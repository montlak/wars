<section>
<h3 class="h3" id="sec3-224"><span class="space">N.</span> MOOTNESS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Cases involving mootness are distinguished from cases discussed above under the heading "<a href="0100-2023-12-052.html#sec3-52">Standing: Failure to State a Claim</a>," in which the employees fail to demonstrate they have suffered some harm that "aggrieves" them. The issue in cases involving mootness is not whether the employees suffered any harm as a result of the agency's actions, but whether subsequent events have reversed the harm initially done. By regulation, 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(5), the Commission now permits agencies to dismiss complaints that are moot. As the Commission explained in its section-by-section analysis:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">One agency suggested that mootness be explicitly added to the regulation. We have adopted that suggestion and included the explicit provision in this subsection. While mootness could also be classified under failure to state a claim, it is added to this subsection to permit it to be raised throughout the complaint process, since mootness can occur throughout the process.</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to the enactment of the regulation, Commission case law held that an agency may dismiss a complaint "rendered moot by particular circumstances in a case." <span class="Italic">Reardon v. USPS</span>, 01830671 (1983). However, the Commission's own decisions showed a great deal of inconsistency over when a complaint should be dismissed as moot. In <span class="Italic">Reardon</span>, the EEOC dismissed the complaint where the employee received all relief to which she was entitled and the relief she requested, discipline of her supervisor, was beyond the EEOC's authority.</p>
<p class="noindent">MD-110, at 5-25 to 5-26, provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A complaint may be dismissed as moot where there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur, and interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation. <span class="Italic">See Wildberger v. Small Business Administration</span>, EEOC Request No. 05960761 (Oct. 8, 1998), (citing <span class="Italic">County of Los Angeles v. Davis</span>, 440 U.S. 625 (1979)). When such circumstances exist, no relief is available, and there is no need for a determination of the rights of the parties. The Commission has also held, however, that where a complainant has made a timely request for compensatory damages, an agency must address the issue of compensatory damages before it can dismiss a complaint for mootness. <span class="Italic">See, for example, Salazar v. Dep't. of Justice,</span> EEOC Request No. 05930316 (Feb. 9, 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Flores v. Department of Army</span>, 01831886 (1983), citing <span class="Italic">County of Los Angeles v. Davis</span>, 440 U.S. 625, 99 S. Ct. 1379, 59 L. Ed.2d 642 (1979), the Commission articulated the following test:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome. As a general <span id="Page_283"></span>rule, voluntary cessation of allegedly illegal conduct does not remove the power to hear and determine a case. However, jurisdiction, properly acquired, may abate if a case becomes moot because (1) it can be said with assurance that there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will reoccur, and (2) interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Flores</span>, the fact that the union and agency negotiated and effected a settlement of the issue in the case rendered it moot.</p>
<p class="noindent">As long as the complainant continues to be subjected to the alleged discriminatory act or policy, it cannot be said that his or her complaint is moot. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Anita J. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120170561 (2017) ("as Complainant alleges that Management applied the Agency's Zero Tolerance Policy in a discriminatory manner, based on her race and sex, and as that policy is still in effect, and the Complainant is still an employee subject to said policy, the complaint is not moot.")</p>
<p class="noindent">A complaint will not be considered moot where the complainant demonstrates that the alleged discriminatory act was repeated in the past. In <span class="Italic">Tomasello v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01951659 (1996), the complainant claimed that the agency had previously improperly disclosed EEO information concerning him and that the agency also promised that such disclosures would not occur again. Under such circumstances, the Commission found that it could not be said with assurance that there was no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. Postmaster General</span>, 01965164 (1997). In <span class="Italic">Hernandez</span>, the Commission found there was no likelihood of recurrence where, on two occasions, the complainant was assigned to work on the Sabbath. On both occasions, the agency promptly rescinded its work order. The Commission also noted that, although the assignments occurred twice, in each instance a different supervisor was involved.</p>
<p class="noindent">Likewise, the eradication of the effects of discrimination must be permanent. A grant of temporary accommodation does not render a complaint moot, particularly where the nature of the required accommodation is likely to change. In such cases, it cannot be said with reasonable certainty that the alleged violation will not recur. In <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01964035 (1997), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record herein, we find that the matter alleged by appellant in his complaint; the agency's failure to accommodate his religious observance of the Sabbath, remains a live issue. While the agency characterized appellant's allegation as being limited to a request for Saturdays off for religious observance, appellant has referred during EEO Counseling and in his formal EEO complaint to the agency's refusal to accommodate his religious observance of the Sabbath. Appellant has also made it consistently clear that he considers such observance to extend from Friday sunset until Saturday sunset. Consequently, the interim relief provided by the agency, a schedule change which permits appellant to have Saturdays off but does not address his need to leave work prior to sunset on Fridays, does not fully address appellant's request for accommodation and therefore does not completely eradicate the effects of the alleged violation. Moreover, as stated by appellant, in view of the fact that winter months will necessitate additional schedule changes to accommodate his Sabbath observance, the alleged violation is clearly likely to reoccur. Thus, appellant's allegation that the agency has failed to accommodate his religious observance of the Sabbath is not a moot issue.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Hoopes v. Postmaster General</span>, 01996883 (2001) (temporary accommodation does not render a complaint moot because of the possibility that a violation will recur).</p>
<p class="noindent">In determining if the effects of any past discrimination have been completely eradicated, the thrust of the inquiry is whether any further relief could be granted to the complainant. "Where an appellant identifies an unresolved personal harm or shows that there remains a potential for such harm, he is aggrieved and therefore states a claim...." <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Postmaster General</span>, 01930089 (1992). An employee remains aggrieved when the agency changes absent without leave status to leave without pay. The employee sought restoration of his sick and annual leave. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In a short decision, the Commission reversed an agency decision dismissing a complaint as moot where the employee alleged that he was discriminatorily denied a shift change to watch his son play high school football. The agency contended the complaint was moot because the employee's son had graduated from high school. The Commission found relief still could be granted because the employee took annual leave in lieu of the shift change. If the employee prevailed, then he would be entitled to restoration of the leave. <span class="Italic">O'Neal v. Attorney General</span>, 01931832 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency's reversal of the underlying personnel action does not moot a complaint where other relief is still possible through the complaint process. In <span class="Italic">Ching v. Department of Navy</span>, 01872873 (1988), the employee was denied a forklift operator's license due to a disabling condition. The employee was later granted both a medical clearance and an operator's license. The Commission rejected the agency's argument that the case was moot, noting that the grant of the license merely would toll the time period for calculating damages. Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Horn v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01965432 (1997), the agency improperly dismissed for mootness the appellant's claim that he was required to undergo training and testing by virtue of the fact that appellant passed the test. The agency's final decision stated that this allegation was rendered moot as a result of the agency's issuance of a memorandum informing the appellant that he passed a special skills certification test. The Commission found that the dismissal was improper because, if discrimination was found, the appellant would be entitled to assurances that he would not again be improperly ordered to undergo training and testing. The Commission also found that the memorandum indicating that the appellant passed a skills certification test was not interim relief or an event that completely and irrevocably eradicated the effect of the alleged violation.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, consistent with its position on the broader definition of injury for purposes of a retaliation claim, in <span class="Italic">Rezac v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120123453 (2013), the Commission found that a reduction of a seven-day suspension to an official discussion through the negotiated grievance process did not moot the underlying EEO complaint based on retaliation. While noting the official discussion was no longer discipline, the Commission found that the official discussion could still deter a reasonable person from filing or pursuing a complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a decision short on rationale, the Commission reversed the agency's dismissal of a claim over two hours of premium pay. In <span class="Italic">Volz v. Attorney General</span>, 01972800 (1997), the agency reasoned that the complainant was not aggrieved because the agency conceded its errors, paid the complainant the two hours in his next pay check and dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. The Commission did not specifically analyze the issue of mootness, but reversed the dismissal holding that the complaint alleged the employee was aggrieved because he did not receive the premium pay in a particular pay period. Apparently, though, the Commission did not believe that including the premium pay in the another pay period served to eradicate the effects of the past alleged discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">An EEO complaint can be rendered moot at any stage of the complaint process. An appeal to the EEOC is rendered moot when the agency voluntarily grants the relief being sought via the appeal. <span class="Italic">Harrison v. USPS</span>, 01831350 (1983) (dismissing appeal of a dismissal of a complaint as untimely when the agency reopened the case for investigation).</p>
<p class="noindent">In the past, an agency could not defeat a complainant's entitlement to attorney fees by voluntarily granting the requested relief and dismissing the complaint as moot. For the purposes of an attorney fees motion, the complainant, in those circumstances, was considered the prevailing party. However, in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon Board &#x0026; Care Home, Inc. v. W. VA. Department of Health and Human Resources</span>, 121 S. Ct. 1835 (2001), the Supreme Court rejected the so-called "catalyst theory" as a basis for determining prevailing party status. See the section on "<a href="0100-2023-11-142.html#sec2-142">Attorney Fees</a>," later in this chapter, and <a href="0100-2023-31-001.html#sec22-1">Chapter 22</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, there is a degree of cooperation required by the complainant in determining whether a complaint is moot. For example, in <span class="Italic">Malloy v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A24228 (2002), the agency agreed to grant the complainant the $81 performance award that his coworkers received. The Commission found the fact that the complainant refused to pick up the award did not preclude the complaint from being rendered moot.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has held that when relief comes "simply because of the passage of time and actions unrelated to [the EEO] complaint...[t]hese events are not equivalent to a rejection of an offer of full relief, and in the absence of such an offer appellant is entitled to a determination on the merits of her claim and an order of appropriate relief if discrimination is found." <span class="Italic">Jones v. USPS</span>, 01870101 (1988). In that case, the agency dismissed the complaint after the disputed letter of warning was removed from the employee's file and the employee was assigned to a new unit. Neither action in <span class="Italic">Jones</span> was in response to the EEO complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The routine removal of the Letter of Warning from appellant's record, because she was not subject to further discipline or because she fell into a certain category of employees, is not the same as expunction of the Letter of Warning pursuant to the EEO complaint process. The distinction between these bases for removal is significant because of the stigma associated with disciplinary action, particularly in appellant's case where the Letter of Warning stated, in essence, that she was incompetent in her profession. (Footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the removal of appellant from the supervision of the cited Manager is not full relief in regard to her allegation that she was not assigned the full range of duties normally associated with her position. Were the limitations on appellant's duties found to be discriminatory, full relief would require assignment of appropriate duties. There is no showing in the record that broader duties have been assigned....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Swenson v. USPS</span>, 01871683 (1988) (letter of warning removed in response to the employee's EEO complaint, thus making it moot).</p>
<p class="noindent">The question of whether a complainant has withdrawn a complaint voluntarily or under duress is not determinative of whether the complaint is moot. <span class="Italic">Cobey v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 05940355 (1994). Withdrawal of the complaint under either circumstance does not guarantee there is no reasonable expectation that the violation will recur.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_284"></span>The fact that the agency can no longer grant the specific relief requested by the complainant does not render a complaint moot. In <span class="Italic">Devereux v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01930675 (1993), the agency dismissed a complaint as moot where the underlying allegation was that the complainant was discriminatorily discouraged from seeking a position at a naval base in the Philippines. Subsequently, the United States determined it would withdraw all military forces from that country. The Commission found the complaint was not moot even though the specific remedy to which the complainant would be entitled if he prevailed--priority consideration for a position at the Philippines naval base--was no longer available. The agency could offer substantially similar relief of priority consideration for another position in a different location.</p>
<p class="noindent">As with most complex areas of the law, the Commission's decisions on mootness have been somewhat inconsistent in the past. Some of the Commission's inconsistency in treating cases involving mootness may come from the fact that there are several ways to characterize a case as moot. For example, in <span class="Italic">Alsop v. Department of Treasury</span>, 01861583 (1986), the agency dismissed a complaint over work assignments after the employee's application for disability retirement was accepted on the basis that the individual was no longer aggrieved within the meaning of Title VII. The Commission found the employee was aggrieved at the time of filing the complaint and was entitled to have the complaint processed. Apparently, the Commission never even considered what relief, if any, still was available to the appellant. But, in <span class="Italic">Nagler v. Secretary of Education</span>, 05900375 (1990), the Commission held that while the complainant was aggrieved by alleged harassment at the time of the filing of her complaint, her retirement made the issue moot since she was no longer subject to the supervision of the alleged offender. Properly viewed, the question under the mootness doctrine is not whether the complainant was ever harmed by the agency's action, because if the complainant was never harmed, the complaint is not moot. Rather, the complaint is moot where it fails to state a claim and, accordingly, should be dismissed. Application of the mootness doctrine presumes the complainant oriGINAlly was harmed by the agency's action. The question is whether the effects of that harm still linger into the present.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency bears the burden of proving that its dismissal of a claim is correct. For example, when an agency contends that a grievance settlement rendered an EEO complaint moot it must produce a copy of the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Josue v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A14576 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the mootness doctrine appears, at first blush, reasonably clear and succinct, the problem lies in applying the doctrine to the many personnel actions and terms and conditions of employment that come within the ambit of the anti-discrimination laws. Other than the general definition of mootness set forth above, the doctrine is probably best explained by exploring its application to various scenarios that recur in EEO complaints.</p>
