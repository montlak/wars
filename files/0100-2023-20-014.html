<h3 class="h3" id="sec11-13a"><span class="space">IV.</span> UNCONSCIOUS/IMPLICIT BIAS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Merriam Webster defines unconscious bias as "a bias or prejudice that is present but not consciously held or recognized." Though "unconscious bias," as a term, was coined years ago, the concept began to take root only in the last few years in the employment law arena. In particular, the Commission recently took up this concept as it relates to disparate impact claims in two cases: <span class="Italic">Gwendolyn G. v. Secretary of State</span>, 2019005389 (2020) and <span class="Italic">Jacinta B. v. Secretary of State</span>, 2020000559 (2021).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Gwendolyn G</span>. involved a female foreign service officer who believed that the agency subjected her to discrimination when she was not selected for a promotion. The basis of her contention was that the agency's use of candidate's names and other gender-identifying pronouns led to "unconscious discrimination against female candidates due to implicit bias." The Commission found that the complainant failed to establish the statistical disparities necessary to establish disparate impact:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In general, to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact, a complainant must show that an agency practice or policy, while neutral on its face, disproportionately impacted members of the protected class through presentation of statistical evidence that demonstrates a statistical disparity that is linked to the challenged practice or policy. <span class="Italic">Watson v. Fort Worth Bank and Trust</span>, 487 U.S. 977, 994 (1988) (the complainant must present statistical evidence of a kind and degree sufficient to show that the practice in question has caused the exclusion). Specifically, the complainant must: (1) identify the specific policy or practice challenged; (2) show statistical disparities; and (3) show that the disparity is linked to the challenged practice or policy. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The burden is on the complainant to show that the facially neutral standard in question affects those individuals within the protected group in a significantly discriminatory pattern. <span class="Italic">Dothard v. Rawlinson</span>, 433 U.S. 321, 329 (1977); <span class="Italic">see also Kimble v. Department of Commerce</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950838 (June 20, 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that Complainant failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact. We agree. We first note that Complainant has identified the Agency policy of using employees' names and gender-identifying pronouns in their personnel records, which, Complainant maintains, leads to unconscious discrimination against female candidates due to implicit bias. Complainant has submitted voluminous scholarly articles attesting to the existence of implicit bias and showing that removing gender-identifying information from a candidate's record results in female candidates being evaluated more highly than would otherwise be the case with the gender-identifying information present. We therefore find Complainant has satisfied step one of the <span class="Italic">Watson</span> three-step test. We further find, however, that she has not satisfied step two. Complainant has submitted statistical evidence showing that 265 Foreign Service generalists were promoted from FS-03 to FS-02 in 2016, and that 56.6% of them had names that were "clearly identifiably male," while only 31.8% had names that were "clearly identifiably female." Complainant <span id="Page_788"></span>further identifies an additional 11.6% of candidates who had names that were neither clearly identifiably male or female. Complainant argues that "even if all the ‘unclear' names were female, which is unlikely, there would still have been significantly more men promoted than women."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note, however, that Complainant has not shown the gender makeup of all FS-03 Foreign Service generalists, including those who were not promoted. If 56.5% of the 265 FS-03 Foreign Service generalists promoted to FS-02 had clearly identifiable male-sounding names, while 31.8% had female-sounding names, that means at least 150 of those promoted were presumably males and from 84 to 116 (assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that all unclear names were in fact females) were presumably females. However, such a difference in the numbers of males and females being promoted is not indicative of sex discrimination unless one knows the gender make-up of the total pool of FS-03 Foreign Service generalists from which the 265 were promoted. If, hypothetically the total pool consisted of 1,000 males and just 84 (or 116) females, that would mean 100% of the females were promoted while only 15% of the males were promoted, which is hardly indicative of sex discrimination against women. Because Complainant has not provided the gender makeup of the pool of all FS-03 Foreign Service generalists at the time of the 2016 promotion, there is no statistical significance to the percentage of males promoted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The same problem arises with Complainant's statistical evidence showing that male FSOs are promoted with less time in grade than female FSOs. Complainant argues that with regard to Foreign Service generalists promoted to FS-02 in their second year of eligibility, 52% had clearly identifiable male names, 34% had clearly identifiable female names, and 15% had names that were not clearly gendered. With regard to generalists promoted to FS-02 in their first year of eligibility, 55% were clearly identifiably male, 31% were clearly identifiably female, and 14% were not clearly gendered. Complainant argues that this evidence shows that male FSOs are promoted more quickly than female FSOs. However, since Complainant has not provided the gender makeup of the oriGINAl pool of FSOs, there is no statistical significance to the percentage of males versus females promoted in their first or second year of eligibility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that the Agency provided its own statistics showing that, within Complainant's "cone" of Public Diplomacy, out of 185 FSOs, 60 were recommended for promotion in 2016, of which 37 were female and just 23 were male. This evidence shows that, within Complainant's cone, female candidates comprised just over 60% of all those promoted. Such evidence does not support Complainant's argument that implicit bias harmed women's chances, and specifically, Complainant's chances, of being promoted. Complainant, in response states:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The administrative judge alleges that because 37 of 60 promotees in one cone were women, there was no issue and no discrimination. Those numbers on their own are meaningless and irrelevant. What if 38, or 39, or 57 or 102 of the women who were considered were qualified but not selected as such because of the discrimination in question? And what if the group considered was 85% women; a 60% success rate would be cause for concern.... [The evidence] fails to take into account the ratio of genders considered for promotion;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the same argument applies to Complainant's statistical evidence about the ratio of male and female FSOs promoted across all cones, and the differences in how quickly males are promoted versus females, namely, that without knowing the ratio of genders considered for promotion, a higher number of one gender being promoted is, in itself, not probative of gender discrimination. We further note, however, that pursuant to <span class="Italic">Watson</span>, the burden of proof is on Complainant to provide statistical evidence of a kind and degree sufficient to show discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because Complainant's evidence "fails to take into account the ratio of genders considered for promotion" her evidence is no less "meaningless and irrelevant" than the Agency's evidence about the gender makeup of the promoted candidates from Complainant's cone. As such, we agree with the AJ that Complainant has failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that Complainant has failed to raise an issue of material fact. Complainant on appeal argues that, as the party opposing summary judgment, her evidence should be seen in the most favorable light. This does not mean, however, that unreasonable or unsupported inferences should be drawn from such evidence. While we readily accept Complainant's evidence showing that more FSOs with male-sounding names were promoted than FSOs with female-sounding names, that does not therefore raise a material issue since, as Complainant herself noted, such evidence, absent evidence showing the gender makeup of the entire pool of FSOs, is "meaningless and irrelevant." We next find that Complainant's bare assertion that her qualifications were superior to those of, at a minimum, at least one of the males promoted is insufficient to raise a material issue of fact. We note that a party opposing summary judgment may not rest upon mere allegations in the pleadings or upon conclusory statements in affidavits; rather, she must go beyond the pleadings and support her contentions with documentary evidence. <span class="Italic">Celotex</span>, 477 U.S. at 324. Here, while Complainant averred that she personally knows of "several" male colleagues who were undeservedly promoted ahead of her based on what she knows of their work, Complainant has not provided any witness testimony or other evidence to support her assertion that her personnel file was more impressive than those of at least one other promoted male. With regard to Complainant's other claimed issues of material fact, we find that they are not material because they do not address either Complainant's admission regarding disparate treatment that she does not believe the board members intentionally discriminated against her, or the fact that Complainant's statistical evidence showing a disparity is invalid.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant in <span class="Italic">Gwendolyn G</span>. also alleged disparate treatment by advancing the same unconscious bias argument. The Commission rejected that argument too and noted that it was, in essence, a disparate impact claim. To this author, at least, that makes a lot sense. Disparate treatment is intentional discrimination. If a person is unaware of their discriminatory <span class="Italic">animus</span>, then by definition it can hardly be said that the actions arising from that <span class="Italic">animus</span> was deliberate.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Jacinta B. v. Secretary of State</span>, 2020000559 (2021), involved a foreign service officer alleged discrimination based on her race (Middle Eastern), national origin (Iranian, naturalized citizen) and religion (Muslim) when she was not promoted. The final agency decision found that the complainant failed to prove discrimination. Before the Commission, the complainant in <span class="Italic">Jacinta B. </span>alleged:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant contends that, at the time of her 2018 non-selection, "unconscious bias" was a known obstacle to achieving awards and promotions within the Agency's selection process. She states that at least two affinity groups, Executive Women at State and Balancing Act, had been trying to raise the issue of unconscious bias with respect to the scoring process. The Union surveyed employees in 2017 and identified strong support for removing names from EERs (reviews). Regarding this survey, Complainant states that "individuals like me, with different ethnically identifiable names, almost unanimously found fault with the Agency's practice of including names in the EERs."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to Complainant, the Board reviewing her file in 2018 was not assessed for and lacked proper training in unconscious bias. As evidence that such training was not provided in 2018, she offers the Agency's December 6, 2019 Memorandum entitled "Fostering a Culture of Inclusion--The Way Ahead," which among other things, stated how in 2019, the Agency "finalized a presentation accessible to all employees, on mitigating unconscious bias in...performance evaluations; and promotions and awards processes." The Memorandum also stated that in 2019, the Agency released a webinar "about mitigating unconscious bias in FS performance evaluations." Complainant also provides separate Agency memoranda describing plans to develop "training on mitigating unconscious bias" and a pilot program for gender-neutral Meritorious Service Increase ("MSI").</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Jacinta B</span>. clarified that the theory of complainant's case was disparate impact, not disparate treatment and analyzed the case from that perspective:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Significantly, Complainant argues that the Agency, in both investigating and deciding her case, disregarded her allegations of "unconscious bias," instead applying a disparate treatment analysis to her allegations. It is clear from the record that Complainant was attempting to raise a disparate impact claim, as she repeatedly clarified in her affidavit that she did not believe the Panel intentionally discriminated against her, instead, describing herself as the victim of unconscious bias as a result of the Agency practice of promotion boards knowing the names of the candidates they were reviewing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant challenges the Agency's policy of allowing reviewers for FS promotions to see the employees' first and last names, arguing that a candidate's name could trigger implicit bias by the reviewer. As evidence of bias against individuals of Middle Eastern dissent, Complainant cites FBI data revealing a 67% increase in hate-based incidents against Muslim Americans in 2015, the highest since the aftermath of September 11, 2001. She also cites the Muslim Public Affairs Council, which, based on media tracking, found an exponential increase in hate-based attacks. She recalls the "Muslim Ban," where the President called first for a "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States," later modified to "extreme vetting" of Muslim immigrants. Moreover, Complainant argues that even if all of the panelists did not realize her name was of Middle Eastern origin specifically, "it is impossible for someone not to know that I am from a specific minority group...and that I am likely from the Middle East with a high probability that I am Muslim."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant further argues that the 2018 selection process specifically gave rise to implicit bias. She asserts the reviewers were not screened for or trained on implicit bias at the time, yet they were required to make subjective judgments using incomplete or ambiguous data. She further argues that reviewers were working under the "intense pressure" <span id="Page_789"></span>to process a high volume of data within time constraints, increasing the likelihood that the reviewers experienced fatigue, thus increasing the potential for unconscious or implicit bias. Complainant cites the January 2019 New York Law Review, which supports for her contention that implicit bias can flourish in scenarios "that involve ambiguous or incomplete information, the presence of time constraints, and circumstances which may compromise cognitive control such as fatigue."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact, Complainant must show that an agency practice or policy, while neutral on its face, disproportionately impacted members of the protected class. <span class="Italic">Huber v. Dep't of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120070399 (July 9, 2009). This is demonstrated through the presentation of statistical evidence that establishes a statistical disparity that is linked to the challenged practice or policy. <span class="Italic">Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &#x0026; Trust</span>, 487 U.S. 977, 994 (1988) (Complainant must present "statistical evidence of a kind and degree sufficient to show that the practice in question has caused the exclusion"). Specifically, Complainant must: (1) identify the specific practice or practices challenged; (2) show statistical disparities; and (3) show that the disparity is linked to the challenged practice or policy. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The burden is on Complainant to show that "the facially neutral standard in question affects those individuals [within the protected group] in a significantly discriminatory pattern." <span class="Italic">Dothard v., Rawlinson</span>, 433 U.S. 321, 329 (1977); <span class="Italic">see also, Gaines v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03990119 (Aug. 31, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If Complainant establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact, the burden shifts to the Agency to provide a business justification for the challenged action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing Section 105 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071 (Nov. 21, 1991)). Pursuant to the Civil Rights Act of 1991, once a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is established, the Agency has the burden of proving that the challenged practice is job-related and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If the Agency satisfies this burden, Complainant may nevertheless prevail if she identifies an alternative employment practice that would accomplish the same goal with a less adverse impact on her protected class. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., <span class="Italic">see also, e.g</span>. <span class="Italic">Mells v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A20763 (Sept. 14, 2004).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that simply claiming that Agency officials' use of subjective criteria causes a disparate impact, without more specificity, does not meet a complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> burden. <span class="Italic">Israel J. v. Dep't of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. Appeal No. 0120160324 (Mar. 22, 2018) (complainant, alleging that the selection process "coupled with the prevalence of discriminatory attitudes" disparately impacts black males; failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact because he did not "sufficiently identify the particular aspect(s) of the Agency's selection process allegedly responsible for any observed statistical disparity as required in the first and third steps of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact. Furthermore, the gross statistics offered by Complainant are too broad to draw appropriate statistical conclusions that there was a relevant statistical disparity in this case."). <span class="Italic">See also Aurore C. v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0220180006 (Nov. 5, 2019) (grievant alleging that the agency's selection process for GS-15 level attorneys had a disparate impact on women applicants, failed to meet her burden to show a significantly discriminatory pattern; statistics based on only two competitive selections in eight years fell short of the evidentiary burden necessary to establish that the selection process has a discriminatory impact on candidates based on protected class); and <span class="Italic">Torres v. Dep't of the Treas</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A51913 (Jun. 14, 2005) (the complainant alleging that more African Americans were selected for EEO positions than Hispanics, failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case for disparate impact because the statistical evidence in the record failed to provide a "quantitative analysis which clearly establishes the alleged disparity").</p>
<p class="noindent">Citing to <span class="Italic">Gwendolyn G</span>. and finding the statistical evidence lacking, the Commission remanded the case for further processing:</p> 
<p class="noindent-1">The instant case is very similar to the complaint raised in <span class="Italic">Gwendolyn G. v. Dep't of State</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 2019005389 (Aug. 31, 2020). There, an FSO, with a traditionally feminine first name, alleged discrimination based on sex when she was not among those selected for promotion from FS-03 to FS-02. Specifically, she alleged that the Agency's specific practice of allowing panel members to review employee files that contained gender-specifying information triggered implicit bias, causing them to unintentionally score her folder more harshly than they would a folder belonging to someone with a masculine sounding name. In addition to identifying a "specific practice" the complainant met prong (1) by providing supporting evidence in the form of "voluminous scholarly articles attesting to the existence of implicit bias and showing that removing gender-identifying information from a candidate's record results in female candidates being evaluated more highly than would otherwise be the case."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Commission found that the complainant in <span class="Italic">Gwendolyn G</span>., did not meet the second and third prongs of her disparate impact claim. The decision found the complainant provided statistical evidence showing that of the FS generalists promoted from FS-03 to FS-02 during the year in question, there were more individuals with "clearly identifiably male" names promoted than the combined amount of individuals with "clearly identifiably female" names and individuals whose names were not clearly gendered. However, we determined "there is no statistical significance to the percentage of males promoted" because the complainant failed to provide "the gender makeup of all FS-03 Foreign Service generalists, including those who were not promoted." Without the statistical evidence, the complainant was unable to link the specified practice with a disparity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Commission noted a significant dearth of evidence presented by the complainant in <span class="Italic">Gwendolyn G</span>. to show that she was personally impacted by the identified policy, stating:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While Complainant may not have access to the personnel files of her colleagues, we note that she has not provided affidavits or any other evidence showing that colleagues were aware of at least one male FSO who was promoted and whose achievements were less impressive than those of Complainant. Instead, Complainant merely surmises that her own file was so impressive that the likelihood of her achievements being less impressive than that at least one promoted male FSO is so unlikely as to satisfy her level of proof.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, as a result of the Agency's investigation's sole focus on disparate treatment, the record is not sufficiently developed to determine whether Complainant can establish even a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact. We have presented some of the details of our prior analysis in <span class="Italic">Gwendolyn G</span>. to provide Complainant and the Agency with guidance in determining the sort of evidence necessary to determine a disparate impact case of this sort. We are vacating the Agency's final decision and remanding this matter to the Agency for further investigation relevant to the disparate impact claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Jacinta B</span>. ordered the agency to include in the ROI "the necessary statistical data to allow a decisionmaker to determine whether Complainant can establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact analysis discussed above with respect to individuals with Middle Eastern names, as well as individuals with names that could be mistakenly identified as Middle Eastern. Evidence shall also be gathered with regard to the Agency's justification for the challenged practice."</p>
