<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-104"><span class="space">a.</span> Void</h5>
<p class="noindent">A settlement agreement that contains an "illusory promise" is void. A complainant must obtain something of value as consideration for his waiver of complaint rights. A settlement agreement also can be declared void based on a mutual mistake of material fact or law. Such a mistake occurs when both parties rely, in reaching agreement, on a material fact that is not true. Both doctrines were discussed by the Commission in <span class="Italic">O'Brien v. Postmaster General</span>, 05920560 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that the December 16, 1991 settlement agreement is not an enforceable agreement for two reasons. First, appellant agreed to withdraw his June 19, 1991 formal EEO complaint and waive his rights to a hearing and further appeal of his complaint in exchange for the agency's promise that the Postmaster would meet with appellant "to discuss the possibility of appellant's being reinstated as a full-time postal worker in any available position." Although the terms of the agreement do not promise appellant a job, the terms do indicate that appellant would have an opportunity to discuss reinstatement in "any available position." Thus, the terms of the agreement expressly indicate that what appellant had bargained for was the opportunity to discuss available positions. Yet, only one week later, the Postmaster informed appellant at the "private" meeting that the Boston Post Office was not hiring. There is no evidence in the record that indicates that there were any "available positions" at the time the agency proposed, drafted and executed the settlement agreement. We conclude that the agency's promise that the Postmaster would meet with appellant "to discuss the possibility of appellant's being reinstated as a full-time postal worker in any available position" was illusory. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> <span class="Italic">Archie R. Ingram v. General Services Administration</span>, EEOC Request No. 05880565 (June 14, 1988) (settlement agreement unenforceable where agency imposed a hiring freeze only two months after agreeing to give appellant priority consideration in selections for a twelve-month period). Accordingly, we find that the appellant in the instant case received no consideration for his promise to withdraw his June 19, 1991 formal EEO complaint. Lacking consideration, the agreement is unenforceable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Michael Collins v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900082 (April 26, 1990). Furthermore, informing appellant that the agency was planning to take six to eight months, or even longer, to process his complaint, and then offering appellant a way to short-cut the unduly long process, did not constitute bargaining in good faith.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second reason that the December 16, 1991 settlement agreement is not an enforceable agreement is because it was based on a mutual mistake of a material fact. Both parties entered into the agreement based on an assumption that the Postmaster would issue the final agency decision on appellant's June 19, 1991 formal EEO complaint. The EEO Manager told appellant that he would have no problem setting up an appointment with the Postmaster that would save appellant the six or eight months it would otherwise take to get a decision on his complaint from the Postmaster. Appellant accepted the proposed settlement on that basis. Yet the record clearly indicates that the Postmaster could not render a decision on appellant's complaint because the complaint alleged, in part, that the Postmaster's letters of March 21, 1991 and April 26, 1991 to appellant were discriminatory. Because the Postmaster's own actions were at issue in appellant's complaint, he was not in a position to render a fair, impartial, and objective final agency decision on appellant's complaint as required by 29 CFR 1613.221(a).</p>
<p class="noindent">A mutual mistake of fact is often referred to as a failure to have a "meeting of the minds." A "meeting of the minds" is required to form a contract; that is, both parties must have the same understanding of their respective promises. In <span class="Italic">Mitchem-Baker v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A12025 (2001), the Commission found the settlement agreement was void because the agency and complainant had different understandings of what was required:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A binding settlement agreement requires a contemporaneous meeting of the minds<span class="Italic">. Brown v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Request No. 05940628 (November 3, 1994). The Commission finds that there was no meeting of the minds when the present settlement agreement was entered into by the parties. The record indicates that the agency believed when it entered into the settlement, that it would remove the October 29, 1997 LOW from complainant's personnel file. The record further indicates that complainant believed, when she entered into the agreement, that the agency would remove both the October 29, 1997 LOW and the April 20, 1999 LOW. The settlement agreement does not clarify which letter of warning was actually to be removed from complainant's personnel file. The Commission finds that when the parties entered into the settlement agreement, they both attached different meanings to "letter of warning." Because there was no meeting of the minds of the parties when the agreement was entered into, we find that the present settlement agreement is not a binding settlement and is void. The Commission sets <span id="Page_416"></span>aside the settlement agreement and remands the matter so that the agency may reinstate the settled matter from the point processing ceased.</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Crews v. Central Intelligence Agency</span>, 01940001 (1993). In that case, the agency agreed to permit the complainant an opportunity to compete for a position conditioned on her successful completion of certain training courses. Although the courses were specified in the agreement, there was no indication of the prerequisites for those courses. The first course was a self-instruction math course, which required a basic knowledge of algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, and physics, none of which was possessed by the complainant. The Commission set aside the agreement based on mutual mistake of fact because the agency believed the complainant was aware of the course requirements and the Commission found it was reasonable for the complainant not to have been aware of those requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agreement is void when there is a mutual mistake of fact or law that renders the terms of the agreement unenforceable. In such circumstances, even though the agency has not technically complied with the terms of the agreement, the complainant may not seek specific enforcement. In <span class="Italic">Grant v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01931896 (1993), the Commission held the only remedy in those situations is reinstatement of the complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the general principles of contract law, a party may avoid an otherwise valid contract because of a mistake. One who attacks a settlement agreement bears the burden of showing fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Asberry v. United States Postal Service</span>, 692 F.2d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1982). The party attempting to avoid the contract must prove that: (1) the mistake related to a basic assumption upon which the contract was made; (2) the mistake had a material effect upon the agreement; and (3) the mistaken parties did not assume or legally bear the risk as to the mistaken fact. Restatement (Second) of Contracts 152; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Skyline Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 613 F.2d 1328 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that both parties voluntarily entered into the agreement based on an assumption that appellant's retirement would be effective December 29, 1990. This provision was material to the agreement because it was intended to result in appellant receiving no less than a $150.00 per month increase in the annuity he currently receives. However, appellant did not receive this increase due to the following events.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that following the agency's submission of the necessary paperwork to effectuate the agreement, OPM informed the agency that it was unable to proceed with implementation of the agreement as written, due to a November 1990 change in the law which affected the ability of employees to elect an alternative form of annuity. OPM explained that because of this change in the law, implementation of the agreement as written would result in appellant receiving retirement pay during a period when he would not have been eligible to receive it, with the result that appellant would owe OPM approximately $40,000.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thereafter, because the result anticipated by OPM was not the result intended by either of the parties, the parties attempted unsuccessfully to resolve the matter by either implementing the agreement as written or amending the agreement. For example, the agency proposed amending the settlement agreement to change appellant's retirement date to December 29, 1989. In the alternative, the agency proposed that the agreement should be enforced as written, with appellant incurring a debt to OPM with no right to backpay or attorney's fees. In contrast, appellant proposed that the agency provide a retroactive minimum increase of $150.00 per month to appellant's retirement annuity effective as of December 29, 1990, and the agency, rather than appellant, should incur any detrimental effects as a result of this arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that both parties acted under a mutual mistake as to the lawfulness of the retirement date provision, which was a material provision of the agreement. Therefore, although the agency failed to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement, we find that the settlement agreement is not an enforceable agreement because it was based on a mutual mistake of a material fact. EEOC Regulation 29 CFR 1613.217(b) provides that if the Commission finds noncompliance that is not attributable to acts or conduct of the complainant, it may order either compliance with the settlement agreement or reinstatement of the complaint at the point processing ceased under the terms of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we order reinstatement of the complaint at the point that processing ceased under the terms of the settlement agreement....</p>
<p class="noindent">If both parties to a settlement agreement have a misunderstanding of the applicable law, this can render the agreement void. For example, in <span class="Italic">Fowble v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A60527 (2006), the parties entered into a settlement agreement regarding the use of sick leave for dependent care. The agreement was premised, however, on the complainant producing medical documentation "to show that his daughter was temporarily disabled, as defined under the Rehabilitation Act,..." The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Fowble</span>, held the agreement was void, finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, after applying the plain meaning rule, the Commission finds that the settlement agreement should be set aside on the grounds that it is void as a matter of law. Based on our review of this matter in its totality, we find that the agreement is unenforceable, because the parties operated under the erroneous assumption that the Rehabilitation Act offered guidelines for defining "temporary" disabilities. Because of this mutual mistake by the parties, a mistake that we find was material, the parties formed an agreement for which compliance, on complainant's part, was impossible. The Commission therefore determines that the settlement agreement is void.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Mason v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 0120064015 (2006), <span class="Italic">recon. denied</span> 0520070215 (2007) (crediting complainant with retroactive sick and annual leave would have required returning severance pay, which neither party contemplated).</p>
<p class="noindent">A settlement agreement following a nonselection, which places the complainant into a position with the agency, does not necessarily contemplate the same position for which the complainant was not selected. <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01956150 (1996). In that case, each party was mistaken as to what the other meant by "the position of Chief, Medical Media Production Service, GS-12." To the complainant, this meant that he would be placed in a permanent GS-12 position. To the agency, however, this meant that complainant would be placed in the temporary GS-12 position for which he had applied and been nonselected. Although the agency argued that complainant should have specified that he expected a permanent position, the Commission held that it was equally incumbent on the agency to specify adequately what position complainant would be offered. The Commission voided the agreement on the basis that there was a mutual mistake of fact.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission found that there was no meeting of the minds in the settlement agreement in <span class="Italic">St. George v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A10001 (2001), where the agreement provided the complainant would be "made whole," but the parties had different interpretations of what the provision meant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a review of the record, the Commission finds that there was no meeting of the minds when the instant settlement agreement was entered into by the parties. The record indicates that when the agency entered into the settlement agreement, it believed that complainant would be "made whole" by reinstating her back to her letter carrier position, including her probationary period. The record also indicates that when complainant entered into the settlement agreement, she believed that she would be "made whole" by, in addition to the reinstatement of her job, receiving her lost wages, sick time, retirement time, vacation time, and all insurances which lapsed. The Commission finds that when the parties entered into the settlement agreement, they understood the phrase "made whole" to have significantly different meanings. Since there was no meeting of the minds of the parties when the settlement agreement was entered into, the Commission finds that the June 21, 2000 settlement agreement is not a binding settlement agreement and is void.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where a settlement agreement resolves more than one complaint, a mutual mistake of fact may not serve to void the entire settlement agreement. For example, in <span class="Italic">Terracina v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 05910888 (1992), the complainant settled a promotion complaint and a reprisal complaint that had been filed under the ADEA. As consideration for the first complaint, the employee received a promotion. As consideration for the reprisal complaint, the agency agreed to pay attorney fees even though the ADEA does not provide for attorney fees in the administrative process. In <span class="Italic">Terracina</span>, the Commission found that an award of attorney fees under the ADEA was not permissible and the agency could not agree to confer a benefit on the complainant through agreement relief which the Commission could not award through decision. Because the complainant had received no other consideration for withdrawal of the reprisal complaint, the Commission reinstated that complaint. It did, however, allow the part of the settlement agreement addressing the promotion complaint to stand.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where a mutual mistake of fact renders a provision of an agreement invalid, the complainant can only choose reinstatement of the complaint as a remedy if she returns the agency to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. For example, in <span class="Italic">Ruleman v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0520080279 (2008), one of the provisions of the agreement called for the agency to change the complainant's position title from secretary to program support assistant. Subsequent to entering the agreement, the parties discovered that such a change was prohibited by OPM regulations. The Commission found the complainant had the option of accepting the agreement without the offending provision or reinstating her complaint after returning other benefits she obtained under the agreement to the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the parties are mutually mistaken about what they can do in a settlement agreement, the agreement is invalid. <span class="Italic">Komiskey v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01955696 (1996). In that case, when they entered into the agreement both parties appeared to believe that the agency would be able to provide the appellant with a discontinued service retirement and a clean record, despite OPM regulations to the contrary. This shared belief was incorrect. Therefore, the Commission found that the settlement agreement was invalid based on mutual mistake.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_417"></span>Similarly, the Commission voided a settlement agreement where the only consideration to the complainant was that the agency would take appropriate actions to issue a visa to another individual. In <span class="Italic">Nichols v. Secretary of State</span>, 01972930 (1998), the Commission found the agency could not legally grant the visa under the settlement agreement and, as a result, there was no consideration.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Luongo v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A24090 (2003), the Commission found there was no meeting of the minds where the settlement agreement provided the complainant would be returned to work after a medical examination, but could continue to pursue back pay issues. The Commission held that the agreement, on its face, raised an issue that it did not resolve and that the issue of back pay was specifically related to the complainant's claim that he was not properly restored to duty after a work-related injury. As a result, there was no meeting of the minds and the agreement was void.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where money is exchanged, a <span class="Italic">de minimus</span> amount may not be sufficient to sustain an agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alton F. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2109000131 (2018) ("While we recognize that Complainant received $70 under the agreement, under the circumstances presented here, we do not find that this <span class="Italic">de minimus</span> payment is sufficient to sustain the agreement and we will not order its return by Complainant.")</p>
