<h4 class="h4" id="sec18-45"><span class="space">13.</span> Tests and Assessments</h4>
<p class="noindent">Tests are routinely used to assess the competencies of a candidate and to make selection decisions. Cognitive tests, physical examinations, leadership aptitude assessments, and personality and mental health evaluations are a few examples. Employing such tests can help to identify qualified candidates. However, they can also be used to discriminate against an individual or serve to disproportionately exclude individuals based on protected statuses. The Commission's guidance entitled <span class="Italic">Employment Tests and Selection Procedures</span>, EEOC-NVTA-2007-2 (2007) notes:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII prohibits both "disparate treatment" and "disparate impact" discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Title VII prohibits intentional discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. For example, Title VII forbids a covered employer from testing the reading ability of African American applicants or employees but not testing the reading ability of their white counterparts. This is called "disparate treatment" discrimination. Disparate treatment cases typically involve the following issues:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Were people of a different race, color, religion, sex, or national origin treated differently?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Is there any evidence of bias, such as discriminatory statements?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">What is the employer's reason for the difference in treatment?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Does the evidence show that the employer's reason for the difference in treatment is untrue, and that the real reason for the different treatment is race, color, religion, sex, or national origin?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII also prohibits employers from using neutral tests or selection procedures that have the effect of disproportionately excluding persons based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, where the tests or selection procedures are not "job-related and consistent with business necessity." This is called "disparate impact" discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Disparate impact cases typically involve the following issues:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Does the employer use a particular employment practice that has a disparate impact on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin? For example, if an employer requires that all applicants pass a physical agility test, does the test disproportionately screen out women? Determining whether a test or other selection procedure has a disparate impact on a particular group ordinarily requires a statistical analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If the selection procedure has a disparate impact based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, can the employer show that the selection procedure is job-related and consistent with business necessity? An employer can meet this standard by showing that it is necessary to the safe and efficient performance of the job. The challenged policy or practice should therefore be associated with the skills needed to perform the job successfully. In contrast to a general measurement of applicants' or employees' skills, the challenged policy or practice must evaluate an individual's skills as related to the particular job in question.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If the employer shows that the selection procedure is job-related and consistent with business necessity, can the person challenging the selection procedure demonstrate that there is a less discriminatory alternative available? For example, is another test available that would be equally effective in predicting job performance but would not disproportionately exclude the protected group?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title I of the ADA prohibits private employers and state and local governments from discriminating against qualified individuals with disabilities on the basis of their disabilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ADA specifies when an employer may require an applicant or employee to undergo a medical examination, i.e., a procedure or test that seeks information about an individual's physical or mental impairments or health. The ADA also specifies when an employer may make "disability-related inquiries," i.e., inquiries that are likely to elicit information about a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">When hiring, an employer may not ask questions about disability or require medical examinations until after it makes a conditional job offer to the applicant. 42 U.S.C. 12112 (d)(2);</p>
<p class="noindent-2">After making a job offer (but before the person starts working), an employer may ask disability-related questions and conduct medical examinations as long as it does so for all individuals entering the same job category. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 12112(d)(3); and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">With respect to employees, an employer may ask questions about disability or require medical examinations only if doing so is job-related and consistent with business necessity. Thus, for example, an employer could request medical information when it has a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that a particular employee will be unable to perform essential job functions or will pose a direct threat because of a medical condition, or when an employer receives a request for a reasonable accommodation and the person's disability and/or need for accommodation is not obvious. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 12112(d)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ADA also makes it unlawful to:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Use employment tests that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities unless the test, as used by the employer, is shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity. 42 U.S.C. 12112(b)(6);</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Fail to select and administer employment tests in the most effective manner to ensure that test results accurately reflect the skills, aptitude or whatever other factor that such test purports to measure, rather than reflecting an applicant's or employee's impairment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 12112(b)(7); and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Fail to make reasonable accommodations, including in the administration of tests, to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such accommodation would impose an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 12112(b)(5).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">The ADEA prohibits discrimination based on age (40 and over) with respect to any term, condition, or privilege of employment. Under the ADEA, covered employers may not select individuals for hiring, promotion, or reductions in force in a way that unlawfully discriminates on the basis of age.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The ADEA prohibits disparate treatment discrimination, i.e., <span id="Page_1580"></span>intentional discrimination based on age. For example, the ADEA forbids an employer from giving a physical agility test only to applicants over age 50, based on a belief that they are less physically able to perform a particular job, but not testing younger applicants.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The ADEA also prohibits employers from using neutral tests or selection procedures that have a discriminatory impact on persons based on age (40 or older), unless the challenged employment action is based on a reasonable factor other than age. <span class="Italic">Smith v. City of Jackson</span>, 544 U.S. 228 (2005). Thus, if a test or other selection procedure has a disparate impact based on age, the employer must show that the test or device chosen was a reasonable one.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a test is challenged, the Commission will look to evidence such as "questions posed to the candidates, Complainant's answers to the questions, how the reviewers scored Complainant's answers, [and] the bases for the scores given to Complainant and the other candidates" to determine whether the selection was discriminatory. <span class="Italic">Leon B. v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120182144 (2019). The complainant in <span class="Italic">Leon B</span>. alleged discrimination when the agency terminated his candidacy for a position because he did not reach the cut-off score of an oral assessment. The test assessed "oral communication skills, working with others, resourcefulness, initiative and leadership judgment, composure, cross-cultural experience, information integration and analysis, planning and organizing, objectivity and integrity, motivation, and written communication skills." The agency countered that it posed the same questions and used the same "rating anchors" for all candidates and noted that those who passed the assessment "ranged from all ages [and] races." When pressed for specifics regarding the "rating anchors," the agency could not provide a "clear, individualized explanation" for terminating the complainant's candidacy and was found to have discriminated against the complainant in <span class="Italic">Leon B</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the evidence establishes that Complainant is a member of protected classes, he applied and was qualified for the Diplomatic Security Foreign Service Special Agent position, the Agency terminated his candidacy, and the Agency continued to assess and process other candidates for the position. Further, the HR Specialist stated that candidates who passed the assessment "ranged from all ages [and] races." "All" ages and races would reasonably include candidates who are substantially younger than Complainant as well as candidates whose races/national origins are different from Complainant's. Accordingly, we find that Complainant has established <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> cases of discrimination based on national origin and age.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with the Agency's conclusion that Complainant did not establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination because he did not identify any similarly situated individuals whose candidacies were terminated. Certainly, the HR Specialist's broad statement that the candidates who passed the assessment "range from all ages, races and gender[s]" does not contain the type of detailed information normally produced in an EEO investigation--and does not provide the specific information that the EEO Investigator requested. Nonetheless, as noted above, the reference to "all" races and ages includes candidates who are not in Complainant's protected groups.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once a complainant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the burden then shifts to the agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 253.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court has described this burden as being met "if the [agency's] evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the [complainant]," and has noted that, "[t]o accomplish this, the [agency] must clearly set forth, through the introduction of admissible evidence, the reasons for the [complainant's] rejection." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 254-55. Moreover, the agency must "frame the factual issue with sufficient clarity so that the [complainant] will have a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate pretext. The explanation provided must be legally sufficient to justify a judgment for" the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 255-56. Although the agency's burden of production is not onerous, it must nevertheless provide a specific, clear, and individualized explanation for the treatment accorded a complainant. <span class="Italic">Lorenzo v. Dep't of Def</span>., EEOC Request No. 05950931 (Nov. 6, 1997) (finding race/national origin discrimination where "the agency's articulation consisted of a conclusory statement that [complainant] did not have the required skills without explaining what those skills were so that [complainant] could respond").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the evidence presented by the Agency is not sufficient to provide a clear, individualized explanation for why the Agency terminated Complainant's candidacy after the assessment process. The ASAC and the BEX Examiner stated that Complainant did not achieve a passing score in the assessment process. In her letter to Complainant, the Staff Director stated that his oral assessment score of 67 fell below the cutoff score of 80 and that the oral assessment was designed to evaluate his "performance against the 12 dimensions that measure the knowledge, skills, and abilities" necessary for the position. The HR Specialist stated that the Agency assessed candidates based "on the answers they provide against the 12 dimensions" and used the same "scoring anchors" for all candidates. She did not identify the "scoring anchors." Further, the Agency provided no information about the questions posed to the candidates, Complainant's answers to the questions, how the reviewers scored Complainant's answers, or the bases for the scores given to Complainant and the other candidates. In fact, the BEX Examiner and the HR Specialist expressly refused to provide information about the questions and assessment materials.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency officials' vague, conclusory statements about the assessment process do not explain why the Agency terminated Complainant's candidacy. <span class="Italic">See Fullman v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 1A31036 (Mar. 18, 2004) (agency statement that selectee was "better suited for the position" was "so generalized, conclusory and vaporous as to offer no substantive explanation of the agency's action"). The Agency, which failed to explain why Complainant received a score of 67 in the oral assessment, has failed to meet its burden of production. <span class="Italic">See Garret W. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120173051 (Oct. 30, 2018) (agency did not meet its burden of production where selecting official provided "scant information about the candidate interviews" and his explanation for scoring complainant lower than selectee "consisted mostly of conclusory statements"); <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., EEOC Request No. 0520070124 (Nov. 14, 2011) (agency failed to meet its burden of production where it simply explained the general mechanics of the selection process but failed to provide an individualized explanation for complainant's specific score).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, the Commission finds that the Agency failed to overcome Complainant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> cases of discrimination based on race/national origin and age and that Complainant prevails without having to prove pretext. <span class="Italic">Saynna-Chhe v. Dep't of Housing and Urban Dev</span>., EEOC Request No. 0720090008 (Aug. 6, 2010) (the consequence of an agency's failure to meet its burden of production under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> is that the complainant, having established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, prevails without having to make any demonstration of pretext). Accordingly, we find that Complainant has established that the Agency discriminated against him on the bases of race/national origin and age when it terminated his candidacy for the position of Diplomatic Security Foreign Service Special Agent. Having found that Complainant established discrimination based on national origin and age, we need not determine whether the Agency discriminated against him based on color or disability because such a determination would not change the remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When discrimination is found, an agency must provide a complainant with a remedy that constitutes full, make-whole relief to restore the complainant as nearly as possible to the position she or he would have occupied absent the discrimination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co</span>., 424 U.S. 747, 764 (1976); <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 418-19 (1975). Make-whole relief includes an unconditional offer of placement in the position the complainant would have occupied but for the discrimination. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501(a)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, absent the discrimination, Complainant would have passed the assessment, and his candidacy would have continued. Accordingly, we will order the Agency to change Complainant's oral assessment results to reflect a passing score. In that regard, we will direct the Agency to give Complainant the same score given to the candidate who received the highest oral assessment score under the December 8, 2016, vacancy announcement for a Diplomatic Security Foreign Service Special Agent (SA), FP-2501-06. The Agency shall then process Complainant's candidacy in the same manner that it processed the candidacies of other applicants who received passing scores. As listed by the HR Specialist, the next steps in the process are for Complainant to obtain a top-secret security clearance and a medical clearance, to pass a suitability review, and to take a physical-readiness test. If he meets those requirements, then the Agency should determine the ranking that Complainant would have had on the "register" absent the discrimination. That is, the Agency should determine the ranking based on the new assessment score and the applicable veterans' and language points. The Agency should then place Complainant in the Diplomatic Security Foreign Service Special Agent position, retroactive to the date that the Agency hired the candidate who held the same ranking on the register that Complainant is deemed to have held.</p>
