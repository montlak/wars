<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-108"><span class="space">2.</span> Reassignment Under Part 1614</h4>
<p class="noindent">Although reassignment in the federal government now comes under Part 1630, <a href="0100-2023-24-124.html">see section below</a> on Reassignment under Part 1630, in October 1989 the Commission proposed and then adopted a regulation under Part 1614 requiring agencies to reassign any nonprobationary employee with a disability who became unable to perform the essential functions of his or her position to a vacant position at the same grade and level within the same commuting area, provided the employee was able to perform the essential functions of the vacant position. The agency was further required to provide additional necessary reasonable accommodation in the new position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 54 Fed. Reg. 45,755; 29 CFR 1614.203(g).</p>
<p class="noindent">The regulation placed additional obligations upon agencies. Agencies were no longer able to defend the removal of employees with disabilities on the basis that their condition had worsened to the point where they could no longer perform the essential functions of their positions, without first giving such employees consideration for reassignment. In some respects, the regulation was far more stringent than the Commission's previous case law. It also was far clearer.</p>
<p class="noindent">The regulation was in effect until 2001; it was then superceded by different requirements at 29 CFR Part 1630 and its Appendix. As noted in the introduction to this section, the ADA specifically requires consideration of reassignment as part of an employer's reasonable accommodation efforts and the Commission proposed to amend Part 1614 to reflect that fact. However, the proposed amendment expressed the Commission's view that reassignment is a "last resort" and should be considered only when an employee cannot be reasonably accommodated in his or her current position or all other accommodations would pose an undue hardship on the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the employee fails to engage in an interactive process with the agency in an attempt at accommodation in her present position, she is not entitled to reassignment as an accommodation. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Mazaleski v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 03990039 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">What is apparent from petitioner's responses is that, rather than assist the agency in determining whether she could be accommodated in the Position, she wanted to be reassigned to another position. It is well-settled, however, that reassignment should only be considered as an accommodation after it has been determined that the employee, because of his/her disability, "can no longer perform the essential functions of his/her current position, with or without reasonable accommodation...."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 37. The Commission finds that, because of petitioner's unwillingness to explore whether she could be accommodated in the Position, the interactive process never advanced to the point where the agency was required to consider reassignment as a means of accommodation. Because of petitioner's unwillingness, and because she gave every indication that she did not intend on returning to the Position, the Commission finds that the agency was justified in its decision to remove her. Accordingly, the Commission concurs with the MSPB's finding that petitioner was not discriminated against based on disability when she was removed from the Position.</p>
<p class="noindent">The cases discussed below should be evaluated in light of the Commission's comments on the reassignment provision of Part 1614 and its amendment of Part 1614 to adapt the provisions of Part 1630, with respect to reassignment. The Commission continues to adhere to the view that the determination of whether a person with a disability can perform the essential functions of the "position in question, is not limited to the position occupied by the employee but may include positions to which the employee could have been reassigned, with or without reasonable accommodation." <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Postmaster General</span>, 01922440 (1994) (citing <span class="Italic">Ignacio, supra</span>); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Conover v. Postmaster General</span>, 03960113 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">Cases filed prior to the effective date of the amendment of Part 1614--June 20, 2002--are evaluated by the Commission based on the existing regulations at the time of the alleged discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Phemister v. Postmaster General</span>, 01995996 (2002), the Commission explained this means:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case at hand, it is not clear whether the agency conducted a search to ascertain whether there were any funded vacant full time positions for which complainant was qualified at the same seniority level as his current position. Even assuming, however, that the agency failed to conduct an adequate search for a full time position before offering complainant the part time position, the agency's failure to conduct either any search at all, or a broad enough search, for a new position for complainant does not, by itself, result in a finding of discrimination<span class="Italic">. See Key v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A20001 (August 2, 2002); <span class="Italic">Barnard v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A10002 (August 2, 2002). Rather, the record must be examined for evidence that, had the search been conducted, there would have been an appropriate vacancy available<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complainant has an evidentiary burden in such reassignment cases to establish that it is more likely than not (preponderance of the evidence) that there were vacancies during the relevant time period into which complainant could have been reassigned<span class="Italic">. See Key,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Barnard,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">see</span> also <span class="Italic">Hampton v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01986308 (August 1, 2002). Clearly, complainant can establish this by producing evidence of particular vacancies. However, this is not the only way of meeting complainant's evidentiary burden. In the alternative, complainant need only show that: (1) he or she was qualified to perform a job or jobs which existed at the agency, and (2) that there were trends or patterns of turnover in the relevant jobs so as to make a vacancy likely during the time period<span class="Italic">. See Hampton,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Here, complainant failed to meet this burden.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A02299 (2003); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Postmaster General</span>, 01982814 (2002); <span class="Italic">Durham v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A03516 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Lewis,</span> <span class="Italic">supra,</span> the agency reassigned an employee from a detail to a position in retail sales to a clerk position. Although the agency had the approval of both OWCP and the complainant's doctor, ultimately performance of the clerk duties exacerbated her wrist condition. The Commission found that the agency had not failed to reasonably accommodate the employee in the original reassignment. However, the Commission found the agency had failed to reasonably accommodate the employee by not returning her to the detail once it became apparent that the clerk duties were affecting her condition. The Commission held that, where there continued to be a demand for the work performed by the employee during her detail, the agency had an obligation to return the employee to the retail position while it continued to search for a suitable position in her own craft.</p>
<p class="noindent">Assigning an employee to a new position as an accommodation for a disability is not appropriate if the new position requires her to perform duties outside of her medical restrictions. In <span class="Italic">Udy v. Postmaster General</span>, 01962181 (1996), the complainant was reassigned to a position with a description that fell within her medical restrictions. However, the Commission held that the agency improperly dismissed her failure to accommodate allegation as moot because, despite the position description, the complainant alleged that she was required to perform duties outside of her medical restrictions.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that an agency searched for positions to which an employee can be reassigned does not fulfill its responsibility to a qualified individual with a disability where the search was not specifically undertaken as a reasonable accommodation effort. <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 03970123 (1998). Instead, there must be a "systematic search for vacant positions based on [the employee's] qualifications and her medical restrictions." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1370"></span>In the 1992 version of MD-110, Chapter 5, Attachment A-7, the Commission provided general guidance on analysis of cases under the reassignment provision. The guidance has been removed from the 1999 version of MD-110, perhaps because the Commission was anticipating its proposed changes to the Rehabilitation Act sections of Part 1614.</p>
<p class="noindent">The burden to prove undue hardship in a reasonable accommodation case rests with the agency. In <span class="Italic">McQueen v. Attorney General</span>, 03930006 (1993), the Commission rejected a finding of the MSPB that established a "rebuttable presumption" that reassignment would be an undue hardship. The Commission made it clear that creating such a presumption improperly shifts the burden of proof to the employee. However, in <span class="Italic">McQueen</span>, the Commission agreed with the result reached by the Board in that particular case because the Board improperly expanded the area of consideration for reassignment. Although the Commission later adopted the Board's expansive interpretation of the area of consideration for reassignment, see the section on "<a href="0100-2023-24-129.html#sec15-109">Reassignment Under the ADA</a>," below, its holding in <span class="Italic">McQueen</span> on the burden of proof in a reassignment case remains good law:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear from the record in this case that the parties and the Board do not dispute that reassignment is within the scope of reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03840005 (September 4, 1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, Special Panel No. 1 (February 27, 1986). Petitioner argues in his petition for review that it is the obligation of the agency to consider reassignment, and if such an accommodation is not reasonable, it is always the agency's burden to establish an undue hardship. Thus, petitioner claims that the Board improperly shifted the affirmative obligation of reasonable accommodation to him when it established a "rebuttable presumption" that reassignment outside INS would result in an undue hardship. We agree. As we noted earlier in the case of <span class="Italic">Prewitt v. United States Postal Service</span>, 662 F.2d 292 (5th Cir. 1981), once a person with a disability establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination based upon a disability, it is incumbent upon the agency to accommodate the person or prove that accommodation would result in an undue burden. The shifting of the burdens of proof outlined in <span class="Italic">Prewitt</span> remains virtually unchanged in the Commission's case law and its regulations. We note that the Board cited the Commission's newly revised regulations as support for the creation of a rebuttable presumption. While it is true that 29 CFR 1614.203(g) was revised due to concerns that it would be impractical and extremely difficult to reassign employees from one agency component to another, this provision does not shift the responsibility of reassignment to the employee. It merely limits the scope of reassignment to parts of the agency located within the same commuting area and sharing the same appointing authority. The newly revised regulations still require the agency to present evidence of undue hardship. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.203(c). Moreover, the recently enacted Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) preserves the agency's obligation of reasonable accommodation set forth in the Commission's newly revised regulations and in <span class="Italic">Prewitt</span> and its progeny. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1630.9(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Board attempts to carve out an exception in cases of reassignment outside of a particular installation or facility, we find that it was improper and also impractical to require petitioner to rebut the presumption of undue hardship. In this regard, we agree with petitioner that, it is well nigh impossible for him to identify vacant positions within other components of the agency for which he is qualified. Accordingly, the Commission finds that the Board erred in establishing a presumption of undue hardship, and requiring petitioner to rebut this presumption.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board finds that because "agency" refers to the Department of Justice, the reassignment effort must encompass all vacant positions within the Department of Justice. The Board notes in its decision that each component part of an agency has "...a mission that is separate and independent...a separate and independent appointing authority, a separate and independent full-time equivalency allocation." Nonetheless, the Board finds that consideration of reassignment to four component parts within the Department of Justice is warranted in this case. The Commission finds that the Board erred in expanding the scope of reassignment in this case to components of the agency outside INS. The Commission has long held that although the agency is required to consider reassigning petitioner to another position as a means of providing reasonable accommodation, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, we have also held that this requirement does not include considering every possible reassignment, finding petitioner an ideal job, or initiating an ongoing search beyond a specific facility or installation. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> <span class="Italic">Lynch v. Department of Education</span>, 31 MSPR 519, 529-530 (Spec. Pan. 1986), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Lynch v. Bennett</span>, 665 F. Supp. 62 (D.D.C. 1987); <span class="Italic">Orlando M. Macaranas v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03910111 (December 2, 1991) (agency met its duty to reasonably accommodate petitioner's disability by searching for vacancies in the San Jose and San Francisco Divisions), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Mattie Roberson v. Department of Army</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03900079 (October 30, 1990). As noted in our newly revised regulations, which codify our prior case law, an agency is only obligated to offer reassignment to a vacant position which is, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, located within the same commuting area and serviced by the same appointing authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.203(g) and cases cited above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, it appears from the record that the four component parts of the agency identified upon remand were in petitioner's commuting area; however they functioned under an independent hiring authority, an independent budget and had a special mission. In addition, the components in fact acted independently with regard to budget and personnel. Accordingly, the Commission finds that consideration of reassignment to these component parts is beyond the scope of reassignment as it is contemplated by the Rehabilitation Act. Therefore, we concur with the Board that petitioner was not entitled to reassignment to the component parts, albeit for reasons which differ from the Board.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency's obligation to consider reassignment to a vacant position as accommodation extends to positions that the agency is aware will become vacant at the time of the complainant's removal. In <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 03930164 (1994), the Commission found the agency breached its obligation of accommodation where it knew, at the time the complainant's removal became effective, that his former position would soon be vacant. In that case, the complainant returned to the agency after a lengthy absence for brain surgery. Upon his return, he was assigned to a new position. The complainant protested that he did not have the background and training for the new position and requested reassignment to his former position. Although the position was occupied by another employee, at the time of the complainant's removal the agency knew that employee would be leaving to accept another position.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the same case, the Commission also rejected an agency argument that the complainant's former position had substantially changed during his absence and, thus, it would impose an undue hardship on the agency to reassign him to that position. The Commission did not accept the agency's position that changes in computer hardware and software changed the essential functions of the position. Rather, the Commission found that only the "tools" for performing those functions had changed.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency has an obligation to investigate reasonable accommodation in the local commuting area prior to implementing a cross-country reassignment where the cross-country move has certain inherent medical risks. In <span class="Italic">Dalton v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01940693 (1995), the complainant suffered from degenerative arthritis that made it difficult for him to perform on-site safety inspections. The agency proposed to reassign the complainant from Washington, D.C. to Denver, rather than look for a position in Washington that did not require on-site inspections. The Commission found that the agency had failed to provide the complainant with reasonable accommodation where it never even explored the possibility of reassignment in the local commuting area.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the complainant does not initially have the burden of identifying a specific position for accommodation, "once agency officials, after a proper search, informed appellant that their attempts at reassignment had been unsuccessful, appellant then had the burden of pointing to specific, vacant positions for which she was qualified." <span class="Italic">See Hicks v. Postmaster General</span>, 05930774 (1994). The Rehabilitation Act does not require an agency to consider every possible reassignment or to find an employee an ideal job. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Franklin v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 01932372 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Gile v. United Airlines, Inc</span>., 95 F.3d 492, 498-99 (7th Cir. 1996), the court addressed the issue of whether an employer must reassign a disabled employee to a different position under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The <span class="Italic">Gile</span> court concluded:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even though the ADA seems to provide that an employer may be obligated to accommodate a disabled employee unable to perform the essential functions of his current job by transferring the employee to a different position, the courts which have addressed the question have not necessarily reached that conclusion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Those courts which have found that reassignment to a different position cannot be a reasonable accommodation under the ADA mistakenly rely upon preamendment Rehabilitation Act cases stating that proposition under the Rehabilitation Act.<span class="Italic"> See Myers v. Hose,</span> 50 F.3d 278, 284 (4th Cir. 1995) (citing <span class="Italic">Guillot</span>, 970 F.2d at 1326); <span class="Italic">Cheatwood v. Roanoke Indus.</span>, 891 F. Supp. 1528, 1537 (N.D. Ala. 1995) (citing <span class="Italic">Myers</span>, 50 F.3d at 284).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The other courts that have addressed the question recognized that under the ADA an employer may be obligated to transfer an employee to a different position where the employee can no longer perform the essential functions of the position he currently holds.<span class="Italic"> See Shiring v. Runyon</span>, No. 95-3547, 1996 WL 417636, at *4 (3d Cir. July 26, 1996) (Rehabilitation Act); <span class="Italic">Benson v. Northwest Airlines, Inc.</span>, 62 F.3d 1108, 1114 (8th Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Haysman v. Food Lion, Inc.</span>, 893 F. Supp. 1092, 1104 (S.D. Ga. 1995); <span class="Italic">Pedigo v. P.A.M. Transp., Inc.</span>, 891 F. Supp. 482, 485-87 (W.D. Ark. 1994); <span class="Italic">Vasquez v. Bedsole</span>, 888 F. Supp. 727, 731 (E.D.N.C. 1995); <span class="Italic">Emrick v. Libbey-Owens-Ford Co.</span>, 875 F. Supp. 393, 397 (E.D. Tex. 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our review of the ADA, its regulations, and the EEOC's interpretive guidance leads us to the conclusion of the majority of courts that have addressed the issue that the ADA may require an employer to reassign a <span id="Page_1371"></span>disabled employee to a different position as reasonable accommodation where the employee can no longer perform the essential functions of their current position. After stating what appears to be a very broad rule, we feel it is prudent to emphasize that, along with the other requirements a disabled employee must meet under the ADA to be entitled to reasonable accommodation, there are significant limitations on an employer's potential obligation to reassign a disabled employee as reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer is not obligated to provide an employee the accommodation he requests or prefers, the employer need only provide some reasonable accommodation<span class="Italic">. Schmidt v. Methodist Hospital</span>, No. 95-2773, 1996 WL 389253, at *3 (7th Cir. July 9, 1996). Thus, when an employee requests a transfer as reasonable accommodation and the employer offers alternative reasonable accommodation, which the employee then refuses, the employer cannot be liable for failing to reasonably accommodate the employee by not transferring him to another position<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ADA may only require an employer to reassign a disabled employee to a position for which the employee is otherwise qualified<span class="Italic">. White v. York Int'l Corp.</span>, 45 F.3d 357, 362 (10th Cir. 1995). An employer may be obligated to reassign a disabled employee, but only to vacant positions; an employer is not required to "bump" other employees to create a vacancy so as to be able to reassign the disabled employee<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Nor is an employer obligated to create a "new" position for the disabled employee. <span class="Italic">Fedro</span>, 21 F.3d at 1396. Furthermore, in order for an employer to be obligated to accommodate an employee by reassigning them to a different position, that accommodation must not impose an "undue hardship" on the employer. 42 USC sec. 12112(b)(5)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent">When the agency cannot locate a vacant position at the same grade and level within the complainant's capabilities, reassignment to a lower-graded position can be a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Olson v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01983200 (2001); <span class="Italic">Ford v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 01A11813 (2001).</p>
