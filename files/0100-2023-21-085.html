<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-92"><span class="space">e.</span> Harasser Unknown</h5>
<p class="noindent">Taking prompt and effective corrective action can be tricky when the person responsible for the harassment is unknown or unknowable. That was the case in <span class="Italic">Adam D. v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 2020002826 (2020), where the Commission held that the agency's prompt and thorough investigation and EEO trainings were sufficient to avoid liability even though the perpetrator who hung a noose in the complainant's work space was never identified:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant saw a hanging noose in his office cubicle on Monday, March 2, 2015, after having been absent from the office since the prior Thursday. Complainant testified that the noose was made from a physical therapy rope he used to treat a shoulder injury, and he stored the rope in his office cubicle. When Complainant saw the noose, he stated that he took a picture of it, placed the noose in an evidence bag, and texted the picture to all the individuals in his division (the Violent Gangs Task Force ("VGTF")), comprised of ten individuals, because he believed that someone in the VGTF had hung the noose.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In applying the hostile work environment standard, the Commission recognizes that Complainant's claim of hostile work environment essentially involves a single incident and management's response to that incident. However, in limited circumstances, we have held that a single incident may result in a finding of discrimination under Title VII. Incidents where African Americans are subjected to nooses are an example of this type of incident. <span class="Italic">See Juergensen v. Dep't of Commerce</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120073331 (Oct. 5, 2007) (a hangman's noose is "a highly charged and powerful symbol in the history of this country, calling up painful memories of the lynching of thousands of African Americans").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We therefore conclude that this event involving a hangman's noose was an objectively hostile event which was sufficiently severe to alter the conditions of Complainant's employment and to create an abusive work environment. <span class="Italic">See Posey v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01986619 (July 10, 2011). "[A] noose evokes an image, particularly among African-Americans, of a disgraceful past of extreme violence and racial bigotry." <span class="Italic">Tootle v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A40127 (Feb. 10, 2006) (single incident of a noose in the middle of workspace of African American employees, even discounting the charged racial climate of the Agency, created a hostile work environment). It is not unreasonable to believe that the noose would lead Complainant, an African American, to feel physically threatened by its presence given the role of nooses in African American history.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having determined that the presence of the noose was sufficiently severe in Complainant's workplace to alter the conditions of his employment, we next consider the Agency's liability for the incident. The Commission has held that an employing agency is liable for harassment by a co-worker or other non-supervisor when it "knows or should have known of the conduct, unless the Agency can show that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action." <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1604.11(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, there is no evidence that a supervisor or a non-supervisor was responsible for placement of the noose in Complainant's cubicle. An investigation failed to reveal the indemnity of the individual(s) responsible for the incident. However, Complainant testified that he believed that co-workers in his division were responsible, even though the Office of Professional Responsibility ("OPR") investigation report revealed that some twenty individuals, many of whom worked for other agencies, had access to the building where Complainant worked during the specific timeframe the noose was placed in Complainant's office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that the Agency was aware of the noose on the same day that Complainant discovered it in his cubicle--March 2, 2015. Specifically, Complainant testified that he took a picture of the noose, emailed his co-workers the picture, and also texted the picture to his supervisor ("S1"). The next day, March 3, 2015, Complainant stated that S1 "urged" him to file a complaint. Subsequently, Complainant reported the noose to the Agency's Office of Diversity and Civil Rights and the Agency's Joint Intake Center ("JIC"), the entity responsible for receiving reports of employee misconduct. Additionally, S1 testified that he immediately reported the incident to his supervisor ("S2"), the HIDTA supervisor, 4 and the OPR.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once notified of this incident, the Agency can only avoid liability for the harassment if it can establish that it undertook immediate and appropriate corrective action. Our review of the record supports the AJ's determination that the Agency has met this burden of proof and there is no basis for imputing liability to the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record supports that the OPR Senior Special Agent ("OPR Agent") began the process of initiating a formal investigation on March 4, 2015--one day after S1 had informed the OPR of the noose. In addition to initiating an investigation, the OPR Agent and S1 held a meeting on March 6, 2015, with the entire VGTF division. During the meeting, they informed VGTF staff that the hanging of the noose was distasteful, offensive, and would not be tolerated. While acknowledging that there was a history of VGTF employees performing practical jokes on each other, they emphasized that this matter was not a joke. The OPR Agent further informed the VGTF that he would investigate the matter after no one came forward as being responsible for placing the noose in Complainant's office space.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our review of the OPR investigation report reflects that the OPR Agent conducted a thorough investigation even though ultimately no individual was identified as placing the noose in Complainant's workstation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A copy of the OPR investigation report indicates that card entry access information was obtained for the period February 26, 2015 through March 2, 2015. The information "identified a number of [Complainant's] co-workers who were in the office on the possible dates in question." The record indicates that many of these individuals with access to the HIDTA building worked for various federal agencies. However, the report clarified that prior to 7:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span>, individuals had restricted access to just their floors. The report revealed that only two employees ("E1" and "E2") accessed the HIDTA building on Saturday, February 28, 2015. E1 worked for the FBI and stated that he was in the building after hours to clean out his office because he was being transferred to another division. E2 worked for the DEA and initially stated that he was on leave during the period at issue and did not recall going into the building on the day in question. However, during a follow-up interview with the OPR Agent, E2 acknowledged that he reported to the office on February 28, 2015 after hours to "input his time and attendance" for the period he was on sick leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The report also indicated that video surveillance cameras were not stationed in a location covering Complainant's workstation. Additionally, the video footage was not initially available because HIDTA had updated its surveillance system during the period in question. Nevertheless, the report indicated that the OPR Agent requested the hard drives from the surveillance cameras which were imaged and examined by a computer forensic analyst but review still yielded negative results. Additionally, twenty individuals assigned to HIDTA were interviewed, but none of the individuals claimed responsibility for the incident and none of the individuals were aware of anyone who took responsibility for the incident. However, the report indicated that the individuals indicated that Complainant had had a prior issue on September 15, 2014, involving another agent making racial comments. This individual was terminated from the Agency, but later reinstated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the record shows that the Special Agent-in-Charge ("SAC") requested the Agency's Chief Counsel for Miami provide training to her managers on EEO issues including harassment and retaliation, which was subsequently provided.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on this evidence, we conclude that the record reflects that from the date of harassment, the Agency took immediate, corrective action. <span id="Page_877"></span>Although Complainant asserts that the Agency failed to conduct DNA testing on the noose, the record indicates that Complainant acknowledged in his deposition that the Agency would have had to get a court order to do so. The record supports that the Agency viewed the video footage and interviewed several individuals who were determined to have access to Complainant's workstation during the relevant period but were unable to identify who was responsible for the incident. While Complainant disagreed with the manner in which the Agency conducted the investigation, (i.e. Complainant being present in the office while others were being interviewed as part of the investigation) the record supports that the Agency conducted a thorough investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Those agencies included the Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA"), the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"), the Federal Bureau of Prisons ("BOP"), and the Monroe County Sheriff's Office ("MCSO").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also initiated EEO training opportunities for management on harassment and retaliation issues. We note that there is no indication in the record that there were any subsequent instances of racial harassment being reported by Complainant. In sum, we find that there is no basis for imputing liability for this unfortunate incident to the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant (Jewish) in <span class="italic">Alonzo L. v. Postmaster General,</span> 2021001703 (2022), alleged, among other things, harassment based on religion when he found a Nazi swastika symbol at his work station with the word "Jew" and graffiti on the bathroom stall reading "Fuck Jews." The Commission found that the agency took appropriate action where it "a sincere effort to identify the perpetrator(s) and, when it was unable to do so, gave three 15-minute service talks communicating this was unacceptable in the Postal Service."</p>
