<h5 class="h5" id="sec21-144"><span class="space">m.</span> $75,001-$80,000</h5>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Bostick v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120093611 (2010), the Commission upheld an award of $76,000 by the agency and rejected the complainant's arguments that he was entitled to a higher damage award. In that case, the agency determined that the complainant suffered the effects of discrimination from May 2005 through at least January 2009. Those effects included mental anguish, debasement, humiliation, depression, and damage to the complainant's character, reputation and professional standing. The agency found that the complainant suffered from daily headaches and nausea and also had sleeplessness and depression that required medication and over 100 hours of therapy.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant had preexisting conditions and other stressors in her life, the administrative judge found that she would have been entitled to $300,000 in damages, but then reduced the award by 73.5% to $79,500. The Commission upheld that decision in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Postmaster General,</span> 0720060086 (2008). The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission applies the principle that "a tortfeasor takes its victims as it finds them." <span class="Italic">Wallis v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (November 13, 1995) (<span class="Italic">quoting Williamson v. Handy Button Machine Co.,</span> 817 F.2d 1290, 1295 (7th Cir. 1987)). The Commission also applies two exceptions to this general rule. First, when a complainant has a pre-existing condition, the agency is liable only for the additional harm or aggravation caused by the discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Second, if complainant's pre-existing condition inevitably would have worsened, the agency is entitled to a reduction in damages reflecting the extent to which the condition would have worsened even absent the discrimination; the burden of proof being on the agency to establish the extent of this entitlement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record, considering the nature of the discriminatory actions and the nature of the harm to complainant, we find the award of $79,500.00 in non-pecuniary, compensatory damages was supported by substantial evidence. We note that the AJ correctly found that the aggravation of complainant's PTSD in May 2000, was improving and would have continued to improve if not for the harassment and failure to accommodate at issue in this case. Through her testimony and affidavit, complainant states as a result of the discrimination she suffered she experienced weight gain, extreme fatigue and weakness due to depression, had a hard time getting out of bed or leaving her house on occasion, missed work, took several medications, including Valium and Zoloft, and suffered from memory loss and muscle weakness as a result of the medication she took. Complainant notes that following the June 19, 2001 meeting with S1, she spent the rest of the day crying and as a result, was treated by her doctor for worsening depression. Further, complainant provided a letter from her doctor dated June 13, 2001, noting complainant was "experiencing a worsening of her depression" and reducing the number of hours she could work. The record also contains a psychiatric clinical note dated June 13, 2001, documenting complainant's visit for medication management which notes that she was "totally distressed and crying" and "struggling to maintain in the work environment." Medical documentation dated June 26, 2001, notes that complainant "had an experience in the work setting, which brought about further exacerbation of her depression. She has again been <span id="Page_1893"></span>lethargic, low motivation, isolative, crying frequently and easily, and having difficulty sleeping." A July 2, 2001 psychiatric clinical note, states that following an incident where her supervisor threatened to have her "work at K-Mart" complainant's dosage of Zoloft was increased and it was noted that her major depressive disorder was "exacerbated by work and family stressors." Complainant's doctor noted in a July 11, 2001 letter that complainant experienced "exacerbations and remissions of anxiety and depression corresponding most closely to problems in the workplace" and noted "[p]roblem interactions with personnel in the workplace and unrealistic expectations of patient's performance causing extreme emotional stress and physical exhaustion." The record reveals that on September 10, 2001, complainant's doctor stated complainant could no longer work at the agency due to medical reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has awarded similar compensatory damages in cases similar to complainant's case. <span class="Italic">See Miles v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A30019 (February 27, 2004) ($75,000.00 awarded where evidence showed complainant was angry, distant, depressed, had crying spells, and missed work as a result of discrimination). In the present case, we have limited complainant's award to the extent that a portion of complainant's emotional harm was caused by factors other than the discriminatory harassment and denial of accommodation at issue in this case. Based on all of these considerations, we find that $79,500.00 is a proper award for that portion of complainant's emotional distress that was caused by the agency's discrimination. Further, the amount of the award meets the goals of not being "monstrously excessive" standing alone, not being the product of passion or prejudice, and being consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Bernard v. Secretary of Veterans Administration</span>, 01966861 (1998), the Commission awarded $80,000 in emotional distress damages even though the complainant presented no medical evidence. The Commission found the claim for damages was adequately supported by the testimony of friends, family, and coworkers. Of particular significance to the Commission was the agency's failure to provide an accommodation that would allow the complainant to function autonomously in his job. As the Commission in <span class="Italic">Bernard</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are particularly mindful of the extended period of time over which appellant sustained these injuries and the profound loss of hope and dignity engendered by the agency's repeated and continued failure to provide him with the reasonable accommodation necessary in order for him to function independently in his position. The serious deleterious effects of this prolonged deprivation cannot and must not be underestimated.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission further noted the emotional distress caused "substantial physical discomfort." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Following <span class="Italic">McCann</span> and <span class="Italic">Bernard</span>, the Commission awarded $80,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Fauntleroy v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A00050 (2001), where the complainant prevailed on a claim of sex discrimination for a failure to promote. Although the complainant had preexisting conditions, the Commission found the evidence was sufficient to award substantial damages in <span class="Italic">Fauntleroy</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ's award was based on credible testimony and other evidence which indicated that complainant suffered worsening of existing gastrointestinal and sleep problems as a result of the discrimination. Complainant was also prescribed medications for each of those physical conditions and for her mental state as well. Complainant testified that she experienced significant weight loss, was consumed with thoughts of the discrimination to which she was subjected, felt humiliation in the workplace and no longer enjoyed working there, experienced difficulties in concentrating on her work, and underwent a loss of enjoyment in some of her out of work activities (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, golf and reading). Complainant's testimony was corroborated by her doctor. He diagnosed her with major depression and testified that the discrimination "ripped her apart." In cases with similar effects, we have awarded similar amounts. For example, in <span class="Italic">Bernard v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01966861 (July 17, 1998), a non-selection case such as this one, we awarded complainant $80,000 in non-pecuniary damages where affidavits provided by complainant, friends, and co-workers described the emotional distress that resulted from the agency's discriminatory actions. In <span class="Italic">McCann v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01971851 (October 23, 1998), a removal case, we found that complainant's testimony and several reports from medical professionals were sufficient to support a finding that the agency's discrimination reawakened complainant's post traumatic stress disorder. As such, she was awarded $75,000 in non-pecuniary damages. Thus, given the record as a whole, the Commission finds no reason to change the AJ's award of $80,000 in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission also awarded $80,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Ruggiero v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01A01302 (2001), where the failure of the agency to reasonably accommodate complainant's rheumatoid arthritis led to the further deterioration of her health. The deterioration caused the complainant difficulty in performing manual tasks and engaging in outside activities that resulted in the loss of consortium with her husband.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reduced the award of an administrative judge from $100,000 to $80,000 in <span class="Italic">Day v. Postmaster General</span>, 07A10079 (2001), where the effects of the agency's failure to hire the complainant lingered for five years. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Day</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that complainant struggled since the early 1990s to obtain employment with the agency. While complainant testified that this struggle left him frustrated and angry, he also clearly testified that the breaking point for him was when his job offer was rescinded for no legitimate reason and he was told to peruse the advertisements in the newspaper to find a job. Complainant and his wife testified that complainant's personality changed after the discriminatory event in many negative ways. Complainant and his wife testified that this action by the agency made complainant lose all self-esteem. After the job was rescinded, complainant and his wife testified that complainant withdrew from life. Complainant did not leave the house and stopped answering the phone. Complainant would sit at home for months and months doing nothing. Complainant stopped walking his dog. It took complainant almost a year to get out of the house. Complainant testified that he felt totally rejected and lacked self-worth. In addition, complainant became very angry and would take out his anger on his family.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also testified to having many sleepless nights after the discriminatory event and that he continued to have sleepless nights on the average of two to three per week as of the date of the hearing on compensatory damages. Complainant and his wife were forced to sell their home and move into an apartment. Complainant also testified to the deterioration of his marriage and relationships with his four children (ages 17, 13, 7, and 4). In addition, complainant took a job in Alabama and relocated there without his wife and children. The long distance relationship put even more stress on his family relationship. Two of his children told complainant that they would not talk to him until he came home. Complainant testified that he feels like a "deadbeat dad." His wife testified to the severe strain the long distance caused their relationship. The withdrawal of complainant after his job was rescinded virtually turned complainant's wife into a single mom when before the job was rescinded complainant was a very active husband and father and helped his wife out a lot in raising their children. Complainant also testified that he has become impotent as a result of the job being rescinded and that his marriage was on the verge of breaking up. Complainant's wife testified that complainant lost so much weight that the neighborhood started rumors that complainant was dying of AIDS.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the complainant suffered from nearly fours years of depression so severe she was unable to work, the Commission found an award of $80,000 in damages was appropriate. In <span class="Italic">McGuire v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01A04942 (2003), the complainant, because of the depression, also suffered physical symptoms, loss of her son's affections, and loss of reputation in the community. The Commission in <span class="Italic">McGuire</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Anxiety, Depression, and Emotional Distress: Complainant herself stated, under oath and without contradiction, that she experienced extreme fear of other people between January and August 1993, and that her emotional distress and depression did not subside until 1997. As a result, she was out of work for four years. Her father stated that, between 1992 and 1997, complainant became distant and withdrawn, and that although she was able to find part-time employment in the Spring of 1997, she would carry scars from her experiences at the agency. Her mother stated that, during her ordeal, complainant became increasingly depressed and afraid to go outside even to buy food, that her appearance became unkempt, and that her house was a mess. H, a family friend who knew complainant for eight years stated that before the harassment episode, complainant would socialize, and that afterwards she became depressed not only because of the harassment, but because of management's failure to do anything about it. H further stated that complainant would visit her at home, often crying, and that later, complainant refused to leave her own house. C, a coworker, also stated that complainant was happy and well adjusted before the episode with Z. C emphasized that complainant was conscientious, committed to her work, and very good at balancing parenting with her job and her social life even though she worked overtime and on weekends. She further stated that, after the harassment began, complainant stopped interacting with her coworkers and began to slide into a depression as her circle of friends fell away. She also stated that complainant was "a physical and mental wreck" for years after the incidents. C echoed the assessment of complainant's father that she had been scarred by the harassment for many years afterward. She too emphasized that management's failure to take prompt and appropriate corrective measures contributed to complainant's prolonged mental and emotional distress. S, a pastor who ran a spiritual support network for women, stated that complainant suffered from depression and inability to concentrate, and that she would often cry during group meetings. E, a licensed clinical social worker who saw complainant regularly between January 1993 and January 1994, opined that complainant had been experiencing anxiety, anger, and depression, and that she was susceptible to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A psychiatrist who saw complainant in September 1996 confirmed that complainant was, in <span id="Page_1894"></span>fact, being treated for PTSD that had been triggered by her work situation. The record includes invoices and receipts indicating that complainant had been taking antidepressant medications under prescription between February 1993 and July 1997, and had been undergoing counseling and psychotherapy throughout 1993 and 1994.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Physical Symptoms: Complainant averred that between January and August 1993, while she was being subjected to sexual harassment by Z, she suffered from migraine headaches, insomnia, stomach problems, and the eating disorder called bulemia. She related how she had to return to the agency in the spring of 1994, and was hospitalized for a stress-induced arrhythmia of the heart after returning to the agency and seeing her former supervisors. Witnesses H, C, and S all stated that they observed complainant gain weight and lose weight very rapidly, and C was able to recall that at one point, complainant's face appeared "extremely bloated." C further attributed the "yo-yo-ing" of complainant's weight to the harassment situation involving Z and management's inaction. E, the social worker, confirmed that complainant presented the symptoms of bulemia. She noted that complainant had suffered from bulemia in the past, and emphasized the condition had been aggravated by the stressful working conditions precipitated by Z and perpetuated by management's failure to resolve the situation. She had incurred charges for various medical expenses related to her condition between January 1993 and December 1996.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Loss of Son's Affections: Complainant averred that, for nearly two years after her resignation from the agency in August 1993, she was unable to care for her son, who was 10 years old when the Z episode began. Complainant was a single parent who apparently had custodial obligations. She stated that when she became depressed, she became fearful of going outside or letting her son outside and play with other children. She became extremely overprotective of him, but at the same time, was unable to attend to his basic needs. She stated that she was unable to give her son the attention that he needed because all she could think about was Z. As a result, her son had to take out the garbage, prepare his own meals, get himself to school on time, and act as a surrogate parent for complainant. All of this took a heavy toll on their relationship. Complainant's account of the situation was corroborated by her parents, and by H and C.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Injury to Credit Standing: Complainant resigned from the agency in August 1993, due to the intense stress that the Z situation had caused her. Although she was reinstated in April 1995, as the result of a successful grievance, she resigned again after experiencing PTSD. It was not until the Spring of 1997, that she felt comfortable enough to return to work on a part-time basis. Thus, the record establishes that, for about four years, she had been unable to work because of the depression, PTSD, and stress-related illnesses that resulted from having been subjected to harassment and a hostile work environment. During that four-year interval, complainant was unable to pay her bills, many of which had been sent to collection agencies. In addition to numerous delinquency notices, the record includes an excerpt from complainant's credit report with the Equifax Credit Reporting Service. This report clearly shows that at least five of complainant's unpaid financial obligations were referred to collection agencies for action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Injury to Reputation in the Community: Complainant lived and worked in Redmond, Oregon, a small town where many of the residents knew each other. Eight articles about complainant's situation and its aftermath appeared in the local newspaper. C averred that once this happened, the entire town knew about complainant. She recited one incident where complainant had gotten an interview for a position at a medical practice, but was turned down after being told by the office manager that it would not be a good idea to have someone with her "reputation and notoriety" working there.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon the foregoing, and upon the agency's failure to rebut any of this evidence, we find that Z's sexual harassment of complainant between June 1992 and August 1993, as well as the agency's failure to take corrective action after being told of the situation, were causative factors behind the injuries that complainant suffered between 1993 and 1997. We also find that complainant's actions regarding the documentation of her co-worker's performance during the Summer and Fall of 1992 contributed to her hospitalization and suicide attempt in October 1992. From that point until complainant's resignation in August 1993, however, Z's conduct toward complainant and management's failure to resolve the matter were the sole cause of her injuries. We now turn to the calculation of the damages award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In cases like this, where a victim of discrimination experiences prolonged pain and suffering for three years or more, higher awards are appropriate and reasonable<span class="Italic">. See Chow v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01981308 (August 5, 1999), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration granted on other grounds</span> EEOC Request No. 05991106 (February 12, 2001) ($100,000 awarded where complainant experienced depression, abdominal pains, chest pains, headaches, and difficulty breathing and sleeping due to nightmares, and where complainant's distress endured for 3 years and 6 months); <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01951729 (July 29, 1998), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span> EEOC Request No. 05981118 (September 30, 1999) ($100,000 awarded where complainant was subjected to hostile work environment that caused her to develop significant levels of anxiety, nervousness and depression, which were manifested by nightmares, cognitive inefficiencies, periods of tearfulness, and suicidal ideation, and where complainant remained out of work between November 1990 and May 1993, nearly 3 years); <span class="Italic">Bahaudin v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01993594 (September 13, 2000) ($85,000 awarded where agency's discriminatory actions caused complainant to become irritable and distant, suffer from insomnia, not want to go to work, lay in bed when not working, neglect his home duties and not eat); and <span class="Italic">Bernard v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01966861 (July 17, 1998) ($80,000 awarded where complainant, through his own testimony and that of family and friends, showed that he experienced symptoms of depression, headaches, ringing in his ears, vomiting, elevated blood pressure, grinding of teeth, and insomnia for over five years after the agency's discriminatory actions).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the circumstances of this case support complainant's request for $80,000 in nonpecuniary compensatory damages. Complainant suffered from depression and anxiety so severe that she was unable to work for nearly four years after she left the agency. As late as September 1996, she was still being treated for PTSD. In addition to mental and emotional distress, complainant had been experiencing physical symptoms such as migraine headaches, stomach problems, insomnia, and bulemia. Third, her inability to be an effective parent during the height of her depression strained her relationship with her son. Fourth, the depression and anxiety that she endured rendered her unable to work, which in turn, damaged her credit rating. Finally, her reputation in Redmond, Oregon had been tarnished because of all the negative publicity that resulted from being harassed by Z between June 1992 and August 1993.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the failure to make reasonable accommodation spanned several years and had a significant impact on the complainant's life, the Commission awarded $80,000 in damages even where the complainant had a preexisting condition that had already resulted in one suicide attempt. In <span class="Italic">Tyler v. Postmaster General,</span> <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a31207.txt">01A31207</a> (2004), the Commission found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reveals that in April 1993, complainant's accommodation was removed, which prohibited him from working as a Mechanic. As a result, complainant did not work full-time from April 1993 until November 7, 1994. Complainant did not begin receiving worker's compensation until February 1994. In November 1994, complainant was placed into a clerk position where he worked the night shift under less than perfect working conditions answering telephones. Complainant remained in the clerk position until September 2000.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant submitted an affidavit in reply to the agency's supplementary investigation for compensatory damages. In his affidavit, complainant averred that the agency's removal of his accommodation and his position as a Mechanic, as well as change in shift time had a profound affect on him, and resulted in severe emotional distress. While complainant was out of work, he suffered financial hardship and was forced to take out a mortgage on his house, which he had previously owned free and clear. This financial stress also caused marital strain. Eventually, complainant and his wife divorced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant recalled that because he was required to work the night shift, he developed insomnia and had little time to spend with his children, which he had previously enjoyed. Furthermore, the new position answering telephones was demeaning to complainant, who had worked as a skilled Mechanic. Complainant averred that because of the agency's actions, he developed depression, which he denied ever being treated for in the past. Complainant stated that he was required to work in an unheated environment which caused him to suffer increased pain and discomfort. Complainant added that the pain, fatigue, depression, marital strain, financial difficulties and inability to use his skills ultimately led to two suicide attempts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant also recalled that because of the depression and fatigue, he became less involved in his church activities, where he had been previously very active. Finally, complainant stated that the agency's failure to implement the AJ's finding of discrimination has increased his emotional distress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's pastor also submitted an affidavit in response to the agency's supplementary investigation. He recalled that when he met complainant 1993, he was an active member of the church who served as Chairman of the Trustee Board. The pastor said he had not noticed complainant suffering from depression until he began counseling complainant in 1994. According to the pastor, complainant reported that he had lost his accommodation and Mechanic position, and was off of work. The pastor averred that complainant seemed depressed, <span id="Page_1895"></span>less energetic and became less involved in church activities. Indeed, he recalled that complainant was too tired or depressed to leave the house to attend Sunday services.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, complainant's psychologist submitted a report detailing complainant's therapeutic history. She reported that she started treating complainant in 1991 following a suicide attempt, and diagnosed complainant with Major Depression--Moderate. She recalled that the early years of therapy dealt with complainant's frustration over his physical injuries. Complainant showed great improvement and in March, 1993, they discussed the termination of therapy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, when complainant's accommodation and position were removed in April 1993, complainant became depressed and suffered from insomnia, physical discomfort and the inability to use his skills as a Mechanic. In December 1993, complainant attempted suicide again. Complainant's psychologist reported that complainant suffered financial and marital strain from being out of work for several months. In sum, complainant's psychologist reported:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">As demonstrated by nine years of therapeutic involvement with [complainant] as well as results of his psychological testing, his depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, sleep deprivation and negative impact on his physical, emotional and spiritual well-being can be traced directly to the removal of his accommodations and his job. In addition, his symptoms have been exacerbated further by the stress of the current litigation.</p>
<p class="noindent">A damage award of $80,000 was upheld by the Commission where an agency's failure to accommodate led to exacerbation of the complainant's back condition. In <span class="Italic">Buckner v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0720070052 (2008), the Commission noted that a deterioration in the complainant's condition coincided with the failure to accommodate. The award is interesting in that there was no discussion of any emotion harm and the award was premised, at least primarily, on physical pain and suffering.</p>
<p class="noindent">Noting that the "more inherently degrading or humiliating the Agency's actions, the more reasonable it is to infer that a person would suffer humiliation or distress from that action," the Commission upheld an award of $80,000 in damages in <span class="Italic">Pendleton v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720090054 (2011). However, the award did not hinge upon the nature of the agency's action--a nonpromotion--but instead upon the damages evidence. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Pendleton</span>, also noted that the agency's appellate argument that the award was out of line with other nonpromotion cases because the proper standard is comparable harm and not comparable personnel actions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's own testimony, as corroborated by her husband, was found credible by the AJ that she became both physically ill and severe emotional distress as a result of the discriminatory non-selection. She said she experienced heart palpitations, blurry vision, headaches, difficulty eating, vomiting and nightmares. She also testified to suffering from sleeplessness, withdrawal, loss of interest and enjoyment in life, anger, sadness, and feeling helpless and hopeless. The evidence shows she sought medical treatment as a result of her physical and psychological symptoms. The AJ has awarded over eight thousand dollars in medical expenses to compensate Complainant for this treatment, an award the Agency has not challenged on appeal. Complainant's psychologist testified that she diagnosed Complainant with major depression and prescribed medication. While the Agency argues that the psychologist's testimony reveals that some of Complainant's depression could be attributed to work-related events other than her non-selection, substantial evidence supports the AJ's conclusion that there remains significant evidence of harm as a result of the Agency's discriminatory non-selection.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Again, in its brief, we find that the Agency has mis-focused its arguments. The Agency seems to argue that the amount of compensatory damages should be correlated with the type of personnel action at issue (in this case, one non-selection). This, however, as already noted is not the standard. Rather, an award of non-pecuniary compensatory damages must be determined based on the extent of the harm suffered by a particular complainant as a result of the Agency's discriminatory actions. Taking into account the evidence of non-pecuniary damages submitted by the Complainant, including the severity and public nature of the actions taken management against a long-time employee who had been respected and praised in the past, that resulted in emotional anguish and humiliation, we find the AJ's award of $80,000 to be appropriate. This amount takes into account the severity of the harm suffered, and is consistent with prior Commission precedent. <span class="Italic">See Hartley v, Department of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Request 05990563 (December 27, 2002) ($85,000 awarded for emotional and physical problems, including loss of self-esteem, worry and stress); <span class="Italic">Fauntleroy v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A00050 (January 10 2001) (affirming AJ's award of $80,000 in compensatory damages where a discriminatory non-selection caused worsening of existing gastrointestinal and sleep problems, and caused complainant to experience major depression); <span class="Italic">Bernard v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01966861 (July 17, 1998) (awarding $80,000 in compensatory damages where non-selection and denial of accommodation were found to cause severe emotional harm and substantial physical discomfort over a period of time).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of $80,000 by the administrative judge was upheld in <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Burruss v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720100002 (2011), where the retaliation resulted in the complainant's arrest. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Burruss</span>, in addition to noting the medical evidence submitted by the complainant cited the findings of the administrative judge:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In rendering his non-pecuniary damages award, the AJ focused on the egregious evidence that Agency officials conspired to subject Complainant to an improper OIG investigation and arrest resulting in Complainant being handcuffed on a public street, held in jail overnight, and taken to the courthouse in shackles. In addition, the AJ noted that while suspended without pay, Complainant had to wait for two weeks before being scheduled for a court hearing. The AJ also noted that Complainant had to explain to his two young children why he did not come home the night he was incarcerated. Complainant also testified that the December Suspension caused him emotional distress. Complainant testified that he was subjected to severe humiliation and other emotional distress as a result of all the actions taken by the Agency (beginning with the December Suspension) and the resulting harmful effects such actions had on his relationships with his co-workers and family members.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ also noted that the evidence shows that Complainant had undergone extensive medical and psychiatric care. The AJ further concluded that as a result of the Agency's retaliatory actions, Complainant suffered loss of self-esteem, humiliation, depression, loss of sleep and withdrawal from his co-workers. The AJ determined that the evidence supported the finding that Complainant endured emotional pain and suffering for at least 31 months following the retaliatory actions of the Agency that began with the December 1, 2006 suspension. Based upon the evidence in the record, the AJ awarded Complainant $80,000.00 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Basaldua v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720090044 (2013), the Commission upheld an award by the administrative judge of $80,000 finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant's presentation of evidence in support of non-pecuniary compensatory damages consisted of testimony from himself, along with proof of treatment in the Emergency Room, medical documentation to support his increased alcohol consumption to deal with the emotional distress, and a prescription for diazepam to help him relax and sleep. Additionally, there is no record of Complainant suffering from any pre-existing condition which would have contributed to any of the side effects Complainant alleges occurred as a result of the discrimination. Complainant testified that as a result of the discrimination he began frequently fighting with his wife which led to marital problems. Complainant testified that his 8 and 12 year old children became withdrawn from him because he frequently snapped at them. Complainant says that he developed trouble sleeping, and waking up frequently with night sweats. Complainant testified that he became withdrawn from his family, questioned his faith, and contemplated divorcing his wife.</p>
<p class="noindent">Despite the lack of medical notes or doctors' reports in the record, the Commission increased the complainant's award from $15,000 to $80,000 in nonpecuniary damages for a myriad of new and aggravated conditions in <span class="Italic">Emmett W. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120143098 (2016):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant stated that after the termination, he lost sleep, weight and the sympathy of others. The stress took a toll on him and his family. Depression and stress "overwhelmed" him and he stated that he was uncertain that he would ever recover. The PTSD worsened and nothing seemed to bring relief for his agony. Because of unpaid bills and creditors' telephone calls and repossession of his property, he had to file bankruptcy. His financial situation "ruined" his reputation as a respectable person. Complainant stated that his medical insurance was cancelled and he could not afford medical care for his family. The three children living with him were placed on state-funded Medicaid. He began working about three months after his termination earning a salary of $6,675 annually, though he would have earned $31,315 yearly from the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although there are no medical reports in the record before us, we have noted earlier herein that evidence from a health care provider or other expert is not a mandatory prerequisite to recover damages. Here, the discrimination occurred in 2011. Complainant has described how he was affected by the discriminatory action and offers that he does not see how he will recover. There is no evidence that his condition has returned to where it was before the 2011 termination and his securing of credit will likely be affected for years because he filed for bankruptcy. Complainant's family provided affidavits regarding the continuing outward manifestations of his PTSD and the deleterious effects that followed Complainant's termination. Family members witnessed his sleeplessness, <span id="Page_1896"></span>stress, depression, volatile anger, marital and familial strain, humiliation, and injury to his credit standing and reputation. We therefore find that the sum of $15,000 is not sufficient to remedy the harm that the Agency's actions caused Complainant and instead award Complainant $80,000, an award limited to the sums necessary to compensate Complainant for the actual harm caused by the Agency's discriminatory action and our attempt to affix a reasonable dollar value to compensate Complainant for that portion of emotional distress and related symptoms that were caused and aggravated by the Agency's discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Webb v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120070230 (Dec. 17, 2009) (citing EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (July 14, 1992) at 13). The Commission recognizes that a precise measurement cannot always be used to reduce the wrong inflicted. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04900010 (Nov. 29, 1990). Nonetheless, the burden of limiting the remedy rests with the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Further, the amount awarded is not monstrously excessive.</p>
