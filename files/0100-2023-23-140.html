<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-138"><span class="space">c.</span> Continued Medical Examinations</h5>
<p class="noindent">An initial and follow-up fitness-for-duty examination was found job-related and consistent with business necessity in <span class="Italic">Depina v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0120080521 (2010), where the first examination was conducted to determine if the complainant could perform essential job functions and the second examination was conducted because the initial examination was incomplete. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Depina</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the AJ's conclusion that the medical examinations of November 2, and December 19, 2005 were lawful, is supported by substantial evidence in the record. Substantial evidence of record indicates that the first examination was necessary as part of an assessment about whether complainant could perform his essential job functions. The record indicates that complainant was not wearing his weapon at work during the relevant time for reasons relating to his disability, however, Customs regulations specify that officers will carry a Service-issued weapon and authorized holster and equipment. ROI, Ex. F23, F24. In addition, complainant's supervisor explained that pancake holsters were not authorized under these regulations. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Accordingly, we find that the first examination was job-related and consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record suggests that the second examination was needed because the first examination was incomplete. Although at first glance it might seem that a neurological examination would be unnecessary, or a "fishing expedition," as complainant describes it, we find that this examination was in fact, lawful. In so finding, we note that complainant's request not to have to wear the "full duty belt" had been made in a letter dated October 13, 2005, by complainant's neurologist. In the letter, the neurologist had asked that there be limits placed on the amount of weight that complainant was allowed to carry around his waist, including the wearing of the full duty belt. The neurologist also stated that he expected complainant not to have these limitations within three months. Accordingly, a follow-up neurological examination was reasonable and we find it was job-related and consistent with business necessity in this circumstance.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Domingo v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120112701 (2013), the Commission found that two fitness-for-duty examinations were warranted where there were conflicting opinions between the two psychiatrists.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in reversing a grant of summary judgment for the agency, the Commission raised questions about whether continued medical examinations were warranted for a law enforcement officer who was HIV-positive. In <span class="Italic">Milford R. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120120081 (2015), the Commission, in remanding the case for hearing, wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Medical Inquiries and Independent Medical Examination</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Rehabilitation Act places certain limitations on an employer's ability to make disability-related inquiries or require medical examinations of employees. The inquiry may be made or the examination ordered only if it is job-related and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.13(b), 1630.14(c). Generally, a disability-related inquiry or medical examination of an employee may be job-related and consistent with business necessity when an employer has a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that: (1) an employee's ability to perform essential job functions will be impaired by a medical condition; or (2) an employee will pose a direct threat due to a medical condition. EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees Under the ADA</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002, Question 5 (July 27, 2000). Objective evidence is reliable information, either directly observed or provided by a credible third party, that an employee may have or has a medical condition that will impair her ability to perform essential job functions or will pose a direct threat. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. It is the burden of the employer to show that its disability-related inquiries and requests for medical examination arc job-related and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to the Agency's policy described above. Complainant was asked to bring in medical documentation regarding his "Diagnosis, prognosis, <span id="Page_1239"></span>and risk to others given his position as a Pentagon Police Officer. Results of Lab studies." ROI at p. 473. According to the AJ, Complainant failed to provide the requested medical documentation, so the MRB ordered an IME, which took place on May 26, 2009.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that the Agency's request for further medical documentation and an ME were warranted because the requests were pursuant to the Agency's medical standard, and because Complainant failed to provide the requested medical documentation. However, we find there remains a dispute regarding whether the Agency's decision to issue Complainant multiple medical inquiries and then order him to undergo an IME was reasonable given the lack of objective evidence that Complainant experienced any issues related to the performance of his essential job functions. Moreover, there is evidence in the record from Complainant's physician clearing him to work. The decision to require an IME was even more questionable, in light of the Agency's Medical Officer's phone conversation with Complainant's physician, who informed the Agency that Complainant was in HIV Stage 1, and later followed up to report that he was followed every three months, that his CD4 and Viral Load counts had improved, and that he had had no side-effects with the medications. (ROI at p. 476). Despite this evidence in the record from Complainant's physician clearing him to work, the AJ credited the Agency's position, and found "no dispute" that Complainant failed to provide the relevant medical documentation. The question of the reasonableness of the Agency's inquiry, as well as the evidence that Complainant may have satisfied the Agency's inquiry prior to the IME should be addressed at the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Periodic Monitoring and Neuropsychiatric Examination</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Confirming Complainant's own physician's opinion, the results of the IME recommended that Complainant be returned to full duty, as he bad no opportunistic infections, and was fully able to perform his job without direct threat to anyone. Nevertheless, the physician who conducted the IME recommended that additional periodic monitoring of Complainant be performed to ensure that Complainant could continue to safely and effectively perform his assigned duties. Specifically, the IME physician determined that Complainant, a civilian, was subject to "Army Regulation AR 600-110 (Identification, Surveillance and Administration of Personnel Infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)." Accordingly, he recommended that Complainant provide a CD4 blood test and staging-testing every six months. (ROI at P.p. 174-177).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The physician also remarked that a psychiatrist would be in the best position to assess any "neurocognitive defects" which may be present due to his HIV infection. Accordingly, the Agency ordered Complainant to undergo the additional blood monitoring and a neuropsychiatric examination. <span class="Italic">See</span> ROI at p. 174.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ erred by failing to address Complainant's claims that he was ordered to undergo a neuropsychiatric examination as well as periodic testing of Complainant's blood every three months. In that regard, we note there is no evidence to support the application of an Army Regulation which requires routine surveillance of soldiers with HIV, since Complainant is a civilian employee, and not in the military. <span class="Italic">See</span> ROI at p. 629. Moreover, we do not find sufficient evidence to support the periodic testing of Complainant, since the Agency's own IME determined Complainant was not direct threat to anyone, nor was there any objective evidence be was having problems performing the essential functions of the job. The Agency will have to address these significant concerns at the hearing. As to the neuropsychiatric examination, we find a dispute in the record as to whether there was sufficient objective evidence to support the medical inquiry.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the complainant's aberrant behavior justifies initial inquiries, including a fitness-for-duty examination, does not mean the agency can require the complainant to undergo further treatment and provide further medical information. In <span class="Italic">Meeker v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A12137 (2002), the Commission found the agency violated the Rehabilitation Act when it required treatment and further information after the fitness-for-duty examination cleared the complainant to return to work. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Meeker</span> found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We turn first to complainant's claim of disability discrimination. Ordinarily, as a threshold matter, complainant must establish that he is a "qualified individual with a disability" within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act. Herein, however, we do not need to address whether complainant is an individual with a disability. The AJ treated the complainant's claim as one of disparate treatment discrimination because complainant alleged that no one else who was otherwise declared fit for duty, and therefore medically cleared to work, was nonetheless required to submit to follow up examinations. Complainant's argument, however, is more appropriately construed as an opposition to further medical inquiries. Complainant need not prove he is an individual with a disability to take such opposition. 29 C.F.R. 1630.14(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Rehabilitation Act incorporates by reference the provisions of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) concerning medical inquiries and examinations. The ADA imposes significant restrictions on an employer's freedom to make medical inquiries of employees. The EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (Disability Guidance), No. 915.002 (July 26, 2000) states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A covered entity shall not require a medical examination and shall not make inquiries of an employee as to whether such employee is an individual with a disability or as to the nature and severity of the disability, unless such examination or inquiry is shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This statutory language makes clear that the ADA's restrictions on inquiries and examinations apply to all employees, not just those with disabilities. Unlike other provisions of the ADA which are limited to qualified individuals with disabilities, the use of the term "employee" in this provision reflects Congress's intent to cover a broader class of individuals and to prevent employers from asking questions and conducting medical examinations that serve no legitimate purpose. Requiring an individual to show that s/he is a person with a disability in order to challenge a disability-related inquiry or medical examination would defeat this purpose. Any employee, therefore, has a right to challenge a disability-related inquiry or medical examination that is not job-related and consistent with business necessity. Disability Guidance at 5 (some footnotes omitted); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Bruno v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No 01996301 (January 16, 2002); and <span class="Italic">Watkins v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01981800 (August 29, 2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the agency must demonstrate that its initial and subsequent requests for medical examinations were job-related and consistent with business necessity. 29 C.F.R. 1630.14(c). Generally, a disability-related inquiry or medical examination of an employee may be "job-related and consistent with business necessity" when an employer "has a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that: (1) an employee's ability to perform essential job functions will be impaired by a medical condition; or (2) an employee will pose a direct threat due to a medical condition." Disability Guidance at 15.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Herein, S1 stated that she requested that complainant submit to a fitness for duty exam because he made random and vague comments about being threatened, watched, and fearing for his life because of his knowledge about some unnamed individuals. S1 further stated in her written account of the incident, which she attached to her letter to DR1 seeking his opinion concerning a fitness for duty exam for complainant, that during the February 20 meeting complainant was crying and stated that a hit man was after him. Agency Hearing Exhibit 4 (A-4). S1 further noted in her request letter to DR1 that complainant had a history of being referred to the employee assistance program, including once for comments that were interpreted as suicidal. A-4. DR1 stated that he approved this request because complainant was expressing bizarre and paranoid-type feelings, which he felt related to "life and death issues in the work place." Based on this information, we conclude that S1 or DR1 had a "reasonable belief" that complainant either could not perform the essential functions of his job or was a direct threat to himself or others.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The examinations did not end with the fitness for duty exam, however. After complainant was examined by both a psychiatrist and a psychologist, he was declared fit for duty and not a threat to himself or others. Nonetheless, DR1 imposed a restriction on complainant, requiring him to seek psychiatric care for one year and report his progress monthly. AJ Decision at 14. As stated above, complainant took issue with having to submit to such exams as a condition of his employment, as well as with having to pay for them himself, given that he was previously declared fit for duty and not a threat to himself or others.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In ordering such subsequent exams, the agency is bound by the same requirements used to evaluate the initial referral. 29 C.F.R. 1630.14(c). Was the requirement job-related and consistent with business necessity? Did the agency have a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that: (1) complainant's ability to perform essential job functions would be impaired by a medical condition; or (2) complainant posed a direct threat due to a medical condition? <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the agency did not have a reasonable belief that complainant's ability to perform essential job functions would be impaired by a medical condition or that he posed a direct threat due to a medical condition. Complainant was determined to be fit for duty by both doctors he was sent to by the agency. The record is void of any evidence that would suggest complainant's ability to do his job was in question. In fact, complainant received a monetary award for his performance not long before the February 20, 1998, conversation with S1<span class="Italic">. See</span> A-4. Further, S1, when asked during the hearing if she thought complainant was a threat to himself or others, responded that she was not fearful of complainant and that if she had been fearful of him, he "would not be at work." Hearing Transcript (HT) at 240. It is the burden of the employer to show that its disability-related inquiries and requests for examinations are job-related and consistent with business necessity. Disability Guidance at 15-23. Herein, the agency has failed to meet this burden. We conclude that the agency did not <span id="Page_1240"></span>demonstrate that the subsequent medical examinations complainant was required to submit to were job-related or consistent with business necessity. Therefore, the agency has violated the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, an employer may not discipline an employee for failure to comply with an improper request for medical information<span class="Italic">. Watkins v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01981800 (August 29, 2001). Here, the agency imposed the most extreme discipline available to it: removal. To remedy that wrongful removal, we will order complainant's immediate reinstatement together with appropriate additional relief as set forth more fully in the order below.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Grayson v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720080044 (2009) (agency was justified in initial inquiry where complainant filed OWCP claim that he was poisoned at work, but not in continuing inquiries after complainant was cleared for return to duty).</p>
