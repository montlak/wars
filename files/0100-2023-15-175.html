<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-173"><span class="space">16.</span> Rules of Deference</h4>
<p class="noindent">The general rule is that because the administrative judge has the opportunity to directly observe the witness, the credibility determinations of judges are entitled to great weight, <span class="Italic">Parks v. USPS</span>, 01830393 (1983), and the EEOC defers to its judges on questions of credibility. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pittman v. Department of Air Force</span>, 01830550 (1983). The credibility findings of an administrative judge "will not be disturbed unless they are shown to be clearly erroneous." <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Postmaster General</span>, 01880992 (1988) (citing <span class="Italic">Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board</span>, 340 U.S. 474, 494 (1951)). Deference to the credibility determinations of the factfinder "generally is required because 'only the trial judge can be aware of the variations in demeanor and tone of voice that bear so heavily on the listener's understanding of and belief in what is said.'" <span class="Italic">Sayles v. Postmaster General</span>, 01922900 (1993) (quoting <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Bessemer City, N.C.</span>, 470 U.S. 564, 575 (1985)). "Credibility determinations in Title VII actions require even more deference than other findings of fact." <span class="Italic">Juarez v. Department of Justice</span>, 01872114 (1988) (citing <span class="Italic">Wrenn v. Gould</span>, 808 F.2d 493 (6th Cir. 1987)).</p>
<p class="noindent">The deference given to credibility determinations is not automatic. <span class="Italic">See Watkins v. USPS</span>, 01851205 (1987). The EEOC will overrule an administrative judge on a credibility finding when reading of the record as a whole makes it clear the judge misinterpreted some testimony. <span class="Italic">See Pittman, supra</span>. The Commission will not defer when the credibility determination is not based on witness demeanor or conduct, but on evidence of record. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Watkins, supra</span>. This is particularly true where the evidence of record contradicts testimony credited by the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marvin v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01891677 (1989). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0520140092 (2015) (objective evidence contradicted supervisor's testimony judge had found credible).</p>
<p class="noindent">The general rule is that "greater deference is to be given to credibility determinations based on a witness's demeanor and manner of giving testimony. Little deference, if any, need be given to credibility determinations made by [an administrative judge] based on the internal logic or reasonableness of the testimony given." <span class="Italic">Huguely v. Department of Army</span>, 01861204 (1987) (overruling a credibility determination based on the selecting official's affidavit where the official was unavailable at the hearing due to illness).</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the general rule recently has been tempered by the Commission's increased emphasis on giving deference to the factual findings of its administrative judges. See <a href="0100-2023-17-001.html#sec8-1">Chapter 8</a>. Less deference still is granted to credibility findings based on the internal logic or reasonableness of the testimony than credibility findings based on witness demeanor. But, deference will be granted to credibility findings based on factors other than witness demeanor if those findings are consistent with the factual record. For example, in <span class="Italic">Kirkpatrick v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01966520 (1998), the Commission deferred to the judge's credibility findings in a selection case where the judge discredited the testimony of the selecting official because that testimony was vague and the selecting official displayed a "lack of diligence" in trying to locate the selection matrix he contended was central to his selection decision. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Alston v. Postmaster General</span>, 01966417 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">Still, the Commission vacillates on the issue of deference based on the internal consistency of testimony. In <span class="Italic">Whaley v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01963107 (1998), the Commission held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[D]eference is not given automatically, and when there is sufficient evidence of record which suggests that the credibility determinations are erroneous, and especially where, as here, the AJ does not base his credibility determinations on the demeanor of the witnesses, but rather on the evidence of record and/or the internal logic and reasonableness of the testimony given, we will not defer<span class="Italic">. Muller v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900634 (October 12, 1990); <span class="Italic">Lawrence v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01952288 (April 18, 1996). In making the decision not to defer to the AJ's credibility determinations, the Commission finds particularly significant the fact that the supervisor did not testify at the hearing. Therefore, the AJ had no opportunity to personally observe him as a witness and yet credited the supervisor's claim that appellant welcomed his May 1993 sexual advance.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Blanca B. v. Secretary of State</span>, 0120151376 (2016) (a complainant's account of the events must be "sufficiently detailed and internally consistent so as to be plausible").</p>
<p class="noindent">It is truly a mistake for the agency to argue, at the close of the hearing, that the entire case hinges upon credibility determinations, and then to fail to implement a decision because it disagrees with the credibility findings. In <span class="Italic">Gatewood v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01953327 (1997), the Commission upheld the findings of its administrative judge after noting that it was "unnecessary to deal with each and every contention of the agency on appeal because the agency is inappropriately trying to negate the very reason for <span id="Page_536"></span>which our regulations provide for a hearing in the administrative process." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">When a witness is disabled, the administrative judge must be careful not to allow that impairment to affect credibility determinations. In <span class="Italic">Hand v. Department of Army</span>, 03910126 (1991), the Commission overturned the credibility findings of an MSPB administrative judge based on so-called demeanor observations. The MSPB judge found the employee's supervisor was a more credible witness because he "looked his examiners directly in the eye and answered their questions without hesitation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> However, the employee suffered from a hearing impairment, as well as a learning disability. As a result, he gave his testimony through interpreters. The Commission rejected the judge's demeanor observations because it would have been "virtually impossible" under the circumstances for the employee to maintain eye contact and give answers without hesitation.</p>
<p class="noindent">A demeanor determination is not the only factor for an administrative judge to consider in evaluating testimony. For example, in <span class="Italic">Pilot v. Postmaster General</span>, 01914052 (1992), the Commission overruled credibility findings of its administrative judge based on demeanor by analyzing other evidence for inconsistency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Commission has consistently held that credibility determinations require more deference than other findings of fact, it also has stressed that an AJ may not "insulate his (or her) findings from review by denominating them credibility determinations." <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">John F. Fitzhugh v. John O. Marsh, Jr., Secretary, Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01890981 (May 12, 1989), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson v. City of Bessemer City</span>, 470 U.S. 564, 575 (1985). In deciding whether or not to believe a witness, the AJ must consider more than demeanor and inflection; he/she also must look at documents and objective evidence which might contradict the witness's testimony. In addition, the AJ must assess whether the witness's testimony is so internally inconsistent or implausible that it cannot be credited<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ states that the evidence that RO 3 was predisposed to discriminate against Black males is substantial. The AJ refers to the credible testimony of Witness 1 and appellant. (Administrative Judge's Recommended Decision, page 242). In examining all the record evidence and reading the transcript, we did not uncover the substantial evidence that the AJ refers to. The record indicates that Witness 1 and appellant both agreed that the RO 3 treated them unfairly. Witness 1 testified that the climate at the agency was not good. However, Witness 1 also testified that the RO 3 treated everyone unfairly. Finally, in this case, the record indicates that the agency treated appellant identically to other employees who were charged with similar offenses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ also stated that only RO 2 heard the threatening statement "...I'll blow you mother f-ckers away." The AJ states that both the RO 1 and RO 2 reported other factual circumstances that were consistent. The AJ states that the RO 1 did not report any threatening remarks at all initially. Further, the AJ contends that the RO 1 made at least two written statements and testified at the arbitration hearing and on none of those occasions did she mention the above referenced statement. The AJ observed the RO 1 and the RO 2 having luncheon together during a break in the administrative hearing. Prior to the lunch break, the AJ had questioned the RO 2 carefully about the fact that only she had reported the above referenced statement. The RO 1 testified immediately following lunch and for the first time mentioned the statement that the RO 2 had referred to on several prior occasions. The AJ concluded that the RO 1 and RO 2 "discussed their testimony during the lunch break and conspired to give false testimony." (Administrative Judge's Decision, page 246).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ's reliance on the alleged false statement by the RO 1 is misplaced. While, the Commission agrees that the record does not indicate the RO 1 ever mentioning this specific statement prior to the administrative hearing, the record does indicate that the RO 1 referred to threatening statement's by appellant. The point where one specifically worded threat ends and another threatening phrase begins may be difficult of ready ascertainment. However, the Commission does not find that the RO 1 testimony and the RO 2 testimony have startling inconsistencies. RO 1 reports that appellant said I will f-ck you up, you haven't seen any stress yet, just watch, and RO 2 reports that appellant threatened to blow you mother f-ckers away, the undertone of both threats are strikingly similar.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the record does not support the AJ's position in this case. After careful consideration of appellant's contentions, including those contentions which were not explicitly addressed herein, and after carefully weighing the evidence of record, we find that the agency's decision to terminate appellant was unrelated to his sex, race or reprisal.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Rash v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01920012 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Rash v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 05920717 (1993), the Commission overturned the credibility findings of its administrative judge based on its review of the record:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ occupies a unique position with respect to the credibility of witnesses. While the Commission has consistently held that credibility determinations require more deference than other findings of fact, it also has stressed that an AJ may not "insulate his (or her) findings from review by denominating them credibility determinations." <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">John F. Fitzhugh v. John O. Marsh, Jr., Secretary, Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01890981 (May 12, 1989), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson v. City of Bessemer City</span>, 470 U.S. 564, 575 (1985). In deciding whether or not to believe a witness, the AJ must consider more than demeanor and inflection; he/she also must look at documents and objective evidence which might contradict the witness's testimony. In addition, the AJ must assess whether the witness's testimony is so internally inconsistent or implausible that it cannot be credited<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the AJ did not soundly support her credibility judgments with regard to the SO 2's testimony. The AJ reasons that the SO 4 credibly testified that the entire advisory panel formulated the interview questions. The AJ then states that the SO 2 testified that he only saw the questions prior to the first interview. The AJ states that the SO 2 testified that he was responsible for one question. The AJ states that she cannot dismiss as coincidental that the selectee's response to that question was considered superior to the other candidates by the SO 4. Finally, the AJ points to the fact that the SO 2 scheduled the interview times.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that the SO 4 stated that the interview questions were formulated in the morning of the first day of interviews. Therefore, the SO 2's statement that he saw the questions prior to the first interview was truthful. Further, the record indicates that the SO 4 agreed with the SO 2's assessment of the appellant. The SO 4 testified that appellant was "nonresponsive" and "needed to be drawn out," the SO 2 testified that appellant was not "spontaneous" in his responses and did not know how to handle the situation described in the questions. While, the SO 4 testified that the SO 2 scheduled the interviews, which resulted in the appellant interviewing on day one and the selectee on day two, the record does not indicate the scores that the selectee received were of such variance from those received by other candidates to indicate that the selectee had prior knowledge of the interview questions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, there are a number of points in the record which question the merit of the AJ's credibility judgment. The AJ stated that the SO 2 was evasive and untruthful in his testimony regarding whether or not he and the selectee car pooled, as well as elsewhere in his testimony. First, the AJ fails to point to any other evasive or untruthful testimony. Second, the testimony regarding the car pool was confusing but not necessarily evasive or untruthful. The SO 2 stated that he did not car pool with the selectee because the selectee does not have a car. He immediately thereafter testified that he drives the selectee to work and back home, almost everyday. A car pool is defined as "a joint arrangement by a group of private automobile owners in which each in turn drives his own car and carries the other passengers." Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, 1985. Thus, by definition, the SO 2's statement that he was not in a car pool is not only truthful but also accurate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that the record does not support the AJ's position in this case....</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">Rash</span>, a credibility finding by the administrative judge may be rebutted by "an evidentiary showing through documents or other extrinsic evidence that the credibility determination is (1) erroneous, (2) not based on testimonial inferences, or (3) not supported by the record." <span class="Italic">Lindsey v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01982536 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent">It is error for an administrative judge to find that the agency's reasons for a personnel action are "unsubstantiated, speculative, and [do not] hold up under scrutiny," where the administrative judge does not find the testimony of any particular agency witness incredible. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01945789 (1996). In the absence of finding any specific testimony incredible, the administrative judge is merely substituting his judgment for that of the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, it is not error <span class="Italic">per se</span> for a recommended decision to be written by an administrative judge who did not actually hear and see the witnesses. In <span class="Italic">Fausto v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01954447 (1997), the complainant argued that it was legal error for one administrative judge to hear all the witnesses and another to write the decision. The Commission found there was no error because the decision was not based on credibility findings at all, but was based on evaluating the record.</p>
<p class="noindent">The clear trend of the Commission has been toward giving greater deference to the findings of its administrative judges, particularly on factual issues. See Chapter 8, subheading "<a href="0100-2023-17-042.html#sec8-43">Administrative Judge Decision</a>." This does not necessarily mean the Commission will retreat from its earlier case law setting down the rules for deference. Indeed, the problem in the past has been that the Commission set down the rules and, too often, refused to follow them in favor of OFO's own <span class="Italic">de novo</span> factfinding. If anything, the Commission's trend toward greater deference may result in a more even application of its case law.</p>
