<h3 class="h3" id="sec2-55"><span class="space">B.</span> THE COMMISSION'S VIEW BEFORE <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">MORGAN--ANISMAN</span></span></h3>
<p class="noindent">It can be argued, given the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, that the Commission's view of continuing violations has been relegated to the history books. To the extent that <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> categorically rejects the view that the limitations period can be overlooked for discrete acts of discrimination if those past acts are sufficiently connected to a timely complaint, that argument has merit. However, such an argument entirely overlooks the Court's holding that equitable considerations may result in waiver, tolling, or estoppel of the limitation period in cases involving discrete acts. As a result, the Commission's view of continuing violations remains relevant to the extent that it gives substantial insight into the circumstances in which the Commission might set aside the time period for contacting a counselor and accept otherwise untimely claims over discrete acts. It is worth bearing in mind that nothing in the <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> decision affects the Commission's handling of untimely complaints involving a single personnel action. Indeed, <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> reaffirms the Commission's right to set aside the filing period based on equitable considerations. In addition, although <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> severely limits the conditions under which a claim of a continuing violation can be asserted, because of the Court's specific reference to waiver, tolling, and estoppel, it does not entirely preclude such claims.</p>
<p class="noindent">At the Commission level, prior to the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, the continuing violation theory underwent a radical transformation in 2001. That transformation, announced in <span class="Italic">Anisman v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 05A00283 (2001), opened a floodgate for stale claims of discrimination, allowing complainants to reach back over years of perceived discrimination. Prior to <span class="Italic">Anisman</span>, the Commission viewed the continuing violation theory as an application of the equitable tolling doctrine to the statute of limitations for contacting a counselor. There were three critical elements to a continuing violation claim. First, the claim had to involve a series of interrelated incidents or personnel actions. Second, at least one of those incidents or actions had to have taken place within the 45 days immediately preceding contact with the EEO counselor. Third, the complainant reasonably must not have been aware that the incidents or actions were discriminatory until the incident or action that triggered counseling.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Anisman</span>, the Commission dropped the third requirement for establishing a continuing violation. In doing so, the Commission followed a widening trend in the circuit courts of appeals--a trend that was adopted by the Ninth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>. Before discussing <span class="Italic">Anisman</span>, a more general discussion of the development of the continuing violation theory is in order.</p>
<p class="noindent">Early on, in <span class="Italic">Moss v. Department of Navy</span>, 01830357 (1983), the EEOC adopted the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">United Airlines v. Evans</span>, 431 U.S. 553, 97 S. Ct. 1885, 52 L. Ed.2d 571 (1977), for processing allegations of continuing discrimination. "[I]n order to show a continuing violation and to have an otherwise untimely claim of discrimination, be timely, a claim must concern a 'present' alleged violation. A nexus must exist between the present and otherwise untimely claims that evinces a pattern or course of conduct." <span class="Italic">Evans, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Evans</span>, the Supreme Court was confronted with an allegation that the plaintiff was subjected to sex discrimination by a former policy of the airline that prohibited the marriage of flight attendants. In 1968, when the plaintiff married, she was forced to resign her position as a flight attendant. The plaintiff never filed a Title VII claim over her resignation. Later in 1968, the airline entered into a new collective bargaining agreement which abolished the prohibition on marriage for flight attendants. Ultimately, the plaintiff was rehired in 1972, but was not given seniority credit for her previous service. In 1973, plaintiff initiated her Title VII complaint against the airline alleging a "continuing violation" in that the policy of not giving her credit for her previous service discriminated against her in the present. While acknowledging the viability of the continuing violation theory, the Court found there was no "present" violation in <span class="Italic">Evans</span> and that a present violation was a necessary element of the claim. It was not sufficient that the effects of past discrimination continued into the present; there must be an actual present violation for the complaint to be considered timely. Because the Court found there was no present violation, it did not consider what other requirements the doctrine of continuing violations may have.</p>
<p class="noindent">Ultimately, the continuing violation theory does not go to the merits of the complaint--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, whether the agency has actually engaged in discrimination. It relates solely to the issue of timeliness--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, whether there is sufficient justification for setting aside the 45-day requirement of counselor contact in order to address the merits of the underlying claim. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Redfearn v. Secretary of Army</span>, 01961933 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">After <span class="Italic">Evans</span>, several federal appellate courts made it clear that, in addition to establishing a present violation and a nexus with past violations, the Title VII plaintiff must also establish that he or she filed the complaint in a timely fashion after becoming aware of the alleged discrimination. In essence, the courts applied the reasonable suspicion standard, discussed earlier in this chapter under the subheading "<a href="0100-2023-11-020.html#sec2-21">Reasonable Suspicion Standard</a>," to a continuing violation claim. Most notably, <span class="Italic">Sabree v. United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners Local No. 33,</span> 921 F.2d 369 (1st Cir. 1990) and <span class="Italic">Berry v. Board of Supervisors,</span> 715 F.2d 971 (5th Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">cert denied</span>, 479 U.S. 868 (1986), adopted the reasonable suspicion standard for continuing violation claims. Under that interpretation of the continuing violation theory, the plaintiff must file a complaint within the statute of limitations--in the case of federal employees by contacting a counselor within 45 days--once he or she becomes aware, or reasonably should have become aware, that the past acts were allegedly discriminatory.</p>
<p class="noindent">Initially, this was also the position adopted by the Commission. However, the EEOC was inconsistent in applying this requirement to its continuing violation cases, often focusing entirely on the nexus question to the exclusion of the reasonable suspicion standard. Some of the confusion generated by the Commission was because of its failure to identify properly and distinguish between several legal doctrines that either prevent the statute of limitations from running (tolling), set aside the statute of limitations even though it expired (waiver), or bar an agency from asserting the statute of limitations even though the time period has lapsed (estoppel). While the result may be the same under each theory--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, an otherwise untimely complaint is deemed timely--each theory is employed for a different reason. It is important to keep the distinctions clear.</p>
<p class="noindent">In general, the discovery doctrine, which finds its articulation in the reasonable suspicion standard, deals with whether the statute of limitations ever started to run. The rule simply provides that a cause of action does not accrue at the time of the injury, but rather at the time the complainant becomes aware of the injury. The statute of limitations does not begin to run, or is tolled, until that time. In other circumstances, such as the mental incapacitation of the complainant, the doctrine of waiver is used to set aside an expired statute of limitations. At other times, the doctrine of estoppel bars an agency from raising the statute of limitations as a defense for reasons that relate to the agency's conduct. For example, if an agency actively misleads a complainant about her right to file a complaint, the agency should be estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a bar to a late-filed complaint. The result of the Commission's failure to identify properly the doctrines on which it relies in timeliness cases was that it was difficult, if not impossible, to make sense of the Commission's case law on continuing violations.</p>
<p class="noindent">With <span class="Italic">Anisman</span>, the Commission adopted a view that had emerged from some federal appellate courts that the reasonable suspicion standard had no role in determining the existence of a continuing violation claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Morgan v. National Railroad Passenger Corp.,</span> 232 F.3d 1008 (9th Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Zubieta,</span> 180 F.3d 329 (D.C. Cir. 1999). Whatever else can be said of the Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Anisman</span>, one thing was clear--by eliminating the reasonable suspicion standard, the Commission made the continuing violation theory easier to understand and apply.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_77"></span>In <span class="Italic">Anisman</span>, the complainant alleged that, on three occasions, he had not been selected for promotion as the result of discrimination based on sex. The agency dismissed two of the selection allegations as untimely and accepted a third for investigation. OriGINAlly, the EEOC agreed with the agency's disposition of the case. However, on reconsideration, the Commission focused on the complainant's additional allegations that the agency had effectuated his nonselections through discriminatory work assignments and performance appraisals. Rejecting its previous case law that required a complainant alleging a continuing violation to establish that he or she was not previously aware, and should not have been previously aware, that the agency's actions were discriminatory, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Anisman</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Improper Fragmentation of Complainant's Claim</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A claim is an assertion of an unlawful employment practice or policy for which, if proven, there is a remedy under federal equal employment statutes. 3 Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 CFR Part 1614 (EEO-MD-110), as revised (November 9, 1999), at 5-5. In the instant case, the Commission finds that the agency improperly fragmented complainant's claim. The agency first defined and investigated complainant's complaint as challenging one non-selection. The agency later defined the complaint as challenging three separate and distinct non-selections, and then dismissed two of the non-selections for untimely EEO counselor contact. The previous decision affirmed the dismissal. However, based on the factual allegations set forth in complainant's formal complaint, the Commission finds that complainant's complaint should be viewed as stating one on-going unlawful employment practice claim, that is, that the agency failed to promote complainant to a GS-13 level position based on sex. Complainant's numerous factual claims describe the means the agency allegedly used to effectuate the alleged promotion discrimination, including allegedly discriminatory assignments, performance appraisal ratings, application ratings in 1994 and 1995, and the non-selection decision in 1996<span class="Italic">. See</span> EEO-MD-110, Example 3 and Practice Tip at 5-7 (it is critical to understand the exact nature of the complainant's concerns so that the employment practice is defined broadly enough to reflect any allegation of a pattern of ongoing discrimination); <span class="Italic">see also, Lee, et al. v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01990384 (February 23, 2000) (the means by which the agency allegedly accomplished the career advancement discrimination should not be treated as independent claims of discrimination under 29 CFR Part 1614). The allegedly continuing nature of the alleged unlawful employment practice is suggested by complainant's identification of agency officials who were involved in the alleged unlawful employment practice on an on-going basis, including a supervisor who allegedly was responsible for discriminatory assignments and performance appraisal ratings; one official who served on all three selection panels; and another official who served on two of the selection panels. The alleged continuing nature of the alleged unlawful employment practice also is indicated by the allegation that the actions of the identified agency officials were linked by a common discriminatory objective, that is, to help the female tax attorneys to get promoted because of their sex<span class="Italic">. See</span> EEO-MD-110 at 5-8; and "Threshold Issues," Section 2 of the Commission's new Compliance Manual, at 2-74 through 2-76.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Timeliness of Complainant's Continuing Violation Non-Promotion Claim</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining the timeliness of an EEO complaint under Title VII, it is essential to identify precisely the unlawful employment practice about which the complainant has complained<span class="Italic">. Delaware State College v. Ricks,</span> 449 U.S. 250, 257 (1980) (discriminatory denial of tenure claim untimely; no other unlawful employment practice alleged). When determining whether a Title VII plaintiff has alleged a timely continuing violation claim, the emphasis should not be placed on mere continuity<span class="Italic">. United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans,</span> 431 U.S. 553, 558 (1977). The critical question is whether any present violation exists<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> In <span class="Italic">Evans</span>, the Court upheld the dismissal of a civil action because the respondent had not alleged that the challenged seniority system currently operated in a discriminatory manner by treating similarly situated males and females differently<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike the respondent in <span class="Italic">Evans</span>, complainant in the instant case alleged that when he contacted the EEO Counselor, the alleged practice of treating similarly situated male and female Estate Tax Attorneys differently regarding promotions allegedly remained in effect. Complainant also alleged that at least one of the series of allegedly related unlawful acts occurred within the 45-calendar-day period for EEO Counselor contact, that is, complainant's non-selection for a GS-13 Attorney (Estate Tax) vacancy in September 1996. Therefore, the Commission finds that complainant has stated a timely raised continuing violation non-promotion claim which should be processed pursuant to 29 CFR 1614.108 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. In so finding, the Commission expresses no opinion on the merits of the allegedly continuing unlawful employment practice claim<span class="Italic">. See</span> "Threshold Issues," Section 2 of the Commission's new Compliance Manual at 2-77 (the charging party is not required to prove the existence of a discriminatory policy or practice before a charge is accepted for investigation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission cautions that to state a timely raised continuing violation claim, a complainant must do more than allege that he or she has been subjected to a continuing violation. He or she must allege, as did complainant in this case, facts that are sufficient to indicate that he or she may have been subjected to an on-going unlawful employment practice which continued into the 45-day period for EEO counselor contact<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Redmon v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> EEOC Request No. 05991100 (August 25, 2000) (sufficiency of factual allegations where an on-going discriminatory system or policy is alleged); <span class="Italic">see also</span>, <span class="Italic">Cobb v. Department of the Treasury,</span> EEOC Request No. 05970077 (March 13, 1977) (to state a hostile work environment claim it is not sufficient to merely allege that a complainant was harassed).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Reasonable Suspicion</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The previous decision stated that a continuing violation will not be found where the acts complained of are, by themselves, capable of triggering a reasonable suspicion of discrimination. However, since the November 9, 1999 effective date of the changes in the 29 CFR Part 1614 regulations and EEO-MD-110, the Commission has held that evidence showing that a complainant had, or should have had, a reasonable suspicion of discrimination more than 45 days prior to initiating EEO Counselor contact, will not preclude acceptance of an otherwise timely claim of ongoing discrimination<span class="Italic">. Howard-Grayson v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05990160 (December 3, 1999) (improper fragmentation of a continuing violation claim); <span class="Italic">accord</span> <span class="Italic">Treschitta v. Department of Transportation,</span> EEOC Request No. 05990600 (January 13, 2000) (timely hostile work environment claim involving incidents spanning an 18 month period). This holding is directly related to one of the major goals of the revised 29 CFR Part 1614 regulations, that is, to address the problem of fragmentation of unlawful employment practice claims. 64 Fed. Reg. 37,648 (1999). Fragmentation is the breaking up of a complainant's legal claim during the EEO process. EEO-MD-110 at 5-5. Continuing violation claims and harassment claims are especially susceptible to fragmentation in the EEO process, 64 Fed. Reg. 37,648 (1999). Given their on-going nature, they also raise a question as to when a complainant must seek EEO counseling.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When a continuing violation is alleged, the running of the period for initiating a Title VII complaint starts from the most recent occurrence of the alleged discrimination and not from the first occurrence. Conference Report to the Equal Opportunity Act of 1992, Pub. L. No. 92-261, 86 Stat. 103 (1972), (which amended Title VII to, among other things, provide a cause of action for the victims of unlawful employment discrimination by federal agencies), discussed in <span class="Italic">Milton v. Weinberger,</span> 645 F. 2d 1070, 1075 n.14 (D.C. Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">see also</span>, <span class="Italic">Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman,</span> 455 U.S. 363, 381 (1982) (when a complaint challenges not just one incident of conduct violative of the Fair Housing Act, but an unlawful practice that continues into the limitations period, the complaint is timely when it is filed within 180 days of the last asserted occurrence of that practice). Where a challenged violation is a continuing one, any concern about the staleness of a claim disappears<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 380.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Recent decisions by United States Courts of Appeals have held that complainants may seek a remedy for continuing employment discrimination regardless of whether the complainant had prior notice or a reasonable suspicion that his or her rights were being violated<span class="Italic">. Morgan v. National Railroad Passenger Corp. d/b/a/ Amtrak,</span> 232 F.3d 1008, 1014-1018 (9th Cir. 2000)(706 of Title VII); and <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Zubieta,</span> 180 F.3d 329, 337 n.11. (D.C. Cir. 1999)(717 of Title VII). The <span class="Italic">Anderson</span> decision explains that reasonable suspicion is a legal doctrine which permits the equitable tolling of the time limit for initiating the EEO process when a complainant did not, at the time, know or have reason to know that an employment decision was discriminatory in nature<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Where an unlawful employment practice claim is timely raised, however, there is no need to consider whether the time limit should be tolled and, therefore, no need to inquire whether a complainant had prior notice or a reasonable suspicion that his or her rights were being violated<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> For this reason, the Commission's "Threshold Issues" guidance issued on May 12, 2000, at 2-74 through 2-79, does not include "reasonable suspicion" as a factor in determining the existence of a timely-raised continuing violation claim. Instead, the "Threshold Issues" guidance, at 2-81 through 2-82, discusses reasonable suspicion solely as a ground for equitable tolling of the limitations period for filing a charge of discrimination<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Therefore, because complainant in the instant complaint contacted an EEO Counselor within 45 calendar days of an occurrence of the allegedly on-going discriminatory employment practice, his EEO Counselor contact was timely as to that allegedly unlawful employment practice, whether or not he suspected discrimination more than 45-calendar days before his EEO Counselor contact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Earlier decisions by United States Courts of Appeals in other circuits in essence held that the essential inquiry in determining the timeliness of a continuing violation claim is when a complainant first should be held to know that an act of discrimination has occurred<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Sabree v. United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners Local No. 33,</span> 921 F.2d 369 (1st Cir. <span id="Page_78"></span>1990) (inquiry into what the plaintiff knew or should have known at the time of the earlier discriminatory act); and <span class="Italic">Berry v. Board of Supervisors,</span> 715 F.2d 971 (5th Cir. 1983) (the most important factor in determining whether an alleged discriminatory act should be deemed to be part of a continuing violation was whether the act had the degree of permanence which should trigger an employee's awareness of, and duty to, assert his or her rights). Prior to the revisions in the 29 CFR Part 1614 regulations, the Commission cited the <span class="Italic">Sabree</span> and the <span class="Italic">Berry</span> decisions with approval in numerous decisions. However, the <span class="Italic">Sabree</span> and <span class="Italic">Berry</span> holdings are inconsistent with the Commission's goal of furthering the elimination of discriminatory employment practices by ending the fragmentation of unlawful employment practice claims in Federal sector cases. For this reason, consistent with the Commission's practice in private sector cases, and in reliance on the Supreme Court decisions and legislative history cited above, the Commission will follow the <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> and <span class="Italic">Anderson</span> decisions, rather than the <span class="Italic">Sabree</span> and <span class="Italic">Berry</span> decisions, when ruling on the timeliness of continuing violation claims under the revised 29 CFR Part 1614 regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to its outright rejection of <span class="Italic">Sabree</span> and <span class="Italic">Berry</span> and the reasonable suspicion standard, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Yaccarino v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A05735 (2001), gave some indication that it was rejecting the standard. In <span class="Italic">Yaccarino</span>, the administrative judge found that all allegations of a sexually hostile environment that occurred more than 45 days before the onset of counseling were untimely. Without any consideration of the reasonable suspicion standard, the Commission found that allegations reaching back five years before counseling might be timely under the continuing violation theory. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Yaccarino</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons that follow, we find that the FAD must be reversed. We first address whether the AJ appropriately considered the timeliness requirement for EEO counselor contact, with respect to those allegations of sexual harassment prior to October 5, 1998, followed by whether the agency established its affirmative defense, in any event. We finally discuss whether the AJ erred in granting summary judgment to the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Timeliness of EEO Counselor Contact Involving Alleged Incidents Prior to October 5, 1998</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that complainant's claim of sexual harassment with regard to those events at issue which occurred prior to October 5, 1998, must fail as untimely. AJ Decision at 2. Even the agency conceded in its motion to the AJ for a decision without a hearing, that at least complainant's claims from August 30, 1998, were timely, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> 45 days prior to EEO counselor contact. Any stalking from August 30, 1998, forward would thus be timely for purposes of complainant's claim, even in the agency's view.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Significantly, complainant argued that the Postmaster had been stalking her since 1993. Accordingly, complainant has alleged that the Postmaster's conduct was a continuing violation. The Commission has held that the time requirements for initiating EEO counseling could be waived as to certain claims within a complaint when the complainant alleges a continuing violation; that is, a series of related discriminatory acts, one of which fell within the time period for contacting an EEO Counselor. <span class="Italic">See Reid v. Department of Commerce,</span> EEOC Request No. 05970705 (April 22, 1999); <span class="Italic">McGivern v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05901150 (December 28, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A determination of whether a series of discrete acts constitutes a continuing violation depends on the interrelatedness of the past and present acts<span class="Italic">. Berry v. Board of Supervisors of Louisiana State Univ.,</span> 715 F.2d 971, 981 (5th Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 479 U.S. 868 (1986). It is necessary to determine whether the acts are interrelated by a common nexus or theme<span class="Italic">. See Vissing v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,</span> EEOC Request No. 05890308 (June 13, 1989); <span class="Italic">Verkennes v. Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Request No. 05900700 (September 21, 1990); <span class="Italic">Maldonado v. Department of the Interior,</span> EEOC Request No. 05900937 (October 31, 1990). Should such a nexus exist, complainant will have established a continuing violation and the agency would be obligated to "overlook the untimeliness of the complaint with respect to some of the acts" challenged by complainant<span class="Italic">. Scott v. Claytor,</span> 469 F. Supp. 22, 26 (D.D.C. 1978).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Commission recently issued policy guidance on evaluating continuing violations in the EEOC Compliance Manual, Volume I, Threshold Issues at 2 (May 12, 2000). For purposes of a serial continuing violation, complainant must establish: (1) a series of separate but closely related discriminatory acts; (2) a timely event, namely, a discriminatory event or act that occurred within the limitations period; and (3) a link between the discriminatory event occurring within the limitations period and the actions that occurred outside the limitations period.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 2-75 through 2-76.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Neither the AJ nor the agency properly considered whether the matters alleged in the complaint constituted a continuing violation. The continuing violation framework delineated above was not addressed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under a continuing violation theory, it is possible all of complainant's allegations back to 1993 could be justified as timely. We find that complainant has legitimately alleged a continuing violation. In the instant case, the complainant has alleged continuing sexual harassment by the Postmaster. Of course, complainant has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that the allegations were part of a continuing violation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Amft v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01A00571 (2001), the Commission found that a class complaint alleging sex-based wage discrimination constituted a continuing violation and because counseling had been initiated within 45 days of the issuance of the last paycheck under the program, the complainants' entire five-year claim for back wages was timely. The Commission affirmed its decision in <span class="Italic">Amft</span> on reconsideration. <span class="Italic">Amft v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 05A10933 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent">As can be seen from the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, there are reasons for treating differently the situations in <span class="Italic">Anisman</span>, involving discrete personnel actions, <span class="Italic">Yaccarino</span>, involving a hostile environment claim, and <span class="Italic">Amft</span>, involving a systemic violation. It was the Commission's failure to recognize those differences that led directly to its decision in <span class="Italic">Anisman</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even under the Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Anisman</span>, the complainant had to claim a present violation in order to make timely the complaint over past violations. To the extent that the continuing violation theory survives <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, that requirement is still in effect. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Pauley v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 01A02749 (2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining the timeliness of an EEO complaint, it is essential to identify precisely the unlawful employment practice about which the complaint has complained<span class="Italic">. Delaware State College v. Ricks,</span> 449 U.S. 250, 257 (1980) (discriminatory denial of tenure claim untimely; no other unlawful employment practice alleged). When determining whether a Title VII plaintiff has alleged a timely continuing violation claim, the emphasis should not be placed on mere continuity<span class="Italic">. United Airlines, Inc. v. Evans,</span> 431 U.S. 553, 558 (1977). The critical question is whether any present violation exists<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> In <span class="Italic">Evans</span>, the Courts upheld the dismissal of a civil action because the respondent had not alleged that the challenged seniority system currently operated in a discriminatory manner by treating similarly males and females differently<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has established that to state a timely raised continuing violation claim, a complainant must do more than allege that he or she has been subjected to a continuing violation. He or she must allege, as did complainant in this case, facts that are sufficient to indicate that he or she may have been subjected to an on-going unlawful employment practice which continued into the 45-day period for EEO counselor contact<span class="Italic">. See Redmon v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> EEOC Request No. 05991100 (August 25, 2000) (sufficiency of factual allegations where an ongoing discriminatory system or policy is alleged).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When a continuing violation is alleged, the running of the period for initiating a Title VII complaint starts from the most recent occurrence of the alleged discrimination and not from the first occurrence. Conference Report to the Equal Opportunity Act of 1992, Pub. L. No. 92-261, 86 Stat. 103 (1972), (which amended Title VII to, among other things, provide a cause of action for the victims of unlawful employment discrimination by federal agencies), discussed in <span class="Italic">Milton v. Weinberg,</span> 645 F. 2d 10170, 1075 n.14 (D.C. Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">see also</span>, <span class="Italic">Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman,</span> 455 U.S. 363, 381 (1982) (when a complaint challenges not just one incident of conduct in violation of the Fair Housing Act, but an unlawful practice that continues into the limitations period, the complaint is timely when it is filed within 180 days of the last asserted occurrence of that practice).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case at hand, complainant requested that her complaints be consolidated. Complainant stated that she was subjected to a pattern of discrimination since 1996, when she told her supervisor that she was pregnant. Complainant was on approved leave for the birth of her child from July 2, 1996 until January 1997. When she returned to work, her job changed. Complainant stated that she sought counseling upon her return to work and was advised that everything that happened before the pregnancy and after the pregnancy would be considered in the complaint. Complainant argued that when she returned from maternity leave she found that her position was not considered in management's new part-time schedule of her duties. Also, complainant stated that management took the better part of her duties away from her and assigned them to a new employee. Complainant alleged that management completed her performance plan late and that she was therefore not eligible to receive a bonus. Also, complainant argued that since January 1997, she was not allowed to increase her workdays from two days a week to three days a week. Further, complainant alleged that management changed the level of her duties, retired her from the Review Branch, and did not give her new assignments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleged that when she contacted the EEO Counselor, the alleged hostile work environment remained in effect. Furthermore, at least one of the series of allegedly ongoing discriminatory practices alleged by complainant occurred within the 45-calendar day period for EEO Counselor contact, namely the change to the level of her duties. Complainant became aware that her duties changed in January 1997 and she contacted an EEO Counselor on February 24, 1997. Therefore, the <span id="Page_79"></span>Commission finds that complainant has stated a timely raised continuing violation claim which should be processed pursuant to 29 CFR 1614.108.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Divecha v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01A15138 (2002) ("The Commission determines that a continuing violation analysis is not necessary as there are no viable claims that occurred within forty-five days of complainant's initial EEO Counselor contact."); <span class="Italic">Couvertier v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A14434 (2002) (no continuing violation analysis is necessary where no present violation is alleged); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Bauer v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01993219 (2002) (a continuing violation claim is set forth where there is a present violation and a nexus with past violations).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, the complainant must also allege that the past and present violations are interconnected in some way. For example, in <span class="Italic">McGary v. Secretary of Army</span>, 05A00196 (2001), the Commission found that <span class="Italic">Anisman</span> did not require reversal of its previous decision where the acts timely brought to the counselor's attention regarding a five-day suspension were not connected to past acts regarding work assignments and a performance appraisal.</p>
