<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-103"><span class="space">5.</span> Dress and Grooming Standards</h4>
<p class="noindent">In March 2014, the EEOC issued a factsheet entitled "Religious Garb and Grooming in the Workplace: Rights and Responsibilities," available at <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/qa_religious_garb_grooming.cfm">http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/qa_religious_garb_grooming.cfm</a>. According to the factsheet:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Examples of religious dress and grooming practices include wearing religious clothing or articles (e.g., a Muslim hijab (headscarf), a Sikh turban, or a Christian cross); observing a religious prohibition against wearing certain garments (e.g., a Muslim, Pentecostal Christian, or Orthodox Jewish woman's practice of not wearing pants or short skirts), or adhering to shaving or hair length observances (e.g., Sikh uncut hair and beard, Rastafarian dreadlocks, or Jewish peyes (sidelocks)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In most instances, employers are required by federal law to make exceptions to their usual rules or preferences to permit applicants and employees to observe religious dress and grooming practices.</p>
<p class="noindent">The factsheet goes on to explain:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">6.&#x2003;May an employer automatically refuse to accommodate an applicant's or employee's religious garb or grooming practice if it would violate the employer's policy or preference regarding how employees should look?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">No. Title VII requires an employer, once it is aware that a religious accommodation is needed, to accommodate an employee whose sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance conflicts with a work requirement, unless doing so would pose an undue hardship. Therefore, when an employer's dress and grooming policy or preference conflicts with an employee's known religious beliefs or practices, the employer must make an exception to allow the religious practice unless that would be an undue hardship on the operation of the employer's business. Fact patterns illustrating whether or not an employer is aware of the need for accommodation appear below at examples 4-7.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For purposes of religious accommodation, undue hardship is defined by courts as a "more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>" cost or burden on the operation of the employer's business. For example, if a religious accommodation would impose more than ordinary administrative costs, it would pose an undue hardship. This is a lower standard than the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) undue hardship defense to disability accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an exception is made as a religious accommodation, the employer may nevertheless retain its usual dress and grooming expectations for other employees, even if they want an exception for secular reasons. Co-workers' disgruntlement or jealousy about the religious accommodation is not considered undue hardship, nor is customer preference.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">EXAMPLE 4--Exception to Uniform Policy as a Religious Accommodation</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on her religious beliefs, Ruth adheres to modest dress. She is hired as a front desk attendant at a sports club, where her duties consist of checking members' identification badges as they enter the facility. The club manager advises Ruth that the club has a dress code requiring all employees to wear white tennis shorts and a polo shirt with the facility logo. Ruth requests permission as a religious accommodation to wear a long white skirt with the required shirt, instead of wearing shorts. The club grants her request, because Ruth's sincerely held religious belief conflicts with the workplace dress code, and accommodating her would not pose an undue hardship. If other employees seek exceptions to the dress code for non-religious reasons such as personal preference, the employer is permitted to deny their requests, even though it granted Ruth a religious accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Daniel-Bey v. USPS</span>, 01821237 (1983), the Commission found that an <span id="Page_1059"></span>allegation that an employee was not permitted to wear his fez at all times while on-duty did not state a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination based on religion. The Commission found that the employee's religious beliefs did not require that he wear a fez at all times, but only that he keep his head covered at all times. The agency was within its rights, the Commission decided, to require the employee to wear official postal headgear while otherwise in uniform.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A50280 (2005), the Commission reached the opposite conclusion in a Postal Service case involving a kufi--a Muslim headdress. The Commission found that the agency failed to accommodate the complainant when it prohibited him from wearing the kufi, even though he conceded it was not required by his religion. The Commission found that the complainant had a personal <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> belief that wearing the kufi was following the ways of the prophet Mohammad and, therefore, the agency was required to accommodate that practice unless it imposed an undue hardship on the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's Compliance Manual, at Section 12-IV, C, 4, discusses the circumstances in which employees may seek an exception from employer dress and grooming standards:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an employer has a dress or grooming policy that conflicts with an employee's religious beliefs or practices, the employee may ask for an exception to the policy as a reasonable accommodation. Religious dress may include clothes, head or face coverings, jewelry, or other items. Religious grooming practices may relate, for example, to shaving or hair length. Absent undue hardship, religious discrimination may be found where an employer fails to reasonably accommodate the employee's religious dress or grooming practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 47--Facial Hair</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prakash, who works for CutX, a surgical instrument manufacturer, does not shave or trim his facial hair because of his Sikh religious observance. When he seeks a promotion to manage the division responsible for sterilizing the instruments, his employer tells him that, to work in that division, he must shave or trim his beard because otherwise his beard may contaminate the sterile field. When Prakash explains that he cannot trim his beard for religious reasons, the employer offers to allow Prakash to wear two face masks instead of trimming his beard. Prakash thinks that wearing two masks is unreasonable (for reasons unrelated to his religious practice) and files a Title VII charge. CutX will prevail because it offered a reasonable accommodation that would eliminate Prakash's religious conflict with the hygiene rule.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Some courts have concluded that it would pose an undue hardship if an employer was required to accommodate a religious dress or grooming practice that conflicts with the public image the employer wishes to convey to customers. While there may be circumstances in which allowing a particular exception to an employer's dress and grooming policy would pose an undue hardship, an employer's reliance on the broad rubric of "image" to deny a requested religious accommodation may in a given case be considered disparate treatment, including because it is tantamount to reliance on customer religious bias (so-called "customer preference") in violation of Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EXAMPLE 48--Religious Garb</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nasreen, a Muslim ticket agent for a commercial airline, wears a hijab (headscarf) to work at the airport ticket counter. After September 11, 2001, her manager objected, telling Nasreen that the customers might think she was sympathetic to terrorist hijackers. Nasreen explains to her manager that wearing the hijab is her religious practice and continues to wear it. She is terminated for wearing a hijab over her manager's objection. Customer fears or prejudices do not amount to undue hardship. As a result, the airline's refusal to accommodate her and its subsequent decision to terminate her violate Title VII. In addition, if the commercial airline had denied Nasreen the position due to perceptions of customer preferences about religious attire, that would also be disparate treatment based on religion in violation of Title VII, because it would be the same as refusing to hire Nasreen because she is a Muslim. <span class="Italic">See supra</span> &#x00A7; 12 II-B.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There may be limited situations in which the need for uniformity of appearance is so important that modifying the dress code would pose an undue hardship. This issue should be resolved on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's factsheet on Religious Garb and Grooming also addresses the potential conflict between certain religious requirements and the appearance of government endorsement of a religion and safety and security concerns:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">11.&#x2003;Do government agencies whose employees work with the public have to make exceptions to uniform policies or otherwise allow religious dress and grooming practices if doing so would not cause an undue hardship?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Yes. Government agency employers, like private employers, must generally allow exceptions to dress and grooming codes as a religious accommodation, although there may be limited situations in which the need for uniformity of appearance is so important that modifying the dress or grooming code would pose an undue hardship. Therefore, it is advisable in all instances for employers to make a case-by-case determination of any needed religious exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">EXAMPLE 12--Public Employee</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Elizabeth, a librarian at a public library, wears a cross as part of her Catholic religious beliefs. In addition, after church services she attends on Ash Wednesday each year, Elizabeth arrives at work with a black ash mark on her forehead in the shape of a cross, which she leaves on until it wears off. Her new supervisor directs her not to wear the cross in the future while on duty, and to wash off the ash mark before reporting to work. Because Elizabeth's duties require her to interact with the public as a government employee, the supervisor fears that her cross and ash mark could be mistaken as government endorsement of religion in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. He cites the need to avoid any appearance of religious favoritism by government employees interacting with the public, and emphasizes that librarians must be viewed as impartial with respect to any information requests from library patrons. However, because the librarian's cross and ash mark are clearly personal in this situation, they would not cause a perception of government endorsement of religion. Accordingly, accommodating Elizabeth's religious practice is not an undue hardship under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">EXAMPLE 13--Public Employee</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Gloria, a newly hired municipal bus driver, was terminated when she advised her supervisor during new-employee orientation that due to the tenets of her faith (Apostolic Pentecostal), she needs to wear a skirt rather than the pants required by the transit agency dress code. Absent evidence that the type of skirt Gloria must wear would pose an actual safety hazard, no undue hardship would have been posed by allowing this dress code exception, and Gloria's termination would violate Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">12.&#x2003;May an employer bar an employee's religious dress or grooming practice based on workplace safety, security, or health concerns?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Yes, but only if the practice actually poses an undue hardship on the operation of the business. The employer should not assume that the accommodation would pose an undue hardship. While safety, security, or health may justify denying accommodation in a given situation, the employer may do so only if the accommodation would actually pose an undue hardship. In many instances, there may be an available accommodation that will permit the employee to adhere to religious practices and will permit the employer to avoid undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">EXAMPLE 14--Long Hair</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">David wears long hair pursuant to his Native American religious beliefs. He applies for a job as a server at a restaurant that requires its male employees to wear their hair "short and neat." When the restaurant manager informs David that if offered the position he will have to cut his hair, David explains that he keeps his hair long based on his religious beliefs and offers to wear it in a ponytail or held up with a clip. The manager refuses this accommodation and denies David the position because he has long hair. Since David could have been accommodated without undue hardship by wearing his hair in a ponytail or held up neatly with a clip, the employer violated Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">EXAMPLE 15--Facial Hair</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prakash, who works for CutX, a surgical instrument manufacturer, does not shave or trim his facial hair because of his Sikh religious observance. When he seeks a promotion to manage the division responsible for sterilizing instruments, his employer tells him that he must shave or trim his beard because it may contaminate the sterile field. All division employees are required to be clean shaven and wear a face mask. When Prakash explains that he does not trim his beard for religious reasons, the employer offers to allow Prakash to wear two face masks instead of trimming his beard. Prakash thinks that wearing two masks is unreasonable and files a Title VII charge. CutX will prevail because it offered a reasonable accommodation that would eliminate Prakash's religious conflict with the hygiene rule.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">EXAMPLE 16--Facial Hair</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Raj, a Sikh, interviews for an office job. At the end of the interview, he receives a job offer but is told he will have to shave his beard because all office staff are required to be "clean shaven" to promote discipline. Raj advises the hiring manager that he wears his beard unshorn because of his Sikh religious practice. Since no undue hardship is posed by allowing Raj to wear his beard, the employer must make an exception as an accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">EXAMPLE 17--Clothing Requirements Near Machinery</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Mirna alleges she was terminated from her job in a factory because of her religion (Pentecostal) after she told her supervisor that her faith prohibits her from wearing pants as required by the company's new dress code. Mirna requested as an accommodation to be permitted to continue wearing a long but close-fitting skirt. Her manager replies that the dress code is essential to safe and efficient operations on the factory floor, but <span id="Page_1060"></span>there is no evidence regarding operation of the machinery at issue to show that close-fitting clothing like that worn by Mirna poses a safety risk. Because the evidence does not establish that wearing pants is truly necessary for safety, the accommodation requested by Mirna does not pose an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">EXAMPLE 18--Head Coverings That Pose Security Concerns</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A private company contracts to provide guards, administrative and medical personnel, and other staff for state and local correctional facilities. The company adopts a new, inflexible policy barring any headgear, including religious head coverings, in all areas of the facility, citing security concerns about the potential for smuggling contraband, interfering with identification, or use of the headgear as a weapon. To comply with Title VII, the employer should consider requests to wear religious headgear on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the identified risks actually exist in that situation and pose an undue hardship. Relevant facts may include the individual's job, the particular garb at issue, and the available accommodations. For example, if an individual's religious headgear is or can be worn in a manner that does not inhibit visual identification of the employee, and if temporary removal may be accomplished for security screens and to address smuggling concerns without undue hardship, the individual can be accommodated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">EXAMPLE 19--Kirpan</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Harvinder, a Sikh who works in a hospital, wears a small (4-inch), dull, and sheathed kirpan (symbolic miniature sword) strapped and hidden underneath her clothing, as a symbol of her religious commitment to defend truth and moral values. When Harvinder's supervisor, Bill, learned about her kirpan from a co-worker, he instructed Harvinder not to wear it at work because it violated the hospital policy against weapons in the workplace. Harvinder explained to Bill that her faith requires her to wear a kirpan in order to comply with the Sikh code of conduct, and gave him literature explaining that the kirpan is a religious artifact, not a weapon. She also showed him the kirpan, allowing him to see that it was no sharper than the butter knives found in the hospital cafeteria. Nevertheless, Bill told her that her employment at the hospital would be terminated if she continued to wear the kirpan at work. Absent any evidence that allowing Harvinder to wear the kirpan would pose an undue hardship in the factual circumstances of this case, the hospital is liable for denial of accommodation.</p>
