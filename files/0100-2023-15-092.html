<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-93"><span class="space">4.</span> Extension of the Investigative Process</h4>
<p class="noindent">The precise parameters for determining that a case is ripe for summary judgment remain elusive. This is, in large part, due to the fact that the Commission views the hearing as an extension of the investigative process--a fact which complicates the <span class="Italic">Liberty Lobby</span> rule allowing summary judgment in some cases even where there are issues of credibility. In <span class="Italic">Sampson v. Attorney General</span>, 01942844 (1996), the Commission attempted to explain why summary judgment was inappropriate in that particular case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, however, inasmuch as the primary motivations advanced by the agency for appellant's nonselections were unrelated to her objective qualifications and instead concerned the supervision of her fiance and the desire to reward Selectee 2, summary judgment was improper and a hearing was necessary to assess the credibility of the agency's assertions in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As hearings are "part of the investigative process," the Commission believes that error occurred when "the investigation of this complaint ceased, primarily through the [actions] of the Administrative Judge, at the stage just prior to the investigative hearing." <span class="Italic">Jafri v. Securities and Exchange Commission</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910194 (August 12, 1991)<span class="Italic">. See also Moore v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01943038 (May 19, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The factual aspects of this case are simply too unclear and too conflicting to permit a recommended decision without a hearing. The dispute between the parties would benefit from the introduction of live testimony and cross-examination. EEOC Regulations plainly indicate that the hearing is intended as a continuation of the investigatory process. Truncation of this process, while material facts are still in dispute, improperly deprives a complainant of a full and fair investigation<span class="Italic">. Stabler v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910080 (February 21, 1991). Accordingly, we find the AJ erred when he issued a recommended decision without a hearing. The Commission further notes that on remand, the AJ will have discretion as to what is and what is not at issue at the hearing<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.109(c); <span class="Italic">Pedersen v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940339 (February 24, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent">Summary judgment is not appropriate in cases where the record is inadequately developed and/or there are outstanding requests for documents. For example, after reviewing complainant's appeal from summary judgment in favor of the agency in <span class="Italic">Celine B. v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120181289 (2020), the Commission found the record inadequate and requested that the agency provide the complete record. The agency responded only with the ROI. The Commission then requested the full hearing record, and the agency responded with its summary judgment motion. Detailing the missing records, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Celine B</span>. reversed the AJ's summary judgment motion, directed the agency to submit a copy of the compliant file to the EEOC Hearing Unit within 15 days and remanded the case for further development of the record in <span class="Italic">Celine B</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We determine whether the AJ appropriately issued the decision without a hearing. The Commission's regulations allow an AJ to issue a decision without a hearing upon finding that there is no genuine issue of material fact. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(g). EEOC's decision without a hearing regulation follows the summary judgment procedure from federal court. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. The U.S. Supreme Court held summary judgment is appropriate where a judge determines no genuine issue of material fact exists under the legal and evidentiary standards. <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc</span>., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986). In ruling on a summary judgment motion, the judge is to determine whether there are genuine issues for trial, as opposed to weighing the evidence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 249. At the summary judgment stage, the judge must believe the non-moving party's evidence and must draw justifiable inferences in the non-moving party's favor. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 255. A "genuine issue of fact" is one that a reasonable judge could find in favor for the non-moving party. <span class="Italic">Celotex v.

A "material" fact has the potential to affect the outcome of a case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An AJ may issue a decision without a hearing only after determining that the record has been adequately developed. <span class="Italic">See Petty v. Dep't of Def</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 01A24206 (July 11, 2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Issuing a decision without holding a hearing is not appropriate for a case that can only be resolved by weighing conflicting evidence. If the non-moving party "has not had the opportunity to discover information that is essential to his opposition," then a decision without a hearing is inappropriate. <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, 477 U.S. at 250. The AJ must enable the non-moving party to engage in sufficient discovery to respond to a motion for a decision without a hearing. After receiving an opposition to a motion for a decision without a hearing, an AJ may order discovery as necessary. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(g)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We carefully reviewed the record and find it inadequately developed. We note that the Commission obtained a copy of the ROI from the Agency. The copy provided to the Commission included a list of exhibits provided by the Investigator. For items identified as F-11 through F-24 and G-1 through G-6, the Investigator provided a memorandum to the file stating that she had requested these documents from the Agency. The Memorandum indicated that Agency officials stated that they were to provide the documents for inclusion in the ROI. The documents requested by the Investigator included: an organizational chart; the workforce profile; list of subordinates to the Complainant's immediate supervisor, annotated by gender and prior EEO activity for 2013-2015; Complainant's position description; Complainant's performance plan/evaluation for 2013 and 2014, including any supporting documentation and mid-year reviews; Complainant's telework requests and decision notices; copies of Complainant's leave requests at issue in claim 4; copies of detail requests and decisions alleged in claim 4; comparator information regarding performance appraisals, telework, and details; labor agreement/contract that applies to telework and details; the Agency's civil rights/anti-harassment policy; contemporaneous notes kept by the Supervisor; documentation of any other similar allegations of harassment made against the Supervisor and the Agency's response; any response/action taken by the Agency if Complainant reported the alleged harassment before filing this EEO complaint; and documentation of any harassment prevention and sexual harassment training provided to the Supervisor and to Complainant. For each exhibit item, the Investigator created a place holder sheet and noting the item promised by the Agency stating that it was "(Not received from the Agency)."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that the copy of the ROI provided to the AJ also contained the same place holder documents. Complainant indicated that she had tried to obtain a copy of these items during discovery. The Agency only provided a couple of items. Complainant was unable to obtain the remaining documents.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant made the AJ aware of the missing documents. There is no indication that the AJ took any action to resolve the issue of the missing documents. Furthermore, the AJ's decision relied on the Supervisor for proof that the alleged actions were not discriminatory based on Complainant's sex and/or prior protected activity. As the record indicated, the Supervisor retired from the Agency in September 2015. Further, the Investigator provided a memorandum stating that she attempted to contact the Supervisor. However, the Investigator could not obtain evidence from the Supervisor as she did not engage in the investigation. As such, documents such as notes from the Supervisor would be insightful.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, the AJ's issuance of a decision without a hearing was inappropriate. We find that the record has not been adequately <span id="Page_480"></span>developed. There are outstanding requests for documents by the Investigator who indicated that Agency officials were to provide the documents for the ROI.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite the Investigator's follow up contact with the Agency officials, she was never able to obtain these documents. Further, when Complainant sought to obtain the documents to respond to the Agency's ROI, she was denied the documents during discovery. The AJ was made aware of the need for the documents. However, the AJ did not address Complainant's request. Furthermore, the AJ relied on denials by the Supervisor. But the Supervisor did not provide an affidavit or any other evidence to the ROI. Therefore, we find that the record has not been adequately developed for the AJ to have issued a decision on summary judgment.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Ramirez v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01A05786 (2001), the Commission found summary judgment was inappropriate because there was an issue of material fact regarding a recommending official's motivation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case at hand, the AJ's determination that complainant's claim of national origin discrimination was appropriate for summary judgment was erroneous, as this claim involves genuine issues of material fact. In finding no discrimination, the AJ relied on the S1's representations to the interviewing official. Specifically, S1 recommended against hiring complainant because of her manner of using sick leave when she worked for him previously. During the investigation, however, complainant disputed the accuracy of S1's representations. She argued that she did not have a history of leave misuse, that S1 recommended her for a step increase during her tenure under him and never indicated displeasure with her use of leave. She noted that others who worked with her and called in sick without following procedures were nonetheless hired for positions with the agency at later dates. Both the EEO Counselor and the EEO Investigator noted that a copy of complainant's leave history was never made part of the record, such that the dispute between S1 and complainant cannot be resolved by reviewing the record. Moreover, the agency made no attempt to ascertain whether S1 had previously been asked to rate the past performance of applicants and, if so, whether his statements were more favorable for those outside complainant's protected class with similar leave records.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Commission precedent holds that the Commission may examine the allegedly biased motivations of third parties whose recommendations may have tainted the action at issue<span class="Italic">. See Stokes v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01933573 (May 16, 1994), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied, Stokes v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940737 (December 15, 1995). Therefore, even assuming that the interviewing officials were not motivated by discrimination when they failed to hire complainant, but rather based the decision solely on S1's statements, the agency is not necessarily shielded from a finding of discrimination. Accordingly, we find that the dispute over whether S1's statements were motivated by complainant's leave record or her national origin is material.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the hearing process is intended to be an extension of the investigative process, designed to "ensure that the parties have a fair and reasonable opportunity to explain and supplement the record and to examine and cross-examine witnesses." <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Management Directive (MD) 110, as revised, November 9, 1999, Chapter 6, page 6-1; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1614.109(c) and (d). "Truncation of this process, while material facts are still in dispute and the credibility of witnesses is still ripe for challenge, improperly deprives complainant of a full and fair investigation of her claims." <span class="Italic">Mi S. Bang v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01961575 (March 26, 1998)<span class="Italic">. See also Peavley v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950628 (October 31, 1996); <span class="Italic">Chronister v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940578 (April 23, 1995). In summary, the issue of S1's motivation requires an assessment as to the credibility of S1 and complainant, as well as further investigation into complainant's leave history and the leave histories of others for whom S1 served as a reference. Therefore, judgment as a matter of law for the agency should not have been granted as to complainant's claim of national origin discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">In order to determine that there are no material disputes of fact in a case, the administrative judge must ensure that the record is adequately developed. For example, in <span class="Italic">Washington v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A41347 (2005), the Commission found that the judge erred in granting summary judgment without allowing the complainant to conduct discovery where the primary issue in the case was whether the complainant was a qualified individual with a disability, the agency had several examinations of the complainant conducted by physicians and none of the results of those examinations appeared in the record. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Tania O. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120142224 (2016) (a genuine issue of material fact exists where the record contains a dispute as to whether the alleged comparatives were similarly situated to complainant).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Gabriel v. Small Business Administration</span>, 0120073370 (2008), the Commission found that the judge erred in granting summary judgment where two witnesses testified that they had no personal knowledge of the actions at issue, two witnesses who did have personal knowledge were "unavailable" to give statements during the investigation, and an affidavit from one of those witnesses was submitted by the agency in support of its summary judgment motion. The Commission remanded the case for further development of the record at hearing. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Pickerel v. Secretary of Army</span>, 0120073012 (2010) (administrative judge erred in relying on unsworn statement of selecting official).</p>
