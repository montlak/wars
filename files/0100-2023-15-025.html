<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-26"><span class="space">1.</span> Sanctions for Nonhearing-Related Conduct</h4>
<p class="noindent">The powers of an administrative judge to impose sanctions are not limited to conduct that relates to the hearing process. In addition to the power to sanction an agency for an inadequate investigation, discussed above, an administrative judge has the authority to impose sanctions on an agency for other improper conduct in the processing of an EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Graham v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01986987 (2001), the Commission found the judge's authority extended to an agency's failure to cooperate during precomplaint counseling, as well as the investigative stage:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the AJ's recommended remedy, we find, contrary to the FAD, that the AJ may sanction an agency for failure to ensure that its employees cooperate with EEO officials involved in pre-complaint counseling and complaint investigations. In reaching this conclusion, we note that EEOC Regulations provide AJ's with broad discretion in the conduct of hearings and the development of the record, including such matters as discovery orders and the drawing of adverse inferences and other sanctions<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR 1614.109(a) and 1614.109(f)(3); <span class="Italic">see also</span>, <span class="Italic">Ortega v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01956818 (February 5, 1998); <span class="Italic">Malley v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01951503 (May 22, 1997). Moreover, 29 CFR 1614.108(c)(3) states that when an agency's employees fail:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">without good cause shown to respond fully and in timely fashion to.... requests for documents, records, comparative data, statistics, affidavits or the attendance of witness(es) the investigator may note in the investigative record that the decision maker should, or the Commission on appeal may, in appropriate circumstances:...(v) Take such other actions as it deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, 29 CFR 1614.109(f)(3) provides that when an agency's employees act in this manner, the AJ may, in appropriate circumstances, take a variety of actions, including drawing an adverse inference, issuing a decision fully or partially in favor of the opposing party, and taking other such actions as appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case at hand, it is undisputed that supervisors at complainant's facility failed to cooperate with the EEO personnel attempting to resolve and investigate complainant's allegations. The investigator provided specific details as to how S1 and DORW ignored her calls, refused to <span id="Page_451"></span>provide her with necessary information and tried to persuade her to stop the investigation. Commission regulations allow the Commission and/or the Administrative Judge to respond to this kind of behavior with appropriate action<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR 1614.108(c)(3) .109(f)(3). Here, the AJ's decision to order the agency to conduct training for all Federal Highway Administration managers and supervisors and post notices informing employees that they have the right to oppose unlawful employment practices was not an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, an AJ has the authority to impose attorney's fees and costs as a sanction, in appropriate circumstances<span class="Italic">. See Comer v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,</span> EEOC Request No. 05940649 (June 3, 1996) (AJ's award of attorney's fees and costs as sanction affirmed to the extent complainant incurred costs as a result of the agency's bad faith conduct); <span class="Italic">see</span> also Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 CFR Part 1614 (EEO-MD-110) (November 9, 1999) at 11-11. To the extent that the agency's failure to cooperate in the counseling and investigation process resulted in the incurrence of attorney's fees and costs for complainant, the agency must reimburse these costs, as ORDERED below. Moreover, complainant is also entitled to reasonable attorney's fees incurred in connection with the instant appeal, but only to the extent that such fees pertain to the scope of the sanctions recommended by the AJ<span class="Italic">. See Stull v. Department of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01942827 (June 15, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent">The validity of <span class="Italic">Comer</span> and <span class="Italic">Stuhl</span> were called into question by a January 2003 memorandum from the Department of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel, discussed below in the section on "<a href="0100-2023-15-122.html#sec6-120">Discovery Sanctions</a>." In <span class="Italic">Waller v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0720030069 (2007), the EEOC rejected the opinion of the Department of Justice and held that the Commission did have the authority to issue attorney fees and costs as a sanction. <span class="Italic">Waller</span> is also discussed fully below.</p>
<p class="noindent">Sanctions are not warranted, however, for an inadequate investigation where the agency makes a good faith effort to comply with the order of the administrative judge to conduct a supplemental investigation. For example, in <span class="Italic">Steen v. Secretary of Army</span>, 07A20033 (2003), the Commission found the administrative judge abused his discretion in imposing sanctions on the agency when he ordered a supplemental investigation, but did not oversee that investigation. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Steen</span> held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission's regulations afford broad authority for the conduct of hearings by Administrative Judges<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 C.F.R. 1614.109; <span class="Italic">Rountree v. Department of Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A00015 (July 13, 2001). The Commission's regulations provide, in relevant part, that a party which "fail[s] without good cause shown to respond fully and in timely fashion to an order of an administrative judge, or requests for the investigative file" may be subject to the imposition of one of several sanctions, including "a decision fully or partially in favor of the opposing party." 29 C.F.R. 1614.109(f)(3)(iv); <span class="Italic">see</span> also <span class="Italic">DaCosta v. Department of Education,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01995992 (February 25, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before sanctions are imposed, the Commission requires the AJ to issue notice to the offending party that makes clear that sanctions may be imposed and the type of sanction that could be imposed, unless the party can show good cause for its failure to comply<span class="Italic">. See Rountree,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>; Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive (MD-110) for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614, as revised, November 9, 1999, at 7-7, fn. 4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, sanctions must be tailored in each case to appropriately address the underlying conduct of the party being sanctioned<span class="Italic">. See Hale v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A03341 (December 8, 2000). A sanction may be used to deter the non-complying party from similar conduct in the future, as well as to equitably remedy the opposing party<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> If a lesser sanction would suffice to deter the conduct and to equitably remedy the opposing party, an AJ may be abusing his discretion in imposing a harsher sanction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the question turns on whether the agency has demonstrated good cause for its failure to comply with the order of July 12, 2001. The record establishes that the agency made reasonable efforts to comply with the order, including talking by phone with the NYDO AJ about whether it should continue trying to complete the investigation, given that 180 days had elapsed since complainant filed his formal complaint, and attempting to speak with the WFO Supervising AJ about the same issue. Further, the tragedy of September 11, 2001 and the temporary closing of the responsible agency office intervened. Moreover, we note that the July 12 order at issue here specifically stated that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Complaint files must be forwarded even where there has been no investigation or there is an incomplete investigation. The Administrative Judge will supervise development of the record through the parties' use of discovery and/or through the Administrative Judges' orders for the production of documents and witnesses. MD-110, Chapter 7, Section III(b). The Administrative Judge may require the Agency to bear the costs of the Complaint's discovery, including attorney's fees, or impose other sanctions as appropriate because the agency has failed to complete its investigation timely as required by 29 C.F.R. 1614.108(e) or has failed to investigate the claims adequately pursuant to MD-110, Chapter 6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency did as ordered, and forwarded the incomplete complaint file. It was then the responsibility of the AJ to oversee further supplementation of the record, which did not occur. 29 C.F.R. 1614.109(a). Given this set of circumstances, we are persuaded that the agency has shown good cause for its failure to timely comply with the July 12, 2001 order in its entirety and that the imposition of default judgment as a sanction in the instant case was improper and constituted an abuse of discretion under the record before us.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Kramer v. Attorney General</span>, 07A10108 (2003), the Commission found the administrative judge abused his discretion in imposing sanctions on the agency for failing to produce a report of investigation where none existed. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Kramer</span> found the judge's order was unclear and that the agency had complied to the extent that it produced the complaint file without a report of investigation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On December 22, 1999, the AJ assigned to the instant case issued an Order to the agency to produce a complaint file within fifteen days of the date of receipt of the Order. The case was then reassigned to another AJ in April 2000, however no report of investigation had been supplied by the agency. On April 28, 2000, the new AJ held a telephone conference with the parties, during which agency counsel stated that no investigation had ever been initiated in the instant case. The AJ then issued a written Order requiring the agency to show good cause why it had failed to comply with the December 22, 1999, Order and why a default judgement against it should not be entered.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response to the April 28, 2000, Order to Show Cause, the agency contended that sanctions were neither warranted nor appropriate as it had in fact complied with the original Order. The agency stated that on February 3, 2000, a complaint file had been produced, although that file did not contain a report of investigation. The agency further argued that the Order stated it was the AJ's intent to supervise the development of the record if there was no report of investigation. The AJ found the agency's arguments to be untenable as he found the December 1999 Order stated that the agency must provide "a copy of the complaint file, including the report of investigation for the above complaint," and that failure to provide the requested materials would allow the AJ to issue sanctions including a default judgement for the complainant. (Notice of Hearing Request and Order Directing Agency to Produce Complaint File, December 22, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon his finding that the agency had failed to comply with the December 22, 1999, Order, and its failure to complete a report of investigation in the instant complaint, the AJ drew an adverse inference in favor of complainant, thereby entering a default judgment finding discrimination, and found that complainant was entitled to remedial relief. Following this Order of Imposition of Sanction, a partial hearing on damages was held on February 12, 2001. At the conclusion of the hearing, the AJ issued a decision finding that complainant was entitled to non-pecuniary damages in the amount of $5,000. In its final order, the agency rejected the AJ's decision and in so doing initiated the instant appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the agency asks the Commission to reject the AJ's decision to impose sanctions, and contends that the default judgment was improper as the agency had complied with the December 1999 Order. The agency further argues that it never received notice that it had not complied with the Order until the AJ issued the Order to Show Cause, and that the December 1999 Order contained language which indicated that if no investigation had been initiated, the AJ would serve to supervise the development of the record. The agency contends that it did show good cause as to why a report of investigation did not exist and, therefore, the AJ should not have entered default judgment against it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, as to the issue of sanctions, the Commission's regulations afford broad authority for the conduct of hearings by Administrative Judges. 29 C.F.R. 1614.109 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>.; <span class="Italic">Rountree v. Department of Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A00015 (July 13, 2001). Additional guidance can be found in EEO MD-110, 7-9. When a complainant or agency fails to comply with an AJ's order, an AJ may take action against the noncomplying party pursuant to 29 C.F.R. 1614.109(f)(3), up to and including issuing a decision in favor of the opposing party. Before sanctions are imposed, the Commission requires the AJ to issue an order to the offending party that makes clear that sanctions may be imposed and the type of sanction that could be imposed for failure to comply with an order unless the party can show good cause for that failure<span class="Italic">. See Rountree</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. A showing that the noncomplying party acted in bad faith is not required<span class="Italic">. See Cornell v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01974476 (November 24, 1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the matter before us, we find that the Administrative Judge improperly granted default judgment in complainant's favor. In reaching this conclusion, we note that the record does not establish that the agency failed to comply with the December 1999 Order requesting the complaint file. In its appeal brief, the agency argues that while the Order <span id="Page_452"></span>did state that the agency was required to provide a copy of the report of investigation, the Order also addressed what actions should be taken in a circumstance when no investigation had been completed, such as in the instant case. We concur with this reading of the Order. Paragraph four of the Order states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Complaint files must be forwarded even where there has been no investigation or there is an incomplete investigation. The Administrative Judge will supervise development of the record through the parties' use of discovery and/or through the Administrative Judge's orders for the production of documents and witnesses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">MD-110 Chapter 7 Section III(b). From the language of this paragraph it appears that the agency complied with the Order by providing a copy of the complaint file to the parties. Further, the agency was not alerted to the fact that the AJ considered the complaint file inadequate until the telephonic conference of April 28, 2000, and the AJ never directly ordered the agency to produce a report of investigation. As such, we find that the AJ's issuance of a default judgment in favor of complainant was unwarranted. We, therefore, vacate the AJ's finding of discrimination, and remand this complaint for a hearing in accordance with the Order below.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720080018 (2008), the Commission reversed the judge's imposition of sanctions on the agency for failure to investigate where the transfer of TSA from the Department of Transportation resulted in confusion and the acceptance of the case was delayed. The Commission found, under those circumstances, that the failure to conduct the investigation was excusable. It also noted that the agency had offered to have the case remanded for investigation, but the judge declined, ordered the parties to engage in discovery, and then held a hearing without resolving the discovery disputes. On remand, the Commission ordered the agency to submit the case to the hearing unit with the "complaint file" within 15 days. The administrative judge again imposed an adverse inference on the agency because the complaint file did not include a report of investigation. Again, in <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, the Commission reversed the imposition of sanctions against the agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the Commission held that the AJ erred in imposing a sanction for failure to issue a report of investigation, stating:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The AJ's decision to sanction the agency in the instant case was flawed on several fronts. First, the record fails to reflect that TSA had violated any order of the AJ. There is no indication that the agency was ever "ordered" to conduct an investigation in the instant matter.... Indeed, [the AJ] expressly found that the agency had adequately justified its failure to timely issue an "acceptance" letter. As the agency explained, the acceptance letter is the triggering event in the investigation of an EEO complaint. Most compellingly, regarding the appropriateness of sanctioning the agency for failure to investigate, the record indicates that the AJ <span class="Italic">specifically declined</span> TSA's August 2004 invitation to accept a remand for the purpose of investigating complainant's claim of disability discrimination (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also concluded that the hearing should not have been held considering the inadequate state of the evidentiary record. We found as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">At the hearing, the inadequacy of the evidentiary record and complainant's inability to present his case were obvious. Complainant was frequently unable to formulate questions without interjecting his own testimony into the question. As a result, he adduced virtually no evidence that went to his entitlement to the protections of the Rehabilitation Act. Despite his responsibility to insure that the record specifically addressed the pertinent elements of complainant's claim (in light of his <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status), the AJ tolerated major gaps in the evidentiary record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of our conclusion that the evidentiary record required further development, we remanded the matter, including the following standard order:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The agency shall submit to the Hearings Unit of the appropriate EEOC field office the request for a hearing within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date this decision becomes final. <span class="Italic">The agency is directed to submit a copy of the complaint file to the EEOC Hearings Unit within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date this decision becomes final.</span> The agency shall provide written notification to the Compliance Officer at the address set forth below that the complaint file has been transmitted to the Hearings Unit. Thereafter, the Administrative Judge shall issue a decision on the complaint in accordance with 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109 and the agency shall issue a final action in accordance with 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.110 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the text of the decision contained the following instructions:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">On remand, the AJ must resolve all outstanding discovery issues. He should further identify the evidence needed to supplement the record in light of the nature of complainant's claim and the agency's defense thereto. The appropriate party should be required to submit such supplemental evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On remand, complainant's case was reassigned to the AJ who had conducted the initial hearing. Despite our explicit instructions, the AJ resolved none of the outstanding discovery issues. Nor did he identify the additional evidence needed to supplement the record. Instead, he imposed a sanction upon the agency for failure to comply with our order to submit a copy of the complaint file to the EEOC Hearings Unit within 15 calendar days. The AJ reasoned that because a complaint file must include a Report of Investigation and because the agency failed to produce an ROI, the agency was in violation of our order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The sanction took the form of a factual finding by the AJ as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">the complainant is perceived disabled as a sanction for the agency's lengthy and unreasonable delay of approximately five months in providing the investigative file to the complainant and the Administrative Judge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ's decision is in direct contravention of our earlier decision in this case. The unmistakable meaning of our decision was that the agency's failure to issue a Report of Investigation was excusable under the circumstances and could not form a valid basis for sanctioning the agency. We placed the onus of supplementing the record, in the first instance, on the AJ by requiring him to resolve all outstanding discovery disputes and to identify any additional evidence needed to complete the record. In light of this, the agency acted reasonably in forbearing from any additional investigation until the AJ had done what we had ordered him to do.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the foregoing, we must set aside the AJ's decision and remand this matter for further proceedings. We direct that, on remand, this matter be assigned to a different AJ. On remand, the AJ must resolve all outstanding discovery issues. He/she should further identify the evidence needed to supplement the record in light of the nature of complainant's claim and the agency's defense thereto. The appropriate party should be required to submit such supplemental evidence.</p>
