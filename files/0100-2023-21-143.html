<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-133-1"><span class="space">9.</span> Microaggressions</h4>
<p class="noindent">Discriminatory harassment is not always immediately obvious. When the frequency ramps up into routine, even every day, "low-level", subtle or insensitive slights that relate to one's protected status the behavior can be considered "microaggressions." The severity of any one comment alone does not rise to the level of harassment, but the cumulative effect of these microaggressions can.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Anne G. v. Veterans Affairs,</span> 2022003036 (2022), is a great example where the Commission found race-based harassment against a black female when coworkers called her "girl," asked her to play a slave in a "living museum," suggested that they serve kool aid and fried chicken at a Juneteenth event and committed other microaggressions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For incident 2, Complainant alleged that the Program Manager, who was white, referred to her as "girl" on multiple occasions in 2018, implying she was considered a child or less than a woman. Complainant asserted the Program Manager did not similarly refer to her white colleagues as "girl." The Commission has found that calling an employee "boy" was racial harassment. <span class="italic">See McAllister v. Dep't of Defense,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01945248 (Mar. 1, 1996), <span class="italic">request for recon. denied,</span> EEOC Request No. 05960416 (May 22, 1997). Similarly, we find that the use of the term "girl" was harassment based on Complainant's race/color.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding allegation 4, Complainant alleged the Case Manager referenced a "lynching" during a meeting. The Commission has found that a comment about "lynching" is objectively hostile and related to race due to the past role of lynching in African American history; and it is sufficiently severe to alter the conditions of Complainant's employment and create an abusive work environment. <span class="italic">See Jay C. v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 2021000763 (Aug. 2, 2022). The evidence shows that sometime after the "lynching" remark, the Case Manager also stated during another meeting that they should give a veteran "enough rope to hang himself" during a discussion of his ability to live independently. We also find that Complainant's claim that a coworker confused her with another Black woman is reasonably based on her race/color.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For allegation 5, Complainant averred that she was asked to participate in an event for a Juneteenth celebration and play the role of a slave for a "living museum." Complainant stated that she was asked to do so in an email sent by an EEO Manager, and she alleged that she felt "forced" to participate. We note that the EEO Manager did not provide an affidavit for this complaint, but Complainant's account is unrebutted by the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the planning of the Juneteenth event, someone suggested that they serve red "kool aid" and fried chicken, which Complainant found offensive. <span class="italic">Id.</span> The Associate Director explained that she conducted online research about food to celebrate Juneteenth and read about strawberry soda. A participant responded that the Associate Director should not believe everything on the internet and another participant explained the meaning of strawberry soda and fried chicken in African American culture. The Associate Director apologized for her question, and said she realized that her attempt to understand Juneteenth food was offensive to some. It is undisputed that the Associate Director's comments about red "kool aid" or soda and fried chicken were based on stereotypes associated with African Americans. As such, we find that the allegations related to the Juneteenth program were based on Complainant's race/color.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_945"></span>On June 23, 2020, the EEO Program Manager led a "Courageous Conversations" meeting to discuss current events. Complainant reported that an employee started yelling the n-word and began cursing during the call. The Commission has found that this term is an unambiguous racial epithet and a "pure anathema to African Americans." <span class="italic">See</span> EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 15, "Race and Color Discrimination," No. 915.003 (Apr. 19, 2006) (<span class="italic">quoting Spriggs v. Diamond Auto Glass,</span> 242 F.3d 179, 185 (4th Cir. 2001)); <span class="italic">see also Brooks v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> EEOC Request No. 05950484 (Jun. 25, 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For incident 6, the Housing Specialist clarified that it was the Team Lead, not the Program Manager, who made the comment about Complainant's lisp, and denied anyone made a comment about Complainant's weight or negative comments about her appearance or intelligence. Complainant explained that she suffered from Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis, which affected her speech and made it appear as if she has a speech impediment with some flare-ups. Accordingly, we find that Complainant established that she was subjected to harassment based on disability when the Team Lead made a comment about Complainant’s lisp.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In looking at the totality of the circumstances, we find that Complainant's workplace was permeated with discriminatory ridicule, insult and microaggressions by multiple Agency employees that, in cumulative effect, were sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment for Complainant that altered the conditions of her employment. <span class="italic">See Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Serv., Inc.,</span> 523 U.S. 75, 81 (1998); <span class="italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.,</span> 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding liability, with regard to harassment by coworkers, an agency is responsible for acts of harassment in the workplace where the agency (or its agents) knew or should have known of the conduct, unless it can show that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action. EEOC's Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors (June 18, 1999). <span class="italic">See Jones v. Dep't of Labor,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A41672 (Oct. 22, 2004). What corrective action is appropriate and effective will necessarily depend on the particular facts of the case. <span class="italic">See Larae S. v. Dep’t of Justice,</span> EEOC DOC 0120143209 (Mar. 9, 2017). When an agency initiates corrective action that only has a temporary or partial impact on the alleged harassment that action is insufficient to establish an affirmative defense. Instances where an agency takes some type of corrective action, but the harassment reoccurs, are considered evidence of the agency's failure to take appropriate corrective action. <span class="italic">See Lemons v. Dep't of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120081287 (Apr. 23, 2009) (harassment escalated after the agency took remedial action), <span class="italic">citing Logsdon v. Dep't of Agriculture,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A40120 (Feb. 28, 2006) (taking only some remedial action does not absolve the agency of liability where that action is ineffective).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, in sum, we conclude that Complainant has established that she was subjected to discriminatory racial harassment in violation of Title VII that was ineffectively addressed by Agency management, resulting in Agency liability for its failure to protect Complainant from the harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Case Manager made the "lynching" comment in September 2018 in the Program Manager's presence, and as such, the Program Manager was aware of the complained of conduct. While the Chief responded that the Program Manager spoke with the Case Manager, we find that it was not sufficiently corrective since the Case Manager made the "rope" comment subsequently in September 2019. The Case Manager attempted to explain that the "rope" comment was made in the context of a veteran's ability to live independently, but we find that her reference to "rope" was troubling based on her past use of "lynching." Complainant also averred that she first reported harassment to the EEO Manager, starting with the "lynching" comment in 2018. The Agency provided no evidence that the EEO Manager exercised reasonable care to address Complainant's concerns starting in 2018.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the "Courageous Conversations" incident, we find that the Agency conducted a fact-finding and initiated the Employee's removal within one week of the incident. A Human Resources Officer testified that the fact-finding did not substantiate the Employee's use of the n-word because only two witnesses, out of fifteen, reported hearing it. However, they determined that the Employee's comments regarding Black-on-Black violence were inappropriate for the workplace, and began the process of terminating the employee. The employee resigned, effective June 30, 2020, prior to receiving the termination notice. These actions on the part of the Agency were appropriate with regard to removing the Employee from the workplace. However, the fact that the incident occurred at all supports Complainant's allegation of an ongoing hostile work environment and her claim that previous management efforts to address it had not been effective.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding incident 6, the Chief conducted a fact-finding upon notification of the incident by Complainant. The Agency took no corrective action against the Team Lead because she had transferred to another facility in June 2019, prior to the Agency's fact-finding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the remaining incidents of harassment, we find that they were not made by coworkers, and an employer is subject to vicarious liability for harassment when it is created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee. <span class="italic">See Burlington Industries, Inc., v. Ellerth,</span> 524 U.S. 742 (1998); Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775 (1998). However, where, as here, the harassment does not result in a tangible employment action the agency can raise an affirmative defense, which is subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence, by demonstrating: (1) that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassing behavior; and (2) that complainant unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the agency or to avoid harm otherwise. <span class="italic">See Burlington Industries, supra; Faragher, supra;</span> Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (June 18, 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that the Program Manager was Complainant's first-line supervisor at the time of events, and Complainant provided unrebutted testimony that she repeatedly corrected the Program Manager when she called Complainant "girl." Further, we find that Complainant acted properly when she addressed the matter directly with the Program Manager, and she did not fail to take advantage of corrective opportunities. As such, we find that the Agency is liable for the "girl" comments made by the Program Manager.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employer may be subject to vicarious liability for harassment by a supervisor who does not have actual authority over the employee, if the employee reasonably believed that the harasser had such power. However, if the harasser had no actual supervisory power over the employee, and the employee did not reasonably believe that the harasser had such authority, then the standard of liability for coworker harassment applies. <span class="italic">See Marielle L. v. Social Security Admin.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120162299 (Mar. 29, 2018). We note that Complainant is also a Special Emphasis Program Manager (SEPM), and the request that she act as a slave for a Juneteenth program came from the EEO Manager. We find that it was reasonable for Complainant to believe that the EEO Manager had supervisory authority to "force" Complainant to participate in the program as part of her duties as an SEPM.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The comments regarding the food related to the Juneteenth program were made by the Associate Director of the Kansas City Medical Center. While the Associate Director averred that she was not in Complainant's line of supervision, she appears to be a high-ranking official based on her reporting directly to the Medical Center Director. <span class="italic">Id.</span> The Commission has recognized the "alter ego" theory, in which an agency is liable for unlawful harassment whenever the harasser is of sufficiently high rank to be treated as the organization's proxy. <span class="italic">See Scarlet M., Maxima R., Sharolyn S. v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120150940, 0120150941, 0120151220 (Apr. 13, 2016); <span class="italic">Sebek v. Dep't of Justice,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A00005 (Mar. 8, 2001). Here, we find that it is appropriate to apply the alter ego theory of liability based on the Associate Director's position at the Agency, and that the Agency is liable for harassment when the Associate Director commented that they should consider serving red "kool aid" or strawberry soda and fried chicken.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In summary, we find that Complainant did not establish that she was subjected to unlawful harassment based on her disability or religion, or in reprisal for prior EEO activity. However, we find that she established liability for hostile work environment harassment based on race/color when she was called "girl"; she was subjected to comments related to "lynching" and "ropes"; she was subjected to racially insensitive/epithets at a work meeting; she was "forced" to act as a slave in a Juneteenth program; and she was subjected to comments related to the Juneteenth celebration that were based on racial stereotypes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Agency took some corrective action, this piecemeal effort was insufficient to address the severe or pervasive comments based on race/color, and a more systemic approach is needed. The Commission has found that training for all employees should not be ordered unless there is evidence of a broad culture of discrimination. <span class="italic">See Marjorie L. v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720170028 (Nov. 16, 2017); <span class="italic">Joey B. v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0720160023 (Dec. 21, 2016). Here, we find that the multiple employees in the program were responsible for the harassing conduct and appear to have freely made statements perpetuating racial stereotypes and used "lynching" and racially insensitive or insulting language during meetings at work. As such, we order the Agency to conduct sensitivity training to all employees in the Homeless Program (Behavioral Health) at the Kansas City Medical Center as part of the remedies.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x2026;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">January 31, 20232. Within 90 days of the date this decision is issued, the Agency shall provide at least four (4) hours of interactive EEO sensitivity training to all employees in the Homeless Program (Behavioral Health) at the Kansas City Medical Center, with an emphasis on microaggressions and insensitivity towards race and color. The EEO Manager, the Associate Director, and the Case Manager6 shall be included in the training.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_946"></span>Not all microaggressions rise to the level of harassment. In <span class="italic">Kelsie T. v. Postmaster General,</span> 2021004654 (2021), the Commission did not find harassment where a coworker said "Bye, Felicia" to the black, female complainant. </p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant alleged that on various dates, she was harassed by co-workers when she was sent demeaning emails, and that they made derogatory racial remarks. Complainant stated that she received an email dated June 3, 2020, from the Operations Support Specialist (Caucasian, white, female) which ended with the phrase "Bye Felicia."2 In addition, Complainant stated that on June 28, 2020, she received an email from the Operations Support Specialist that indicated that "I would appreciate it if the next time I call your phone and you are at work, that you would answer." Finally, Complainant claimed that on July 23, 2020, the Operations Support Specialist sent her a two-page email, also addressed to five other co-workers. Complainant perceived that she was being singled out for an alleged lack of contribution to the day-to-day Operations Support process. She felt the email was belittling to her and that her co-workers were included on it for additional humiliation. During the investigation into the complaint, the Operations Support Specialist confirmed she sent these emails, but denied she intended to offend Complainant. However, she admitted she should not have ended one of the emails with "Bye Felicia."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S1 stated that Complainant did not report the incidents involving the Operations Support Specialist until a meeting he held in mid-August 2020 with her. S1 stated that he had a discussion with the Operations Support Specialist and asked her to be more careful and professional in her communications, including with Complainant. Complainant did not indicate that she experienced further harassing incidents after this discussion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the image which emerges from considering the totality of the record is that there were conflicts and tensions with the Operations Support Specialist that left Complainant feeling aggrieved. However, the statutes under the Commission's jurisdiction do not protect an employee against all workplace personality conflicts or microaggressions. <span class="italic">See Bouche v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01990799 (Mar. 13, 2002). <span class="italic">See also Jackson v. City of Killeen,</span> 654 F.2d 1181, 1186 (5th Cir. 1981) ("Title VII is not a shield against harsh treatment at the workplace; it protects only in instances of harshness disparately distributed. The essence of the action is, of course discrimination."). Discrimination statutes prohibit only harassing behavior that is directed at an employee because of his or her protected bases. Here, the preponderance of the evidence does not prove that the Operations Support Specialist, in the communications identified by Complainant, was motivated by discriminatory animus. While the term "Bye Felicia" may be mean-spirited and unprofessional, there is no indication that its single use was racially motivated. Management appears to have promptly counseled the Operations Support Specialist about her communications upon learning of it from Complainant, and there is no indication that the alleged harassment continued. Complainant's claim of harassment is precluded based on our findings that she failed to establish that any of the actions were motivated by her protected bases. <span class="italic">See Oakley v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01982923 (Sept. 21, 2000).</p>
