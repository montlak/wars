<h3 class="h3" id="sec13-44"><span class="space">K.</span> DRESS CODES AND GROOMING STANDARDS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Dress code regulations that require different dress standards for males and females do not violate Title VII, <span class="Italic">per</span> <span class="Italic">se</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Arnold v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01883085 (1988) <span class="Italic">(</span>citing <span class="Italic">Fountain v. Safeway Food Stores, Inc.</span>, 555 F.2d 753 (9th Cir. 1977)). In <span class="Italic">Arnold</span>, the agency required men to wear ties and jackets <span id="Page_1018"></span>for identification photos, although no specific requirements were placed on women other than they be "neatly attired." The Commission found that "[a]s long as dress requirements are equally enforced and equivalent with respect to the burden imposed, no Title VII violation exists." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In many cases involving dress codes, the Commission made a distinction between dress requirements that merely relate to appearance and dress requirements that affect the ability to perform a job. Mere appearance is not considered a term or condition of employment. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Sites v. Postmaster General</span>, 01913740 (1991) (holding that an employee who alleges she is not permitted to wear shorts in hot weather while similarly situated employees are permitted to wear shorts has raised a complaint over a term or condition of employment because it related to her ability to comfortably perform her job).</p>
<p class="noindent">An employer may establish a dress code with different standards for men and women to create a proper decorum or neat and professional atmosphere without violating Title VII. Because clothing fashions for men and women differ, the agency may require, in line with current fashion, that only male employees wear neckties to create the proper decorum without violating Title VII. <span class="Italic">See Serratt v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01960322 (1996). Likewise, a policy that requires males, but not females, to have short hair does not violate Title VII. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tavora v. New York Mercantile Exchange</span>, 101 F.3d 907 (2nd Cir. 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">A complainant who alleges that her supervisor directed her to act in a "feminine manner" and dress appropriately stated a claim for relief based on sex discrimination. <span class="Italic">Knight v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01940992 (1994). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Shedd v. Secretary of Transportation,</span> 0120073132 (2007), the Commission found that the agency improperly dismissed a complaint where the complainant alleged that he was ordered to dress in more masculine colors and that female employees were not similarly instructed. Rejecting the agency's reliance on dress codes cases that permit agencies to establish different standards for men and women, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Shedd</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its final agency decision, dated June 14, 2007, the agency determined that complainant's complaint was comprised of the following claim:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[Was complainant] discriminated against based on his sex (male) when [he was] told on April 20, 2007, that [his] green pants were inappropriate business casual attire under the new dress code, while similarly situated female employees were not bound by the color of their pants?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency dismissed complainant's complaint for failure to state a claim. Specifically, the agency stated that "the Commission has held that "an employer may establish a dress code with different standards for men and women to create a proper decorum or neat and professional atmosphere without necessarily violating Title VII."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency improperly dismissed complainant's complaint. The Commission determines that the agency improperly framed complainant's claim solely as a dress code issue; rather, we find that complainant is alleging that he was instructed by management to dress and conduct himself in a more masculine manner. The record contains a copy of complainant's formal complaint. Therein, complainant states that "Area Manager told me that I was not following the dress code because my pants [were] not considered a boy color.... When asked for a color chart of what colors that guys couldn't wear, he stated that there were too many and guys would be judged on a case by case basis. When the Area Manager first informed me that I couldn't wear those pants because I was a guy, I asked [him] if a female could wear this color. He said that they could and that they were not bound by colors."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also contains a copy of the EEO Counselor's Report. Therein, according to the EEO Counselor, complainant stated that he has been reprimanded several times based on the colors that he was wearing. In addition, complainant stated that the Area Manager made a special trip to his work area to see how he was dressed. Furthermore, complainant stated that he "had to go out and repurchase clothing that is of the right 'gentlemanly' color." Based on the foregoing, we find that complainant has stated a claim. <span class="Italic">See Knight v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01940992 (July 14, 1994) (complainant alleging that supervisor told her to dress and conduct herself in a more feminine manner states a claim).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Beard v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120081092 (2008), the Commission found that the complainant stated a claim of sex discrimination where he alleged that he was told his bleach-dyed Mohawk was unprofessional and detracted from the agency's image and that only women should be allowed to dye their hair; that he could not wear men's Capri pants while women were allowed to wear Capri pants; and that he could not wear sandals while women were allowed to wear similar footwear. The Commission found that the gist of the complaint was that the complainant was being instructed to dress in more masculine manner.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">White v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01A55076 (2005), the Commission found that a complaint that men were required to wear a business suit or a sport coat and dress slacks and women were required to dress professionally failed to state a claim. The Commission held that the complainant failed to allege any personal harm.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Quintana v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/01A33412.txt">01A33412</a> (2004), the Commission found it was not discrimination for the agency to order the complainant not to wear Western attire and to wear business clothes such as a tie and jacket where the complainant was a visible representative of the government and a professional appearance was important.</p>
<p class="noindent">Grooming standards remains an area where an agency essentially can legally discriminate between the sexes. For example, in <span class="Italic">Hall-Harwood v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01942956 (1995), the Commission affirmed its stance that an agency can prohibit males from wearing earrings in situations where it permits females to wear earrings. The Commission continues to reach this conclusion based on what appears to be a faulty analysis. The Commission used the following analysis in <span class="Italic">Hall-Harwood</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant's allegation constitutes a claim of disparate treatment in employment which is properly analyzed under the three-tier order and allocation of proof as set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the AJ and the agency that appellant clearly established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of sex discrimination by showing that an agency policy prohibited males from wearing earrings in certain situations that females were allowed to wear earrings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also agree that the agency articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its policy. As noted above, the Assistant Agent and the Agent testified that appellant's wearing an earring in certain situations would be unprofessional and adversely affect the agency's ability to perform its mission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, under the last tier of the scheme, we reject the AJ's reasoning and determine that appellant has not met his ultimate burden of proving that sex discrimination occurred.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established in the Federal Courts of Appeal that different grooming standards for men and women such as hair length requirements for females and not for females, do not constitute sex discrimination under Title VII because they pertain to mutable characteristics which can be readily changed by the affected individual<span class="Italic">. See Willingham v. Macon Telegraph Publishing Co.</span>, 507 F.2d 1084 (5th Cir. 1975). Moreover, the Commission has stated that appearance related issues involving mutable characteristics other than hair length, such as the wearing of earrings by males, would be subjected by the Courts to the same legal analysis and conclusion that they do not constitute prohibited sex discrimination under Title VII. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 619.7.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has adopted this guidance in its appeal decisions in Federal sector cases. In <span class="Italic">Henderson v. Frank, Postmaster General, United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Docket No. 05910228 (April 11, 1991, the Commission determined that the agency's policy prohibiting males from wearing earrings in certain situations did not violate Title VII. Later, in <span class="Italic">Charles v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01932731, the Commission followed the <span class="Italic">Henderson</span> decision and found no sex discrimination when the agency ordered appellant not to wear an earring when delivering mail. As noted by the agency, the Commission, in <span class="Italic">Charles</span>, determined that minor sex-based distinctions in dress and grooming codes are not violations of Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find nothing in the facts of appellant's case which might lead us to veer from the clearly established precedent on the issue before us. The agency's policy prohibiting appellant from wearing earrings in certain situations, and discouraging certain other grooming patterns, was within the Agency's discretion to enforce. As in <span class="Italic">Henderson</span> and <span class="Italic">Charles</span>, we find that the agency's differences in the dress standard for men and women, particularly with respect to males not wearing earrings in certain situations, are, in this case, minor and based on a mutable characteristics. Therefore, we find that no violation of Title VII occurred.</p>
<p class="noindent">The problem with the Commission's analysis is in the application of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> to this situation. <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> is an analysis to be applied where there is no direct evidence of discrimination. See Chapter 10 under the heading "<a href="0100-2023-19-101.html#sec10-94">Standard of Proof</a>." Here, the agency freely admits that its sole criterion for the earring rule is sex--that is, it applies a different rule to males because they are males. It is absurd to have the agency set forth a "legitimate, nondiscriminatory" reason in this case and to have the complainant attempt to show it is pretextual. The agency's reason in this case is blatantly discriminatory. The facts present a case of direct evidence of discrimination that should be analyzed under <span class="Italic">Price-Waterhouse</span>. Under the <span class="Italic">Price-Waterhouse</span> analysis, once a complainant proves, through direct evidence, that discrimination is a motivating factor in a personnel action, the agency must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it would have taken the same action even absent discrimination. Clearly, the agency in <span class="Italic">Hall-Harwood</span> or any similar grooming standards case could not make such a showing. Thus, grooming standards would fall under the appropriate analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent">Perhaps, ultimately, it is wise that, as a society, we accept different grooming standards for males and females. However, the Commission should render an honest analysis in these cases. The real rationale has nothing to do with the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis and the failure of the complainant to prove discrimination. Rather, it has to do with an exception the Commission and <span id="Page_1019"></span>the courts have carved for grooming standards. Both the Commission and the courts would do well to simply acknowledge that fact and work on better defining the basis of the exception instead of confusing the issue with discussions of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has held that "an employer may establish a dress code with different standards for men and women to create a proper decorum or neat and professional atmosphere without necessarily violating Title VII." <span class="Italic">See Bowles v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120071380 (2007), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Baker v. Postmaster General</span>, 05910402 (1991); <span class="Italic">White v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 01A55076 (2005). In <span class="Italic">Bowles</span>, the Commission found the complainant's allegation that he was subjected to national origin and sex discrimination when he was not allowed to wear a kilt to work failed to state a claim. However, in <span class="Italic">Vidas v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120071403 (2007), the Commission upheld the agency's dismissal for failure to state a claim of an allegation that the complainant was discriminated against on the basis of sex when he was ordered to go home and change his kilt for more appropriate male attire. But, the Commission reversed the agency's dismissal of a claim that subsequently the complainant was harassed by management officials after wearing the kilt with such comments as "something must be wrong with you if you spend $200 on a dress," "you don't actually go anywhere while you are wearing that do you?" and "do you wear that when you're out with your wife?." In <span class="Italic">McArthur v. Secretary of Transportation</span>, 0120071658 (2010), the Commission found that the complainant, an air traffic controller, failed to state a claim when he alleged that he was initially told to take annual leave to go home and change when he showed up for work wearing a kilt. Another manager intervened and told the complainant he would not have to go home and change, but was never to wear a kilt to work again or he would be considered insubordinate and appropriate action would be taken. The Commission upheld dismissal of the complaint finding that the possibility of future harm was too speculative to state a claim for relief.</p>
