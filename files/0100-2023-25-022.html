<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-23"><span class="space">3.</span> Reverse Age Discrimination</h4>
<p class="noindent">The EEOC's position has been that a valid claim lies for so-called "reverse age discrimination" where a younger employee, who is 40 years of age or older, alleges that he or she has received less favorable treatment than an older employee. In <span class="Italic">General Dynamics Land Systems v. Cline</span>, 124 S. Ct. 1236 (2004), the Supreme Court categorically rejected that position and held that the ADEA is designed to protect older workers against discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to <span class="Italic">Cline</span>, the Commission consistently adhered to the position that it is possible to discriminate among protected employees by favoring the older of the two. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1625.2(a). In <span class="Italic">Garrett v. Postmaster General</span>, 01960422 (1997), the Commission, specifically relying on its own regulation, held that a provision giving seniority to the eldest of employees with the same length of services violated the ADEA:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1988, the agency's collective bargaining agreement was amended to include tie breaker provisions for Rural Carrier Associates Relevant to this case was a provision that "earliest date of birth" should be used to establish seniority between two employees with the same length of service. At the time this provision was adopted, appellant was 34 years old and Comparative A was 38 years old. However, the provision was not applied to appellant and Comparative A at this time, and management continued to treat appellant as the more senior employee based on her examination score. Finally, in 1994, the union raised the matter with the Rome, Georgia Postmaster, and, on October 1, 1994, appellant's seniority standing was adjusted, pursuant to the tie-breaker provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, to reflect that Comparative A, as the older employee, had the greater seniority. As a result, Comparative A, based on her greater seniority, was given the auxiliary route which had been worked by appellant prior to that date.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On July 19, 1995, the AJ issued a recommended decision without a hearing, pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.109(e), concluding that the evidence of record supported a finding that appellant had been discriminated against on the basis of her age when her seniority standing was adjusted on October 1, 1994. The AJ found that the provision of the collective bargaining agreement which used age as a tie-breaker in determining seniority violated the Commission's regulations which interpret the ADEA.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1625.2(a). Moreover, the AJ found that simply because the practice in question was contained within a seniority system did not protect it from challenge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a final decision dated September 22, 1995, the agency rejected the findings and conclusions of the AJ, and entered a finding of no discrimination. It is from this decision that appellant now appeals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After a careful review of the record in its entirety, the Commission finds that the AJ's recommended decision sets forth the relevant facts and properly analyzes the appropriate regulations, policies and laws. As the AJ correctly noted, the Commission's interpretive regulation, at 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1625.2(a), specifically states:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;It is unlawful in situations where this Act applies, for an employer to discriminate in hiring or in any other way by giving preference because of age between individuals 40 and over. Thus, if two people apply for the same position, and one is 42 and the other 52, the employer may not lawfully turn down either one on the basis of age, but must make such decision on the basis of some other factor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plain language of this regulation appears to apply squarely to the instant matter, and works to prohibit the use of age as a seniority tie-breaker in this case. While the tie-breaker provision in question benefits the older employee, the Commission's regulation provides protection from age discrimination to both the older and younger individual who fall within the ambit of the ADEA. The Commission, and its AJ, recognize that at least one Circuit court has differed with our regulation<span class="Italic">. See Hamilton v. Caterpillar Incorporated</span>, 966 F.2d 1226 (7th Cir. 1992). However, because the EEOC is the primary agency charged with the implementation of the ADEA, its interpretation of that statute is entitled to great deference<span class="Italic">. See generally Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 2782-82 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission upheld this position in <span class="Italic">Tucker v. Postmaster General</span>, 05980851 (1999). In <span class="Italic">Tucker</span>, the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that appellant, a Rural Carrier Associate (RCA), filed a formal complaint of age discrimination (date of birth 10/9/53) when another employee (date of birth 1/30/48) was placed ahead of him on the seniority list on March 3, 1995. Appellant and the comparative employee were both hired by the agency on December 31, 1988, as RCAs. It was undisputed that at the time, and for six years thereafter, appellant was placed above the comparative employee on the seniority list, due to the fact that his entrance test scores were higher. In 1995, the agency learned that its seniority list was improper, in that, the standings of appellant and the comparative were inverted. According to the National Agreement for Rural Carriers, when all other factors are equal, the "tie-breaker" for determining seniority was the earliest date of birth. After an investigation of the complaint, appellant requested a hearing before an EEOC Administrative Judge (AJ). The AJ issued a recommended decision finding no discrimination. The agency later adopted the AJ's decision as its final agency decision, and appellant thereafter submitted his appeal to the Commission. The previous decision, finding that the agency's actions were a<span class="Italic"> per se</span> violation of Section 15 of the ADEA, reversed the final agency decision, and remanded the matter for a determination of an appropriate remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Tucker</span>, went on to find that it would not grant the agency's motion for reconsideration:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, with respect to the contention of both the agency and the Union that an adverse ruling could result in a disruption of the assignments of RCAs and substantially impact mail service in the United States, we do not find that a violation of the ADEA should be allowed to continue merely because of speculation about the consequences that an adverse ruling could have. We note in this regard that neither the agency nor the Union presented any evidence that would support their contention. The Commission is confident that the agency can fashion an alternate tie-breaker that will not violate the laws against employment discrimination and which will protect our nation's mail service. In order to provide the agency with sufficient time to negotiate a "tiebreaker," the Order below provides the agency 120 days within which to negotiate an alternate "tie breaker."</p>

<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Cline</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, a collective bargaining agreement between General Dynamics and the United Auto Workers eliminated health benefits to subsequently retired employees unless those employees were at least 50 years of age. The plaintiffs, who were between the ages of 40 and 50, brought suit under the ADEA alleging "reverse age discrimination." Justice Souter, writing for the majority in <span class="Italic">Cline</span>, found:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The common ground in this case is the generalization that the ADEA's prohibition covers discriminat[ion]...because of [an] individual's age," 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 623(a)(1), that helps the younger by hurting the older. In the abstract, the phrase is open to an argument for a broader construction, since reference to "age" carries no express modifier and the word could be read to look two ways.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This more expansive possible understanding does not, however, square with the natural reading of the whole provision prohibiting discrimination, and in fact Congress's interpretive clues speak almost unanimously to an understanding of discrimination as directed against workers who are older than the ones getting treated better.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress chose not to include age within discrimination forbidden by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, &#x00A7; 715, 78 Stat. 265, being aware that there were legitimate reasons as well as invidious ones for making employment decisions on age. Instead it called for a study of the issue by the Secretary of Labor, <span class="Italic">ibid.</span>, who concluded that age discrimination was a serious problem, but one different in kind from discrimination on account of race. The Secretary spoke of disadvantage to older individuals from arbitrary and stereotypical employment distinctions (including then-common policies of age ceilings on hiring), but he examined the problem in light of rational considerations of increased pension cost and, in some cases, legitimate concerns about an older person's ability to do the job. Wirtz Report 2. When the Secretary ultimately took the position that arbitrary discrimination against older workers was widespread and persistent enough to call for a federal legislative remedy,<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, at 21.22, he placed his recommendation against the background of common experience that the potential cost of employing someone rises with age, <span id="Page_1452"></span>so that the older an employee is, the greater the inducement to prefer a younger substitute. The report contains no suggestion that reactions to age level off at some point, and it was devoid of any indication that the Secretary had noticed unfair advantages accruing to older employees at the expense of their juniors. Congress then asked for a specific proposal, Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1966, &#x00A7; 606, 80 Stat. 845, which the Secretary provided in January 1967. 113 Cong. Rec. 1377 (1967);<span class="Italic"> see also</span> Public Papers of the Presidents, Lyndon B. Johnson, Vol. 1, Jan. 23, 1967, p. 37 (1968) (message to Congress urging that [o]pportunity...be opened to the many Americans over 45 who are qualified and willing to work.). Extensive House and Senate hearings ensued.<span class="Italic"> See</span> Age Discrimination in Employment: Hearings on H. R. 3651 <span class="Italic">et al.</span> before the General Subcommittee on Labor of the House Committee on Education and Labor, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967) (hereinafter House Hearings); Age Discrimination in Employment: Hearings on S. 830 and S. 788 before the Subcommittee on Labor of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967) (hereinafter Senate Hearings). <span class="Italic">See generally</span> <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Wyoming,</span> 460 U.S. 226, 229. 233 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The testimony at both hearings dwelled on unjustified assumptions about the effect of age on ability to work. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> House Hearings 151 (statement of Rep. Joshua Eilberg) (At age 40, a worker may find that age restrictions become common.... By age 45, his employment opportunities are likely to contract sharply; they shrink more severely at age 55 and virtually vanish by age 65.);<span class="Italic"> id.,</span> at 422 (statement of Rep. Claude Pepper) (We must provide meaningful opportunities for employment to the thousands of workers 45 and over who are well qualified but nevertheless denied jobs which they may desperately need because someone has arbitrarily decided that they are too old.); Senate Hearings 34 (statement of Sen. George Murphy) ([A]n older worker often faces an attitude on the part of some employers that prevents him from receiving serious consideration or even an interview in his search for employment.). The hearings specifically addressed higher pension and benefit costs as heavier drags on hiring workers the older they got. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> House Hearings 45 (statement of Norman Sprague) (Apart from stereotypes, labor market conditions, seniority and promotion-from-within policies, job training costs, pension and insurance costs, and mandatory retirement policies often make employers reluctant to hire older workers.). The record thus reflects the common facts that an individual's chances to find and keep a job get worse over time; as between any two people, the younger is in the stronger position, the older more apt to be tagged with demeaning stereotype. Not surprisingly, from the voluminous records of the hearings, we have found (and Cline has cited) nothing suggesting that any workers were registering complaints about discrimination in favor of their seniors. Nor is there any such suggestion in the introductory provisions of the ADEA, 81 Stat. 602, which begins with statements of purpose and findings that mirror the Wirtz Report and the committee transcripts<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>, &#x00A7; 2. The findings stress the impediments suffered by older workers...in their efforts to retain...and especially to regain employment,<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, &#x00A7; 2(a)(1); the [burdens] of arbitrary age limits regardless of potential for job performance,<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, &#x00A7; 2(a)(2); the costs of otherwise desirable practices [that] may work to the disadvantage of older persons, <span class="Italic">ibid.;</span> and the incidence of unemployment, especially long-term unemployment[, which] is, relative to the younger ages, high among older workers,<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, &#x00A7; 2(a)(3). The statutory objects were to promote employment of older persons based on their ability rather than age; to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment; [and] to help employers and workers find ways of meeting problems arising from the impact of age on employment<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>, &#x00A7; 2(b). In sum, except on one point, all the findings and statements of objectives are either cast in terms of the effects of age as intensifying over time, or are couched in terms that refer to older workers, explicitly or implicitly relative to younger ones. The single subject on which the statute speaks less specifically is that of arbitrary limits or arbitrary age discrimination. But these are unmistakable references to the Wirtz Report's finding that [a]lmost three out of every five employers covered by [a] 1965 survey have in effect age limitations (most frequently between 45 and 55) on new hires which they apply without consideration of an applicant's other qualifications. Wirtz Report 6. The ADEA's ban on arbitrary limits thus applies to age caps that exclude older applicants, necessarily to the advantage of younger ones.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Such is the setting of the ADEA's core substantive provision, &#x00A7; 4 (as amended, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 623), prohibiting employers and certain others from "discriminat[ion]...because of [an] individual's age, whenever (as originally enacted) the individual is at least forty years of age but less than sixty-five years of age," &#x00A7; 12, 81 Stat. 607. The prefatory provisions and their legislative history make a case that we think is beyond reasonable doubt, that the ADEA was concerned to protect a relatively old worker from discrimination that works to the advantage of the relatively young.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor is it remarkable that the record is devoid of any evidence that younger workers were suffering at the expense of their elders, let alone that a social problem required a federal statute to place a younger worker in parity with an older one. Common experience is to the contrary, and the testimony, reports, and congressional findings simply confirm that Congress used the phrase "discriminat[ion]...because of [an] individual's age" the same way that ordinary people in common usage might speak of age discrimination any day of the week. One commonplace conception of American society in recent decades is its character as a "youth culture," and in a world where younger is better, talk about discrimination because of age is naturally understood to refer to discrimination against the older. This same, idiomatic sense of the statutory phrase is confirmed by the statute's restriction of the protected class to those 40 and above. If Congress had been worrying about protecting the younger against the older, it would not likely have ignored everyone under 40. The youthful deficiencies of inexperience and unsteadiness invite stereotypical and discriminatory thinking about those a lot younger than 40, and prejudice suffered by a 40-year-old is not typically owing to youth, as 40-year-olds sadly tend to find out. The enemy of 40 is 30, not 50.<span class="Italic"> See</span> H. R. Rep. No. 805, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 6 (1967) ("[T]estimony indicated [40] to be the age at which age discrimination in employment becomes evident."). Even so, the 40-year threshold was adopted over the objection that some discrimination against older people begins at an even younger age; female flight attendants were not fired at 32 because they were too young, <span class="Italic">ibid</span>.<span class="Italic"> See also</span> Senate Hearings 47 (statement of Sec'y Wirtz) (lowering the minimum age limit "would change the nature of the proposal from an over-age employment discrimination measure."). Thus, the 40-year threshold makes sense as identifying a class requiring protection against preference for their juniors, not as defining a class that might be threatened by favoritism toward seniors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The federal reports are as replete with cases taking this position as they are nearly devoid of decisions like the one reviewed here. To start closest to home, the best example is <span class="Italic">Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins,</span> 507 U.S. 604 (1993), in which we held there is no violation of the ADEA in firing an employee because his pension is about to vest, a basis for action that we took to be analytically distinct from age, even though it would never occur without advanced years<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>, at 611.612. We said that "the very essence of age discrimination [is] for an older employee to be fired because the employer believes that productivity and competence decline with old age,"<span class="Italic"> id.,</span> at 610, whereas discrimination on the basis of pension status "would not constitute discriminatory treatment on the basis of age [because t]he prohibited stereotype [of the faltering worker] would not have figured in this decision, and the attendant stigma would not ensue,"<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, at 612. And we have relied on this same reading of the statute in other cases. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., O'Connor</span>, 517 U.S., at 313 ("Because the ADEA prohibits discrimination on the basis of age...the fact that a replacement is substantially younger than the plaintiff is a...reliable indicator of age discrimination."); <span class="Italic">Western Air Lines, Inc. v. Criswell,</span> 472 U.S. 400, 409 (1985) ("[T]he legislative history of the ADEA...repeatedly emphasize[s that] the process of psychological and physiological degeneration caused by aging varies with each individual."). While none of these cases directly addresses the question presented here, all of them show our consistent understanding that the text, structure, and history point to the ADEA as a remedy for unfair preference based on relative youth, leaving complaints of the relatively young outside the statutory concern. The Courts of Appeals and the District Courts have read the law the same way, and prior to this case have enjoyed virtually unanimous accord in understanding the ADEA to forbid only discrimination preferring young to old. So the Seventh Circuit held in <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span>, and the First Circuit said in <span class="Italic">Schuler</span>, and so the District Courts have ruled in cases too numerous for citation here in the text. The very strength of this consensus is enough to rule out any serious claim of ambiguity, and congressional silence after years of judicial interpretation supports adherence to the traditional view.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Court in <span class="Italic">Cline</span> went on to reject several alternative rationales suggested by the plaintiff and the <span class="Italic">amicus</span> EEOC.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission has since relied on <span class="Italic">Cline</span> to hold that "the ADEA does not allow for claims of reverse discrimination." <span class="Italic">Miller v. Postmaster General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a54558.txt">01A54558</a> (2005) (dismissing claim that employees over 50 were treated more favorably than younger employees).</p>
<p class="noindent">In August 2006, the Commission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for its ADEA regulations at 29 CFR Part 1625. 71 Fed. Reg. 46177--46180 (August 11, 2006). Specifically, in light of <span class="Italic">Cline</span>, the Commission proposes to amend 29 CFR 1625.2 to read:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an individual in any aspect of employment because that individual is 40 years old or older, unless one of the statutory exceptions applies. Favoring an older individual over a younger individual because of age is not unlawful discrimination under the Act, even if the younger individual is at least 40 years of age.</p>
