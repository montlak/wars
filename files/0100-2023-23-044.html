<h3 class="h3" id="sec14-44"><span class="space">E.</span> CASE LAW ANALYSIS UNDER THE ADAAA</h3>
<p class="noindent">Because of the caseload backlog at the Office of Federal Operations, as well as the amount of time that it takes cases to get through the agency process and the hearing process if a hearing is requested, case law under the ADAAA was slow to develop.</p>
<p class="noindent">Eight years after its passage, <span class="Italic">Dania S. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 0120142114 (2016), was the first substantive case decided by the Commission under the ADAAA. In that case, the agency denied the complainant's hardship request for reassignment to Connecticut in order to care for her son. Despite the denial, she still moved to Connecticut only to find that the lengthy commute aggravated her disabilities. She renewed her hardship request with the agency, but this time disclosed her disabilities:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">She wrote that her commute was now three hours each way, submitted documentation of the large rail road expense, and wrote this caused extreme financial hardship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant wrote above that she was diagnosed with tendonitis of her Achilles tendon, that she was referred for physical therapy, wore a CAM walker boot to prevent further injury, was diagnosed with partial epilepsy which have caused seizures, and had vertigo, and has encountered various medical problems which make her commute more complicated. She indicated that she visited the emergency room in the past week with a dizzy spell, and wrote that the commute posed a medical risk. She submitted medical documentation showing that in 2001 she visited a doctor complaining of recurrent vertigo and an episode of syncope (fainting), on an unknown date was treated for vertigo and prescribed medication for dizziness, was treated for vertigo in June 2009 for which she missed work, had a diagnosis of vertigo and dizziness in August 2009, and had [imaging] in September 2012, of her Achilles tendon which indicated mild [tendonitis] of the Achilles tendon with accompanying mild to moderate Achilles peritendinitis, mild Haglund deformity and developing enthesopathy at the Achilles attachment, and mild retrocalcaneal bursitis.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency again denied her hardship request. Next, she submitted a reasonable accommodation request for a reassignment to Connecticut, explaining how the commute aggravated her conditions and attached more medical documentation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A medical report by a physician indicated that Complainant visited him on July 19, 2012, complaining of leg pain with moderate severity in both legs, right worse than left, with radiating pain to the right leg and cramping, with symptoms of a year. The report showed Complainant was 5 feet tall and weighed 265 pounds. In reviewing symptoms, the physician indicated that Complainant was negative for vertigo and weakness, and positive both for comfort and ability to conduct usual activities. His examination showed full muscle strength, normal bones and joints and coordination. In September 4, 2012, notes, Podiatrist 1 or someone from his practice wrote that Complainant was complaining of right post heel pain, moved the past weekend and aggravated her foot, there was pain upon palpitation of the heel radiating up the Achilles, and she had a right post heel spur. He noted Complainant was waiting for authorization for a CAM--presumably insurance authorization. On December 4, 2012, Podiatrist 2 wrote that Complainant was being treated for acute Achilles tendonitis secondary to overuse, which was exacerbated by increased weight bearing and ambulation. He opined that her daily commute was having a negative impact on her injury, and requested as accommodation a change in her workplace location to reduce her commute. Podiatrist 1 wrote on December 4, 2012, that he was treating Complainant for chronic Achilles [tendonitis] of the right foot, and immobilization was required for approximately two months along with physical therapy. He recommended minimal walking. On December 4, 2012, Podiatrist 2 referred Complainant for physical therapy two to three times weekly for her right Achilles Tendonitis. Paperwork showed she was scheduled for physical therapy appointments from December 11, 2012 through February 1, 2013, on a frequent basis. In addition, on December 4, 2012, Complainant's Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) wrote she had worsening chronic vertigo, and advised her to relocate her job closer to home.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency's Reasonable Accommodation Coordinator denied her request, concluding that the complainant did not have a disability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding Complainant did not have a disability in the denial letter, the Agency wrote that while Complainant's DO wrote on December 4, 2012, that she had chronic vertigo, it was unclear from his brief note whether and to what extent it limits any major life activities, and Complainant's physician wrote before that Complainant denied vertigo, weakness, and inability to conduct usual activities. Regarding Complainant's foot, the Agency wrote that while Podiatrist 1 termed the issue as chronic, Podiatrist 2 wrote it was an acute injury, recommended treatment with immobilization and minimal walking for two months which has passed and his documentation did not reveal a limitation beyond this period. Further, the Agency referred to Complainant's prior physician report documenting normal bones and joints. The Agency wrote that while Podiatrist 2 recommended a reduction in Complainant's commute time and that commuting had a negative impact on her injury, this was unclear and no time period was mentioned. The Agency also wrote therein that even if Complainant was eventually determined to have a disability, an employer is not required to accommodate an employee's choice of commuting method or where to live.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant lodged an EEO complaint alleging the agency discriminated against her based on her race, disability, and age when it denied her hardship requests and reasonable accommodation request. The agency found no discrimination, concluding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the theory of reasonable accommodation for issue 2, the Agency found that Complainant failed to establish a nexus between her medical conditions and the accommodation she requests--a transfer to get a shorter commute. The Agency explained that Complainant chose to move to a location with a six hour round trip commute from the Boro Hall District Office, and commuting to and from her home is not a function of her job. The Agency cited court decisions for the proposition that a commute is not something an employer is required to reasonably accommodate. The Agency went on to find that even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that an employer is required to provide a shorter commute as a reasonable accommodation in appropriate circumstances, she failed to prove that an accommodation was required because of her medical conditions. It found that the medical evidence regarding vertigo was inconsistent, but even if it was chronic, it would only affect her ability to drive, and it was unclear why it was necessary for her to reduce her drive from 45 to 30 minutes, as requested. The Agency found that the medical evidence Complainant submitted only documented a few <span id="Page_1134"></span>incidents of vertigo in 2005, 2009, and 2012. Regarding Complainant's Achilles tendonitis, the Agency reiterated the findings in its denial letter. The Agency also found that Complainant failed to show she needed a shorter commute--it reasoned that most of it was spent in her vehicle, standing was only required on a train or subway platform, and walking was only required to access the platforms.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that after the Agency denied Complainant's reasonable accommodation request in April 2013, Complainant visited the emergency room and was diagnosed with enthesopathy of the knee and later in July 2013 with a meniscus tear, and by August 14, 2013, an orthopedic surgeon diagnosed her with left knee internal derangement, recommended that she be out of work from approximately July 26, 2013 to September [23], 2013, and that she work in Connecticut due to the inability to travel six hours daily. Complainant had left knee arthroscopy surgery around August 26, 2013, and thereafter was restricted to no excessive stair climbing. On October 23, 2013, her orthopedic surgeon recommended limited steps and commute of less than one hour for a minimum of six weeks. On November 17, 2013, Complainant was in a motor vehicle accident and sustained neck pain due to a sprain/strain, cervical radiculopathy, lower back pain due to sprain/strain, and bi-lateral knee pain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On November 6, 2013, Complainant again requested a transfer to Connecticut, citing her "inability to walk," noting she uses a cane. By December 2013, her request for a compassionate detail to the Boston Region while undergoing medical treatment was approved, which includes Connecticut, and in March 2014, she was granted a hardship transfer to the Waterbury, Connecticut Office, which Complainant wrote on appeal was due to her difficulty with walking and mobility.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission affirmed the agency's final decision, but as the Commission's first substantive case decided under the ADAAA, the entirety of <span class="Italic">Dania S</span>. analysis is reproduced below:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Disability</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The events in this case arose after January 1, 2009, the effective date of the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), which expanded the definition of disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act Under EEOC regulations implementing the ADAAA, an individual with a disability is one who: (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; (2) has record of such an impairment; or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g). A physical or mental impairment is defined as: (1) any physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more body systems, such as neurological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs, respiratory (including speech organs), cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genitourinary, immune, circulatory, hemic, lymphatic, skin, and endocrine; or (2) any mental or psychological disorder. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(h). The impairment must substantially limit the ability of the complainant to perform a particular major life as compared to most people in the general population. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 16302(j)(1)(ii). Major life activities include, in part, caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, seeing, walking, standing, concentrating, and thinking. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 16302(i)(1)(i). Major life activities also include the operation of a major bodily function, such as in part neurological and brain. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(i)(1)(ii)-</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The primary purpose of the ADAAA is to make it easier for people with disabilities to obtain protection under the ADA. Consistent with this, the definition of disability shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.1(c)(4). In determining other examples of major life activities, a major life activity is not determined by reference to whether it is of central importance to daily life. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(i)(2). The term "substantially limits" shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage, to the maximum extent permitted by the ADA. "Substantially limits" is not meant to be a demanding standard. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(i). An impairment need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major like activity in order to be considered substantially limiting. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(ii). The determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity can't be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures, except ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(vi).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity, it is useful to consider the condition and manner in which the individual performs the major life activity and/or duration of time it takes to do so. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(4)(i). Consideration of facts such as condition, manner, or duration may include, among other things, consideration of the difficulty, effort, or time required to perform the major life activity; pain experienced when performing a major life activity, and the length of time a major life activity can be performed. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(4)(ii).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(vii). The six month "transitory" part of the "transitory and minor" exception to "regarded as" coverage in &#x00A7; 1630.15(f) does not apply to the definition of "disability" under paragraphs (g)(1)(i) (the "actual" disability prong) or (g)(1)(ii) (the "record of" prong). The effects of an impairment lasting or expected to last six fewer than six months can be substantially limiting within the meaning of this section. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(ix). Therefore, an impairment does not have to last for more than six months in order to be considered to be substantially limiting under the first or second prong of the definition of disability. The duration of the impairment is one factor that is relevant in determining whether the impairment substantially limits a major life activity. Impairments that last only for a short period of time are typically not covered, although they may be covered if sufficiently severe. Appendix to Part 1630, at &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(ix).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying above, we find that Complainant was an individual with a disability. In her December 2012, request for reasonable accommodation, Complainant wrote that she had disabling conditions of leg pain and difficulty walking, and was having difficulty with mobility to and from her work station. This was supported by medical documentation she submitted: a doctor visit in July 2012, complaining of leg pain with moderate severity, radiating pain to the right leg with cramping, with symptoms of a year. September 2012 notes from Podiatrist l's practice that Complainant was complaining of right post heel pain, and she had a right post heel spur, and Complainant was waiting for authorization for a CAM presumably insurance authorization. Podiatrist 2 writing on December 4, 2012, that he was treating Complainant for acute Achilles tendonitis secondary to overuse, which was exacerbated by weight bearing and ambulation, and opining that her daily commute was having a negative impact on her injury. Podiatrist 1 wrote on December 4, 2012, that he was treating Complainant for chronic Achilles Tendonosis of the right foot, immobilization was required for approximately two months along with physical therapy, and recommended minimal walking, and she was scheduled for frequent physical therapy from December 11, 2012 through February 1, 2013. We find Complainant is substantially impaired in the major life activity of walking, and hence has a disability. Because we have made this finding, we need not further address Complainant's vertigo.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The term "qualified" with respect to an individual with a disability means the individual satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education and other job-related requirements of the employment position such individual holds or desires and, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). Complainant was a Claims Representative, bilingual, GS-11, and served in this position for 10 years. The Agency does not contest that she was qualified.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Issue 1</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To prevail in a disparate treatment claim such as this, Complainant must satisfy the three-part evidentiary scheme fashioned by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). She must generally establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by demonstrating that he was subjected to an adverse employment action under circumstances that would support an inference of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Furnco Constr. Co. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567, 576 (1978). The <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> inquiry may be dispensed with in this case, however, since the Agency has articulated legitimate and nondiscriminatory reasons for its conduct. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Postal Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens</span>, 460 U.S. 711, 713-17 (1983); <span class="Italic">Holley v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950842 (Nov. 13, 1997). To ultimately prevail, Complainant must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Agency's explanation is a pretext for discrimination. <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products. Inc</span>., 530 U.S. 133 (2000); <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502, 519 (1993); <span class="Italic">Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 256 (1981); <span class="Italic">Holley, supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Pavellca v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, EEOC Request No. 05950351 (Dec. 14, 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Hardship Coordinator explained that she denied the November 2012 hardship transfer request because Complainant did not meet the definition for a set of circumstances that requires a permanent reassignment--circumstances beyond her control, since by moving to a different geographic location Complainant created her own set of circumstances. She differentiated Complainant's situated from someone requesting a hardship transfer due to marriage to a person who lives and works elsewhere, a spouse's military transfer, or elder care.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant has failed to show that this explanation was pretext to mask discrimination based on her age, race, or disability. Complainant contended that 7 1/2 years before when the Hardship Coordinator was in her office in a different job overseeing the interviewing area, she would only have Hispanic or African American employees do hard interviews. While not specifically asked about this, the Hardship Coordinator, who was not Complainant's supervisor then, countered that when she was assigned reception duties, she would assign, as would other management officials, claimants who did not speak English to the applicable bi-lingual interpreter, and Complainant received as many interviews as other Claims <span id="Page_1135"></span>Representatives--each in the front-end interviewing area was assigned another interview as soon as she completed an interview. Complainant has not shown animus based on her race, age, or national origin.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given that with her November 2012 hardship transfer request Complainant also wrote that she encountered various medical problems which made her commute more complicated and submitted medical documentation, we find that she was also requesting then to be transferred as a reasonable accommodation. Under the Commission's regulations, an agency is required to make reasonable accommodation to the known physical and mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability unless the agency can show that accommodation would cause an undue hardship. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.9.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With her hardship transfer request, Complainant submitted limited medical documentation, with no letters by health care professionals that her medical conditions necessitated a shorter commute. Given this, we find that Complainant failed to establish at that time a nexus between the accommodation she was requesting and her disability. Accordingly, we find no discrimination on issue 1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Issue 2</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the correct legal theory which applies is failure to reasonably accommodate. The Agency denied Complainant's request for reasonable accommodation on two grounds--(1) she is not an individual with a disability, and (2) she failed to show a nexus between her medical conditions and the accommodation she requested, both because she did not show her medical condition necessitated a shorter commute, and because she chose to move to a location with a six hour round trip commute from the Bore Hall field office, and commuting from home was not a function of her job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have already found that Complainant is an individual with a disability. Further, Complainant showed her medical condition necessitated a shorter commute. She submitted a letter by Podiatrist 2 dated December 4, 2012, who wrote Complainant was being treated for acute Achilles tendonitis secondary to overuse which was exacerbated by weight bearing and ambulation, that her daily commute was having a negative impact on her injury, and recommended a change in her workplace location to reduce her commute. This was backed up by Complainant writing in her reasonable accommodation request that she encountered complications with her illnesses related to her commute, wears a Cam Walker which at times alleviates her pain but she generally has very limited mobility, and a letter by Podiatrist 1 dated December 4, 2012, recommending minimal walking. Complainant's description of her three hour commute indicates repeated walking--walking to the commuter rail station platform or stop, walking to the subway platform, and walking up and down many staircases in the subway which aggravated her injury.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also found that Complainant chose to move to a location with a six hour round trip commute from the Born Hall District Office, and commuting from home was not a function of her job. Complainant made her reasonable accommodation request in issue 2 after she moved on September 1, 2012, and realized the commute was aggravating her medical conditions. Commission precedent has established that a request for a shorter commute time due to disability triggers the agency's responsibility under the Rehabilitation Act. This includes the obligation to consider reassigning the complainant to shorten the commute to a vacant position. <span class="Italic">Philippe v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A12653 (May 15, 2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish entitlement to reassignment as a reasonable accommodation, a complainant must show that a vacant, funded position existed during the relevant time period or was likely to open. The burden is on the complainant to do this. <span class="Italic">Hampton v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01986308 (Aug. 1, 2002); <span class="Italic">Complainant v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120140221 (April 8, 2014).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainant submitted evidence that she applied and was rejected for three vacancy announcements that closed in May 2012 and July 2012. They were located in Connecticut in New Haven, Meriden and Torrington--a Service Representative, GS-5 to 8, a Supervisory Social Insurance Specialist, GS-12, and a Claims Representative, GS-5 to 11. Regarding the evidence of a GS-12 opening, an Agency is not required to promote an employee as a form or reasonable accommodation. Complainant submitted documentation showing that she was entitled to consideration for the reasonable accommodation of a shorter commute starting in the December 2012-January 2013 time period. But she did not meet her burden of showing there were funded, vacant positions which existed during the relevant time period or were likely to open in the parts of Connecticut she was seeking. Accordingly, Complainant has failed to show that the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act when it denied her reasonable accommodation request. Nor has she proven discrimination based on race or age when she was denied a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FAD is AFFIRMED.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Xochitl B. v. Secretary of Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/0120160228.txt">0120160228</a> (2016), the Commission remanded the case for further development of the record where it was unclear whether the duration of the complainant's impairment rose to the level of being a disability. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Xochitl B</span>. alleged discrimination after she injured her wrist and it was later determined that she had a scaphoid fracture and her arm was placed in a full cast. The record, however, did not reflect the duration of the impairment and the Commission remanded the case noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was amended in 2008 by the ADA Amendments Act (ADAAA). The primary purpose of the ADAAA is to make it easier for people with disabilities to obtain coverage under the ADA. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.1(b)(4). Accordingly, the Commission construes disability broadly in favor of expansive coverage to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the transitory and minor exception, a transitory impairment does not have to last for more than six months in order to be considered substantially limiting under the first two prongs of the definition of disability. The duration of an impairment is one factor that is relevant in determining whether the impairment substantially limits a major life activity. Impairments that last only a short period of time are typically not covered, although they may be covered if sufficiently severe. 29 C.F.R. Part 1630 Appendix--Section 1630.2(j)(1)(ix).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At this point, the record does not reflect the duration and severity of Complainant's impairment. Given all the above, we find that the Agency has not shown as a matter of law that Complainant is not an individual with a disability. This is a determination that must be made on the merits after an investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Becki P. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 012052848 (2018), involved a Human Resources Specialist whose duties included serving as an adviser and providing customer service in the areas of staffing, recruiting and classification. The complainant presented her supervisor with a Confirmation of Reasonable Accommodation Request Form, which stated that she suffered from fibromyalgia and noted that "[b]eing seated all day exasperates the musculoskeletal pain and increases the symptoms that can prohibit me to perform at the full level of my job." The request also explained that staying in a position for a long time, like sitting in traffic, increased her pain and stress. Her doctor's note simply stated that the complainant suffered "severe chronic pain" and noted that "[i]t would be beneficial for her to work from home 3 days a week." The supervisor requested additional medical documentation to establish her condition and the nature, severity and expected duration of her condition. The complainant presented two more doctors' note, each diagnosing her with fibromyalgia, describing its symptoms and how long commutes exasperate those symptoms, and recommending that she be permitted to telework. The agency denied the complainant's request to work from home three days a week because her physical presence in the office was critical to the fulfillment of the customer service component of her job. Instead, the agency provided an ergonomic keyboard, ergonomic keyboard tray, ergonomic mouse and ergonomic chair as reasonable accommodations. The complainant filed an EEO complaint, alleging, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, a failure to reasonably accommodate her disability. The administrative judge issued a decision without a hearing, finding no discrimination and noting that, while the complainant may have preferred to work from home, nothing in the medical documentation established that it was necessary to the successful performance of her duties. The Commission disagreed, finding that there existed genuine issues of material fact concerning whether the accommodations provided were effective and whether the requested accommodation (telework) would have imposed an undue hardship. The Commission's case analysis under the ADAAA is instructive, and so it is reproduced in substantial part below. First, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Becki P.</span> found that the complainant was an individual with a disability, writing:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The events in this case arose after January 1, 2009, the effective date of the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), which expanded the definition of disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act. The primary purpose of the ADAAA is to make it easier for people with disabilities to obtain protection under the ADA. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.1(c)(4). Consistent with the ADAAA's purpose of reinstating a broad scope of protection under the ADA, the definition of "disability" shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether agencies have complied with their obligations and whether discrimination has occurred, not whether the individual meets the definition of disability. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The question of whether an individual meets the definition of disability should not demand extensive analysis. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under EEOC regulations implementing the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), an individual with a disability is one who: (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; (2) has a record of such an impairment; or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g)(1). Major life activities include, but are not limited to: caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, <span id="Page_1136"></span>walking, standing, sitting, reaching, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, interacting with others, and working. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(i)(1)(i). The term "substantially limits" shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(i). "Substantially limits" is not meant to be a demanding standard. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> An impairment is a disability if it substantially limits the ability of an individual to perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general population. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(ii). An impairment need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity in order to be considered substantially limiting. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find that Complainant is an individual with a disability because she has a physical impairment that substantially limits her in the major life activity of sitting. Specifically, Complainant's Rheumatologist has diagnosed her with fibromyalgia, a condition which causes pain throughout most areas of the body. The Rheumatologist described Complainant's condition as chronic and not curable and wrote that Complainant experienced pain when sitting for long periods. We find that Complainant has established that she is an individual with a disability under the expansive definition as defined in the ADAAA, as noted above.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Becki P</span>. next turned to whether the complainant was "otherwise qualified":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish that she was unlawfully denied a reasonable accommodation, Complainant must show that: (1) she is an individual with a disability, as defined by 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g); (2) she is a "qualified" individual with a disability pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m); and (3) the Agency failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (Oct. 17, 2002) (Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation). An individual with a disability is "qualified" if he or she satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the employment position that the individual holds or desires and, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). "Essential functions" are the fundamental job duties of the employment position that the individual holds or desires. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, it is undisputed that Complainant met the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements for her position. We note that Complainant has contended that she could perform the essential functions of her position with or without reasonable accommodation. In that regard, she has argued that she could have performed the essential functions of her position from home. The Agency further does not dispute that she had been performing the essential functions of her position, despite her impairment. We find that Complainant has established that she is a qualified individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission next found that a genuine issue of material fact existed concerning whether the accommodations provided were effective:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find the AJ erred in finding that the Agency's ergonomic accommodations were effective for her fibromyalgia disability. As noted above, while an Agency may choose among reasonable accommodations, the accommodation chosen must be effective. Here, the Agency's ergonomic accommodations for Complainant's office have clearly not addressed Complainant's Rheumatologist's letter that Complainant experienced symptoms of fibromyalgia sitting for prolonged periods of time during her commute to work. In addition, we find that the AJ improperly discounted Complainant's medical documentation, which suggested telework as an accommodation for Complainant. While Complainant's medical documentation did not explicitly state that telework was necessary, it did suggest it as a possible accommodation for Complainant. There is no dispute that Complainant provided multiple letters from two different doctors, documenting the pain and fatigue she suffered from her fibromyalgia and how her condition flared up during her commute to work. None of the ergonomic accommodations provided for Complainant addressed the pain she suffered during her commute to work. Complainant averred:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Chronic fatigue is a symptom of my medical condition and minimizing commute decreases physical activities and reduces the number of breaks and/or absences I need. Not allowing the flexibility of additional telework imposes additional physical activities and fatigue as a consequence it increases the number of days of annual/sick and/or leave without pay.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency maintained that there were few duties that the complainant could perform outside of the human resources offices because she handled personally identifiable information (PII) and, as a consequence, allowing the complainant to work from home would cause an undue hardship on the agency. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Becki P.</span> found that the administrative judge's decision was in error and ordered a hearing on the claims:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The burden now shifts to the employer to provide case-specific evidence proving that providing reasonable accommodation would cause an undue hardship in the particular circumstances. Here, the undue hardship analysis appears to turn on whether Complainant could sufficiently interact with managers and employees while working from home and whether Complainant could have worked from home on tasks that did not involve Personally Identifiable Information (PII).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that S1 wrote that the reasonable accommodation of three days per week of telework would "impose an undue hardship on the operation of SSP's mission and business." S1 stated that the essential functions of the Complainant's job are to provide customer service in the area of Human Resources to organization managers. S1 further stated that this requires her to physically be in the office, and it would be an undue burden on the Agency to permit Complainant to telework 60% of her work week because her physical presence is critical to fulfilling the customer service function. S2 stated there are few duties that can be performed outside the HR office particularly due to PII. S2 further stated that effective and efficient HR work is best done where the records and people are located because otherwise a delay is created which creates a negative impact on the mission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Complainant, however, maintains that she has already been working from home once per pay period wherein she has successfully provided excellent customer service. Complainant specifically averred:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">On my daily basis, my job requires the utilization of mutliplt [sic] systems which Command's [sic] have authorized me access from home. In fact, most of my communications related to customer service is via email and I have access to email while teleworking.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find there exists a genuine dispute of material fact concerning whether the accommodations provided by the Agency adequately addressed Complainant's need for a reasonable accommodation, and whether he Agency could have granted Complainant's request to telework without incurring an undue hardship. In so finding, we note that in allowing an employee to telework an employer "may need to reassign some minor job duties or marGINAl functions (i.e., those that are not essential to the successful performance of a job) if they cannot be performed outside the workplace...." Work at Home/Telework as a Reasonable Accommodation. Question 4, available at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/facts/telework.html">http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/telework.html</a> (last modified October 27, 2005). We further note that an employer should not, however, deny a request to telework as a reasonable accommodation solely because a job involves some contact and coordination with other employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Frequently, meetings can be conducted effectively by telephone and information can be exchanged quickly through email. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Ike D. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 0120161282 (2018), did just what the ADAAA allows it, which is to dispense quickly with the question of whether the complainant was a qualified individual, saving extensive analysis for whether discrimination occurred. The complainant in <span class="Italic">Ike D</span>. alleged that he was diagnosed with post-concussive syndrome and stated that he was substantially limited in the major life activity of concentrating. The agency denied his request for reasonable accommodation because, according to the agency, a disability is a condition that lasts more than six months. The Commission rejected that analysis with one sentence. "Complainant was diagnosed with post-concussive syndrome and stated that he was substantially limited in the major life of concentrating, so we find that Complainant was an individual with a disability under the expansive definition of the ADAAA." And that is as it should be.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's analysis in <span class="Italic">Cleveland C., et al. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120170405 (2018), was more fulsome as to whether the complainant was a qualified individual. Agency regulations, in that case, required police officers to maintain a clean-shaven face because facial hair interfered with the sealing mechanism on respirators used for protection from chemical, physical and biological hazards. Ten police officers developed a chronic skin condition known as Pseudofolliculitis Barbae. The only remedy was for the police officers to stop shaving their faces. The agency directed the complainants to shave their faces or accept a reassignment with a possible pay reduction or termination. The complainant's alleged disability discrimination. The agency issued a consolidated final decision, finding that the complainants were not individuals with a disability because their skin disorder did not substantially limit their employment. The Commission vacated that decision in <span class="Italic">Cleveland C., et al</span>. as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we determine that the Agency erred in finding that Complainants were not individuals with a disability. First, we find that Complainants had a physical impairment affecting the skin in that they were diagnosed with Pseudofolliculitis Barbae, a chronic bacterial skin disorder resulting from ingrown hairs that causes skin irritation, rashes, sores, scarring, infection, among other symptoms brought on by clean shaving.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, we find that this bacterial skin disorder substantially limited Complainants in the operation of major bodily functions, including the immune system and the skin. Because the operation of a major bodily function is a major life activity, Complainants have shown that they have <span id="Page_1137"></span>a physical impairment of the skin that substantially limits them in major life activities, and therefore have established that they are individuals with a disability, pursuant to the ADAAA and Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To be entitled to protection under the Rehabilitation Act, Complainants must also show that they were "qualified" individuals with a disability. A qualified individual with a disability is an individual with a disability who satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job related requirements of the employment position such individual holds or desires, and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency does not dispute that Complainants satisfied the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the position of Police Officer. Rather, the Agency believes that Complainants are unable to perform the job safely because they cannot meet a specific requirement imposed by the Agency: wear negative pressure APR protective masks with clean-shaven skin.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, the question of whether Complainants are or are not "qualified" to perform the job of Police Officer hinges on whether the standard they are unable to meet (wear a negative pressure protective mask with clean-shaven skin) has been justified by the Agency and, if it has been justified, whether there is a reasonable accommodation (including the use of an alternate standard) that would enable them to meet the standard. <span class="Italic">Gwendolyn G. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120080613 (Dec. 23, 2013).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As such, we determine that the Agency applied the wrong legal analysis in its final decision. The Agency should have analyzed whether the qualification standard at issue here, the requirement that police officers wear negative pressure protective masks while clean-shaven, violated the Rehabilitation Act, using the specific "Qualification Standard" analysis described below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC regulations define "qualification standards" as "the personal and professional attributes including the skill, experience, education, physical, medical, safety, and other requirements established by a covered entity as requirements which an individual must meet in order to be eligible for the position held or desired." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(q). "The term 'qualification standard' may include a requirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of the individual or others in the workplace." 29 C.F.R. 1630.15(b)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1138"></span>A qualification standard, selection criteria, or employment test that screens out or tends to screen out a person with a disability or a class of persons with disabilities, violates the Rehabilitation Act unless the employer is able to show that the standard, test, or criteria meets the affirmative defenses laid out in 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12113(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Complainants' disability prevented them from being clean shaven, which the Agency maintained disqualified them from wearing negative pressure protective masks because, in the Agency's opinion, the masks could not create adequate protective seals with their skin. Therefore, the Agency believed Complainants' disability prevented them from meeting the Agency's negative pressure protective mask and clean-shaven standard. This resulted in Complainants being stripped of their Police Officer duties and placed on light duty until they chose to comply and fully shave their faces.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question then is whether the Agency is able to justify the qualification standard under the test set forth under the law. In order to justify a standard, the statute requires that the Agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1)&#x2003;show that the standard, criteria, or test is "job-related and consistent with business necessity"; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2)&#x2003;show that there is no accommodation that would enable the person to meet the existing standard or no alternative approach (itself a form of accommodation) through which the employer can determine whether the person can perform the essential function.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12113(a); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.15(h); <span class="Italic">Gwendolyn G. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120080613 (Dec. 23, 2013).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When determining if a standard or test is job-related and consistent with business necessity, the central question is whether the standard or test is "carefully tailored to measure [an individual's] actual ability to [perform] the essential function of the job" H.R. Rep. 101-485(11) at 36, 101st Cong., 2nd Sess. 1990, 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 353-5.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, upon remand, the Agency's new consolidated final decision should determine whether the qualification standard of wearing a negative pressure protective mask while clean-shaven was carefully tailored to measure Complainants' actual ability to perform the essential functions of a police officer. Possible evidence to consider may include: the number of documented instances (or lack of documented instances) when negative pressure protective masks did not seal correctly due to Complainants' facial hair; whether Complainants passed their mask fit tests with facial hair; and how often Complainants had to don these respirators while performing the essential functions of a police officer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If upon remand, the Agency determines that the qualification standard of wearing a negative pressure mask while clean-shaven is job-related and consistent with business necessity, the Agency must then consider both accommodations that enable Complainants to meet the standard and alternative approaches through which the Agency can determine whether Complainants can perform the essential functions of a police officer. Such accommodations and alternative approaches to investigate and consider upon remand include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--allowing Complainants to wear negative pressure masks with facial hair, if negative pressure masks can in fact form adequate protective seals with faces that have a small degree of facial hair; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">--allowing Complainants to wear other types of protective masks, such as Powered Air-Purifying Respirators, with facial hair.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that in its consolidated final decision, the Agency maintained that it properly applied OSHA regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1910.134 in implementing PFPA Regulation No. 9420. But the Agency's decision did not address a provision of the OSHA regulation that contemplates providing Powered Air-Purifying Respirators (PAPR) to those who cannot use a negative pressure mask due to a medical condition:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If the respirator is a negative pressure respirator and [a physician or other licensed health care professional] finds a medical condition that may place the employee's health at increased risk if the respirator is used, the employer shall provide a PAPR if the [physician's] medical evaluation finds that the employee can use such a respirator....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1910.134(e)(6)(ii)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, upon remand, when the Agency investigates and considers the alternative approach of allowing Complainants to wear Powered Air-Purifying Respirators with facial hair, the Agency's supplemental investigation and new consolidated final decision should examine whether 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1910.134(e)(6)(ii) is relevant, applicable, and perhaps dispositive, to these cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At this juncture, the Commission determines that it would be inappropriate for it to adjudicate the question of whether the Agency used a discriminatory qualification standard in violation of the Rehabilitation Act. The Agency's consolidated final decision applied the wrong legal analysis, and subsequently neither parties' briefs properly addressed the qualification-standards issues relevant to these appeals. Additionally, the record is unclear as to what extent OSHA regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1910.134(e)(6)(ii) is applicable and relevant to the Agency's policy and qualification standard and to Complainant's disability claims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we remand these cases to the Agency with specific instructions to conduct a supplemental investigation on whether there is an accommodation that would enable Complainants to meet the existing standard or alternative approach through which the Agency could determine whether Complainants can perform the essential functions of a police officer. After the Agency conducts its supplemental investigation and provides Complainants with a reasonable opportunity to provide a rebuttal, the Agency must issue a new consolidated final decision, with specific instructions to apply the "qualification standards" framework above in determining whether the Agency violated the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">The complainant in <span class="Italic">Annalee D. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120180922 (2019), alleged that the agency subjected her to disability discrimination when she performed higher-level work but did not receive commensurate pay. Though the Commission is short on the facts of the case, it seems that the claim was born out of a reasonable accommodation. The Commission discussed in more detail than usual whether the complainant was an "individual with a disability" and a "qualified individual" under the ADAAA:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency acknowledges that Complainant is an individual with a disability. Furthermore, upon review, the record shows that Complainant provided the Agency with medical documentation stating that she was diagnosed with right and left epicondylitis with the restrictions of not lifting, carrying, pushing, or pulling more than 10 pounds. Complainant was also restricted from pushing or pulling for more than 20 minutes. <span class="Italic">See Rochelle F. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120171406 (Mar 5, 2019); <span class="Italic">Gwendolyn G. v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120080613 (Dec. 23, 2013) (finding Complainant is individual with a disability where she was substantially limited in the major life activity of lifting and restricted to lifting no more than 10 pounds).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The next inquiry is whether Complainant is a "qualified individual with a disability." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). A "qualified individual with a disability" is one who satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education and other job-related requirements of the employment position and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The record shows that on December 22, 2016, Complainant was offered and accepted a limited duty modified job offer commensurate with her medical restrictions. As the Agency could not <span id="Page_1139"></span>find a limited duty position in the mail handler craft, Complainant was offered, and accepted, a clerk position. The Agency does not claim that Complainant could not perform the functions of this position. As such, we find that Complainant was a qualified individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission in <span class="Italic">Annalee D</span>. reversed the agency's finding that it did not discriminate against the complaint on the bases of her disability, explaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the Agency's decision to pay Complainant at the PS-04 level was directly related to her disability as it was the result of the limited duty job offer. In so finding, we note that in his affidavit, Complainant's manager (M1) states that he was instructed by the plant manager (PM) to pay limited duty employees "the same level as their base [pay] because of their medical restrictions...and also that would [be] encouraging others to get hurt on the job to get more pay when injured on the job." We find that this is more than sufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The burden now shifts to the Agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. <span class="Italic">See Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248 (1981). Here, the record shows that prior to the events at issue, Complainant was assigned to a missing manifest project under the direction of, and funded by Headquarters, and was being paid at the PS-06 level. The Agency states that "when HQ ended the assignment, the level/pay ended." The record shows, however, that the missing manifest project assignment ended on December 27, 2016, but Complainant continued to be paid as a PS-06 clerk until March 10, 2017. Complainant states that her duties did not change in March 2017, and the Agency does not dispute this statement. We also note that the PM states that management was instructed not to create "make shift work" for limited duty employees such as Complainant, but to instead "identify jobs or portions of jobs that [they] could do within their restrictions." Additionally, she states that "limited duty employees who were not able to complete the full duties of a higher-level bid position were not to be paid higher level." We find, however, that the Agency failed to identify the duties of the PS-06 clerk position they assert Complainant was not performing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, when asked what duties of the level 6 clerk position Complainant was not performing, M1 states that Complainant isn't "pulling or pushing and can't lift anything &#x003E;10 lbs where the clerks have to lift up to 70 lbs and also need to do pulling and pushing up to 70 lbs." We note, however, that these are not job duties but are, instead, physical requirements. Additionally, a review of the position description for the sales, service/distribution associate, PS-06, position provided by the Agency does not indicate any lifting requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor has the Agency identified which, if any, of the duties listed in the position description were not being performed by Complainant at the relevant time. Without identifying the specific duties of the PS-06 clerk position the Agency claims that Complainant was not performing, we find that the Agency failed to rebut the inference of discrimination created when Complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination by articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. Therefore, we find that the Agency discriminated against Complainant based on her disability when it paid her at a lower level.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Annalee D</span>., the agency lost because it failed to prove that the complainant was completing the lower-level work that justified her lower-level pay. It is important to remember, however, that when a complainant is reassigned to a lower-level position as a reasonable accommodation, the agency is not obligated to retain the complainant's pay from his/her former higher-level position. That is true, unless the complainant can show that the agency "transfers employees without disabilities to lower level positions and maintains their oriGINAl salaries."
