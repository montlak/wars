<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-15"><span class="space">2.</span> Statute of Limitations</h4>
<p class="noindent">The question of the statute of limitations under the ADEA is one that has caused much confusion and consternation between the Commission, the courts and prospective complainants. In its oriGINAl form the ADEA applied only to private sector employers and was a hybrid between Title VII and the Fair Labor Standards Act. Procedures and remedies were borrowed from both pieces of legislation in drafting the ADEA. To add to the confusion, Congress, in extending the coverage of the ADEA to federal employees, specifically provided that most sections of the ADEA were not applicable. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 USC 633a(f). Unfortunately, one of the sections that Congress made inapplicable to the federal government was that containing the statute of limitations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 USC 626(c)-(e). As a result, complainants and the courts have engaged in guessing games as to the statute of limitations--a game made all the more complex by the notice of rights given by the Commission. Courts have held that the ADEA statute of limitations for filing a civil action was anything from 30 days to six years.</p>
<p class="noindent">As discussed in the next section, the Commission attempted to address the statute of limitations muddle in Part 1614 by specifying what constitutes administrative exhaustion and by providing a regulatory statute of limitations in ADEA cases. Over time, as discussed below, the courts reached a consensus that a federal sector ADEA plaintiff has 90 days from the time that administrative remedies are exhausted to file a civil action.</p>
<p class="noindent">For complainants who elect to proceed directly to U.S. district court after filing a notice of intent to file a civil action, the statute of limitations issue does not arise as frequently. However, at least one court, in addressing the question of the statute of limitations when complainants proceed directly to court without use of the administrative process, found that the general ADEA statute of limitations applies. That statute of limitations provides for the filing of a civil action within two years of the alleged discriminatory incident, or three years if the violation is willful. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Wiersema v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 648 F. Supp. 66, <span class="Italic">reconsideration</span> <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 41 Emp. Prac. Dec. Para. 36,519 (E.D. Tenn. 1968). Of course, any statute of limitations is subject to the notice of intent to file suit requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent">As with administrative claims filed under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act, complainants under the ADEA have the right to terminate the administrative process at any time after the complaint has been pending for 180 days and proceed to U.S. district court after giving notice of intent to sue. Because federal employees are not required to exhaust administrative remedies, some courts have found that the statute of limitations for filing a civil action is not tolled by election of the administrative procedure as it is under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act. In other words, an ADEA complainant may find he or she has inadvertently waived the right to file a civil action if the applicable limitations period expires while the complaint is being processed administratively, even if such action is filed within 90 days of a final administrative decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">For years, the EEOC had a standard notice of right to file a civil action that it gave to all ADEA complainants. The notice of rights was a standard portion of any decision issued by the former Office of Review and Appeals or the Commission itself. Most agencies also adopted the same notice of rights for inclusion in their own decisions. (The notice changed slightly depending on what stage of the process was being completed). The notice, which was subject to a great deal of judicial criticism, read substantially as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">You have the right to file civil action in an appropriate United States District Court <span class="Italic">WITHIN</span> <span class="Italic">THIRTY</span> <span class="Italic">(30)</span> <span class="Italic">DAYS</span> of the date that you receive this decision, unless within that time you decide to file a request to reopen. As to any claim based on the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 USC 633a), you <span class="Italic">MAY</span> have up to six years after the right of action first accrued<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Lehman v. Nakshian</span>, 435 U.S. 156 (1981); 29 USC 633a(f); and 28 USC 2401(a)....</p>
<p class="noindent">Finally, after much judicial criticism, the Commission changed its administrative notice to ADEA complainants. The revised notice read:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">You have the right to file a civil action in an appropriate United States District Court <span class="Italic">WITHIN THIRTY (30) CALENDAR DAYS</span> of the date that you received this decision, unless within that time you decide to file a request to reopen. The limitations period for filing a civil action under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, 29 USC 621, <span class="Italic">et</span> <span class="Italic">seq.</span>, (ADEA) may differ from the period set out for the filing of civil actions under Title VII off the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 USC 2000e <span class="Italic">et</span> <span class="Italic">seq.</span>, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 USC 791. You may be foreclosed from filing a civil action on any claim brought under the ADEA if you fail to file <span id="Page_1445"></span>within the limitations period applied by the Court in the jurisdiction in which your action is filed....</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the new notice did not particularly clarify the statute of limitations problem, it at least did not affirmatively mislead complainants into believing that a six-year statute of limitations applies to civil actions under the ADEA.</p>
<p class="noindent">In addition, when the Commission received requests for hearings or appeals that raised claims under the ADEA, it began routinely issuing a letter to complainants which generally stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Please be advised that the Courts have applied limitations periods ranging from two to three years to up to six years on the filing of lawsuits by federal employees under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, 29 USC section 621, <span class="Italic">et</span> <span class="Italic">seq</span>. ("ADEA"). It is the Commission's position that a Complainant may have up to six years after the date of the alleged discriminatory action in which to file a civil action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">From our review of your complaint, it appears that the statute of limitations may have expired or may expire before the processing or your complaint is completed. For this reason, you may wish to consult an Attorney respecting your rights to file an action in District Court. Please note that in accordance with 29 CFR section 1613.513, filing a civil action terminates the administrative processing of the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Complainants who first used the administrative process could be subject to any of three statutes of limitations. First, there was the 30-day statute of limitations from receipt of an administrative decision on the complaint. This statute of limitations derived from Title VII, 42 USC 2000e-16(c), which gives complainants 30 days to file a civil action for <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">novo</span> review of the administrative decisions. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 USC 7703(b)(2) (giving employees 30 days from the issuance of a Merit Systems Protection Board decision involving allegations of discrimination to file a civil action for <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">novo</span> review of the findings on those allegations). This time period has now been extended to 90 days under the 1991 Civil Rights Act. Second, there is the two- to three-year statute of limitations which applies to ADEA actions in the private sector. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 USC 626(e)(1). Finally, there is a general six-year statute of limitations that applies to all actions against the United States where no specific statute of limitations is otherwise provided. <span class="Italic">See</span> 28 USC 2401(a).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's previous notice of civil action rights strongly implied that plaintiffs under the ADEA had up to six years from the alleged discriminatory incident to file a civil action. Only two courts have ever held that the general six-year statute of limitations applies to federal sector ADEA actions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lubniewski v. Lehman</span>, 891 F.2d 216 (9th Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Marks v. Turnage</span>, 680 F. Supp. 1241 (N.D. Ill. 1988). Yet, for several years, the Commission persisted in issuing a notice that was vague at best, and very likely misleading.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Bornholdt v. Brady</span>, 869 F.2d 57, 65-66 (2d Cir. 1989), the court described the statute of limitations problem with federal ADEA cases:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nonetheless, the evolution of &#x00A7; 633a creates a strong inference that Congress deliberately chose not to make the ADEA limitations period for suits against the government the same as the 30-day period of limitation provided for analogous suits under Title VII, 42 USC 2000e-16(c). When Senator Bentsen first introduced his 1972 bill to extend the coverage of the ADEA to government employees, <span class="Italic">see</span> S. 3318, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., 118 Cong. Rec. 7745 (1972), the bill did not propose a new section for claims against government employers; it simply proposed to expand the definition of employer, which would have made existing provisions of the Act applicable to claims against the government. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 7746. The bill was later restructured by Senator Bentsen to remove the federal government from the general definition of employer and to place appropriate substantive provisions in a separate section similar to &#x00A7; 633a<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 15894-95. This proposed new section, submitted as an amendment to S. 1861, provided that a civil action following a final agency decision on an age-discrimination claim would have to be filed within 30 days of that decision. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 15895. This provision was thus virtually identical to the 30-day filing provision that appears in Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S.&#x2003;1861 was then referred to committee. When it was reported out, it contained an ADEA amendment substantially similar to Senator Bentsen's proposal but for one element: the 30-day limitation period had been deleted. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 23952, 23955-56. The ADEA amendment thus reported out of committee was essentially what now appears as part of &#x00A7; 633a. The committee report that accompanied S. 1861, though noting the ADEA "amendment is similar to a proposal first introduced by Senator Bentsen,: S. Rep. No. 842, 92d Cong. 45 (1972), was silent as to the reason for elimination of the limitations period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress's deletion of a provision virtually identical to the one we would otherwise think the most appropriate to borrow cannot be lightly disregarded.... We think the history strongly suggests that a 30-day limitation on age-discrimination claims against the government was not what Congress intended.</p>
<p class="noindent">Having defined the statute of limitations problem, the Second Circuit declined to decide what limitations period should apply and dismissed the case on other grounds.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Lavery v. Marsh</span>, 727 F. Supp. 728, 730-33 (D. Mass. 1989), the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts considered the question and concluded that the 30-day limitations period in Title VII and the Civil Service Reform Act should be borrowed as the appropriate statute of limitations in the absence of a specific limitations period in the Act itself:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The usual limitation period for the ADEA, codified at 29 USC 626(e)(1) (incorporating 29 USC 255) is two years from when the cause of action accrued, "except that a cause of action arising out of a willful violation may be commenced within three years after the cause of action accrued." Section 633a, however, provides that actions brought under that section "shall not be subject to, or affected by, any provision of this chapter other than the provisions of 631(b) [which establishes an age limit of 40 years for 633a actions] and the provisions of this section." 29 USC 633a(f). The statute of limitation contained in 626(e)(1) is thus plainly inapplicable to this case....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both parties agree that this absence of a specified statute of limitation does not mean that the action is never time-barred:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">as is often the case in federal civil law, there is no federal statute of limitations expressly applicable to this suit. In such situations we do not ordinarily assume that Congress intended that there be no time limit on actions at all.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">DelCostello v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters</span>, 462 U.S. 151, 158 (1983). Not surprisingly, however, the parties differ on how the court should fill this gap.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Plaintiff, no doubt influenced by the Statement of Right to File a Civil Action's citation to 28 USC 2401(a), argues that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Congress has spoken clearly and unequivocally: "[e]very civil action commenced against the United States shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years the right of action first accrues...." 28 USC 2401(a). Mr. Lavery maintains that in the absence of an expressed statute of limitations within the ADEA, or any clear guidance from the legislative history to the contrary, that Congress has provided a general statute of limitations for all actions against the United States which is applicable to this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...If plaintiff's contention is correct--if the applicable statute of limitations is six years--then plaintiff's action, brought less than five years after the time of the alleged discriminatory nonselection, is not time-barred.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Citing</span> <span class="Italic">DelCostello</span>, defendant argues that the catch-all six-year statute of limitation is not applicable, and that the court should "borrow" a limitation period from some other source. 462 U.S. at 158, 161 (where "there is no federal statute of limitations expressly applicable...our task is to "borrow" the most suitable statute or other rule of timeliness from some other source"; holding that, although courts typically borrow from a related state law, it is more appropriate in some cases to borrow from a related federal law)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 633a is silent on whether the court should use the catch-all six-year statute of limitation or borrow a statute of limitation from some other source. As is ordinarily appropriate with regard to questions of statutory construction, when the language of the statute is not explicit, the court should look to any implicit manifestations of legislative intent for guidance. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Bornholdt v. Brady</span>, 869 F.2d 57, 64 (2d Cir. 1989) (in 633a case, court must "apply the limitations period [the court] believe[s] Congress intended"). Because 633a is part of a broader statutory scheme to eradicate age and other forms of employment discrimination in society, the manifestations of legislative intent with regard to the ADEA, Title VII, and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978...are relevant to this inquiry in addition to the manifestations of legislative intent with regard to 633a.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 633a(d), the starting point for this inquiry, allows a claimant to forego an administrative remedy and instead proceed directly to district court. A claimant who elects this option may file a civil action, but is not given six years within which to contemplate suit. Rather, the claimant must file a notice of intent to sue with the EEOC within 180 days of the alleged unlawful conduct. This short limitation period for suits against the government is evidence, albeit weak, that 633a does not manifest, either expressly or impliedly, an intent to give claimants who are denied administrative relief six years within which to file their action. Rather, the 180-day notice provision evidences a purpose to require that age-discrimination claims against the government be resolved expeditiously.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An analysis of the ADEA provisions for private employees also supports the conclusion that the six-year catch-all statute of limitation does not apply in this case. Under the ADEA, actions for age discrimination against private employers must be brought within two years, or in the case of willful violations of the Act, three years. 29 USC 626(e)(1). No reason has been advanced for thinking that Congress would provide for a longer limitation period for actions against the sovereign than for actions against private parties. Indeed, in cases where Congress has waived sovereign immunity, as it has done in 633a, the courts must narrowly construe that waiver:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he United States, a sovereign, is immune from suits save as it <span id="Page_1446"></span>consents to be sued...and the terms of its consent to be sued in any court define that court's jurisdiction to entertain the suit. Thus, if Congress waives the Government's immunity from suit, as it has in the ADEA, the plaintiff has a right to trial by jury only where that right is one of the terms of [the Government's] consent to be sued. Like a waiver of immunity itself, which must be unequivocally expressed, this Court has long decided that limitations and conditions upon which the Government consents to be sued must be strictly observed and exceptions thereto are not to be implied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Nakshian</span>, 453 U.S. 160-61 (citations and quotation marks omitted). Of course, <span class="Italic">Nakshian</span>, which was also an ADEA case, involved the right to jury trial in the context of a waiver of sovereign immunity. Nevertheless, the reasoning of that case is equally appropriate to the issue here. Thus, where the sovereign waives the immunity, the "limitations and conditions upon which the Government consents to be sued," including the limitation period within which suits must be filed, "must be strictly observed and exceptions thereto are not to be implied." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 161; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">United States v. Mottaz</span>, 476 U.S. 834, 841 (1986) ("[w]hen waiver legislation contains a statute of limitations, the limitations provision constitutes a condition on the waiver of sovereign immunity").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An analysis of other federal anti-discrimination statutes yields a similar pattern. As noted above, the ADEA grew out of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Under Title VII, as under the ADEA, a federal employee may seek administrative relief for discriminatory conduct through the EEOC. If the EEOC denies a claimant's request for relief, the claimant may then file a civil action, but Title VII requires that the claimant do so within thirty days of receipt of the final decision by the EEOC. 42 USC 2000e-16(c). If the plaintiff's contention is correct--if his ADEA action is governed by the catch-all six-year statute of limitation--then age-discrimination victims are afforded greater protection than victims of discrimination on account of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The court cannot ascribe to the statute, without explicit direction, a meaning that treats victims of employment discrimination so differently.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 ("CSRA") provides an identical thirty-days-from-final-decision limitation period. Under the CSRA, a federal employee who has been discriminated against on account of age, or on account of some other specified characteristic, and who has been subject to a major adverse personnel action--that is, removal, suspension for fourteen days or more, reduction in grade or pay, of furlough of 30 days or less--may seek relief from the Merit Systems Protection Board ("MSPB"). 5 USC 7512. If the MSPB finds no discrimination, then, as under Title VII, the claimant may file a civil action, but must do so within thirty days of receipt of the MSPB's final decision. 5 USC 7703(b)(2). It does not make sense to impose a thirty-day limit for the filing a civil actions following an administrative decision of no age-discrimination in major adverse personnel actions but to allow, as plaintiff suggests, up to six years for the filing of civil actions in cases of less severe adverse personnel actions such as nonselection for promotion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that the statute does not grant claimants six years within which to file ADEA suits against the government. Rather, the combined framework of 633a, of the ADEA as a whole, of Title VII, and of the CSRA, manifests a legislative intent to provide a remedy for age-discrimination by the government, but to require that the remedy be pursued promptly. The catch-all six-year statute of limitation of 28 USC 2401(a) is thus inapplicable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Looking to federal law for a close analogy, I conclude that the court should borrow the limitation period from Title VII and from the CSRA--that 633a claimants must file their civil actions within thirty days of receipt of the EEOC's final decision. This method of borrowing is the only one that gives victims of age-discrimination the same protections as victims of other forms of discrimination, and gives federal employees subjected to major adverse personnel actions at least as much protection as is given to federal employees subjected to less severe adverse personnel actions. This is the conclusion, also, of the majority of courts that have considered analogous issues....</p>
<p class="noindent">The court noted that the case was troubling "in light of the apparent absence of any effective response by the EEOC to repeated judicial criticism of the EEOC's vague, cryptic, mystifying, and ambiguous notices." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 736.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in <span class="Italic">Lubniewski v. Lehman</span>, 891 F.2d 216, 220 (9th Cir. 1989), relying heavily on the <span class="Italic">Bornholdt</span> analysis, rejected borrowing the 30-day statute of limitations under Title VII and found that the general six-year statute of limitations in 28 USC 2401(a) applied to federal ADEA claims:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note in support of this conclusion that regulations of the EEOC, the agency principally responsible for enforcing Title VII, and the ADEA, nowhere state that federal employee ADEA claims must be filed within 30 days. Although these regulations require Title VII claims to be filed within thirty days, 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.281 (1988), the EEOC made them expressly inapplicable to federal employee ADEA claims. 29 CFR 1613.514 (1988). <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Lorillard v. Pons</span>, 434 U.S. 575, 584-85, 98 S. Ct. 866, 872, 55 L. Ed.2d 40 (1978) (in section of ADEA where Congress has rejected Title VII procedures, Title VII standards "shed no light on congressional intent under the ADEA"). The notice that the EEOC sends to federal employees who have made Title VII and ADEA claims mirrors these regulations and implies that Title VII's thirty-day filing deadline is inapplicable to federal employee ADEA claims....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor do we think it proper to borrow a limitation period from another section of the ADEA. Section 633a(f) demonstrates that section 633a meant to be unaffected by any other sections of the ADEA....</p>
<p class="noindent">However, the Commission has now revised its notice to federal employees and has specifically taken no position regarding the applicable statute of limitations in adopting Part 1614.</p>
<p class="noindent">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in <span class="Italic">Lavery v. Marsh</span>, 918 F.2d 1022 (1st Cir. 1990), upheld the district court's decision below. After noting that "there are virtually as many different answers to the question presented here as there are courts that have dealt with it...," the Court of Appeals in <span class="Italic">Lavery,</span> 918 F.2d at 1026, held:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We simply do not know why Congress left out the thirty-day limitations provision before passing the amendment. Without an explanation, "we find this deletion alone an ambiguous indication of Congressional purpose and draw no conclusion from it." <span class="Italic">Rastelli v. Warden</span>, 782 F.2d 17, 24 n.3 (2d Cir. 1986). Absent evidence one way or the other, human error is as likely the cause for the omission as deliberation. "'In resolving ambiguity, we must allow ourselves some recognition of the existence of sheer inadvertence in the legislative process.'" <span class="Italic">Cass v. United States</span>, 417 U.S. 72, 83 (1974) (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The legislative history sheds no light on what limitations period Congress specifically intended should apply to federal employee ADEA actions. Borrowing a limitations period from a closely analogous statute is the appropriate course, and Title VII's thirty-day period remains the closest analogy. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lehman v. Nakshian</span>; <span class="Italic">Oscar Mayer &#x0026; Co. v. Evans</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Long v. Frank</span>, 22 F.3d 54 (2nd Cir. 1994), the Second Circuit rejected its own <span class="Italic">dicta</span> in <span class="Italic">Bornholdt</span>. In <span class="Italic">Long</span>, the Second Circuit noted that since the <span class="Italic">Bornholdt</span> case, the Supreme Court had issued <span class="Italic">Stevens v. Department of Treasury</span>, 111 S. Ct. 1562, 1567 (1991), which held that because there was no express statute of limitations in the ADEA, it was permissible to "borrow" an analogous state or federal provision. The court in <span class="Italic">Long</span>, 22 F.3d at 56-58, discredited its <span class="Italic">dicta</span> in <span class="Italic">Bornholdt</span> and reasoned that Title VII was the most analogous statute from which to "borrow":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A major factor motivating our discussion in <span class="Italic">Bornholdt</span> was the perception that while "borrowing" ordinarily is the appropriate mode of statutory construction with respect to unexpressed statutes of limitations, it might not be the proper method in suits against the federal government. <span class="Italic">Bornholdt</span>, 869 F.2d at 64. We reasoned that with respect to federal causes of action against private entities, borrowing was necessary because there is no general statute of limitations to cover such actions. With respect to suits against the federal government, on the other hand, the six year catch-all provision exists, &#x00A7; 28 USC 2401(a), undermining what we perceived to be a fundamental rationale behind the practice of borrowing a statute of limitations. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequent to our decision in <span class="Italic">Bornholdt</span>, however, the Supreme Court indicated that borrowing is appropriate in ADEA suits against the federal government, although the Court did not decide specifically which limitations period should apply. <span class="Italic">See Stevens</span>, 500 U.S. at 7, 111 S. Ct. at 1567. We must now address the question left open by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Stevens</span> and this court in <span class="Italic">Bornholdt</span>, and decide which of the available statutes is most analogous to the ADEA, and therefore most appropriate for borrowing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is beyond dispute that the provisions of the ADEA are analogous to, and indeed were "patterned after," Title VII. <span class="Italic">See Lehman v. Nakshian</span>, 453 U.S. 156, 163-64, 101 S. Ct. 2698, 2703, 69 L. Ed.2d 548 (1981); <span class="Italic">Bornholdt</span>, 869 F.2d at 65. Both statutes share the common purpose of eliminating discrimination in the workplace, <span class="Italic">Oscar Mayer &#x0026; Co. v. Evans</span>, 441 U.S. 750, 756, 99 S. Ct. 2066, 2071, 60 L. Ed.2d 609 (1979), and several circuit courts, including this court, have interpreted the ADEA by comparison to analogous provisions of Title VII. <span class="Italic">See Rebar v. Marsh</span>, 959 F.2d 216, 218 n.5 (11th Cir. 1992) (collecting cases); <span class="Italic">Bornholdt</span>, 869 F.2d at 65 (same).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The only factor that counsels against fixing the ADEA statute of limitations by reference to Title VII, and the one that influenced our discussion in <span class="Italic">Bornholdt</span>, is that Congress eliminated an identical thirty day provision from an earlier draft of &#x00A7; 633a. <span class="Italic">See Bornholdt</span>, 869 F.2d at 65-66. The legislative history is silent on Congress's reasons for deleting the thirty day period from &#x00A7; 633a. In the absence of an explanation for the omission, we cannot ascribe to it the deliberate purpose of precluding interpretation by reference to the most closely analogous statute, for, in doing so we are just as likely to defeat Congress's intent as to effectuate it. <span class="Italic">See Rastelli v. Warden,</span> 782 F.2d 17, 24 n.3 (2d Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">see also Del-Costello v. International Bhd. of Teamsters</span>, 462 U.S. 151, 169 n.21, 103 S. Ct. 2281, 2293 n.21, 76 L. Ed.2d 476 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1447"></span>As we noted in <span class="Italic">Bornholdt</span>, the two most likely candidates for borrowing besides Title VII would be inappropriate for federal ADEA suits. 869 F.2d at 64-65. The two year limitations period applicable to private ADEA actions (three years for willful violations) is not fit for borrowing because the legislative history makes clear that &#x00A7; 633a "is independent of any other section of [the ADEA]," H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 950, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 11 (1978), reprinted in 1978 USCCAN 504, 528, 532, and its provisions are "self-contained and unaffected by other sections, including those governing procedures applicable in actions against private employers," <span class="Italic">Lehman</span>, 453 U.S. at 168, 101 S. Ct. at 2705. The six year catch-all limitations period, &#x00A7; 28 USC 2401(a), is similarly unacceptable since it applies only in cases where no other congressional intent is discernible. Because the provisions of Title VII are analogous to the ADEA in structure and purpose, the provisions of that statute provide stronger guidance in this case than the catch-all provision. <span class="Italic">See Wilson v. Garcia</span>, 471 U.S. 261, 278-80, 105 S. Ct. 1938, 1948-49, 85 L. Ed.2d 254 (1985) (refusing to apply catch-all provision when another statute of limitations governing conduct more closely analogous to the conduct at issue was available); <span class="Italic">Lavery</span>, 918 F.2d at 1026-27 (rejecting catch-all provision for ADEA claims by federal employees and applying Title VII period). Given the compelling analogy between the ADEA and Title VII, we think it prudent to adhere to accepted methods of statutory construction in borrowing a statute of limitations, rather than canvassing the volumes of the United States Code in search of a less appropriate alternative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, while these factors provide an independent justification for borrowing the Title VII limitations period, it is significant that the EEOC--the agency responsible for enforcing the ADEA--has since our decision in <span class="Italic">Bornholdt</span> amended its regulations to apply the same limitations period to federal claims under the ADEA as applies under Title VII. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 29 CFR 1614.408(c). In support of its interpretation of the ADEA, the EEOC noted the anomaly that would result if federal employees complaining of discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin under Title VII had to bring suit within thirty days of a final agency decision, while those complaining of age discrimination had six years. <span class="Italic">See</span> 57 Fed. Reg. 12,634, 12,640 (1992). Insofar as the EEOC's interpretation reflects an expression of policy as to how long a federal employee should have to sue, we must defer to the EEOC's conclusion.<span class="Italic"> See</span> <span class="Italic">Pauley v. BethEnergy Mines, Inc</span>., 501 U.S. 680, 111 S. Ct. 2524, 2535, 115 L. Ed.2d 604 (1991). Even if we were not so constrained, in a case like this one where the EEOC's determination comports with our own statutory interpretation, we find its analysis persuasive. Accordingly, we hold that when federal employees bring a civil action after pursuing administrative remedies under the ADEA, the action must be brought within the time period allowed for similar suits under Title VII.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another court called into question the "continuing vitality" of the Ninth Circuit's <span class="Italic">Lubniewski</span> decision, which held that a six-year statute of limitations applied, because it relied almost exclusively on <span class="Italic">Bornholdt, supra</span>--a decision now discredited by the Second Circuit. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Shalala</span>, 64 F.3d 601, 603-06 (11th Cir. 1995). In addition, two other circuits have found that the appropriate limitations period to "borrow" comes from Title VII. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rawlett v. Runyon</span>, 104 F.3d 359 (4th Cir. 1996) (Table); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Runyon</span>, 32 F.3d 1454 (10th Cir. 1994).</p>
