<h3 class="h3" id="sec15-130"><span class="space">CC.</span> SERVICE ANIMALS</h3>
<p class="noindent">More and more, people are using service animals to help alleviate disability related difficulties. There are guide dogs for the blind, service animals that alert the hearing impaired to certain sounds and dangers, emotional support animals, and service animals for mobility, just to name a few. Because these animals can satisfy an employee's legitimate need, agencies are well advised to consider requests from employees to bring their animal to work as a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">In addition, an agency's refusal to allow a qualified employee to bring a service animal to work as a reasonable accommodation can result in liability for certain pecuniary damages. For instance, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Thersa E. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2021005121 (2022), awarded the complaint $4,650 for dog walking expenses incurred by the employee when the agency refused her request to bring her service dog to work as a reasonable accommodation and she had to leave her service animal at home. For more on potential monetary liabilities related to reasonable accommodation requests, see <a href="0100-2023-30-001.html#sec21-1">Chapter 21</a>. It's worth noting that only dogs are considered service animals under Titles II and III of the ADA. Part 35 Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in State and Local Government Services, section 35.104 reads, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Service animal means any dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability. Other species of animals, whether wild or domestic, trained or untrained, are not service animals for the purposes of this definition. The work or tasks performed by a service animal must be directly related to the individual's disability. Examples of work or tasks include, but are not limited to, assisting individuals who are blind or have low vision with navigation and other tasks, alerting individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing to the presence of people or sounds, providing non-violent protection or rescue work, pulling a wheelchair, assisting an individual during a seizure, alerting individuals to the presence of allergens, retrieving items such as medicine or the telephone, providing physical support and assistance with balance and stability to individuals with mobility disabilities, and helping persons with psychiatric and neurological disabilities by preventing or interrupting impulsive or destructive behaviors. The crime deterrent effects of an animal's presence and the provision of emotional support, well-being, comfort, or companionship do not constitute work or tasks for the purposes of this definition.</p>
<p class="noindent">No similar definition exists under Title I.</p>
<p class="noindent">Commission regulations are short on discussion as it relates to service animals and reasonable accommodations, but some tangential discussion can be found in Regulations to Implement the Equal Employment Provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as Amended, 29 CFR 1630.2(j)(1)(vi): Mitigating Measures:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Amendments Act provides an "illustrative but non-comprehensive list of the types of mitigating measures that are not to be considered." <span class="Italic">See</span> 2008 Senate Statement of Managers at 9. Section 1630.2(j)(5) of the regulations includes all of those mitigating measures listed in the ADA Amendments Act's illustrative list of mitigating measures, including reasonable accommodations (as applied under title I) or "auxiliary aids or services" (as defined by 42 U.S.C. 12103(1) and applied under titles II and III).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since it would be impossible to guarantee comprehensiveness in a finite list, the list of examples of mitigating measures provided in the ADA and the regulations is non-exhaustive. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2008 House Judiciary Committee Report at 20. The absence of any particular mitigating measure from the list in the regulations should not convey a negative implication as to whether the measure is a mitigating measure under the ADA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2008 Senate Statement of Managers at 9.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, the fact that mitigating measures include "reasonable accommodations" generally makes it unnecessary to mention specific kinds of accommodations. Nevertheless, the use of a service animal, job coach, or personal assistant on the job would certainly be considered types of mitigating measures, as would the use of any device that could be considered assistive technology, and whether individuals who use these measures have disabilities would be determined without reference to their ameliorative effects. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2008 House Judiciary Committee Report at 20; 2008 House Educ. &#x0026; Labor Rep. at 15. Similarly, adaptive strategies that might mitigate, or even allow an individual to otherwise avoid performing particular major life activities, are mitigating measures and also would not be considered in determining whether an impairment is substantially limiting. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Other Commission guidance acknowledging the use of service animals as a form of reasonable accommodation includes <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (October 2, 2017):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Leave</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Permitting the use of accrued paid leave, or unpaid leave, is a form of reasonable accommodation when necessitated by an employee's disability. An employer does not have to provide paid leave beyond that which is provided to similarly-situated employees. Employers should allow an employee with a disability to exhaust accrued paid leave first and then provide unpaid leave.(49) For example, if employees get 10 days of paid leave, and an employee with a disability needs 15 days of leave, the employer should allow the individual to use 10 days of paid leave and 5 days of unpaid leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employee with a disability may need leave for a number of reasons related to the disability, including, but not limited to:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">training a service animal (e.g., a guide dog);...</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission's Questions &#x0026; Answers about Blindness and Vision Impairments in the Workplace and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (May 7, 2014), notes:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">10.&#x2003;What types of reasonable accommodations may employees with visual disabilities need?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Some employees may need one or more of the following accommodations:</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> modification of employer policies to allow use of a guide dog in the workplace</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">&#x2022;</span> time off, in the form of accrued paid leave or unpaid leave if paid leave has been exhausted or is unavailable</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Example 9: An employer provides a total of three weeks of leave (sick and annual leave) per employee each year. An employee with a degenerative eye condition has, over time, lost most of her vision and has decided to start using a guide dog. Training the guide dog will require her to attend a six-week residential program. Although the six weeks of leave that are needed exceed the amount of leave provided to each employee, the employer must provide additional unpaid leave as a reasonable accommodation as long as it would <span id="Page_1400"></span>not result in undue hardship. The same rule would apply if the employee needs time off for treatment related to a visual disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">Meaningful Commission decisions are equally difficult to come by. The published few are discussed below.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Andolino v. Postmaster General</span>, 01944544 (1996), the Commission approved the use of a hearing dog as a reasonable accommodation. The agency was not asked to provide such a dog, only to permit the employee to use her own dog on agency premises. The agency argued that its provision of physical assistance and an interpreter constituted sufficient accommodation. The Commission rejected the agency's argument in <span class="Italic">Andolino</span>, noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case at hand, appellant, in making her request for accommodation, stated that a hearing ear dog would allow her to travel safely to and from work, and move safely about the facility. Specifically, appellant indicated that the dog would alert her to emergency alarm signals. The Commission notes that the Manager of Safety and Health admitted that appellant's view of the alarm warning lights is blocked, and the agency does not dispute appellants assertion that lights were not installed in the rest rooms, locker room, or break rooms. Thus, appellant articulated a nexus between the requested accommodation and her employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated, there is no evidence that the Postmaster or other management official questioned appellant's rationale for requesting a hearing ear dog. Instead, the agency denied appellant's request, asserting that allowing appellant to bring the dog to work would constitute an undue hardship. Specifically, the agency stated that there was insufficient space for the dog in appellant's work area, and that the dog could create a distraction. However, the AJ determined that it appeared from the record that there would be sufficient space under appellant's desk or case for the dog. In addition, appellant stated that the dog is trained to remain quiet, and stay near her. Further, it is reasonable to conclude that appellant would be able to feed and walk the dog during her breaks. While the agency asserted that it would be burdensome to train all employees at the facility in question regarding the dog, the agency has presented no evidence to support such an assertion. The Trainer indicated that such training would comprise only one thirty-minute discussion. In addition, the agency could thereafter include the information in its employee orientation program. Finally, while the agency stated that other employees may be allergic to the dog, such an assertion is, at best, speculative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the agency stated that appellant was provided with an interpreter for meetings, and safety talks, that action does not address appellant's concerns. In addition, the Commission finds that the buddy system initiated by the agency does not constitute reasonable accommodation. It is noted that the two individuals in question are both male, and would not be able to enter the rest room to notify appellant if an alarm sounded. The record further reveals that, on at least one occasion, employees failed to locate appellant in the rest room during a fire drill. Accordingly, based upon a review of the record herein, the Commission finds that the agency failed to reasonably accommodate appellant's disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission reversed the agency's finding that it did not unlawfully deny the complainant's request to bring a medical alert dog to work in <span class="Italic">Thersa E. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120182764 (2021). The complainant explained that she suffered from four strokes and that the dog was trained to alert her to a possible stroke so that she could take medication to prevent such a recurrence. After engaging in the interactive process, answering many questions about the dog, providing proof of the dog's training and doctor's letters, the agency denied the request, concluding that there was "no nexus between [Complainant's] medical condition and request accommodation." The agency, instead, noted other ways the complainant could monitor her condition and suggested other possible forms of accommodation. The Commission disagreed in <span class="Italic">Thersa E</span>.:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, it is undisputed that Complainant is a qualified individual with a disability. Complainant asked the Agency to accommodate her disability by permitting her to bring her medical alert dog to work. The Agency denied Complainant's request because, according to the February 9, 2017, letter from HR Manager 2, the DRAC concluded that there was no nexus between her medical condition and the requested accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with the DRAC's conclusion. It is undisputed that Complainant experiences atrial fibrillation, has had strokes, and is at risk of having additional strokes. Complainant provided the DRAC with a list of dates and times when her dog alerted her to a-fib episodes. She also provided medical documentation establishing the connection between the a-fib and her request to have the dog: in a statement dated August 31, 2015,9 Physician 2 expressly stated that a "trained atrial fibrillation detection dog is recommended to help detect atrial fibrillation in this high risk patient and reduce stroke risk"; in a May 2, 2016, Patient Summary, Physician 2 noted that Complainant brought her "afib service dog" to her medical appointment, the dog alerted her to a-fib twice in the past month, and each episode lasted for approximately 15 minutes; Physician 1 wrote in the April 27, 2016, FMLA form that Complainant had "a rescue dog in training to recognize her a-fib"; and Physician 3 noted in the November 26, 2016, Patient Summary that Complainant's dog was alerting her to a-fib episodes approximately every two weeks.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, there is no explanation in the record for why Physician 2, during his conversation with the DRAC, purportedly contradicted his written comments in the statement dated August 31, 2015, and the May 2, 2016, Patient Summary. Those documents expressly refer to Complainant's use of a dog to detect atrial fibrillation. Although Trainer 1 purportedly told the DRAC that she did not know of anyone who had trained a dog to detect atrial fibrillation, Complainant stated in her sworn affidavit that her medical alert dog alerts her to a-fib. Even if HR Manager 2 accurately described the DRAC's conversation with Physician 2 and Trainer 1, we find that the preponderance of the evidence establishes a direct nexus between Complainant's request to bring her medical alert dog to work and her heart condition/atrial fibrillation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that the Agency did not offer Complainant an effective alternative accommodation. In the February 9, 2017, letter, HR Manager 2 suggested that leave or the use of a personal monitoring device might accommodate Complainant's condition. Although an employer may choose among effective accommodations, "forcing an employee to take leave when another accommodation would permit an employee to continue working is not an effective accommodation." <span class="Italic">Denese G. v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120141118 (Dec. 29, 2016) (citing <span class="Italic">Mamola v. Group Mfg. Servs., Inc</span>., 2010 WL 1433491 (D. Ariz. Apr. 9, 2010); <span class="Italic">Woodson v. Int'l Bus. Machines, Inc</span>., 2007 WL 4170560 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 19, 2007)). Thus, "absent undue hardship, an agency should provide reasonable accommodations that permit an employee to keep working rather than choosing to put the employee on leave." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, using leave in lieu of bringing a medical alert dog to work would not have been an effective alternative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, an offer to modify Complainant's assignment or schedule to enable her to use a personal monitoring device does not constitute an offer of an effective alternative accommodation. There is no evidence that Complainant sought to use such a device. In fact, on appeal, Complainant argues that a monitoring device would not alert her to atrial fibrillation. The Agency's role is to determine whether it can provide an effective accommodation without incurring an undue hardship. It is not the Agency's role to dictate what sort of assistive or monitoring device/animal Complainant chooses to use or otherwise to determine how Complainant monitors her heart condition. That decision rests with Complainant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This is not a situation, such as that presented in Vina D. where the complainant rejected an agency's offer of an accommodation that would have eliminated the barrier to equal employment opportunity. Complainant sought permission to bring her medical alert dog to work so that the dog could alert her to episodes of atrial fibrillation. Based on the evidence before us, we find that the Agency's suggested alternatives would not have alerted her to a-fib episodes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that, in its final decision, the Agency stated that there was no evidence that Complainant's atrial fibrillation or the lack of a medical alert dog prevented Complainant from performing the essential functions of her position. The DRAC, however, did not base its decision on Complainant's ability to perform essential functions. Moreover, the issue here is whether the Agency could have provided Complainant with "a change in the work environment...that enables an individual with a disability to enjoy equal employment opportunities." <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. pt. 6130 app. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o). The Agency did not do so. Just as an employer, absent undue hardship, should permit an individual who is blind to use a guide dog at work or an individual with a disability requiring medication during work hours to use a refrigerator to store medicine, so too should the Agency have allowed Complainant to bring her medical alert dog to work. Unlike the agency in <span class="Italic">Conley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, the Agency here did not offer Complainant an effective alternative accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we find that the Agency has not shown that allowing Complainant to bring her medical alert dog to work would have resulted in an undue hardship. The Agency did not base its denial of Complainant's request on the difficulty or expense that the requested accommodation would have entailed. The DRAC representatives specifically requested information about the dog's training and asked to observe Complainant and her dog in the workplace. Yet, nothing in HR Manager 2's February 9, 2017, letter stated that having the dog in the workplace would have caused any difficulty. Similarly, nothing in the letter stated that the Agency would have incurred any costs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having considered the evidence of record and based on the specific circumstances presented in this case, we find that the Agency unlawfully denied Complainant a reasonable accommodation for her disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, compensatory damages may be awarded for pecuniary losses, emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life. An agency, however, is not liable for compensatory damages in cases of disability discrimination where it demonstrates that it made a good faith effort to accommodate the complainant's disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1401"></span>In this case, Complainant requested permission to bring her medical alert dog to work in April 2016. The OIC did not meet with Complainant until June 10, 2016, and the DRAC did not ask Complainant for additional information until July 13, 2016. The Agency then waited until September 9, 2016, to request more information. Complainant completed a PS Form 2488 on September 17, 2016, and she met with DRAC representatives on November 16, 2016. Even though the Agency's February 9, 2017, decision was only three weeks after the DRAC representatives' January 18, 2017, teleconference with Physician 2 and Trainer 1, it was ten months after Complainant made her request. Given the two-month delay between Complainant's request and her meeting with the OIC, as well as the Agency's long delays in requesting additional information, we find that the Agency failed to make good-faith efforts to provide Complainant with a reasonable accommodation. Accordingly, we find that Complainant is entitled to compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="noindent">Like all reasonable accommodation requests, employees must be able to establish how the service animal will assist the complainant to perform the essential functions of the position. In <span class="Italic">Kathie N. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 2019003312 (2020), the service animal, according to the complainant, was "scent-trained to recognize chemical shifts in her body when she was escalating into anxiety or panic attacks" and helped to calm her in those instances. The agency provisionally allowed the complainant to bring her trained service dog to work with her. When the dog proved to be ill-trained and disruptive, the agency terminated the accommodation in favor of other options. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Kathie N.</span> found insufficient evidence to support a nexus between the service dog as an accommodation and the complaint's work performance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, in its final decision, the Agency has expressly conceded that Complainant is a qualified individual with a disability. Moreover, the record showed that Complainant's accommodation request to have her service dog allowed in the office was temporarily approved. However, it was soon determined by management that the dog was disruptive to the office because the dog barked and was not sufficiently controlled by Complainant, and the trial accommodation was rescinded.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to S2, Complainant had to leave the meeting on October 18, 2017, after about 30 minutes, because of the dog's barking. S2 also testified that on other occasions, S2 heard the dog barking in the office. Finally, at the October 24 meeting to discuss the matter, S2 stated the dog barked and jumped up on Complainant and she seemed unable to control the dog.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that it had a written policy that provided for the removal of service animals from Agency property if the animal was not adequately under the control of the handler. Under this policy, examples of a service animal not being under control are barking not brought under immediate control or the animal jumping on individuals or furniture. The Agency point out that its policy mirrors guidance on service animals issued by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) as part of its implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The Agency pointed to DoJ guidance that provides that a service animal may be removed from the premises if the animal's handler does not or cannot take effective action to control it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, it is undisputed that because of Complainant's dog's training, barking was a possible and, in fact, a probable occurrence in the office. Moreover, management witnesses pointed to occasions where Complainant was unable to stop the dog's barking. Similarly, it was likely that the dog, when sensing Complainant was becoming anxious, would routinely jump up on her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission has held that a complainant requesting the use of a service dog as an accommodation must establish that the dog is necessary for the performance of the essential duties of his or her position. <span class="Italic">See Jacques v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120071612 (March 8, 2010) (accommodation of a service dog was denied to a complainant with a severe hearing loss where the dog would be confined to the postal vehicle and the complainant failed to identify a need for the presence of the dog to perform his essential job functions); <span class="Italic">Struthers v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A40043 (June 29, 2006), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520069311 (March 7, 2007) (complainant was not entitled to the accommodation of a service dog where she did not establish a nexus between an alleged inability to interact with coworkers and the request for an assistance dog). In the present case, Complainant has failed to provide evidence to adequately establish the need for the presence of her dog in order to assist her in performing the essential functions of her position. Without more evidence in support of a nexus between the performance of her duties and her request to bring the dog to work, we cannot reasonably conclude that the Agency's decision to terminate its trial approval constitutes an unlawful failure to accommodate her disability in violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, that record establishes that the Agency offered Complainant an alternative accommodation--the use of annual leave, sick leave, or leave without pay when she felt that she would be stressed or might experience a panic attack. While Complainant maintained that this was not effective, she failed to give any reason why it would not work. The Commission however, has long held that a complainant is entitled to an effective reasonable accommodation, but not necessarily the accommodation of their choice. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.9; EEOC <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, at Question 9 (October 17, 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Meaghan F. v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 2019005325 (2021) (finding agency did not improperly deny complainant's request for an emotional support dog on a permanent basis where that accommodation was allowed on a trial basis and it did not prove effective in enabling the complainant to perform the essential functions of her position).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dona A. v. Social Security Administration</span>, 2022000745 (2022), the Commission reversed the AJ's summary judgment decision in favor of the agency where 'significant issues of material fact remained.' In particular, the missing analysis included whether the complainant had a medical need for a service animal, whether the animal qualified as a service animal and whether the agency fulfilled its obligations under the Rehabilitation Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Medical Need for Service Dog</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that Complainant has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Additionally, both parties agree that Complainant's mental health conditions affect her energy, concentration, sleep patterns, memory, thinking, emotional states (causes fear), and her motivation to move. Finally, there is no dispute that Complainant is otherwise qualified for her job. Therefore, the record supports that Complainant is a qualified individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On February 27, 2019, Complainant filed a reasonable accommodation request, and subsequently received extensions by the Agency in April and May 2019 to submit additional medical documentation. The request identified Complainant as being diagnosed with PTSD, MDD, GAD, and ADHD, and requested fifteen accommodations including the use of a service dog. On the request, Complainant provided the following judication for her need for a service dog:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">assist to regain control during a mental/emotional crises and fear by recovering orientation of time and place. Promotes energy levels to rise, engage social interaction and preventing social withdrawal, and balance assistance due [to] dizziness and occasional balance challenges.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the parties dispute whether Complainant's need for a service dog is based on a medical professional's determination or Complainant's personal belief. The record contains a May 2, 2019 letter from Complainant's psychiatrist. The letter states that Complainant has been diagnosed with Major Depression Recurrent Moderate Intensity, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, ADHS Combined Type and Chronic PTSD. The letter further states:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Patient will benefit from accommodations to help with the above diagnoses which will lead to problems with intense and persistent fear, irregular sleep patterns, difficulties with concentration and difficulties with emotional regulation when under perceived/actual threats or insecurities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The letter next lists six accommodations which would help Complainant 'perform optimally at work.' The sixth accommodation listed was use of a service dog. Specifically, the psychiatrist notes, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Patient reports a lot of relief in symptoms when she has her pet with her. Patient reports that her pet is able to identify and wake her up when she is having nightmares. Patient feels that having her pet may help with the stress level at work. Patient may have this opportunity at work if such accommodation is at all possible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the language used in describing Complainant's need for a service dog is based on Complainant's personal belief that her dog would help alleviate her stress. In contrast, Complainant argues that the psychiatrist noted that use of a service dog was one of six possible accommodations that would help treat Complainant's mental conditions, and therefore, the psychiatrist recommended the service dog accommodation based on a medical need.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ determined that this medical documentation was not sufficient because the psychiatrist did not state that use of a service dog 'would solve the problem [i.e. Complainant's fear, sleep issues, and stress].' However, we note that the psychiatrist never indicated that any of the six recommended accommodations would solve Complainant's mental condition. Rather, the psychiatrist states that these accommodations would help Complainant 'perform optimally.'</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further note that the AJ did not address additional medical documentation in the record supporting that other medical professionals determined that Complainant's mental condition necessitated use of a service dog as an accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1402"></span>A May 1, 2019 letter from another physician, who was also treating Complainant's mental conditions, recommended and explained that use of a service dog 'would provide [Complainant] with a sense of protection and support by preventing triggers, as well as providing comfort in the event of triggers.' Additionally, a June 11, 2019 letter from Complainant's mental health counselor stated, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The service dog will be able to keep her focus on work, minimize episodes and alleviate [Complainant's] GAD and MDD. Studies have demonstrated that service dogs can help to eliminate environmental triggers associated with PTSD. In [Complainant's] case, the service dog would provide a sense of psychological support by preventing triggers as well as comfort in the event of triggers. The service dog would provide social stimulation and social interaction as well as assisting [Complainant] to come back from crisis and mental traumatic memories appearance [sic] during work hours. This would positively influence her mental and emotional strength during daily activities</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, all three medical professionals consistently identified the benefits of a service dog to accommodate Complainant's mental disabilities. Therefore, contrary to the AJ's finding, our review of the record reflects that there is a genuine dispute about whether or not Complainant provided sufficient medical documentation to allow the Agency to reasonably conclude that a service dog was an effective accommodation allow Complainant to perform the essential functions of her position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Service Dog Qualifications</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ determined that documentation in the record failed to reflect that Complainant's dog was properly trained or qualified to work as a service animal. Here, the Agency defined a service animal as specifically trained to complete particular functions to calm individuals with emotional, social, or cogitative disabilities. By contrast, the Agency characterized Complainant's dog as a pet or an untrained 'emotional support' animal not covered by the Rehabilitation Act. In agreeing with the Agency, the AJ noted that documentation in the record only indicated that Complainant's dog had 'initiated,' but had not completed, the necessary training to qualify as a service animal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, our review of the record supports otherwise. A copy of a July 12, 2019 letter from the Landheim Training and Boarding Center reflects that Complainant's two dogs 'have initiated service dog training to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with psychiatric and neurological disabilities as established under the ADA [Americans with Disabilities Act] definition of a service animal.' Additionally, the letter indicates that Complainant had received instruction in training her dogs in the following relevant skills related to Complainant's mental condition: 'laying across handler [Complainant] to provide Deep Pressure Therapy; bracing during balance loss; interrupt Dissociative episodes; interrupt freezing episodes; and interrupt fear.'</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, our review supports that there is sufficient documentation of record to create a genuine issue of fact as to whether Complainant's dog met the Agency's qualifications to work as a service animal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Undue Burden/Effective Alternative Accommodations</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that on February 28, 2020, the Agency's National Reasonable Accommodation Coordinator issued a final determination on Complainant's reasonable accommodation requests.7 Specifically, the Agency granted Complainant's requests to use leave without pay as needed, as well as her request not to switch her schedule with another employee if she arrived to work late. However, the Agency declined Complainant's remaining accommodation requests. Regarding Complainant's request for a service dog, the Agency explained that the medical documentation submitted was 'insufficient to establish that bringing [her] emotional support of service animal to work is necessary to enable [her] to perform the essential functions of [her] job.' In addition, the Agency indicated its belief that Complainant's dog was not a service animal, but an emotional support dog.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a general rule, an Agency can either accept an employee's reasonable accommodation request or demonstrate that the request would cause an undue hardship. Here, the Agency denied the request. However, the AJ's decision has failed to address what difficulties or hardships the Agency could have faced if it had granted Complainant's accommodations, including the use of her dog. The Area Director testified that Complainant's request for an 'emotional support dog' was problematic because her position required that she interview the public face-to-face, and even if the dog was muzzled, there was no barrier between the dog and the public. In response, Complainant noted in her December 4, 2020 affidavit that during her face-to-face interactions with claimants, she was required to serve claimants who entered the office with service dogs and emotional support birds without any physical barrier provided by the Agency separating her from the claimants' service animals. Moreover, the record contains testimony from Complainant's second level supervisor, the District Manager, indicating that the Agency's Chicago office had a similar employee with a service dog and the office had a barrier wall to separate the Claims Specialist (and the service dog) from the public. While there was apparently no such barrier currently at the Hammond Office, the Agency provided no explanation for why one could not be installed if necessary. In sum, there is adequate support for a finding that there remain unresolved issues concerning whether or not granting Complainant's accommodation request would have caused an undue hardship for the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While avoiding the undue hardship analysis in her decision, the AJ focused on the Agency's decision to offer Complainant alternative accommodations to the service dog such as unpaid breaks, a quieter workspace, and a privacy canopy over her desk.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We acknowledge that although protected individuals are entitled to reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act, they are not necessarily entitled to their accommodation of choice. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Notice No. 915.002, Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act (October 17, 2002) ('Guidance'), Question 9. However, alternative proposed accommodations must be 'effective.' <span class="Italic">See U.S. Airways v. Barnett</span>, 535 U.S. 391, 400(2002). 'An ineffective 'modification' or 'adjustment' will not accommodate a disabled individual's limitations.' <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In the context of job performance, this means that a reasonable accommodation enables the individual to perform the essential functions of the position. <span class="Italic">See</span> Guidance. Here, there remains a significant unresolved issue of how the alternative accommodations proffered by the Agency would have been an effective alternative to the ones Complainant requested.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, significant issues of the material fact remain in dispute in this case, including whether Complainant had a medical need for a service animal; whether Complainant's dog qualified as a service animal; and whether the Agency fulfilled its obligations under the Rehabilitation Act to provide Complainant with effective alternative accommodations. Therefore, we find that a decision by summary judgment should not have been granted in this case and a hearing is required.</p>
<p class="noindent">Also, like any request for reasonable accommodation, agencies may request medical documentation to support a complainant's request to use a service dog at work. The Commission in <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120132519 (2013), rejected the complainant's denial of reasonable accommodation claim where the complainant failed to provide medical documentation "specifically explaining how the use of the service animal would assist complainant in her position." <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Ayesha W. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 2019001899 (2019) (finding no disability related harassment when, on four occasions, supervisors attempted to persuade the complainant to maintain better control over her poorly behaved service dog).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Vina D. v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120150054 (2017), a hearing-impaired complainant began bringing her dog to work. Her supervisor told her that she could not bring the dog to work. When the complainant explained that the dog was being trained as her service dog, the supervisor asked for specific information related to the dog including the type of tasks the dog was trained to perform, how those tasks would assist the complainant to complete her work, and whether there were other accommodation options to address her needs. The agency denied the complainant's request to have her dog in the workplace, noting that the "dog did not meet the statutory definition of a 'service animal' because the dog was not yet 'fully trained to assist the complainant with her essential work functions.'" The agency proposed alternative accommodations. Ultimately, the complainant claimed that the agency's refusal to allow her dog at the workplace denied her a reasonable accommodation. Because the alternative accommodations were effective, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Vina D.</span> disagreed and ruled in favor of the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Loats v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120130255 (2013), the Commission found that the complaint stated a claim under the Rehabilitation Act when an agency-controlled lodge required that the complainant provide certification that his service animal was not a pet and, as a result, delayed the check-in process.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where an agency refuses the reasonable accommodation request of a qualifying employee, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employee as a result of the agency's failure are compensable. In <span class="Italic">Thersa E. v. Postmaster General</span>, 2021005121 (2022), for instance, the Commission awarded the complainant $4,650 in pecuniary damages for dog-walking services for the period of time that the complainant was not permitted to bring his service dog to work:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the cost of a dog walker for the period of time Complainant's service dog was not able to accompany her to work is an out-of-pocket expense caused by the Agency's discriminatory actions. While the Agency argues that employing a dog walker is not an inherent part of being a dog owner, this is not a relevant observation. In the present case, Complainant would not have had to employ a dog walker but for the Agency's refusal to allow her service dog to accompany her to work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Agency's insistence that employing a service to walk a dog during the day is not a part of dog ownership is both subjective and irrelevant to the current case. The ownership of a service dog is wholly separate from owning a family pet which may in theory stay home throughout the day without being walked while an individual attends <span id="Page_1403"></span>work. In contrast, a service dog by nature is expected to go everywhere with its owner throughout the day, including work, and would not be expected to remain home unattended, immobile. Furthermore, Complainant required the use of her service dog and sought a reasonable accommodation to allow the service dog to accompany her to work. Therefore, if not for the Agency's denial of reasonable accommodation, she would have had her service do with her at work. In light of the Agency's denial of reasonable accommodation, we find that Complainant was forced to leave her service dog at home for the duration of the workday.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As such, based on the Agency's violation of the Rehabilitation Act, Complainant was required to employ a dog walker to ensure her service dog was receiving proper attention and care. We note that this dog is more than a mere pet in the present case and serves a valuable function to Complainant. In this light, it is also understandable that Complainant would be inclined to provide care for her service dog while she was at work wherein the dog was not allowed until 2021.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has also argued that there is no record evidence of the amount paid to walk Complainant's dog. However, while the arrangement to walk her dog was provided by an acquaintance rather than an official service, Complainant has submitted a document which indicates that she paid a dog walker a $5.00 fee per day, five days a week, since June 2016, totaling in $4,200.00. As such, we find that the Agency should incur the $4,200.00 paid by Complainant in order to care for her service dog while she was not able to bring him to work with her.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As there is no dispute regarding the Agency's award of $450.00 in damages awarded for psychiatric care, we find that Complainant is entitled to $4,650.00 in pecuniary damages.</p>
