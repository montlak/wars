<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-74"><span class="space">2.</span> Constructive Knowledge</h4>
<p class="noindent">In its decisions, the Commission has specifically rejected the notion of imputed knowledge of a disabling condition. In practice, however, it will examine the record to determine the extent of the agency's knowledge of a disabling condition. In effect, the Commission determines whether the agency knew or should have known of the disabling condition in sufficient detail to put it on notice of its obligation to consider reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is hard to determine precisely where the Commission draws the line, but there are situations where it essentially applies a constructive notice theory in finding that an agency had knowledge of the complainant's disability. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Randel v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 03960070 (1996) (finding that agency officials had sufficient notice of the complainant's disability where a medical certificate submitted in support of a leave request stated that the complainant suffered from depression, was under medication and was receiving treatment).</p>
<p class="noindent">Analyzing the circumstances of the disabling condition itself, the Commission in <span class="Italic">Kristie D. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 2019002875 (2019), determined that the agency had knowledge:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1992, the Rehabilitation Act was amended to clarify that the standards set out in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) applied to complaints of discrimination based on disability by federal employees or applicants for employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992, Pub. L. 102-569, 106 Stat. 4344, 4424 (1992) (codified as amended at 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791(g)); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(b). Moreover, the events in the instant case arose after January 1, 2009, the effective date of the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), which expanded the definition of disability under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. The primary purpose of the ADAAA is to make it easier for people with disabilities to obtain protection under the ADA. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.1(c)(4). Consistent with the ADAAA's purpose of reinstating a broad scope of protection under the ADA, the definition of "disability" shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether agencies have complied with their obligations and whether discrimination has occurred, not whether the individual meets the definition of disability. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The question of whether an individual meets the definition of disability should not demand extensive analysis. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under EEOC regulations implementing the ADAAA, an individual with a disability is one who:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;has a record of such an impairment; or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Major life activities include, but are not limited to: caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, sitting, reaching, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, interacting with others, and working. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(i)(1)(i). The term "substantially limits" shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(i).

An impairment need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity in order to be considered substantially limiting. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, we find that Complainant has established that she is an individual with a disability protected by the Rehabilitation Act under the expansive definition set forth in the ADAAA, and the Agency has clearly erred in finding otherwise. In so finding, the record reflects that while Complainant was deployed with the Army overseas she was diagnosed with PTSD, and a depressive disorder due to the death of her daughter. The record shows that Complainant did not pass the Army's medical section upon her return from deployment and was placed in the Army's WTU where she received medical treatment for her PTSD and her depressive disorder. Complainant then notified the Agency and S1 of her placement in the WTU and that she would not be returning to the Agency until her treatment through the WTU was completed. The Army further provided the Agency and S1 with its orders that Complainant's treatment with the WTU would be extended for further medical treatment. The record reflects that Complainant had been taking medications, going to therapy, and she was later provided with a therapy dog. Complainant averred that her conditions impact her life every single day, and it's "very hard to manage and to move on with [her] life to focus." ROI, at 252.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the record also establishes that it was common knowledge among S1, C1, and C2 that Complainant had medical conditions associated with her deployment in the Army. We note that S1 was in constant contact with Complainant about her delay in returning to work and he also received documentation from the Army about Complainant's medical status. C1 and C2 specifically attested that S1 repeatedly made comments about her extended absence in relation to her conditions. We note that S1 admitted to saying that Complainant was "milking the system," and both C1 and C2 attested that S1 would frequently make statements implying that she was faking her illness or stretching out the treatment for her illness to delay her return. Both C1 and C2 believed that S1's repeated comments about Complainant's medical conditions were both untruthful and inappropriate. In addition, Complainant averred that she had been aware of S1's inappropriate comments about her medical conditions, and therefore stopped going to therapy to avoid further comments from S1. We therefore find the Agency's determination that no one who worked with Complainant was aware of her medical conditions to be dubious.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find it highly unlikely that S1 was unaware of Complainant's PTSD and depressive disorder, especially given his reported comments to C1 and C2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we find that Complainant was substantially limited in the major life activities of thinking and concentrating and that she has shown to be an individual with a disability protected by the Rehabilitation Act under the expansive definition set forth in the ADAAA. <span class="Italic">See Complainant v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0720060029 (Sep. 5, 2008) (finding substantial evidence in the record to support the Administrative Judge's determination that complainant was an individual with a disability because his PTSD substantially limited the major life activities of concentrating, focusing, thinking, and recalling). As such, we will consider the merits of her disability discrimination claims below.</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency's knowledge, as determined from a review of the surrounding circumstances, must amount to more than a mere suspicion of a disabling condition. In <span class="Italic">Brown v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 05921024 (1993), the Commission noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1182"></span>While the Commission agrees that a qualified individual with a disability should be reasonably accommodated, the agency's accommodation obligation arises only when the disability is known. Therefore, the Commission must examine the record to determine if the agency knew of appellant's disability at the time it made the determination to nonselect her for the position at issue. It is the position of the Commission that a known disability is one of which relevant agency officials have actual, rather than imputed, knowledge or notice. <span class="Italic">Floyd Stallworth v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05900416 (August 2, 1990); <span class="Italic">Daniel H. Gant v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01902828 (July 9, 1991). In this regard, the Commission must focus on the information available to the decision-maker at the time of her decision, as opposed to any information submitted into the record during the processing of this complaint. <span class="Italic">Mantolete v. Bolger</span>, 767 F.2d 1416, 1424 (9th Cir. 1985) (the asserted basis for an employer's decision not to hire an applicant is limited to the evidence relied on by the employer at the time the decision was made).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the previous decision correctly stated, the SO did have some information about appellant's medical condition. For example, the SO knew from reading appellant's letter to the Administrator that appellant had battled depression for two years without treatment prior to her resignation from Federal employment in 1987, and that appellant's illness had been brought on by a number of situational factors. The latter was reaffirmed by appellant's assertion during their interview that events in appellant's past, including the death of her father and a miscarriage, had caused appellant delayed grief. The SO stated that appellant told her she was taking medication, had been treated by a psychiatrist and a psychiatric nurse, and had undergone eight weeks of intensive group therapy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The previous decision noted that the SO also knew that appellant had raised the possibility of being hired under a special hiring authority for mentally restored individuals. However, the previous decision found that the SO's impression from appellant's interview was that appellant received about eight weeks of treatment for her depression, and that she was cured. The record does not indicate that appellant used the word "handicapped" during the interview, and, more importantly, appellant did not provide documentation of a disabling condition during or after the interview. The SO testified that as appellant described it, the illness was a "short-lived episode," and the SO did not consider it to be a permanent condition at the time of the interview. The Commission concludes, as did our previous decision, that although the SO was aware of appellant's assertion that she had a history of depression brought on by traumatic events in her personal life, this does not equate to knowledge on the part of the SO that appellant's depression was substantially limiting such that it would constitute a major impairment and render appellant an individual with a disability. The Commission concludes that the information relayed to the SO was insufficient to convey knowledge of a substantially limiting impairment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, even if the relevant agency official had actual knowledge of a substantially limiting mental impairment, which the Commission finds she did not, appellant introduced no evidence to agency officials beyond her own assertions to link her mental impairment to her spotty employment record. Appellant argued that she tended to leave positions when her condition worsened, that job-hopping was symptomatic of depression, and that she explained the link between her employment history and her medical condition to the SO. In fact, there is some evidence in her physician's letter of June 7, 1991, to support appellant's assertion. However, this evidence, like the evidence of appellant's disability, was not made available to the SO at the time of her nonselection decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The previous decision also noted that even if, as the AJ found, the agency in the person of the SO had reason to suspect a disabling condition, the requirement for actual knowledge discussed above requires more than mere suspicion. As the previous decision properly pointed out, imposing a duty to accommodate based only upon suspicion of a disability could lead an agency to make improper inquiries. In this case, the agency would have been required to investigate whether or not appellant, in fact, was an individual with a disability. This type of investigation would violate the prohibitions against preemployment inquiry found at EEOC Regulation 29 CFR 1613.706(a). As the previous decision stated, it follows that the agency, lacking actual knowledge of appellant's disability, was not required to ask appellant for medical documentation. The previous decision concluded, and the Commission agrees, that appellant failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination as she failed to supply enough information to agency officials to provide them with notice of her disabling condition, and thus, to trigger their duty to consider a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">(Footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">The knowledge required is on the part of the agency, however, and not any individual supervisor. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 0120132360 (2015) (supervisor's claim that he was unaware of the complainant's disability did not negate the fact that the agency was aware of the disability and its duty to provide accommodation was ongoing).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Botone v. Secretary of Interior</span>, 01952528 (1996), the Commission found the agency was not aware of the complainant's alcoholism when it removed him. The evidence established that there was one incident where the complainant exhibited confusion over the telephone and had slurred speech, he had a prolonged absence from work, and his mother told the agency her son was ill. In light of the complainant's otherwise good work history and the absence of any other symptoms or signs of alcoholism, this was insufficient to put the agency on notice of the complainant's disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that the agency has knowledge of some limitations imposed by a disability does mean that it has knowledge of all the limitations. For example, in <span class="Italic">Scheidt v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120130757 (2013), the supervisor knew the complainant had a back condition that placed standing, sitting, walking and lifting limitations on the complainant. The Commission found that the agency did not have notice, however, of a need for a schedule change as an accommodation where the complainant had not specifically requested such an accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent">A simple comment by a coworker that a complainant might have a "mental health problem" is not sufficient to put the agency on notice of a potential disability. In <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120081093 (2009), the complainant was sent home from a training when he appeared bleary-eyed and was observed slurring his speech and stumbling. At least one other employee told the complainant's supervisor that he "reeked of alcohol." Finding that his subsequent removal was not discriminatory, the Commission noted that the circumstances should not have put the agency on notice that the complainant was having a medication problem as he contended.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the absence of being expressly told of a complainant's disability, the determination of whether the agency should have known of the disability is a factual one. There is no easy rule to apply to such cases. However, a few episodes of unusual behavior generally will not be sufficient to put the agency on notice of the existence of a mental condition. Indeed, in <span class="Italic">Means v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 03940050 (1994), the Commission held that a supervisor is entitled to attribute a few episodes of unusual behavior to "external factors" rather than mental illness:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commission finds that petitioner's mental condition, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, bipolar disorder, renders him an individual with a disability within the meaning of the regulations. The Commission further finds, however, that petitioner failed to show that agency officials knew or should have known of his mental condition. First, petitioner himself testified that he never "directly" informed agency officials of his disability, and that he never considered advising them of same. Second, during petitioner's psychotic break in December 1989, the record shows that petitioner was not at work that week and that he did not return to work until January 3, 1990. Petitioner also testified that when he requested leave during that time, he wrote on the leave slip that he needed time off because he was tense and nervous. Moreover, the fact that petitioner requested 2.5 weeks of sick leave in January 1990 and submitted a doctor's statement on the letterhead of a mental health clinic--without more, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, a diagnosis--is not sufficient to put the agency on notice of his disorder. In this regard, we note that petitioner's supervisor indicated that petitioner did not request leave very often, nor did he ever ask petitioner why he was seeing a doctor. Moreover, we find that petitioner's other behavior, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, such as giving the twelve page-letter, the religious inscriptions, and the t-shirt to his supervisor--even considered in the aggregate--simply was not enough to alert agency officials to the fact that he has a mental disorder. That is, absent unusual behavior by an employee, an employer rightfully will attribute an employee's behavior to external factors--as when the supervisor concluded that petitioner's letter was in response to his performance appraisal--rather than to the existence of a mental or physical disorder unless the employee informs them otherwise.</p>
<p class="noindent">The entire burden to inform the agency of a disabling condition does not fall on the employee when the agency should be on notice of the disability. In <span class="Italic">Driscoll v. Department of Army</span>, 03850243 (1987), the Commission found that a supervisor's knowledge that the employee was reinstated as a "mentally restored" person under the agency "handicap program" was sufficient to put him on notice that current performance problems might be the result of the former mental condition. The Commission found that the supervisor was obligated to inquire into the employee's current medical status before proposing his removal. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Simandl v. Postmaster General</span>, 01962857 (1999), the Commission held that the employee's request for unscheduled leave to receive medical treatment should have put the agency on notice that there was a problem. However, in <span class="Italic">Palo v. Postmaster General</span>, 01992298 (2002), the Commission found the fact that the complainant noted on his employment application that he was a disabled veteran entitled to 10 preference points was insufficient to put the agency on notice of his disability. The Commission noted that a determination that an individual is disabled for other purposes does not establish that he or she is an individual with a disability under the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1183"></span>A complainant is not required to identify her disability with medical precision. <span class="Italic">Neal v. Postmaster General</span>, 01924024 (1993). In that case, the Commission found it was irrelevant whether the complainant properly identified her condition as sickle cell anemia or chronic degenerative disease. In either event, the condition substantially impaired a major life activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">That the agency denies knowledge of the disability is not dispositive of the issue. The Commission will look to the underlying facts to determine agency knowledge. <span class="Italic">White v. Department of Interior</span>, 03840007 (1987). In that case, the employee suffered from a learning disability and the employee's supervisor made numerous notations on performance evaluations of the employee's inability to understand written and oral instructions and to learn new tasks. Also, at the time of his proposed removal, the deciding official inquired whether the employee was able to understand what was expected of him. The Commission found the evidence of record did not support the agency's contention that it was unaware of the employee's disability.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a disciplinary action is based on conduct related to the disability, the issue is not whether the agency knew of the disability at the time the conduct occurred, but whether it was aware of the disability at the time it imposed discipline. <span class="Italic">Brooks v. USPS</span>, 01861322 (1987). The issue is not prevention of the conduct, but whether the complainant was treated the same as similarly situated employees. In the <span class="Italic">Brooks</span> case, the agency's policy of removing employees who engaged in physical assaults was mitigated when the agency believed that a disabling condition contributed to the conduct.</p>
