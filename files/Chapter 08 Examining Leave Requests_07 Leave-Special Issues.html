<h2 class="h2">SPECIAL ISSUES</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">As a federal manager, you are probably familiar enough with annual leave and sick leave to administer them without too much difficulty. But your supervisory duties also include the administration of less common forms of federal leave. Since these come up less often, you may not be as familiar with them.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You should get the details from your HR office whenever special leave issues arise, but we'll cover the basics of what you need to know about:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Leave transfers.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Military leave.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Court leave.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Home leave.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Funeral leave.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Bone marrow/organ donor leave.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Disabled veteran leave.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Excessive absence</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">"Excessive absence" or "excessive absenteeism" occurs when an employee has a long-term continuous absence from work with no foreseeable end in sight or has frequent unplanned absences from work. An employee's absence, by its very nature, adversely affects your agency's ability to accomplish its mission. Therefore, frequent and unscheduled absences, as well as prolonged absences with no end in sight, are a legitimate basis for proposing an adverse action against an employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Generally, an adverse action cannot be based on an employee's use of approved leave. However, there is an exception if the agency can show three things:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The employee was absent for compelling reasons beyond his control so that agency approval or disapproval was immaterial because the employee could not be on the job.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The absence or absences continued beyond a reasonable time, and the employee was warned that adverse action might be initiated unless the employee became available for duty on a regular, full-time, or part-time basis.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The position needed to be filled by an employee available for duty on a regular, full-time, or part-time basis.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">These three elements were developed in a 1984 decision by the Merit Systems Protection Board -- <i>Cook v. Department of the Army</i>. They are referred to as the "<i>Cook</i> criteria," and you may be familiar with the "<i>Cook</i> warning" or "<i>Cook</i> letter" (described below) that must be given to an employee before action can be taken against them for excessive absence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To be clear, the exception described in <i>Cook</i> only applies under unusual circumstances, such as when the employee is unable to return to duty because of the continuing effects of illness or injury.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Absence for compelling reasons beyond employee's control.</b> The first of the three criteria is usually proved with medical documentation. For example, the employee's medical documentation shows they cannot perform the essential functions of the position, they are unable to return to duty, and their absence has no foreseeable end.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Unreasonable absence and warning that adverse action might be initiated.</b> The second element has two parts. First, the agency must show that the absence has continued for an unreasonable period of time. Second, the agency must have issued the employee a warning notifying them that an adverse action may be taken against them if they do not return to work.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b><i>Cook</i> warning letter.</b> The warning given to the employee is the one you, as the manager, need to make sure is handled properly. Once you suspect an excessive absence situation is developing, contact HR to make them aware of what is going on and to discuss whether it's the appropriate time to prepare and provide to the employee a <i>Cook</i> letter. This notice is a core element of proof needed to prove an excessive absence charge. If it is not provided or the warning does not satisfy the requirements of <i>Cook</i>, the MSPB will reverse the action if the employee appeals.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Position needs to be filled by regularly available employee.</b> The third element can be satisfied when an employee's extensive absences undermine agency functioning and force other employees to take on significant additional responsibilities. Here are some examples of how this criterion has been met:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The agency is forced to spend considerable sums to transport staff from one office to another to take over the employee's assignments during an extended absence.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Given the nature of the work, the position must be filled by an employee who is available on a full-time basis without medical restrictions.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Other staff must assume the employee's responsibilities even though they lack the requisite specialized training for some of the duties.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> There is a high demand for services provided by the program in which the employee works, and the employee's absence impacted the program.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Caution:</b> An excessive absence charge must not rely on leave taken under the Family and Medical Leave Act. If the charge is based on more than one type of leave, including FMLA leave -- for example, sick leave, leave without pay, and FMLA leave -- the Merit Systems Protection Board will not include the FMLA leave in its calculation of how much time the employee was actually absent from work.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Failure to follow leave procedures</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies may impose reasonable conditions on leave requests in their leave policies. Employees are responsible for requesting leave in accordance with the agency's leave-requesting procedures and providing sufficiently detailed supporting documentation, such as a self-certification or a medical certification, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As a result, an employee can be disciplined for failure to follow policies for taking or requesting leave, even if the leave is ultimately approved, if the employee is clearly on notice of the requirements and of the likelihood of discipline for continued failure to comply.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Seriousness of the offense.</b> You might be wondering whether an employee's failure to follow leave procedures is serious enough to warrant removal of an employee. The Merit Systems Protection Board has found that an employee's failure to follow leave-requesting procedures can be serious where, for example, the employee improperly refused to communicate with the agency as required for weeks at a time, even though he may have been entitled to approved leave on the merits of his absence. This type of situation may prevent an agency from being able to plan for the employee's presence or absence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">However, an employee's failure to follow leave-requesting procedures is less serious when it's merely a technical error. For example, in one case, the MSPB found an agency acted unreasonably in not approving an employee's absence on leave without pay because he failed to request leave either through the agency's electronic timekeeping system or on Form SF-71 -- a minor, technical violation of the agency's leave policy. The board found it was clear from the doctor's letter to the agency that the employee needed additional leave, which was more fully explained in a timely joint response of the employee's doctor and counselor to the agency's request for information. The agency failed to show that the offense either adversely affected the employee's ability to perform his duties or resulted in specific harm to the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Merger with AWOL</b> charge. If you're considering charging an employee with both absence without leave and failure to follow leave procedures, you need to be careful about how you write the specifications. If the two charges are based on the same set of facts, and the employee appeals the action to the MSPB, the board will likely "merge" the two charges -- lump them together -- into a single charge. And if you can't prove one element of the single charge you're left with, the action will be reversed.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Leave transfer programs</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">What happens if you or one of your employees faces an emergency with no annual or sick leave available to provide needed time off work? Leave without pay is one answer, although an emergency may be a bad time for a drop in income.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But under certain circumstances, employees who have exhausted available sick and annual leave and are faced with personal or family medical emergencies may use donated or transferred leave. Donated leave may also be available under general emergency conditions, such as after a natural disaster.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When calculating your and your employees' leave availabilities, don't neglect leave transfer programs.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Emergency leave transfer.</b> After major disasters or emergencies declared by the president, the president may give the Office of Personnel Management the authority to establish an emergency leave transfer program. Initially, agencies with affected employees ask their unaffected employees to voluntarily donate annual leave and approve both donors and recipients. HR administers the program within your agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency notifies OPM that the amount of donated leave from its own employees is insufficient for the needs of its employees affected by the emergency, OPM may ask agencies governmentwide to call for donations by their employees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Leave transfer.</b> Employees may donate annual leave directly to individual employees with personal or family medical emergencies. Agencies must approve recipients and donors. The program is administered by HR.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">These rules apply:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Recipients must be expected to be absent from work without available paid leave for at least 24 hours, prorated for part-time employees.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Donors may not donate more than one-half of the annual leave they would accrue in a year. If an employee has "use or lose" annual leave available, the maximum donation is the lesser of one-half of the annual leave the employee would accrue in a leave year or the number of hours remaining in the leave year for which the employee is scheduled to work and receive pay.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A leave recipient using donated leave can accrue no more than 40 hours of annual leave and 40 hours of sick leave in "set-aside accounts." The leave in these accounts will be transferred to the employee's regular leave accounts when the medical emergency ends or if the employee exhausts all donated leave.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Any unused donated leave must be returned to the donor when the medical emergency ends.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Leave banks.</b> Many agencies have established "leave banks" to cover employees with personal or family medical emergencies who have run out of paid leave. These work in the same manner and with the same rules as leave transfers, but participating employees are not dependent on specific donors.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee becomes and remains a member of a leave bank by donating annually at least the amount of leave normally accrued in a pay period (four, six, or eight hours). The agency's leave bank board determines how much leave a member with a medical emergency may receive from the leave bank. Any unused leave is returned to the leave bank.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Leave transfers and FMLA.</b> The Family and Medical Leave Act entitles employees to leave without pay for certain purposes, including medical emergencies. However, the FMLA also allows employees to substitute annual leave and sick leave for LWOP. They may also substitute annual leave obtained through leave transfer programs.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Warning:</b> Participation as a donor in leave transfer programs is entirely voluntary. These programs present employees with an opportunity to help those in need, whether because of an individual emergency or because of a general disaster. As a manager, you should encourage participation, but you cannot order employees to donate. You should avoid even the appearance of pressure, or of favoritism toward a particular employee with a medical emergency. Consult HR.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Military leave</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Military leave is an excused absence to perform active or reserve military duties, or to participate in required military training, without charge to pay or annual leave.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">HR will take care of the precise calculations -- they can be tricky -- but you should be aware of the effect of military leave on your staffing situation. The following rules apply:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Employees may use up to a maximum of 15 days (120 hours) military leave per fiscal year for active duty, active duty training, and inactive duty training.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Although the normal federal leave year is a calendar year, the military leave year is the fiscal year.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Military leave is calculated in one-hour increments.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Earned military leave time that is not used within a fiscal year can be carried forward to the next fiscal year, to a maximum of 15 days.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Military leave is available only to employees who are appointed for one year or more. It is not available to short-term, temporary employees.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Leave allowances are prorated for long-term, part-time employees.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Employees must present official orders to qualify for military leave.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Employees who volunteer for military duty qualify for military leave.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Employees are entitled to a maximum of 22 days military leave per year in connection with emergency duty ordered by the president or the governor of a state.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Reserve and National Guard technicians may receive up to 44 days military leave per year for duty overseas under certain conditions.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Employees are entitled to receive their full civilian pay while on military leave, including overtime and premium pay.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Employees on extended absence for military duty are placed in LWOP status after their paid military leave allowance is exhausted.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Court leave</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Employees should be excused to serve as witnesses or perform jury duty in proceedings within a federal, state, county, or municipal court. This is generally known as court leave, and jury leave is a form of court leave.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">These principles apply:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Court leave is not necessary when an employee is required to serve as a witness for a federal, state, or local government in an official capacity. In that case, the employee is in normal pay status.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Employees are not entitled to court leave to serve as witnesses for a private party if a federal, state, or local government entity is a party to the proceedings.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Employees may receive leave to serve as witnesses on behalf of a private party if a government entity is not a party to the proceeding.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Employees are entitled to receive court leave when serving on jury duty. If an employee is excused from serving as a juror on a scheduled duty day, however, the employee is required either to return to work or take annual leave or leave without pay.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> An employee acting as a witness should either return to work once dismissed or take another form of leave.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Court leave may be granted only for hours in which the employee would otherwise be in a pay and duty status. To avoid undue hardship, an agency may adjust the schedule of an employee who works nights or weekends and is called to jury duty.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Employees must reimburse fees paid for service as a juror or witness to their agency. However, funds paid to jurors or witnesses in the nature of "expenses" (e.g., transportation) do not have to be reimbursed to the agency.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Leave for voting</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">To promote access to voting, employees should be granted administrative leave for the purpose of voting or serving as a non-partisan poll worker or non-partisan observer, subject to certain conditions and limitations. Your agency should inform employees of the availability of administrative leave for voting and non-partisan poll worker or non-partisan observer purposes.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Employees should obtain your approval before using administrative leave for voting purposes, so that it does not significantly disrupt agency operations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Voting.</b> Employees should be allowed to use up to four hours of administrative leave for voting in:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A federal general election.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A federal, state, local (i.e., county and municipal), tribal, or territorial level election event (including primaries and caucuses) that does not coincide with a federal general election day.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A federal special congressional election not held on the date of a federal general election.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">The administrative leave may be used for voting on the established election day or for early voting, whichever option is used by the employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Working or observing at the polls.</b> Employees also should be allowed to use up to four hours of administrative leave per leave year to serve as a non-partisan poll worker or to participate in non-partisan observer activities at the federal, state, local (i.e., county and municipal), tribal, and territorial level. This leave is in addition to any administrative leave an employee uses to vote.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Limitations and other considerations.</b> Scheduling of administrative leave for voting purposes is subject to the agency's determination that the employee can be relieved of duty during the specific period of time requested without significantly impairing mission-essential operations. However, agencies should strive to accommodate employee leave requests by making necessary operational adjustments.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Also be aware that:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> If less than four hours are needed to vote, you should grant only the needed amount of administrative leave to the employee.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Employees may use administrative leave for any travel time to and from the voting poll location.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Employees may use administrative leave to vote in each covered election event, but they are limited to four hours of administrative leave for voting per election event.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Home leave</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Home leave is a special type of leave earned by employees serving in regular overseas assignments. It is earned in addition to annual leave. It can generally only be granted after two years of continuous service abroad, at the discretion of the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Home leave can only be taken during or after an overseas assignment when it is anticipated that the employee will return to overseas duty; it must be taken in the United States or a U.S. territorial possession. Employees assigned abroad earn from five to 15 days home leave annually, depending on the overseas duty post.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Note:</b> Home leave does not apply to employees working in the continental United States, even if they must be away from their normal duty stations for extended periods. Employees in this situation must use annual leave.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Funeral leave</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Funeral leave is granted to an employee to make arrangements for or to attend the funeral of, or memorial service for, an immediate relative who died as a result of wounds, disease, or injury incurred while serving as a member of the armed forces in a combat zone.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"Armed forces" means the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, and includes the Reserve components, National Guard, and Air National Guard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You must approve this form of leave for an employee as needed and requested, but not for longer than three workdays for a single instance. The three days need not be consecutive, but if not, the employee needs to provide a good reason to permit funeral leave for nonconsecutive days.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies may require the employee to document her relationship to the immediate relative when requesting this type of leave and may request additional information in cases of suspected leave abuse. For the purposes of funeral leave, "immediate relatives" include:</p>
<ol class="num-r">
<li><span class="num-r">1.</span> Spouse and spouse's parents.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">2.</span> Sons and daughters, and their spouses.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">3.</span> Parents and their spouses.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">4.</span> Brothers and sisters, and their spouses.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">5.</span> Grandparents and grandchildren, and their spouses.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">6.</span> Domestic partner and domestic partner's parents, including domestic partners of any individual named in 2-5 above.</li>
<li><span class="num-r">7.</span> Any individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Body-Text">You can leave the precise interpretations up to HR, and you should whenever you have any questions, but in general a domestic partner for leave purposes is an adult living in a committed relationship with another adult. Both domestic partners of the same sex and of the opposite sex are included, including those living in relationships acknowledged by states as marriages or equivalent to marriages. The children of domestic partners are considered the equivalent of the employee's own children, and <i>in loco parentis</i> relationships are included under "parents" and "sons and daughters."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Note:</b> Funeral leave is sometimes confused with bereavement leave (sick leave which may be taken on the death of a family member).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Killed in the line of duty.</b> Federal law enforcement officers or federal firefighters may be excused from duty to attend the funeral of a fellow federal law enforcement officer or federal firefighter who was killed in the line of duty. This excusal is made without loss of or reduction in:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Pay.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Leave.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Credit for time or service.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Performance or efficiency rating.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body-Text">When excused to attend such services, it is considered to be an official duty of the officer or firefighter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">This does not apply to the death of a local or state officer. However, agencies have their own authority to grant excused time without charge to leave when they judge it in the interest of the agency to do so.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Bone marrow or organ donor leave</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">The federal government has taken a proactive role to encourage organ and bone marrow donations, making it easier for federal employees to become part of this lifesaving effort.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee may use up to seven days of paid leave each calendar year to serve as a bone marrow donor. An employee also may use up to 30 days of paid leave each calendar year to serve as an organ donor. Leave for bone marrow and organ donation is a separate category from annual and sick leave.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The law provides that an employee is entitled to use this leave without loss of or reduction in pay, leave to which he is otherwise entitled, credit for time or service, or performance or efficiency rating. Agencies are responsible for informing their employees of the entitlement to leave for bone marrow and organ donation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The length of absence for organ donation procedures will vary depending upon the medical circumstances of each case. For medical procedures and recuperation requiring absences longer than 30 days, agencies are encouraged to continue to accommodate employees by granting additional time off in the form of sick and/or annual leave, advance sick and/or annual leave, donated annual leave from the agency's leave transfer or leave bank programs, or leave without pay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The intent of this leave was to encourage the registration and donation of bone marrow by individuals who might not otherwise donate. The idea is that providing such an incentive to federal workers would increase the size and diversity of the donor registry.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>"Donation" for personal use.</b> An individual having bone marrow removed and stored for his own future use is not a "donor," and the benefit of seven days of paid time off was not intended for someone who is undergoing such a procedure for his own needs. Sick leave, annual leave, and advance annual and sick leave are available to an employee facing this type of medical procedure. In addition, leave donated under the federal leave sharing program and leave without pay under the Family and Medical Leave Act may be used if the condition meets the requirements of these programs.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Disabled veteran leave</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">The Wounded Warriors Federal Leave Act provides Title 5, U.S. Postal Service, and Postal Regulatory Commission veterans who have a service-connected disability rating of 30 percent or greater with access to up to 104 hours or 13 days of leave for medical treatment related to their disabilities during their first year of civilian employment. The purpose of disabled veteran leave is to help newly hired veterans who begin federal service without any sick leave but need medical treatment for their service-connected disabilities.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A service-connected disability must have been incurred or aggravated in the line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service. Agencies may require employees using disabled veteran leave to submit certification issued by a health care provider that they used the leave for purposes of receiving treatment for the service-connected disability.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Disabled veteran leave is a one-time benefit. Once an employee has been provided the leave benefit, he will not have any further entitlements to the benefit. Any leave not used during the employee's first year is forfeited.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>12-month eligibility period.</b> Agencies must credit newly hired regular, full-time employees who are veterans with a service-connected disability rating of 30 percent from the Veterans Benefits Administration with 104 hours of disabled veteran leave for a 12-month period beginning on the first date of employment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For employees who have a qualifying disability rating in effect before they are hired, the 12-month eligibility period begins on the date they are hired. Employees hired before a qualifying disability rating has been determined can establish eligibility for disabled veteran leave at a later time, but their eligibility period still expires one day before the one-year anniversary date of the first day of employment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Unused disabled veteran leave may not be cashed out and paid in a lump sum. If a change in an employee's disability rating during the eligibility period causes him to no longer have a qualifying service-connected disability, any unused disabled veteran leave must be forfeited.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Using disabled veteran leave.</b> An eligible employee must request disabled veteran leave in advance. The request must include a self-certification that the leave will be used for medical treatment of a qualifying service-connected disability, along with the days and hours of absence needed. Agencies can apply time limits for requests.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Employees do not have to request leave in advance if their need for leave is critical and not foreseeable, such as a medical emergency or an unexpected need for surgery. In this situation, employees must provide notice within a reasonable period of time.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Substitution of disabled veteran leave.</b> Employees can retroactively substitute disabled veteran leave for other forms of leave or time off taken for the purpose of receiving treatment for a qualifying disability when the leave or time off was taken during the employee's 12-month eligibility period for the medical treatment of a qualifying disability.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Retroactive substitution may be necessary because of the lag in time between an employee's filing of a claim with the VBA and the approval of that claim. The disability rating may be effective retroactive to the date the claim was filed, and the effective date may retroactively start the 12-month eligibility period.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency may require medical certification before approving retroactive substitution.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Employees not eligible for disabled veteran leave.</b> The following categories of employees are not eligible for disabled veteran leave:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Employees not covered under 5 USC Chapter 2105 (such as employees of Department of Defense nonappropriated fund instrumentalities).</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Employees not covered by a leave system (such as those with intermittent work schedules or leave-exempt presidential appointees).</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Employees under leave systems that are governed by an independent statutory authority (such as Federal Aviation Administration or Transportation Security Administration employees).</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Mistakes to avoid</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">These less common forms of federal leave can be tricky so seek the guidance of your HR office whenever they arise. Follow these tips to keep you out of trouble.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Do not:</b></p>
<ul class="bull">
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Pressure employees to donate to leave transfer programs.</b> You cannot order or otherwise pressure potential leave donors to donate. In particular, you must avoid the appearance of favoritism toward particular leave recipients.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Deny court leave because an employee works a night shift.</b> Although court leave may be granted only for hours in which the employee would otherwise be in a pay and duty status, to avoid undue hardship, an agency may adjust the schedule of an employee who works nights or weekends and is called to jury duty.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Confuse funeral leave with bereavement leave.</b> Funeral leave is a separate entitlement available on the death of a family member on active duty in a combat zone. Bereavement leave is a use of sick leave for bereavement purposes. The rules are distinct.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Approve bone marrow leave for an employee's personal use.</b> The benefit of seven days of paid time off was not intended for someone who is undergoing this procedure to store the bone marrow for his own future needs. Sick, annual, and advance annual and sick leave are available for this type of medical procedure.</li>
<li><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <b>Deny disabled veteran leave for unforeseen emergencies.</b> Employees do not have to request leave in advance if their need for leave is critical and not foreseeable, such as a medical emergency or an unexpected need for surgery. Notice must be provided within a reasonable period of time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Ask FMG</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Do employees have a right to receive donated leave?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> There is no general right. Recipients of donated leave must either be affected by a general emergency, such as a natural disaster, or by a personal or family medical emergency. They must also be approved as recipients by their agency. Leave transfers are administered for the agency by HR. Leave bank approval comes from the agency leave bank board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. A long-term employee who is in poor health has run out of paid leave. Can I order my employees to donate leave to him?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> No. Participation in leave transfer programs is always voluntary. You also need to avoid even the appearance of favoritism, however worthy or in need of help the employee is. Consult HR to learn about your options in this situation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Can I approve court leave when an employee works nights or weekends?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Yes. Although court leave may be granted only for hours in which the employee would otherwise be in a pay and duty status, to avoid undue hardship, you may adjust the schedule of an employee who works nights or weekends and is called to jury duty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. I thought bereavement was handled through sick leave. So what is "funeral leave"?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> Funeral leave is leave granted to a federal employee in connection with the funeral of, or memorial service for, an immediate relative who died as a result of wounds, disease, or injury incurred while serving as a member of the armed forces in a combat zone. It is separate from bereavement leave, where sick leave is used for bereavement purposes. These are two different entitlements, with distinct rules.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>Q. Can I authorize home leave for employees serving for extended periods in the continental United States if they must work far away from their normal duty stations?</b></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><b>A.</b> No. Home leave is for employees serving overseas only, typically available after two years of continuous service abroad. Employees working in CONUS will have to use annual leave.</p>
