<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-35"><span class="space">7.</span> Episodic Conditions; Conditions in Remission</h4>
<p class="noindent">Congress addressed two separate situations in one rule of construction in the ADAAA. The first situation involves conditions that are episodic in nature. These episodic or intermittent conditions created confusion under the ADA because <span id="Page_1122"></span>it was unclear both how often an episodic condition needed to be active in order to be considered substantially limiting and how long the episodes needed to last. Individuals with medical conditions that virtually incapacitated them during the active phase were found not to be individuals with disabilities because the condition was active only infrequently. Because they were not individuals with disabilities and, thus, did not qualify for protection under the ADA, they were not entitled to accommodation during the active phases of the condition.</p>
<p class="noindent">The rules of construction of the ADAAA now specifically provide that an "impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active." 42 USC 12102(4)(D). Prior to the amendment including episodic conditions based on the symptoms when the condition is active, the Commission had generally embraced that position but done little to clarify the parameters of when an episodic condition would be considered substantially limiting.</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, the Commission had held that the fact that a disabling condition was intermittent, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the symptoms wax and wane and were not disabling all of the time, did not prevent the employee from qualifying as an individual with a disability within the meaning of the Act. <span class="Italic">Jeffers v. Department of Navy</span>, 03840194 (1986). In that case, the complainant had a back condition that at times allowed him to perform the duties of his position and at times required his absence altogether from the workplace. The Commission sidestepped the issue of whether the complainant was substantially limited and determined that the agency could not reasonably accommodate the employee because the flare-ups of the condition followed no pattern and there was no restructuring of his position that could account for his erratic absences without placing an undue hardship on the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission had held, however, that the intermittent nature of a condition could prevent it from substantially limiting a major life activity. In <span class="Italic">Anderson v. National Gallery of Art</span>, 03910108 (1991), the complainant suffered from migraine headaches that occurred three or four times a year. During the attacks the complainant suffered vision and speech difficulties and was impaired for the remainder of the day. The Commission found the symptoms did not constitute a substantial limitation on major life activities because of their infrequency.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, in <span class="Italic">Omar v. Postmaster General</span>, 05920207 (1992), the Commission found the intermittent effects of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease substantially limited a major life activity since the disease was long-term and debilitating even though the symptoms were intermittent. The symptoms consisted of severe pelvic pain that sometimes rendered the employee unable to function.</p>
<p class="noindent">That the intermittent nature of the condition was exacerbated by working conditions also did not remove it from the ambit of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">Thompkins v. Secretary of Navy</span>, 01872684 (1988). In that case, the complainant, a Korean War veteran, suffered from a post-traumatic stress disorder. The symptoms were aggravated by his assignment to a position that entailed frustrating working conditions, such as handling high priority assignments requiring the approval of higher-level officials when those officials were often difficult to reach. In finding that the complainant had a disabling condition within the meaning of the regulations, the Commission noted that the ability to deal with everyday stress was not listed as a major life activity in its regulations. However, the Commission indicated that the list is not exhaustive and that activities not included in the list can be major life activities.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fact that a condition was intermittent and allowed an employee to perform the essential functions of a position on some days did not mean she was a qualified individual with a disability. In <span class="Italic">Kittredge v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 01952383 (1996), the Commission held that the complainant, who suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, was not a qualified individual with a disability. Although she could perform competently when lucid, her condition, which included delusional behavior, rendered her unable to carry out her duties as a clerk-typist on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although episodic conditions under the ADAAA will now be evaluated in their active phase to determine if the individual is substantially limited, this does not mean that an agency will have to provide reasonable accommodation to all such individuals. For example, the agency still has available to it the undue hardship defense as in <span class="Italic">Jeffers</span> where the Commission determined it would be an undue hardship for the agency to accommodate the erratic and unpredictable nature of the employee's absences. Also, as in <span class="Italic">Kittredge</span>, the agency could defend on the basis that the episodic condition means the employee is not qualified because he or she cannot perform the essential functions of a position on a regular basis. Finally, the agency could defend on the basis that the condition, even though episodic, is a direct threat in that the employee poses a danger to himself or someone else.</p>
<p class="noindent">As noted above, the ADAAA also provides that conditions in remission will be considered as substantially limiting if they would be so when active. 42 USC 12102(4)(D).</p>
<p class="noindent">Prior to the ADAAA, the fact that a medical condition was in remission did not automatically remove an employee from the ambit of the Rehabilitation Act, but the Commission looked at the individual circumstances to determine whether the condition had, in the past, substantially limited a major life activity. As the Commission observed in <span class="Italic">Waller v. Secretary of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 01933268 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because we find that appellant failed to establish that he was a person with a disability, we find that appellant failed to establish disability discrimination. Appellant has a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. However, both agency physicians testified that appellant's disease is in remission or inactive. Doctor 1 characterized appellant's skin condition as a superficial rash. Appellant himself conceded that his disability has been inactive for 17 years. The record does not support appellant's contention that his work environment exacerbated or revived his condition. Appellant did not produce any contrary medical opinions. He failed to show that his condition manifested itself in a substantial impairment to his major life activities. Nor did he show that he had a record of such an impairment, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that his condition was substantially limiting before it went into remission, or that he was regarded as having such an impairment.</p>
<p class="noindent">At first glance, adding conditions that were previously substantially limiting but have gone into remission to the list of disabilities would not seem much of a change since individuals with a record of a disability were already protected under the ADA. But consider the example of an employee who has a past history of a substantially limiting medical condition, such as the plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Arline</span>. The condition is in remission for several years and the reenters an active phase. Assume the employee needs six weeks of medical treatment and then can resume her full duties. Prior to the ADAAA, there was question as to whether such an employee would be entitled to six weeks of leave as a reasonable accommodation since generally a condition that last only six weeks, even if entirely debilitating during that time, would not be considered substantially limited. Under the ADAAA, that employee is now entitled to the leave as an accommodation because her status as an individual with a disability entitled to accommodation is not contingent on the condition being active. Of course, when the condition is in remission, the agency is not required to accommodate the employee not because the individual is no longer an individual with a disability, but because the condition currently imposes no limitations that require accommodation in the workplace. However, in its final regulations, the Commission has carved out an exception to the latter proposition. The final regulations make clear that an agency has an obligation to provide reasonable accommodation to an individual with a record of a disability if it would not impose an undue hardship. Thus, for example, an employee with a record of a disability who needs leave as an accommodation for treatment that prevent the past symptoms of an impairment from returning and being substantially limiting would be entitled to that leave as an accommodation unless it would impose an undue hardship on the agency. The Commission's seventh rule of construction, at 29 CFR 1630.2(j)(1)(vii) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active.</p>
<p class="noindent">The appendix to 1630.2(j)(1)(vii) further explains:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity in its active state. "This provision is intended to reject the reasoning of court decisions concluding that certain individuals with certain conditions--such as epilepsy or post traumatic stress disorder--were not protected by the ADA because their conditions were episodic or intermittent." Joint Hoyer-Sensenbrenner Statement at 2-3. The legislative history provides: "This * * * rule of construction thus rejects the reasoning of the courts in cases like <span class="Italic">Todd v. Academy Corp</span>. [57 F. Supp.2d 448, 453 (S.D. Tex. 1999)] where the court found that the plaintiff's epilepsy, which resulted in short seizures during which the plaintiff was unable to speak and experienced tremors, was not sufficiently limiting, at least in part because those seizures occurred episodically. It similarly rejects the results reached in cases [such as <span class="Italic">Pimental v. Dartmouth-Hitchock Clinic</span>, 236 F. Supp.2d 177, 182-83 (D.N.H. 2002)] where the courts have discounted the impact of an impairment [such as cancer] that may be in remission as too short-lived to be substantially limiting. It is thus expected that individuals with impairments that are episodic or in remission (e.g., epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, cancer) will be able to establish coverage if, when active, the impairment or the manner in which it manifests (e.g., seizures) substantially limits a major life activity." 2008 House Judiciary Committee Report at 19-20.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other examples of impairments that may be episodic include, but are not limited to, hypertension, diabetes, asthma, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2008 House Judiciary Committee Report at 19-20. The fact that the periods during which an episodic impairment is active and substantially limits a major life activity may be brief or occur infrequently is no longer relevant to determining whether the impairment substantially limits a major life activity. For example, a person with post-traumatic stress disorder who experiences intermittent flashbacks to traumatic events is substantially limited in brain function and thinking.</p>
<p class="noindent">One of the first insights into how the new ADAAA provision on conditions in remission would be applied comes from <span class="Italic">Hoffman v. Carefirst of Fort Wayne, Inc. d/b/a Advanced Healthcare</span>, 1:09-CV-251 (N.D. Ind., Aug. 31, 2010). In that case, the employee had renal cancer that was in remission. He sought an accommodation of working a 40-hour a week schedule, as opposed to 65-70 hours per week, and also to be allowed to continue to work out of his <span id="Page_1123"></span>home instead of at a more remote location. Advanced Healthcare moved for summary judgment contending that Hoffman was not an individual with a disability even under the lowered standards of the ADAAA. The district court denied summary judgment concluding that Hoffman was an individual with a disability. The court in <span class="Italic">Hoffman</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ADA makes it unlawful for an employer to "discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to...terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a). "To prevail on an ADA claim, the plaintiff must show (1) he is disabled; (2) he is qualified to perform the essential function of the job with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) he suffered an adverse employment action because of his disability." <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Lee's Log Cabin,</span> 546 F.3d 438, 442 (7th Cir. 2008). The ADA defines "disability" with respect to an individual as (A) "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual"; (B) "a record of such an impairment"; or (C) "being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Hoffman claims that his Stage III renal cancer, which was admittedly in remission during the time frame that gave rise to this action, constitutes a "disability" under the ADA. Advanced Healthcare argues that because Hoffman did not have a physical impairment which substantially limited a major life activity in January 2009, he was not disabled under the ADA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Effective January 1, 2009, Congress amended the ADA to "[reinstate] a broad scope of protection." <span class="Italic">See</span> ADA Amendments Act of 2008 ("ADAAA"), Pub. L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat 3553 (2008). Specifically, Congress found that the United States Supreme Court had improperly narrowed the protection intended to be afforded under the ADA, and the ADAAA rejected the holdings of <span class="Italic">Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc</span>., 527 U.S. 471, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1999), and <span class="Italic">Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams</span>, 534 U.S. 184, 122 S. Ct. 681, 151 L. Ed. 2d 615 (2002). Although the ADAAA left the ADA's three-category definition of "disability" intact, significant changes were made to how the categories are to be interpreted. Importantly, the ADAAA clarified that the operation of "major bodily functions," including "functions of the immune system," constitute major life activities under the ADA's first definition of disability. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 3555. Moreover, the ADAAA very clearly provides that "an impairment that is episodic or <span class="Italic">in remission</span> is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(4)(D) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Not surprisingly, Advanced Healthcare argues that Hoffman did not have a physical impairment which substantially limited any major life activity in January 2009--his cancer was in remission, he returned to work without restrictions, he carried out his regular job duties of 40 hours a week as a service technician for a full year, and he did not miss any significant time off work. Moreover, Advanced Healthcare argues, without providing case law or legislative history in support of its position, that it "highly doubts that Congress intended all cancer survivors in remission, with no medical evidence of active disease, to be considered disabled as a matter of law for the rest of their lives." (Reply Mem., p. 3.) In response, Hoffman contends that the clear wording of section 12102(4)(D) ("an impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active"), renders Hoffman's renal cancer (in remission) a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This Court has tried in vain to find analogous case law in which the central issue is whether an individual with cancer in remission is considered "disabled" under the ADAAA. Because the ADAAA amendments have been ruled as not retroactive, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Winsley v. Cook County</span>, 563 F.3d 598, 600 n.1 (7th Cir. 2009), at this point in time, there is a lack of case law on this issue. The Amendments went into effect on January 1, 2009. Pub. L. No. 110-325, 112 Stat. 3553. Since the alleged discriminatory action happened in this case during late January 2009, the parties agree that the Amendments apply. This is one of the first cases of its kind to make it to the summary judgment phase, where the new ADAAA standard is applicable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ADAAA states that "it is the intent of Congress that the primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether entities covered under the ADA have complied with their obligations...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 3554. Therefore, the "question of whether an individual's impairment is a disability under the ADA should not demand extensive analysis." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This Court is bound by the clear language of the ADAAA. Because it clearly provides that "an impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active," and neither side disputes that Stage III Renal Cancer, when active, constitutes a disability, this Court must find that Hoffman was "disabled" under the ADAAA. In other words, under the ADAAA, because Hoffman had cancer in remission (and that cancer would have substantially limited a major life activity when it was active), Hoffman does not need to show that he was substantially limited in a major life activity at the actual time of the alleged adverse employment action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This conclusion is further bolstered by the EEOC's interpretive guidance. The EEOC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to implement the amendments in 29 C.F.R. Part 1630, which specifically provides that "cancer" is an example of "impairments that are episodic or in remission," and is therefore considered to be a disability. 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(g)(4). Additionally, it states that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Examples of Impairments that Will Consistently Meet the Definition of Disability--...include, but are not limited to--(B) Cancer, which substantially limits major life activities such as normal cell growth...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">29 C.F.R. 1630.2(g)(5). Thus, under the clear language of the ADAAA, the Court finds that Hoffman was indeed "disabled" under the ADA.</p>
<p class="noindent">The court concluded that there was a genuine dispute of material fact on whether Advanced Healthcare could have accommodated Hoffman.</p>
