<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-149"><span class="space">5.</span> Exclusion of Witnesses</h4>
<p class="noindent">An administrative judge has the discretion to exclude certain witnesses from testifying, either on the grounds that their proffered testimony is not relevant to contested issues at the hearing, or their testimony would be unduly repetitious. 29 CFR 1614.109(e). When the judge does exclude the testimony of a witness, the reason for the exclusion should be placed on the record.</p>
<p class="noindent">The exclusion of witnesses by the administrative judge is a matter of discretion. A party challenging such a determination on appeal must show that the judge abused his or her discretion and that the testimony, if allowed and credited by the administrative judge, would have altered the decision. <span class="Italic">See Corpus v. Postmaster General</span>, 05A10457 (2001); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Siu v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 05A10219 (2001) (the fact that an approved witness did not support the complainant's case does not demonstrate that the judge erred in disallowing other witnesses); <span class="Italic">Grant v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01985972 (2001) (complainant made no proffer of what evidence the witnesses would have provided in their testimony); <span class="Italic">Tedeschi v. Postmaster General</span>, 01871031 (1988). A proffer of what the witness would have testified to is required, and consideration should be given to submitting the excluded testimony in affidavit or deposition form. It is not error for the administrative judge to deny the complainant the opportunity to call witnesses on the basis that their testimony would be unduly repetitious, where the judge has made a preliminary ruling denying the witnesses and given the complainant an opportunity to make a further proffer on their expected testimony. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Doucette v. Postmaster General</span>, 01883808 (1989).</p>
<p class="noindent">Limiting the number of witnesses on a particular point is a matter committed to the discretion of the administrative judge. As the Commission explained in <span class="Italic">Shaw v. Attorney General</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/migrated_files/decisions/01a51519.txt">01A51519</a> (2006):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To begin, we address the complainant's assertion that her witnesses were improperly excluded from testifying at the hearing. We find no error. We remind complainant that our administrative hearing process differs from the federal process. The EEOC AJ is not bound by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or Evidence. The AJ is bound only to the EEOC Regulations. 29 C.F.R. section 1614.109(a) gives the AJ full responsibility for the adjudication of the complaint. We have consistently interpreted this responsibility to include the authority to "limit the number of witnesses so as to exclude irrelevant and repetitious evidence." Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614, Ch. 7, III, D, 4 (Nov. 9, 1999). Complainant wanted the excluded witnesses to testify as to her superior qualifications and the irregular practice of promoting males. However, the testimonies of these witnesses on precisely these issues were already on record as affidavits.<span class="Italic"> See</span> Exhibits 6, 7, and 10. As the live testimony would indeed have been repetitious, we find no error in excluding them at the hearing. Both the AJ and the agency are correct to point out that complainant admitted that the supervisors had better, first-hand knowledge of her qualifications than the named witnesses who are all Senior Officer Specialists (GS-8), but she did not call the supervisors as witnesses. Moreover, we agree that she could have and perhaps should have requested documentation on the hiring practices at the facility during discovery, instead of relying on the testimony of a witness who is no way involved in hiring decisions. Thus, we conclude that the exclusion of the witnesses was proper.</p>
<p class="noindent">An administrative judge does not err in ruling that the testimony of a witness is irrelevant because the witness lacks first-hand knowledge of the evidence about which they are being asked to testify. <span class="Italic">See Tarson v. Department of Army</span>, 01842184 (1986) (there was no error in excluding witnesses called to testify about agency procedures when those witnesses had no first-hand knowledge of these procedures). Because hearsay is admissible in EEO hearings, this rule is sometimes difficult to apply, but a witness who is called to testify solely on the basis of hearsay may properly be excluded. <span class="Italic">See Gowayed v. Department of Energy</span>, 01852180 (1987) (failure of administrative judge to consider responses of an EEO counselor to written interrogatories was not harmful where counselor had no personal knowledge of the events).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Tarson</span>, the Commission also found the administrative judge had not committed error in refusing to permit the testimony of an employee, who had filed an earlier complaint based on sex discrimination, in a case involving religious discrimination. The appellant proffered that the testimony would show the agency's attitude against employees who filed EEO complaints. The Commission found that since the agency maintained the employee was terminated because he was hired illegally, testimony about the supervisors' attitudes toward complainants was not relevant.</p>
<p class="noindent">Giving each party a full and fair opportunity to present its case does not necessarily mean each side is entitled to the same number of witnesses on a particular point. However, it is an abuse of discretion for the administrative judge to approve six agency witnesses to testify about the appellant's performance and only three, including the appellant, to testify on the same issue for appellant. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 01891407 (1989).</p>
<p class="noindent">The administrative judge did not abuse his discretion in not allowing an agency witness to testify at hearing where both parties designated the individual as a witness, but prior to hearing the agency notified the judge and the complainant that the individual had retired and the agency could not procure his attendance. In <span class="Italic">Complainant v. Secretary of Homeland Security</span>, 0720130035 (2015), the agency notified the judge after the hearing started that the witness would be available. The Commission upheld the ruling of the judge stating:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that S2 was approved as a joint witness during the prehearing conference. However, soon after the prehearing conference the Agency notified AJ1 and Complainant that S2 had retired from the federal government and that the Agency was not able to secure him as a witness; as a result he would not be testifying at the hearing. When the hearing began on November 30, 2011, the Agency again confirmed that S2 would not be testifying. The Agency did not inform AJ1 and Complainant that it was able to procure S2 as a witness until after the hearing had begun.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ considered the harm to the Agency if S2 was not permitted to testify and weighed that against the harm to Complainant had S2 been permitted to testify without notice of his willingness to appear. AJ1 ultimately determined that allowing S2 to testify would prejudice Complainant and therefore denied the Agency's request for S2 to testify.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with AJ1 that allowing S2 to testify without previous notice to Complainant would have prejudiced Complainant because his attorneys did not have time to prepare to examine S2. <span class="Italic">See Kitchen v. National Labor Relations Board</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720110017 (May 1, 2013) (AJ properly excluded subject witnesses and documents that Agency did not present until right before hearing because it would have been prejudicial to complainant's preparedness and ability to defend). As a result, we find that AJ1 properly denied the Agency's request to allow S2 to testify.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Commission will not, on appeal, entertain an argument that the administrative judge improperly excluded the testimony of witnesses where no objection was made to the exclusion at the time of the ruling. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">David v. Postmaster General</span>, 01A45119 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">There is no requirement that the complainant testify. In <span class="Italic">Jeffries v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 01A02227 (2003), the Commission held that the judge did not <span id="Page_523"></span>improperly disallow the testimony of the complainant where, on the morning of the hearing, the judge read the list of approved witnesses, the complainant was not among the approved witnesses, and she did not enter an objection or otherwise indicate she was to testify.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the exclusion of witnesses is within the discretion of the administrative judge, that discretion is not unfettered and can be abused. In <span class="Italic">Karu v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 0120070908 (2008), the Commission found that the administrative judge improperly excluded a witness who would have testified about ageist comments in the workplace, as well as a witness who would have testified that the agency's EEO provided a list of EEO complainants to management officials. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Karu</span>, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are particularly concerned about the AJ's rejection of two witnesses who were to testify at the hearing about ageist jokes and comments in the workplace and about why the EEO office forwarded to senior management a report containing the names of employees with pending EEO complaints and the number of complaints these employees filed during their tenure with the agency.<span class="Italic"> See</span> Order on Motion for Reconsideration of Witnesses. This report purportedly listed complainant's name. The AJ rejected the witness who admittedly made the ageist comments because the AJ found the comments irrelevant and taken out of context. According to the Al, the comments were made in jest and therefore are not evidence of a discriminatory animus. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. We are not convinced. We have little tolerance for offensive comments about a protected basis, even if made in good-natured jest. Such comments may be indicative of prevailing ageist attitudes in the office which complainant claims were used against her. The AJ should have evaluated these comments in the context of complainant's claims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the AJ rejected the witness who was to testify about the disclosure of the names of employees with pending EEO complaints. The AJ did so because she found this individual's testimony redundant as the interview panel members and SO1 already knew of complainant's prior protected activity. It is improper for an agency to disclose to management the names of employees who have filed EEO complaints. We fail to understand the purpose of such a report and without further clarification we assume, as complainant has, that it was used for an illegitimate purpose. Although the selection panel may have known about complainant's prior EEO history, the AJ should have inquired further into why this report even existed. As such, we remand this matter, along with the other two claims discussed <span class="Italic">infra</span>, to the Chicago District Office for a new hearing in accordance with the Order below.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. Secretary of Air Force</span>, 0120065232 (2008), holding the administrative judge properly excluded the testimony of a witness where there was no showing the witness had any knowledge of the complainant's EEO activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">An administrative judge does not abuse his discretion in denying the complainant witnesses who would have testified on the legitimacy of an underlying OIG report and the agency's grievance procedure. In <span class="Italic">Polizzi v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120110910 (2013), the complainant was terminated based on the results of an OIG investigation. The Commission noted that the question before the administrative judge was whether the RMO acted with discriminatory intent in terminating the complainant and not the validity of the underlying investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Limiting the number of witnesses on a particular issue also is within the discretion of the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Smith, et al. v. Postmaster General</span>, 0120081917 (2012) (limiting members in class action to their own testimony and that of one supporting witness on issue of compensatory damages not an abuse of discretion).</p>
<p class="noindent">The exclusion of a witness or witnesses from testifying can also be a proper sanction for misconduct during prehearing proceedings. Where counsel for a class complaint misled the administrative judge and agency counsel with respect to the retention of an expert witness, the judge properly sanctioned the class by precluding it from introducing any expect testimony. In <span class="Italic">Epps v. Secretary of Agriculture</span>, 01200507452 (2007), counsel represented a class of all current and former black employees who had applied for but not received promotions at the National Finance Center. After the agency produced voluminous discovery that included machine-readable data and excerpts from over 150 boxes of promotion files, class counsel represented that he had retained an expert witness. The agency noticed the expert's deposition and also requested identifying information about the expert, include a curriculum vitae and expert's report. Class counsel responded he that would not allow the deposition. Agency counsel responded that he did not intend to honor the unilateral cancelation of the deposition. He appeared for the scheduled deposition. Class counsel and the supposedly-retained expert did not. Later, class counsel submitted a witness list without testimony proffers despite being twice ordered to produce a list with proffers.</p>
<p class="noindent">The administrative judge sanctioned by class by precluding it from offering any expert testimony or evidence at hearing. Noting that the "expert" had been referred to by class counsel at times as "he" and at other times as "she," the judge found that no expert had in fact been retained. On appeal, the Commission upheld the sanction rejecting an argument by the class representative that counsel had not competently represented the class. The Commission noted that, at that point, counsel had represented the class for years and the class had ample opportunity to evaluate the competence of counsel and retain new counsel, if necessary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, an agency can be subject to a sanction of exclusion of witnesses. In <span class="Italic">Fleming v.</span> Postmaster General, 0720050083 (2007), the agency transmitted the case to an EEOC administrative judge after determining it had breached a settlement agreement and the complainant elected reinstatement of his complaint as a remedy. Thereafter, the agency alternatively contested jurisdiction on the basis that it had not breached the agreement and denied that it was contesting jurisdiction. Shortly, before the hearing, the agency filed a motion for summary judgment contending that the judge lacked jurisdiction. The judge excluded the agency from presenting any witnesses and, based on the evidence presented by the complainant and his witnesses, found in favor of the complainant. The Commission, in <span class="Italic">Fleming</span>, upheld the sanction, finding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On August 30, 2004, the AJ issued an Order Imposing Sanctions against the agency. The record reflects a complex chronological progression that culminated in the AJ's Order. However, the motivation for the AJ's Order Imposing Sanctions can be succinctly identified as follows. The AJ imposed sanctions based on his assessment that the agency had persistently refused to produce a copy of its written decision to complainant regarding breach allegations; and that the agency mishandled complainant's breach allegations and repeatedly refused to follow a correct procedure, even after the AJ called the matter to the agency's attention on several occasions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, the AJ determined the agency repeatedly changed its position relating to the question of his jurisdiction. The AJ found that, in October 2003, the agency transmitted the instant case to him requesting reinstatement, as noted above, and that by doing so, the agency implicitly found that the AJ had jurisdiction. The AJ noted, however, that during pre-hearing discussions, the agency representative hinted that the agency had not breached the settlement agreement and that the agency might, in fact, contest the AJ's jurisdiction. The AJ indicated that the agency declined to take this position in writing. In an effort to resolve any uncertainties over the agency's position, the AJ ordered the agency to produce an official response to the breach allegation. The AJ determined that the agency refused to do so, "continuing to hold open the option of contesting jurisdiction, without actually contesting jurisdiction."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ noted that in a response to an Order to Show Cause, the agency conceded that the AJ had jurisdiction and disavowed any attempt to claim that the agency had not breached the agreement. The AJ determined, however, that approximately fifteen days before the scheduled hearing, the agency filed a summary judgment motion contending that the AJ lacked jurisdiction. The AJ found this motion "grossly untimely and totally inconsistent with the response to the Order to Show Cause." The AJ denied the agency's motion for summary judgment, finding that it was untimely; and that the agency waived its right to contest jurisdiction. As a result of the agency's actions, the AJ issued an Order Imposing Sanctions, which excluded the agency's witnesses from testifying in the scheduled August 30, 2004 hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Following the hearing, held on August 30, 2004, the AJ found that complainant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of sex and age discrimination when his route was not properly adjusted and additional work was added making it excess of eight hours daily. The AJ found that the agency failed to articulate legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions, and that complainant was, therefore, not required to show pretext.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this conclusion, the AJ credited complainant's testimony that when the agency made route adjustments, complainant's route lengthened by approximately one hour. Complainant stated, however, that a younger similarly situated female comparison employee did not have similar time added to her route. The AJ noted that complainant testified that while he received additional deliveries to his route, the comparison employee did not receive any additional deliveries. The AJ further noted that complainant testified that he had an insufficient amount of time to carry an additional 350 deliveries, but that the comparison employee received extra office time to prepare her existing deliveries. Moreover, the AJ found credible the testimony of a letter carrier who stated that his job was to fill in for the carriers, including complainant, on their days off or when they were on leave. Specifically, the AJ noted that the letter carrier stated that complainant's route was incapable of being carried in eight hours. The AJ noted that the letter carrier testified that he was routinely paid overtime for complainant's route because complainant carried more than eight hours.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ noted that complainant's former supervisor testified that she conducted a street observation of complainant's route and found that it could not be carried in the time allotted (eight hours). The AJ, however, noted that the record supported a finding that the agency did not conduct another street observation or make a correction to complainant's route after routinely paying overtime for complainant's route. The AJ concluded that the agency's failure to make an effort to <span id="Page_524"></span>address complainant's adjusted route was unreasonable. Specifically, the AJ concluded that the agency's routine approval of overtime on complainant's route indicated that the agency was aware that the route was overburdened.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that the exclusion of witness cases are somewhat different than that default judgment cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> discussion in Chapter 8, subsection on Default Judgments. In default judgment cases, the judgment itself is the sanction. In <span class="Italic">Fleming</span>, the sanction was not judgment, although the sanction of exclusion resulted in judgment for the complainant. The difference is that in <span class="Italic">Fleming</span>, even with the sanction, the complainant still had to present evidence sufficient to support a decision in his favor. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Hillion v. Postmaster General</span>, 0720070068 (2007) (administrative judge properly sanctioned agency by excluding all witnesses where agency failed to file a prehearing submission or a proposed witness list). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Natalie S. v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 0120180466 (2020) (upholding an administrative judge's modification of the first administrative judge's witness exclusion as a sanction by allowing rebuttal witnesses).</p>
