<p class="Body-Text">If the Board lacks jurisdiction over the basic personnel action appealed by an individual, it lacks the authority to resolve related discrimination issues. <span class="Italic">Denson v. USPS</span>, 4 MSPR 439, 440, 4 MSPB 490 (1980). For a short time, the law required the Board to adjudicate a discrimination claim raised in a constructive adverse action appeal even if it concluded that it had no jurisdiction over the underlying appeal. <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 906 F.2d 689 (Fed. Cir. 1990), determined that the appellant's claim of an involuntary resignation--allegedly due to reprisal for his filing EEO complaints--was a mixed case, and the court required the Board to adjudicate the appellant's discrimination or retaliation claim despite the Board's conclusion that the resignation was not involuntary, a finding that technically deprived the Board of jurisdiction over the appeal. This decision, however, was vacated and, <span class="Italic">en banc</span>, the Federal Circuit decided that the Board was not required to decide an EEO allegation without an action within its appellate jurisdiction. In the <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision, <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240, 1243-48 (Fed. Cir. 1991), the court resolved as to an appeal that originated as a mixed case appeal involving an allegedly coerced resignation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the AJ and the Board recognized, the sole issue in this case is whether the Board had jurisdiction over Cruz' appeal to it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has only that jurisdiction conferred on it by Congress....&#8197;The Board's limited jurisdiction as here applicable is set by a statute, 5 USC 7512, which grants the Board jurisdiction to hear and determine challenges to specific adverse actions of agencies, including removals and four other adverse actions not here involved. The <span class="Italic">sole</span> agency action in this case is its January 28, 1988 notification to Cruz of its tentative proposal to remove him on charges specifying numerous acts of insubordination and unacceptable performance of one critical element of his position. It is that proposal, Cruz argues, that was tainted by reprisal. Because mere proposals to remove are not listed in Sec. 7512, they are not appealable adverse actions in themselves and the Board has no jurisdiction over them....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Sec. 7702 merely describes what the Board must do when it has jurisdiction; it is not a grant of jurisdiction. Moreover to apply sec. 7702 to a case in which there is no appealable action is to rewrite the statute by deleting its subsection (a)(l)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Cruz' February 16, 1988 letter announcing his resignation effective March 1, 1988, and his disregard of two written warnings that failure to withdraw his resignation would forfeit his appeal rights, forestalled all agency procedures and resulted in the agency's taking no action at all, much less an appealable action, on the proposed removal. There being no appealable action, the Board was without jurisdiction and there was nothing with which Cruz' reprisal assertion could be "mixed."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the Board lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine an appeal from an employee who has voluntarily resigned. The courts, however, have recognized a corollary proposition, i.e., that the Board does have jurisdiction to hear and determine an appeal by an employee whose resignation was not voluntary, an involuntary resignation being deemed a "constructive removal." The Board has jurisdiction to determine whether a resignation was voluntary or involuntary because it has jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction....&#8197;A resignation is either voluntary or involuntary on the date it is submitted, and jurisdiction must <span id="Page_3333"></span>be determined as of that date. Cruz, who has the burden of establishing jurisdiction, alleged before the Board that his resignation was involuntary because the agency knew that the charges it cited as the basis for proposing his removal could not be substantiated. That allegation was correctly found to be without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Resignations are presumed voluntary...and Cruz has submitted no evidence overcoming that presumption or indicating that his resignation was involuntary. On the contrary, the record establishes a textbook example of a voluntary resignation submitted in the face of serious charges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for Board review, Cruz recognized that his reprisal claim rested on the absence of reasonable grounds for proposing his removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In the absence of sustainable charges and substantive documentation, and in the presence of so many procedural violations, it can only be concluded that there was another reason for the agency's actions; and that reason is my prior EEO involvement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The opposite of Cruz' scenario is present here, where there was strong evidence that the charges constituted good cause, there was substantive documentation, and his resignation precluded all procedures on the proposal. We repeat that the only agency action here was the notification of intent to remove in view of serious charges. The AJ found and the Board affirmed the finding that the Navy fully believed the charges would be sustained. Under such objective circumstances the Navy would have been remiss if it had condoned Cruz' conduct by failing to bring the charges it brought. In cases properly before this court, i.e., those not involving discrimination, the Board's jurisdiction over an allegedly involuntary resignation has been determined by an evaluation of objective facts without exploration of the subjective motivation of either the employee or the agency....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It must be remembered that the asserted act of reprisal here is the Navy's bringing of the charges. The sole issue here is the Board's jurisdiction, and that issue resolves into whether Cruz' resignation was voluntary or involuntary because obtained by coercion, deception or the like. All evidence of involuntariness must be considered, but the reprisal assertion, if the Board had independent jurisdiction over it, would be subsumed by the findings of no coercion, or deception, or other improper agency act. Though we obviously do not here decide whether reprisal may or may not have been among the motives of Cruz' supervisors, we cannot hold that the bringing of numerous, valid, serious and sustainable charges of conduct that destroys the efficiency of the service constitutes coercion to resign. To so hold would be contrary to precedent and to common sense. This court has repeatedly held that the imminence of a less desirable alternative does not render involuntary the choice made....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Cruz' primary assertion in his appeal here is that the Board should have decided his reprisal claim and notified him of a right to appeal that decision to the EEOC or a district court because the agency's January 29, 1988 letter was in reprisal for filing his 1987 EEOC complaint. But that mere assertion does not provide a basis for Board jurisdiction in this voluntary resignation case. First, a petitioner's mere assertion cannot create jurisdiction. Second, as above indicated, bringing charges, for whatever reason, is not in itself an agency action appealable to the Board. Nor are discriminatory acts in themselves agency actions appealable to the Board. A statute, 5 USC 2302(b), makes reprisal a prohibited personnel practice, but that statute is not an independent source of Board jurisdiction....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor would a source of jurisdiction be created by accepting, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, Cruz' label for his reprisal assertion: "Title VII claim of discrimination." The Board has not been granted jurisdiction over Title VII claims <span class="Italic">per se</span>, i.e., over "pure" or "naked" Title VII claims unaccompanied by an appealable action over which the Board does have jurisdiction. Cruz on this appeal attempts to convert his attempted appeal under Title 5, USC to a suit for discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. As above indicated, when discrimination is asserted in an appeal from a removal or other appealable adverse agency action over which the Board <span class="Italic">has</span> jurisdiction, the case is a "mixed case" and the Board must decide the merits of the appealable action and whether it was a discriminatory act. 5 USC 7702. In such cases, the Board routinely notifies appellants of a right to EEOC review. Where, as here, it has been found that there never was an appealable adverse agency action, the case is not a "mixed case," sec. 7702 is not involved, and the Board correctly determined that it was without jurisdiction to consider Cruz' claim of procedural error or his reprisal assertion, or any other claim beyond the Board's jurisdiction. That holding and our affirmance break no new ground....&#8197;For the same reason, the Board correctly declined to refer to any right of EEOC review and Cruz' motion for transfer of this case to a district court must be denied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Cruz mistakenly relies on <span class="Italic">Durden v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 18 MSPR 373 (1983) as requiring the Board to notify him of a right to appeal the Board's decision to the EEOC. First, <span class="Italic">Durden</span> is not precedent in this court. Second, the Board noted that the handicap discrimination issue in <span class="Italic">Durden</span> required analysis to determine whether Durden's retirement in the face of the agency's advice to consider retirement or be removed <span class="Italic">because of his handicap</span> was a constructive discharge, whereas the proposal to remove Cruz was based on repeated acts of insubordination, on conduct most destructive of the efficiency of the service. Third, unlike the present case, the agency suggested retirement in <span class="Italic">Durden</span> and it was found, contrary to the facts here, that there was not even an arguable basis for Durden's discharge, the agency having previously accommodated his handicap. Finally, and most important, the Board said <span class="Italic">Durden</span> was a narrow exception because handicap discrimination was the <span class="Italic">sole</span> reason for the threatened discharge, i.e., the threat and Durden's retirement were "intertwined" with, indeed <span class="Italic">based</span> on, Durden's handicap. There is no basis for a similar exception here, where Cruz' assertion of reprisal does not affect the voluntariness of his resignation in the face of serious charges of insubordination and unacceptable performance. Unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">Durden</span>, as the Board held, Cruz' "reprisal claim, even if true, cannot be considered the sole reason here, since the agency demonstrated an arguable basis" for the proposal to remove him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...It may be that a resignation case could arise in which the facts would compel a Board decision on a reprisal assertion. We hold only that in a case like the present, where the Board has determined that a resignation in the face of serious charges was voluntary, it never acquired jurisdiction to decide anything, including the question of whether there may also have been another reason--one outside the Board's statutorily assigned jurisdiction--for proposing those valid charges.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On the strength of the second <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> decision, <span class="Italic">Durden</span> was formally overruled by the Board in <span class="Italic">Price v. USPS</span>, 50 MSPR 107, 110 (1991). The Board noted in <span class="Italic">Price</span>, however, that "the Board may still make an initial determination on a claim of prohibited discrimination where, unlike here, that claim is asserted as the sole cause of an involuntary action, and thereby determine Board jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 99-3408) ("Since the Board lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Jones's back pay claim [in enforced leave claim], it also lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate his claim of employment discrimination."); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. USDA</span>, 106 MSPR 677, 682-83 &#x00B6; 12, 2007 MSPB 244 (2007) ("[t]he AJ should have considered, in his jurisdictional analysis, the appellant's claim of denial of a reasonable accommodation. The permissible scope of the Board's review of an appellant's discrimination claims on the question of coercion is not confined solely to the specific allegations accepted by the agency for investigation; rather, it may extend to any discrimination like or related to the substance of the allegations in the claim and which reasonably can be expected to grow out of the investigation triggered by the claim."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>.<span class="Italic"> Fisher v. USPS,</span> 184 Fed. Appx. 969, 972 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP) (Board lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate a discrimination claim when it lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the underlying restoration claim).

<p class="Body-Text">Since the issues of voluntariness and discrimination must be jointly determined to establish jurisdiction, the situation is unusual; however, the allegation of discrimination, intertwined with a jurisdictional issue, is sufficient to entitle the appellant to an EEOC appeal from the Board's decision. <span class="Italic">Durden v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 18 MSPR 373, 374-75 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Roby v. Dept. of Navy</span>, AT-0752-15-0588-I-1 (NP 9/13/2016) (forced retirement appeal: "The EEOC's regulations provide that when, as here, the Board dismisses a 'mixed case' appeal for lack of jurisdiction, the action is no longer a 'mixed case' and the agency is obligated to reissue a notice to the appellant pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(f) giving her the right to elect between a hearing before an EEOC administrative judge or an immediate final decision on her discrimination claims. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(b)."). If the appellant files an EEO complaint, receives a final agency decision, appeals to the Board, and the Board dismisses the case for lack of jurisdiction, the Board's practice is to require the agency to issue to the appellant notice of further EEOC appellate rights, <span class="Italic">Manoogian v. DHS,</span> SF-0752-11-0194-I-1 (NP 10/27/2011):</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit's position is that if there is no jurisdiction over an action appealed to the Board, the Board properly does not inform the appellant in its decision of EEOC appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cruz v.
