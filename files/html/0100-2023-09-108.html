<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-106"><span class="space">c.</span> Delay Excused; Obstruction or Misrepresentation by Counsel</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Board law excuses an untimely filing when a designated representative misrepresents, intentionally or negligently, that an appeal was filed, and the appellant is otherwise diligent in prosecuting her appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lang v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 59 MSPR 218, 220 (1993), <span class="Italic">post</span>. The evolution of the exception to the usual rule that counsel's negligence is attributed to his client is traced by the cases that follow.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Dunbar v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 640, 642, 643-45 (1990), the attorney prepared the appeal on time, instructed his secretary to mail the appeal on time, but the secretary, in what the appellant characterized as "a deliberate act of defiance by the secretary," failed to mail the appeal by the deadline. The delay was excused:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well recognized that a person is bound by the actions or inactions of his chosen representative....&#8197;Courts have recognized, however, that it is inappropriate to apply the principle that an attorney's actions should be attributed to his client when the client has proven that his diligent efforts to prosecute the suit were, without his knowledge, thwarted by his attorney's deceptions and negligence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Primbs v. United States</span>, 4 Cl. Ct. 366, 370 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 765 F.2d 159 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court reinstated the suit [in <span class="Italic">Primbs</span>] . It found that the attorney not only had failed to inform the plaintiff of the show-cause order [to show why the case should not be dismissed for lack of prosecution], but had "actively misled and lulled his client into believing this case was proceeding smoothly."...&#8197;It also found that the fact that the attorney's "failures and deceptions would provide good reason for a malpractice action [did] not relieve th[e] court of its duty to determine whether plaintiff's suit should be reinstated."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the account the appellant and his former representative have given concerning the filing of the appeal. The appellant's allegations are supported by his own statement and by the affidavit of his former representative, and they have not been rebutted by the agency. Furthermore, we find that the appellant...acted diligently in filing his appeal....&#8197;[T]he appellant checked repeatedly on the status of his appeal. Not only did he make several telephone calls to his former representative's law office to inquire about the status of his appeal and to remind the attorney that the filing deadline was approaching, but he also personally visited that office on March 29, 1989, in an unsuccessful attempt to mail the appeal himself....&#8197;[T]he appellant's inquiries about whether the petition for appeal had been mailed continued until he was assured that it had. We find further that the appellant's reliance on that assurance was, under the circumstances described above, reasonable....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant's attorney...misled his client. The fact that the appellant's attorney did so unintentionally is not, in our view, a sufficient basis for declining to waive the time limit. Regardless of the reasons for the attorney's misleading information, the effect of that information was that, despite the appellant's diligent efforts to monitor the progress of his appeal[6], the appeal was filed late....&#8197;[W]e find that the appellant has shown good cause for the untimeliness of his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The appellant has a personal duty to monitor the progress of the appeal at all times and not to leave it entirely to his attorney....&#8197;When the client is aware, or should be aware, of his attorney's misconduct, it is not unjust to penalize him. <span class="Italic">See Shea v. Donohue Construction Co., Inc.</span>, 795 F.2d at 1078.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board assesses the neglect or diligence of the appellant by the appellant's actions. To fit within <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span>, the appellant must show that he attempted to review the appeal in time to ascertain its status or that he made other attempts to ensure that a representative filed the appeal. <span class="Italic">Curry v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 645, 650 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Nolte v. DHHS</span>, 58 MSPR 44, 47 (1993) (applying the same approach to a belated PFR). The point was reiterated by <span class="Italic">D'Aquin v. OPM</span>, 65 MSPR 499, 504-05 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has consistently held that misplaced reliance upon an attorney is insufficient to establish good cause for a waiver of the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See Scott v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 439, 441 (1992). The unwarranted belief that a representative is pursuing an appeal does not support a finding of due diligence which would excuse the filing delay. <span class="Italic">See Graham v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 47 MSPR 38, 40 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has nonetheless found that, under limited circumstances, the actions of a representative may support a finding of good cause for a filing delay. If the appellant shows that she actively monitored the progress of her appeal but that her representative thwarted her diligent efforts to prosecute her appeal, then good cause for the delay may be shown. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dunbar v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant here has made no such showing. She states that she was initially incarcerated on December 9, 1993, nine days <span class="Italic">after</span> the filing deadline. She also states that she was not alerted to the fact that her attorney had failed to file an appeal for her until she belatedly received his withdrawal in the mail sometime <span class="Italic">after</span> the filing deadline and her subsequent incarceration. She makes no claim, however, that she asked her attorney, during their December 9 telephone conversation, whether he had mailed her petition for appeal to the Board, or that she tried to contact the Regional Office to confirm its receipt of her petition for appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our decision in <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span> requires a greater degree of diligence on the part of the appellant in the prosecution of her appeal. In <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span>, the appellant checked repeatedly on the status of his appeal <span class="Italic">before</span> the filing deadline, attempted to mail the appeal himself and was thwarted in his efforts by a deliberate act of defiance on the part of his attorney's secretary. <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span>, 43 MSPR at 644.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant asserts that the delay was caused by his representative's failure to timely file the appeal despite the appellant's attempts to monitor his appeal. Generally, an appellant is responsible for the failures of his chosen representative<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 7 MSPR 667, 670 (1981). However, the Board has held that, in limited circumstances, in the interest of fairness an appellant should not be penalized when his representative thwarts his diligent efforts to prosecute his appeal<span class="Italic">. See Dunbar v. Department of the Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 640, 642-45 (1990). In <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span>, the appellant repeatedly telephoned his attorney's office to monitor the progress of his appeal and visited the office in an attempt to mail the appeal himself. An employee of the attorney actively misled the appellant into believing that the appeal had been mailed. In contrast, the appellant in this appeal does not allege that his representative actively deceived him but rather asserts that his repeated attempts to contact his representative were unsuccessful. It was not until the April 9, 1991 filing date had passed that the appellant decided that his reliance on his representative was misplaced. An appellant's unwarranted belief that his representative is pursuing his appeal is not a proper basis for a finding of due diligence<span class="Italic">. See Curry v. Department of the Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 645, 650 (1990). Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant has failed to show that he exercised the appropriate diligence in monitoring his appeal<span class="Italic">. See Graham v. Department of the Army</span>, 47 MSPR 38, 40-41 (1991); <span class="Italic">Bro v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 46 MSPR 294, 296 (1990).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the respondent argues that he failed to respond to OSC's complaint due to his attorney's negligence. The respondent, however, never submitted a designation of representation identifying a representative, and we find that the respondent cannot establish good cause for his default based upon the acts and omissions of his putative representative. As a general matter, a party is bound by the actions or inactions of his chosen representative, <span class="Italic">see Dunbar v.

Under these facts, where the respondent never submitted a designation of representation identifying a representative, we find that the respondent cannot prove that his diligent efforts to prosecute his case were thwarted by his attorney's deception and negligence, such that his inactions should be excused. <span class="Italic">See Miller v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant has made unrebutted statements that her union representative misrepresented to her that he filed a Board appeal on her behalf before expiration of the regulatory deadline. She states that she secured union representation in September, 1992, when the agency initiated an investigation that resulted in her November, 1992 removal. She further asserts that she was in contact with this representative at various times before and after she received the November 20, 1992 removal notice, and in December, 1992 he assured her that he was waiting for a hearing date from the Board. The appellant continues:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I waited several months. I tried to contact [the union representative] on numerous occasions to try to find out the status. I called the [u]nion office over and over and left messages for him to return my calls. He did not. Finally, I spoke with [another union rep] in March, 1993, and told him of the situation. He in turn got in touch with [the union representative]. I was called and told my paper work had been lost and the letter for my request for a hearing had been crumbled up and found behind a box.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that she filed her Board appeal on the same day that she ascertained that the representative had not filed it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record provides no reason to disbelieve the appellant's assertions. Thus, we find that whether it was intentional or not, the representative's assertion that he was waiting for a hearing date from the Board amounts to a misrepresentation that her case was proceeding smoothly. <span class="Italic">Dabbs</span>, 56 MSPR at 60.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find further that, given the fact that the appellant believed that the representative was awaiting a hearing date from the Board, her further attempts to monitor her appeal were diligent and were delayed by the failure of her union representative to respond to her calls. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dabbs</span>, 56 MSPR at 59-60. Also, her ultimate resort to getting another union representative to secure the information from her union representative demonstrates the exercise of ordinary prudence under the circumstances. In addition, when she was advised that the appeal had not been filed, the appellant acted diligently in filing her appeal immediately. Finally, we find that the interest of fairness requires that the time limit be waived given the circumstances presented in this case....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dunbar</span> was applied to excuse a six-day delay in filing, <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. OPM</span>, 88 MSPR 499, 501-02 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has made the requisite showing under <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span> in this case. The appellant has submitted his uncontradicted affidavit and other evidence with his petition for review supporting his allegations that he exercised due diligence and was misled by his former attorney into believing that his appeal would be timely filed, and we have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the appellant's assertions....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's evidence shows that he retained his former attorney in February 1999, well in advance of OPM's May 11, 2000 final decision. During the period between OPM's May 11, 2000 final decision and the June 15, 2000 filing deadline, the appellant made diligent efforts to contact his then-attorney and timely file his appeal. The appellant's efforts included sending a facsimile on May 15, 2000, to his attorney asking for "HELP" in responding to OPM sign in sheet's final decision and requesting that the attorney call the appellant to discuss the case. Between May 15, 2000, and June 9, 2000, the appellant attempted at least 14 telephone calls to his attorney, but the attorney did not respond. Further, on June 1, 2000, the appellant, accompanied by a friend, drove to his attorney's office "to inquire about the progress of his appeal," and the attorney reassured the appellant that "[his] appeal [would] be filed on time." Thus, the appellant has shown that his diligent efforts to timely file his petition for appeal were thwarted by his former attorney's misleading reassurance that the appeal would be timely filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of these circumstances, we find that the appellant has shown good cause for the 6 day delay in filing his appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span>, 43 MSPR at 645. OPM has not responded to the appellant's evidence showing good cause, nor has OPM asserted that it would be prejudiced by waiver of the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See Dunbar</span>, 43 MSPR at 644; <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span>, 4 MSPR at 184.

<p class="Body-Text">A restrictive reading of <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span>, suggesting that reliance upon an attorney must be fully justified, was offered in <span class="Italic">Semans v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 56 MSPR 111, 112-14 (1992), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Semans v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1993 NP No. 93-3141), <span class="Italic">post</span>. The Board determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant mailed a petition for appeal to the Denver Regional Office on June 5, 1992, contesting the agency's decision to suspend him for 30 days effective May 5, 1992. The administrative judge ordered the appellant to file argument and evidence establishing that the petition for appeal had been timely filed or that good cause existed to waive the filing deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response, the appellant filed an affidavit recounting the following events. On May 5, 1992, the appellant sent documents concerning the suspension, "including a signed appeal form," to Dennis McAllister, an attorney in New York. In a May 15 telephone conversation, McAllister advised the appellant that he would not handle an appeal to the Board "for free" and that the appellant "would have to file the appeal on [his] own, but due to the fact that [McAllister] had the documents in his office, [McAllister] would fill them out and send them." On May 19, the appellant contacted McAllister, who advised the appellant that he had "completed [the] appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board and was sending it out at this time" On May 22, the appellant and his family traveled from their home in New Mexico to South Dakota, where the appellant attempted to secure a loan to pay McAllister's fee. The appellant returned from South Dakota on June 4. The next day his wife picked up the mail from the post office, where it was being held, and discovered that McAllister had returned the appeal documents to the appellant. The appellant had thought that McAllister would file the petition for appeal with the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he administrative judge dismissed the appeal as untimely, without discussing whether the apparent misunderstanding between the appellant and McAllister was a sufficient excuse for waiving the filing deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petition for appeal was due to be filed no later than May 26, 1992. It was filed on June 5, 1992. The Board may excuse an untimely filing only upon a showing of good cause, that is, upon a showing that the party making the filing exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Tidwell v. OPM</span>, 53 MSPR 464 (1992), we held that an appellant who had mistakenly believed that an attorney would file a petition for review on her behalf did not establish good cause to waive the filing deadline, where she had been aware of the deadline, she had not requested an extension, she had not attempted to file the petition herself, and the attorney had not told her that he would file the petition with the Board. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Mallory v. Dept. of Army</span>, 39 MSPR 519 (the Board found no good cause shown for waiving the deadline for filing a petition for review of an initial decision where the late filing was due to the appellant's mistaken belief that her attorney would seek review of the initial decision in federal court), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 884 F.2d 1398 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present appeal, as in <span class="Italic">Tidwell</span>, the appellant was aware of the filing deadline, he did not request an extension, and he did not attempt to file the petition for appeal himself before the deadline passed. The appellant's account of McAllister's supposed assurance that the appeal was "completed" and McAllister was "sending it out" is vague; it is not clear where McAllister said he would send the documents. Moreover, the appellant avers that McAllister told him just 11 days before the filing deadline that "[he] would have to file the appeal on [his] own...." In the face of this statement, and in light of the fact that McAllister made plain that he did not intend to prosecute an appeal until arrangements were made for the payment of McAllister's fee, the appellant's reliance <span id="Page_1019"></span>on McAllister to file the petition for appeal falls short of the diligence expected of him under the circumstances. This appeal thus stands in contrast to <span class="Italic">Dunbar v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 640 (1990), in which we held that good cause for waiving the deadline for filing a petition for appeal had been established, where the appellant had repeatedly called his attorney to check on the status of his appeal until he was assured that the petition for appeal had been filed on time with the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the appellant's explanation for the belated filing of the petition for appeal does not establish good cause for waiving the filing deadline.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit considered the Board's approach in <span class="Italic">Semans</span> a tad parched and reversed, <span class="Italic">Semans v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1993 NP No. 93-3141):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Semans was suspended for 30 days from his position as a criminal investigator for the Department of the Interior effective May 5, 1992. That same day Semans sent documents relating to his suspension, including a signed appeal form, to an attorney in New York, Dennis McAllister. During a telephone conversation on May 15, McAllister informed Semans that his firm did not handle appeals to the board without a fee. Nonetheless, McAllister told Semans that since he had the necessary appeal documents at his office, he "would fill them out and send them." On May 19, McAllister advised Semans that the appeal forms were complete and being "sen[t] out at this time." On May 22, Semans traveled from his home in New Mexico to South Dakota where he attempted to secure a loan from his Tribe to pay McAllister's fee. Semans returned home on June 4, and on June 5 discovered the completed appeal documents in his mail retrieved from the post office. Only then was it clear that McAllister had mailed the appeal forms to Semans' home rather than to the board. Semans immediately contacted McAllister who informed him of the misunderstanding. Semans filed his appeal to the board on June 5, 10 days after the time limit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After review of Semans' evidence and argument, the Administrative Judge (AJ) found that Semans "failed to provide 'good cause' for his delay in appealing" and dismissed the appeal as untimely filed. The full board reopened the appeal on its own motion, affirmed the Initial Decision of the AJ as modified by its Opinion and Order. The board discussed "whether the apparent misunderstanding between [Semans] and McAllister establishes good cause for waiving the filing deadline." The board stated that Semans'</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">account of McAllister's supposed assurance that the appeal was "completed" and McAllister was "sending it out" is vague; it is not clear where McAllister said he would send the documents. Moreover, [Semans] avers that McAllister told him just 11 days before the filing deadline that "[he] would have to file the appeal on [his] own...." In the face of this statement, and in light of the fact that McAllister made plain that he did not intend to prosecute an appeal until arrangements were made for the payment of McAllister's fee, [Seamans'] reliance on McAllister to file the petition for appeal falls short of the diligence expected of him under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We review the board's decision on waiver of the regulatory time limit to determine whether it was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. <span class="Italic">Mendoza v. MSPB</span>, 966 F.2d 650, 653 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">in banc</span>); 5 USC 7703(c) (1988). The twenty-day time period to file an appeal to the board may be waived if good cause is shown. <span class="Italic">Phillips v. USPS</span>, 695 F.2d 1389, 1391 (Fed. Cir. 1982). This court has noted that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">any doubt as to whether good cause has been shown should be resolved in favor of an appellant, that an appellant need not show impossibility but only that the delay was excusable in light of the surrounding circumstances where ordinary prudence had been exercised, and that a reasonable excuse should be accepted by the presiding official absent proof of substantial prejudice to the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Yuni v. MSPB</span>, 784 F.2d 381, 384 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Semans was diligent in sending the documents in support of his appeal to McAllister promptly after he was suspended. He was diligent in filing the appeal the same day he discovered that it had not been filed by McAllister. The board viewed Seman's affidavit as somewhat vague in that it was not clear where McAllister said he would send the appeal forms. We are convinced from the surrounding facts, however, that the board reached the wrong inferences and conclusions. If Semans knew that McAllister intended to send the appeal documents to his home, rather than to the board, it is most unlikely, in view of his other diligence, that Semans would neglect to make arrangements for the timely filing of the appeal while he was in South Dakota seeking financing for the appeal. Thus, it seems clear that Semans must have thought McAllister would file his appeal documents with the board. Semans' affidavit says nothing to indicate otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the facts show Semans exercised reasonable diligence and ordinary prudence with respect to the filing of his appeal. Absent an allegation or evidence of prejudice to the agency, there was good cause for waiving the filing time limit, and the board abused its discretion in refusing to do so. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Yuni</span>, 784 F.2d at 384. We therefore reverse the board's decision and remand the case for proceedings on the merits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A more expansive Board interpretation of <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span> is provided by <span class="Italic">Colon v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 190, 193 n.1 (1993), excusing a delayed filing without extensive analysis of the appellant's efforts to keep track of what her counsel did to perfect the appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...According to the affidavit of Irene Jackson, an associate of the appellant's counsel, copies of the documents were served upon opposing counsel and the Office of Personnel Management on July 30, 1990, but Ms. Jackson's secretary failed to follow her explicit instructions to mail copies of the documents to the Board. This failure was discovered on August 13, 1990, when Ms. Jackson was checking to see if return receipts had been received. When the Board's Office of the Clerk opened the next day, Ms. Jackson learned that the Board was not served with the documents. She therefore mailed them by express mail on that date. Ms. Jackson states that she had discussed matters appearing in the documents with a union representative for the appellant, and with opposing counsel, and had no reason to suspect that the Board had not received its copies. The secretary had been hired 11/2 months before the filing was due, and was fired for disruption and incompetence on August 6, 1990. In <span class="Italic">Dunbar v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 640 (1990), the Board found good cause for waiver of the time limit to appeal where the untimeliness was due to a deliberate act of defiance by the representative's secretary. We find the facts here to be similar to those in <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A filing delay in a mixed case was excused in <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Dept. of State</span>, 60 MSPR 441, 444-46 (1994), elaborating on <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 1, 1993, the EEOC administrative judge assigned to her discrimination complaint informed her that he would remand her complaint to the agency for processing as a "mixed case" and that she should consult with her attorney regarding her right to file a Board appeal from the agency's decision. On March 2, 1993, she contacted Mr. Howard who informed her that he would attempt to negotiate a settlement with the agency's representative and that he would "handle" her appeal to the Board should his settlement efforts be unsuccessful. Since then, she telephoned Mr. Howard several times to inquire about the status of her case, but he did not return any of her calls. On May 17, 1993, she received a copy of the agency's final decision and belatedly became aware of the procedures and the time limit for filing a Board appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's contentions regarding the circumstances are not inherently incredible and are not disputed or rebutted by the agency. They indicate that her former attorney apparently dropped her as a client without filing this appeal as he had promised and without giving her adequate notice so that she could timely file the appeal on her own or through another representative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In general, an appellant is bound by the failures of her chosen representative. In <span class="Italic">Dunbar v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 640, 643-45 (1990), however, the Board recognized that there are situations when applying this general principle would be inequitable. The Board held in <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span> that it would not apply this principle where an appellant has proven that her diligent efforts to prosecute her appeal were, without her knowledge, thwarted by her representative's deceptions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that the appellant was unaware of the time limit for filing this Board appeal until May 17, 1993, when she belatedly received a copy of the agency's final decision. As discussed above, her diligent efforts to prosecute her case were thwarted by her former attorney's failure to respond to her repeated inquiries about the status of her case, even while the time limit for filing the appeal was running unbeknownst to her. The evidence is clear that the appellant and her former attorney were not acting as one. We therefore find that her former attorney's negligence or malfeasance should not be attributed to her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that in <span class="Italic">Shavers v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 187, 190-91 (1992), the Board held that <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span> did not apply to a situation where the appellant merely made futile attempts to contact his representative while allowing the time limit for filing his appeal to expire. The Board stated that in such a situation the appellant's unwarranted reliance on his representative, while failing to take any action on his own in the face of his knowledge of the filing deadline, did not show due diligence. Unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">Shavers</span>, however, the appellant here had no notice of the filing deadline until after the deadline had passed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the appellant's former attorney here did not "actively" mislead or deceive the appellant by making false statements as did the appellant's representative in <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span>. We find, however, that the actions of the appellant's former attorney were misleading and deceptive in effect under the circumstances because the appellant could have reasonably believed, based on his failure to contact her or respond to her inquiries, either that the agency had not yet issued a final decision or that he had timely filed a Board appeal as he had promised. We find that <span id="Page_1020"></span>the appellant's former attorney thereby "misled and lulled his client into believing th[e] case was proceeding smoothly."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the appellant exhibited due diligence by promptly filing this appeal, through another representative, 2 days after her receipt of the agency's final decision. Upon considering all of the circumstances of this appeal, we find that the appellant has established good cause for waiver of the time limit. The agency has not argued or shown that its ability to defend this appeal was prejudiced by the appellant's 23-day filing delay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Delayed filing in another mixed-case appeal was not excused, however, based on reliance on counsel whose efforts on the case were not actively monitored by the appellant, <span class="Italic">Batchelor v. DHUD</span>, AT-0752-10-1089-I-1 (NP 6/1/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, because the appellant's representative received the final agency decision on the appellant's Equal Employment Opportunity complaint on July 17, 2010, the appellant's appeal was filed 35 days late. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fain v. Department of Education</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 162, &#x00B6; 5 (2005) (the receipt of an initial decision by an appellant's designated representative constitutes constructive receipt by the appellant). Thus, the dispositive issue in this case is whether the appellant demonstrated good cause for her untimely filed appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To determine whether an appellant has shown good cause, the Board will consider the length of the delay, the reasonableness of her excuse and her showing of due diligence, whether she is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and whether she has presented evidence of the existence of circumstances beyond her control that affected her ability to comply with the time limits, or of unavoidable casualty or misfortune which similarly shows a causal relationship to her inability to timely file her petition. <span class="Italic">Alvarado v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 407, &#x00B6; 4 (2010); <span class="Italic">Moorman v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 60, 62-63 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 79 F.3d 1167 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table). To establish that an untimely filing was the result of an illness, an appellant must: (1) identify the time period during which she suffered from the illness; (2) submit medical evidence showing that she suffered from the alleged illness during that time period; and (3) explain how the illness prevented her from timely filing her appeal or a request for an extension of time. <span class="Italic">Lacy v. Department of the Navy,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 434, 437 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant reiterated her argument that her appeal was untimely filed because she was misled by her attorney, who she alleged contacted her immediately before the filing deadline for her appeal to inform her that he no longer wished to represent her. However, the appellant has not asserted that she actively monitored her appeal, but that her attorney thwarted her diligent efforts to pursue her appeal. <span class="Italic">See Lagreca v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 162, &#x00B6; 10 (2010). The Board has otherwise consistently held that an appellant is responsible for the errors of her chosen representative. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 667, 670 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Anthony v. SSA</span>, PH-0432-15-0405-I-1 (NP 7/28/2016) ("The appellant, however, is responsible for the alleged errors of her chosen representative, except where her diligent efforts to prosecute her appeal are thwarted by her representative's negligence or malfeasance. <span class="Italic">Moore v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 268, 271 (1998).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Notwithstanding decisions permitting untimely filings due to obstruction by representatives, the appellant may be charged with a duty to determine the status of her appeal from the best source available--the MSPB--if substantial delay is to be excused, <span class="Italic">Wright v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 98-3237):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties agree that the present appeal is untimely because it was filed on July 17, 1997, over nine months after the October 1, 1996 deadline. The board may waive the time limit for refiling an appeal, however, when the petitioner shows good cause for delay. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.22(c) (1998). "Delay is excusable where, under the circumstances, a petitioner exercises diligence or ordinary prudence." <span class="Italic">Mendoza v.</span> <span class="Italic">Merit Sys. Protection</span> Bd., 966 F.2d 650, 653 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">in banc</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We must affirm the board's decision to deny a good cause waiver of a filing deadline unless the decision is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(c) (1994); <span class="Italic">Webb v. Merit</span> <span class="Italic">Sys. Protection</span> Bd., 70 F.3d 104, 105 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Rowe v. Merit Sys. Protection</span> <span class="Italic">Bd.</span>, 802 F.2d 434, 437 (Fed. Cir. 1986). "We have often stated that whether the...time limit for an appeal should be waived based upon a showing of good cause is a matter committed to the Board's discretion and [we] will not substitute [our] own judgment for that of the Board." <span class="Italic">Mendoza</span>, 966 F.2d at 653.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board did not abuse its discretion in holding that Wright lacked good cause for refiling her appeal late. Wright argues that her representative failed to file her appeal despite her instructions to do so. "It is well settled that a person is bound by the consequences of his representative's conduct, which includes both his acts and omissions." <span class="Italic">Rowe</span>, 802 F.2d at 437. Wright thus "had a personal duty to monitor the progress of [her] appeal at all times and not leave it entirely to" her representative, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 438, which she failed to discharge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Wright seeks to escape the consequences of this failure by claiming that her representative misled her into believing that the appeal had been filed, thus thwarting her attempts to monitor its progress. A litigant "cannot escape the consequences of the lateness of his appeal that was filed by his [representative] after the deadline, even though [he] himself acted in good faith in relying on the advice and actions of his [representative]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 437. Although there may be an exception to this rule where an "attorney has intentionally misrepresented facts to the client and the client has justifiably relied on those misrepresentations to his detriment," <span class="Italic">Huston v. Ladner</span>, 973 F.2d 1564, 1570-71 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Newman, J. dissenting), the board did not abuse its discretion in holding that such an exception does not apply in this case, <span class="Italic">cf. id</span>. at 1567 (majority opinion) ("The question is not whether we, had we been on the Board, would have voted to grant [the] petition...[but rather] can we say that the decision to the contrary was an abuse of the Board's discretion?").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board found that Wright did not act diligently in monitoring the status of her appeal. We see no error in this conclusion because Wright utterly failed to verify that her representative refiled the appeal. Despite the irregularity of not being served with a copy of the pleading or the board's Acknowledgment Order, Wright never even asked her representative for copies of these documents. Although she wrote to the President, her senator, the Department of Defense Inspector General, and the EEOC after the deadline expired, she never contacted the board, the most likely source of information, to learn the status of her appeal. Wright argues that she wrote the President at the direction of her representative. But even this did not prevent her from contacting the board as well.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board excused filing delay for an individual who received poor information from his representative concerning the time for filing a mixed case appeal (previously required to be filed within 120-365 days following the filing of an agency EEO complaint). There was no showing of prejudice to the agency. <span class="Italic">Sturdavant v. USPS</span>, 9 MSPR 565, 569 (1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Speaking of representatives, to the extent delays of counsel have been forgiven, the same analysis applies to union representatives, <span class="Italic">McAuley v. OPM</span>, NY-844E-14-0134-I-1 (NP 8/27/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has held that a limited exception to this rule exists when an appellant has proven that her diligent efforts to prosecute her case were thwarted by her representative's deception and negligence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also Dunbar v. Department of the Navy</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 640, 643-45 (1990). The appellant states that she chose her representative because she could not afford a lawyer. However, because she freely chose her own representation, she is responsible for the errors of their alleged untimely filing. <span class="Italic">See Miller</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 258, &#x00B6; 11. The documentation included with the appellant's petition for review does not suggest deception or negligence that could establish that the union representatives effectively thwarted the prosecution of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. at 643-65). Rather, the documentation only seems to show that one of the representatives who allegedly was working the decedent's case fell ill, not that any deception or negligence occurred. <span class="Italic">See Miller</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 258, &#x00B6; 11. Further, the appellant has not alleged facts that, if proven, could show that she or Mr. McAuley had otherwise been making diligent efforts to timely file an appeal. <span class="Italic">See Miller</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 258, &#x00B6; 11. The administrative judge correctly noted below that these circumstances do not constitute good cause for filing the appeal 619 days late. <span class="Italic">See Moorman</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 63; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(c).</p>
