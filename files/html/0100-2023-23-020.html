<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-21"><span class="space">a.</span> Incomplete Settlement; Omitted Terms</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board generally accepts settlements without much regard to their substance, and there are plenty of insubstantial settlements. There are exceptions, principally when the agreement contains a term that the AJ spots as being unlawful or unenforceable. In an appeal involving settlement of a Hatch Act complaint, the Board declined to accept an incomplete, unenforceable agreement regarding withholding of federal funds from a state agency. The settlement was rejected and the case was sent back to the Board's ALJ. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Spickard</span>, 58 MSPR 108, 110 (1993). Hatch Act cases aside, and reserving for later discussion settlements containing provisions arguably contrary to law, the parties make their agreements and the Board accepts them with their imperfections. A good AJ will offer suggestions, if asked, during settlement negotiations. Ultimately it is the parties' responsibility to arrive at a complete agreement capable of enforcement by the Board if the parties intend the Board to accept the agreement for that purpose.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board will not set aside an agreement because a party complains that some matters were not included in the agreement. Nor will the Board modify a material term in an agreement without a basis to set aside the agreement. <span class="Italic">Williamson v. VA</span>, 61 MSPR 66, 69 (1994). What is being settled should be clear. <span class="Italic">Colonel v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 38 MSPR 285, 291 (1988). If there are multiple, joined appeals under different docket numbers, the parties should specify in their settlement how the various actions are being treated to avoid prolongation of the litigation by MSPB's efforts to determine what was actually settled and dismissed and what remains to be adjudicated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hill v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 464, 467 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agreements have been negotiated that include basic elements--reinstatement, back pay, and counsel fees--but that are silent as to details concerning some aspect of the conditions of reinstatement. If terms are missing, there is no ambiguity and no clarification is necessary. There is no agreement as to the omitted point, meaning that an enforcement petition cannot be used to obtain a benefit that should have been, but was not, included in a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pittman v. USPS</span>, 29 MSPR 339, 342-43 (1985). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-222.html#sec16-221">Agreement to 'Cancel' Action; Back Pay, Interest, Damages, or Other Entitlement; Bonus or Award; Lump Sum Provision</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once a settlement agreement is reached, the appellant may only claim, through enforcement proceedings, rights consistent with the agreement. Remedies claimed for injuries suffered as a result of the adverse action but not addressed by the settlement are barred by the employee's acceptance of the terms of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Cuthbertson v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 84-1265). Clear evidence of the terms of a settlement agreement controls over the appellant's belief as to what was intended. <span class="Italic">Duffy v. Dept. of Interior</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3331); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. DOJ</span>, 37 MSPR 374, 378 (1988) (agreement not to attempt to collect on a portion of an allegedly improper voucher already paid to the employee did not constitute an agreement to pay the employee for a related portion of the claim). Should the agreement be recorded by the AJ and should the parties, with representation, agree that the terms of the agreement are reflected by their conference, the Board will not likely consider an appellant's protest that the agreement lacked terms that should have been included and that were included in a draft version of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nulty v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 57, 60 (1989) ("The Board will not set aside a settlement agreement where the objections are based on matters that were not included in the settlement agreement, and the Board has no authority to modify the material terms of a settlement agreement unilaterally."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Madlangbayan v. DOJ</span> (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">The parties should consider and provide for all of the possibilities encompassed by a settlement. The Board is not likely to read into a settlement what the parties do not write in. In <span class="Italic">Harrison v. VA</span>, 44 MSPR 594, 599 (1990), through settlement the parties converted a removal to a resignation postdated far enough to provide for a certain sum of back pay. When the appellant received his back pay, he moved for compliance, claiming that the agency failed to credit him with sick and annual leave during the period he was restored to an earnings status following settlement of the removal. The Board disagreed: whatever rights the appellant accrued derived from the settlement, not from an obligation of the agency to restore the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> following cancelation of a removal as an unwarranted personnel action under the Back Pay Act. Discerning no indication in the agreement that the appellant would be granted annual and sick leave credit, the Board proclaimed in <span class="Italic">Harrison</span> that "[b]ecause the appellant entered the settlement agreement without ensuring that the agreement expressly provided that he would receive annual and <span id="Page_4771"></span>sick leave credit, the appellant, in effect, removed the leave issue from the jurisdiction of the Board." In <span class="Italic">Bales v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 54 MSPR 187, 190 (1992), the appellant apparently claimed, in compliance proceedings, that the agency was releasing derogatory information about him. The Board did not consider the allegations in <span class="Italic">Bales</span>, determining that "[a]ppellant's contentions of slander, libel and retaliation are outside the scope of the Board's jurisdiction in this case because they do not relate to any provision of the settlement agreement." A settlement agreement stating that no further adverse action will be taken against an employee does not preclude a criminal case in federal district court. <span class="Italic">Davis v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1992 NP No. 91-3345). A settlement in an adverse action case that includes a provision that the appellant could contest the validity of a performance appraisal in "the appropriate forum" did not vest jurisdiction in the Board through compliance proceedings to address the level of the appraisal. The Board concluded that "[t]he issues surrounding the appellant's performance appraisal are not independently appealable to the Board, and the Board will not reopen and review issues surrounding an action which has been settled." <span class="Italic">Manley v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 68 MSPR 485, 488 (1995), <span class="Italic">rev'd and remanded</span>, <span class="Italic">Manley v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 91 F.3d 117 (Fed. Cir. 1996), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, 75 MSPR 103 (1997).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To resolve ambiguities, the Board may consider contemporaneous side agreements or modifications that the parties, by their words or conduct, construe to be part of the settlement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Moore v. Dept. of Army</span>, 38 MSPR 237, 241 (1988) (involving a settlement filed with the AJ after issuance of the initial decision dismissing an appeal on the basis of an oral settlement; the AJ put the written agreement in the record and the parties believed it to have been accepted; the agreement would be enforced by the Board despite the AJ's error, but "in the future...only the settlement terms which an administrative judge has approved and allowed to be entered into the record will be considered on a petition for enforcement of a settlement agreement"). The Board attempts to avoid illogical results when it interprets settlements. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wells v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 89 MSPR 228, 231-35 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-19 (2001) (commonsense approach to an agreement that failed to identify the employment status of the appellant following settlement of a probationary separation resulting from a negative suitability determination; the Board construed the agreement to call for the employee's resignation and clean record; the appellant was given the option of securing the enforcement or rescission of the settlement and reinstatement of appeal); <span class="Italic">Monahan v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 153, 157 (1989) (accepting agency's interpretation of a settlement when "[a]ny other interpretation of that provision would be illogical, at best"). The parties may, through their agreement, attempt to limit use of side agreements or "understandings" that vary the language of the written agreement.

<p class="Body-Text">If there is ambiguity, enforcement proceedings may be necessary to define the intent of the agreement through a hearing with testimony of individuals who know how and why the agreement was prepared. <span class="Italic">Greco v. Dept. of Army</span>, 25 MSPR 408, 409 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Readout v. OPM</span>, 78 MSPR 637, 644 (1998) (directing the agency to supply information to the Board concerning the meaning of the term "benefits" in an agreement settling a disability retirement appeal); <span class="Italic">Moore v. Dept. of Army</span>, 38 MSPR 237, 241 (1988) (reviewing contemporaneous documents, notes, and the events leading to the settlement agreement to resolve an ambiguity). But ambiguity is not the same as the omission of a term that a party later states should have been in the agreement by implication. "When a contract is silent as to a term, the term is removed from the Board's jurisdiction and the Board lacks the authority to unilaterally modify the material terms in a settlement agreement." <span class="Italic">DeLuna v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 526, 530 (1993) (characterizing the appellant's PFR as an attack on the validity of the settlement agreement rather than an enforcement petition seeking enforcement of the alleged "oral" agreement);<span class="Italic"> see</span> <span class="Italic">Flores v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Flores v. USPS</span>, 115 MSPR 189, 195-96 &#x00B6; 13, 2010 MSPB 215 (2010), noted as to the absence of a descriptive term for a position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he fact that the agreement does not use the terms part-time flexible or full-time regular does not mean that the agreement was ambiguous regarding the nature of the position specified in the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Galatis,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 651, &#x00B6; 10 (an assertion that an agreement is silent as to a particular matter does not necessarily make an agreement ambiguous); <span class="Italic">Haefele,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 630, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11 (the absence of a term in an oral settlement agreement indicating that the agreement was conditioned upon it being reduced to writing and signed by the parties did not mean that the agreement was ambiguous on that point, and the Board refused to consider the agency's evidence regarding the parties' intent or understanding at the time they entered into the agreement). Paragraph nine of the settlement agreement states that the "[a]greement shall be interpreted in accordance with the plain meaning of its terms and not strictly for or against any of the Parties hereto." The terms of the settlement agreement state a specific position, at a specific location, with specific duty hours providing for 8-hour days, and 2 specific days off per week. The plain meaning of these terms is that the appellant would be working a full-time position with a specific work schedule at the South Downey facility. Nothing in the agreement indicates that the specific terms regarding the appellant's schedule would be subject to the variability associated with part-time flexible positions with the agency. Thus, the clear and specific terms of the agreement are unambiguous and are not subject to variation. <span class="Italic">See Slattery,</span> 590 F.3d at 1347;<span class="Italic"> Galatis,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 651, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Haefele,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 630, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11. In these circumstances, we will not consider the agency's parol evidence regarding the agency's intent at the time it entered into the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Galatis,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 651, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Haefele,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 630, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Notwithstanding the case law concerning interpretation of ambiguous settlement agreements, the best policy is to write and sign complete and clear settlement agreements. Litigation in enforcement proceedings should not be a substitute for proper negotiation of settlement agreements. Judge Mayer of the Federal Circuit wrote a concurring opinion on counsel fees sought as a result of a partially successful compliance effort involving a somewhat ambiguous settlement agreement in <span class="Italic">Greco v. Dept. of Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558 (Fed. Cir. 1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court's interpretation of this settlement agreement is a reasonable one and I join it. But it is just that--an interpretation of this document; it has no greater effect. It would be far better if parties to a settlement remembered that it is a contract, which can and should be crafted to specifically cover what is contemplated. This would avoid cases like this one, so wasteful of the time and effort of all concerned, which asks us to fathom what the parties meant when they could so easily have said it themselves in the first place.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On occasion the Board may imply into an agreement an affirmative obligation of a party that is the natural result of that party's specific undertaking. In <span class="Italic">Eagleheart v. USPS</span>, 110 MSPR 642, 645-46 &#x00B6; 10, 2009 MSPB 37 (2009) (again remanded, 113 MSPR 89, 2009 MSPB 231 (2009)), the settlement called for rescission and removal from the appellant's record of the proposal and decision letters effecting his removal and the appellant was called upon to resign immediately for personal reasons. The appellant immediately executed a resignation form and the agency processed a PS-50 noting a resignation. Three months later the agency issued a corrected PS-50 stating that the appellant had resigned voluntarily for personal reasons. The delay in correction of the personnel records caused the appellant problems in a position with a later federal employer. The Board noted that the even though the agreement did not specify how the agency would document the resignation, the agency had an obligation to do so properly and promptly:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement is a contract, the interpretation of which is a matter of law. <span class="Italic">Greco v. Department of the Army,</span> 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). In construing the terms of a settlement agreement, the words of the agreement itself are of paramount importance, and parol evidence will be considered only if the agreement is ambiguous. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">West v. Department of the Army</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 531, &#x00B6; 10 (2004). Here, the agency agreed that the notice of proposed removal and the letter of decision would be rescinded and removed from the appellant's record of employment with the agency, and that the appellant would resign for "personal reasons." In return, the appellant agreed to withdraw his appeal and not institute any further appeals on the matters raised in the case. Notably, however, the settlement agreement does not specifically address the agency's obligation to issue an updated PS-50 documenting the appellant's voluntary resignation from the agency as part of the agency's agreement to cancel and rescind the removal action. When the appellant withdrew his Board appeal in exchange for the agency's cancellation and rescission of his removal, his goal was to eliminate this negative information as it may affect future employment with the government or elsewhere; no other reasonable meaning has been proposed. <span class="Italic">See King v. Department of the Navy,</span> 130 F.3d 1031, 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("When an employee voluntarily resigns in exchange for purging of the records that show the prior adverse action, the employee's goal...is to eliminate this information as it may affect future employment."). Thus, the Board has ruled under similar circumstances that such an agreement requires the agency to provide the appellant with an updated Standard Form (SF) 50. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wells v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 228, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-17 (2001) (although the settlement agreement did not call upon the agency to issue an updated SF-50 documenting the appellant's resignation in lieu of a negative suitability determination, the only reasonable interpretation of the agreement was that it required the agency to issue an updated SF-50 documenting the voluntary resignation). Therefore, under the circumstances of this case, it would be reasonable to interpret the agreement as requiring the agency to provide an updated PS-50 documenting the appellant's voluntary resignation for personal reasons.</p>
