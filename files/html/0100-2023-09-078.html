<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-77"><span class="space">b.</span> Belated Receipt of Adverse Action Decision</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's current regulation reflects the necessity of a full 30-day notice period, but the regulation precludes intentional avoidance of receipt of an agency decision in an appealable action, 5 CFR 1201.22(b) (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an appeal must be filed no later than 30 days after the effective date, if any, of the action being appealed, or 30 days after the date of the appellant's receipt of the agency's decision, whichever is later. Where an appellant and an agency mutually agree in writing to attempt to resolve their dispute through an alternative dispute resolution process prior to the timely filing of an appeal, however, the time limit for filing the appeal is extended by an additional 30 days--for a total of 60 days....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;The time limit prescribed by paragraph (b)(1) of this section for filing an appeal does not apply where a law or regulation establishes a different time limit or where there is no applicable time limit. No time limit applies to appeals under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (Pub. L. 103-353), as amended; see part 1208 of this title. <span class="Italic">See</span> part 1208 of this title for the statutory filing time limits applicable to appeals under the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act (Pub. L. 105-339). <span class="Italic">See</span> part 1209 of this title for the statutory filing time limits applicable to whistleblower appeals and stay requests.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;An appellant is responsible for keeping the agency informed of his or her current home address for purposes of receiving the agency's decision, and correspondence which is properly addressed and sent to the appellant's address via postal or commercial delivery is presumed to have been duly delivered to the addressee. While such a presumption may be overcome under the circumstances of a particular case, an appellant may not avoid service of a properly addressed and mailed decision by intentional or negligent conduct which frustrates actual service. The appellant may also be deemed to have received the agency's decision if it was received by a designated representative or a person of suitable age and discretion residing with the appellant. The following examples illustrate the application of this rule:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example A</span>: An appellant who fails to pick up mail delivered to his or her post office box may be deemed to have received the agency decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example B</span>: An appellant who did not receive his or her mail while in the hospital may overcome the presumption of actual receipt.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example C</span>: An appellant may be deemed to have received an agency decision received by his or her roommate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Duran v. VA</span>, 76 MSPR 311, 313-14 (1997), resolved that the appeal period ran from receipt of the adverse action decision rather than the letter referencing the decision. The adverse action decision was essential because it provided the basis of removal, the effective date of removal, and a statement of appeal rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appeal of a removal action must be filed with the Board no later than 30 days after the effective date of that removal action. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). Where an agency fails to provide an employee with notice of the employee's removal on or before the effective date of the removal, the date of the employee's receipt of the removal notice must be considered the effective date of the removal for purposes of the running of the period for filing a Board appeal of that removal action<span class="Italic">. Loui v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 25 F.3d 1011, 1014 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">accord McClendon v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 66 MSPR 211, 213-14 (1995). In such a case, it is irrelevant for purposes of determining the timeliness of the appeal whether the employee needed the full filing period or whether the employee could have contacted the agency concerning the appeal requirements<span class="Italic">. Loui</span>, 25 F.3d at 1014; <span class="Italic">accord Alejandro v. Department of the Navy</span>, 64 MSPR 506, 508 (1994). Thus, the appellant's petition for appeal of her removal had to be filed no later than 30 days from the date of her receipt of the agency's notice of her removal to be timely<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.22(b); <span class="Italic">Loui</span>, 25 F.3d at 1013-14; <span class="Italic">McClendon</span>, 66 MSPR at 213-14; <span class="Italic">Alejandro</span>, 64 MSPR at 508-09.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first find that the agency's June 7, 1996 letter did not constitute notice of the appellant's removal for purposes of triggering the 30-day filing period. That letter merely stated that the agency would not change its decision to remove her and referred her to the agency's May 29, 1996 decision letter for her appeal rights. In the June 7, 1996 letter, however, the agency did not enclose a copy of the May 29, 1996 decision letter and did not provide the appellant with the effective date of her removal or with Board appeal rights. Because the June 7, 1996 letter did not provide the appellant with the basis of her removal, appeal rights, or the effective date of her removal, information necessary to prepare her appeal, we find that the 30-day filing period did not begin on the date she received the June 7, 1996 letter<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 752.404(0; <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 669, 673-74 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">cf. Paradiso v. Department of the Army</span>, 65 MSPR 324, 327-28 (1994) (finding that the delayed receipt of an SF-50 did not toll the running of the filing period because the appellant, having already received the agency's final decision, knew of the basis of her removal and of her appeal rights by the time she was removed and she thus did not need the SF-50 to prepare her appeal), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 61 F.3d 919 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the 30-day filing period began to run, instead, when the appellant received the agency's May 29, 1996 decision letter....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1997 the Board amended its regulations to allow filing the later of 30 days after the effective date of an action or 30 days after the date of receipt of the agency's action. Earlier decisions, applying a regulation that clocked the appeal period from the effective date of the decision, extended the period for appeal when delivery of the appealable decision was delayed. Late filing would be excused if the employee learned of the adverse action after its effective date. In <span class="Italic">Alsup v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 4 MSPR 61, 62, 4 MSPB 150 (1980), a demotion was effective November 17, 1979, but the appellant was not notified of the action until January 22, 1980. Although appeal rights were not provided by notice to the appellant, the appeal form was signed on February 4, 1980, and filed February 28, 1980. Without requiring further evidence of the delay, the Board reversed the decision of the AJ who dismissed the appeal as untimely. Time for filing an appeal was again extended when an agency suspended an employee for six months but, due to an administrative oversight, retroactively instigated the suspension in the fifth month, delayed issuance of a notice of the suspension until the fifth month, and failed to inform the employee of her appeal rights when the notice was issued. <span class="Italic">McQuerter v. Dept. of Army</span>, 3 MSPR 456, 457, 3 MSPB 527 (1980); <span class="Italic">see Nash</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">McClendon v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 66 MSPR 211, 214 (1995) (delay of the receipt of an adverse action decision extended the appeal period by a time equal to the delay); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. USPS</span>, 60 MSPR 665, 667 (1994) (appeal was timely when the employee belatedly received notice of the removal decision and when the agency advised the Board that the effective date of the removal was after the date stated in the removal decision); <span class="Italic">Hardway v. USPS</span>, 15 MSPR 387, 389 (1983) (appellant was unaware that he was removed until only a few days remained of the time for appeal: "Equity would require that Mr. Hardway have 20 days from the date he knew he must file an appeal of his effected removal to do so.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In<span class="Italic"> Loui v. MSPB</span>, 25 F.3d 1011, 1013-14 (Fed. Cir. 1994), a decision that contributed to the Board's 1997 revisions in the regulation setting the time limits for appeals, the agency decision letter was dated February 22, the removal was effective February 19, and the appeal was filed more than 20 days after the effective date, but within 20 days of the employee's receipt of the letter. The Board concluded that the appeal was untimely. The Federal Circuit reversed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Administrative Personnel Regulations set forth procedures by which a federal employee may appeal an agency action to the board. One such regulation requires that an appeal be filed "during the period beginning on the day after the effective date of the action being appealed and ending 20 days after the effective date." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.22(b) (1993). It is the Board's policy that section 1201.22(b) be applied in a manner that expedites the processing of its cases, but with due regard to the rights of the parties before it. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.11 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations also specify procedures an agency must follow when it removes an employee. Section 752.404(f) explicitly requires an agency to "deliver the notice of decision to the employee <span class="Italic">at or before</span> the time the action will be effective, and advise the employee of appeal rights." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 752.404(f) (1993), (emphasis added). An obvious purpose of section 752.404(f) is to ensure that an employee can take full advantage of the period of time allowed under the regulations in order to file an appeal once he or she learns of the basis for an agency's decision and of the right to appeal that decision. Therefore, any stated effective date in a written notice that is prior to the date of delivery of that notice conflicts with the regulations and is consequently a nullity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case thus involves the interplay between the two regulations. Since <span id="Page_969"></span>they relate to the same subject matter, they must be construed to be consistent with each other if at all possible....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's action in attempting to enforce an effective date before delivery of notice not only violated section 752.404(f), it also deprived the employee of part of the appeal time provided for in section 1201.22(b). Eight days out of the 20-day time period, or forty percent of Loui's appeal time, had expired by the time notice of Loui's removal was delivered to him. Such a result does not reconcile and give full force to both regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have recognized in regard to the timeliness of appeals to the board that "[t]he critical element...is that the employee acted promptly and within the allowable time limits once he was aware of the basis of his claim."...&#8197;Accordingly, we have held that the limitations period for filing an appeal to the board is tolled until an agency informs the employee of his or her appeal rights<span class="Italic">. Casey</span>, 748 F.2d at 686. Similarly, in order to give meaning and effect to both sections 752.404(f) and 1201.22(b), we hold that for purposes of determining when the 20-day time period for appeal begins in cases in which the stated effective date in a removal notice is earlier than the date of delivery of the removal notice, the date of delivery must be considered to be the "effective date."' Loui thus met the 20-day requirement here by appealing within 20 days of delivery of the notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the government's assertion, the agency's late notice obviously was not "harmless error." Loui, while filing his appeal within 20 days of receiving notice, was found to have lost his right of appeal. Ironically, it is the Postal Service's untimely delivered certified mail letter that underscores the importance of section 752.404(f). That regulation requires delivery before the 20-day appeal period begins, clearly recognizing that a short period of time can be greatly diminished by the vicissitudes of the mail, even that sent and delivered by the Postal Service itself. It is irrelevant that Loui might not have needed the full 20 days, as indicated by the AJ, or that he could have contacted the agency concerning the appeal requirements. The regulations in their entirety gave Loui 20 days from the date of delivery of notice and he was entitled to the full amount. Section 752.404(f) cannot be interpreted in such a way as to deprive an employee of part of the time for appeal provided for by section 1201.22(b).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Loui</span> was adopted and applied by the Board, <span class="Italic">Alejandro v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 64 MSPR 506, 508-09 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case involves the application of two separate Board regulations. First, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.22(b) requires that an appeal be filed "during the period beginning on the day after the effective date of the action being appealed and ending 20 days after the effective date." Second, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 752.404(f) requires an agency to "deliver the notice of decision to the employee at or before the time the action will be effective, and advise the employee of appeal rights."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently interpreted the application of these regulations for the purpose of determining when the 20-day time period for an appeal begins, and found that in order to give meaning and effect to both sections 752.404(f) and 1201.22(b) in cases in which the stated effective date in a removal notice is earlier than the date of delivery of the removal notice, "the date of delivery must be considered to be the 'effective date.'" <span class="Italic">Loui v. MSPB</span>, 25 F.3d 1011, 1014 (Fed. Cir. June 1, 1994). The court found that to hold otherwise would not give full force to both regulations and would "deprive an employee of part of the time for appeal provided for by 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)." The court further found that it is irrelevant whether the appellant needed the full twenty days in which to file his appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant claims that he received his notice letter on November 16, 1993, and that it was mailed on November 12, 1993, the effective date of his removal. The agency did not dispute this claim below. Thus, we presume that the appellant's assertion is true and that he did not receive the notice of removal until four days after the effective date of the removal action. Therefore, applying <span class="Italic">Loui v. MSPB</span>, the date of delivery, November 16, 1993, must be considered to be the effective date for the purpose of determining the timeliness of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When the date of receipt of the agency decision is disputed, the Board receives and considers relevant documents, e.g., return receipts provided by the Postal Service. <span class="Italic">Cuellar v. USPS</span>, 3 MSPR 135, 136 (1980). In <span class="Italic">Williams v. EEOC</span>, 75 MSPR 144, 148 (1997), the issue was when the appellant received the agency EEO decision that triggered his right to pursue a mixed case appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Postal Service sometimes leaves certified mail with the addressee, and allows the addressee to fill in any date as the date of receipt....&#8197;There is no evidence that the dates shown on the return receipts are unreliable in general, nor is there any reason to believe that, in this particular case, the appellant actually received the final agency decision prior to the date shown on the postal return receipt. The very purpose of sending an article using return receipt service is to establish a record of receipt, including the date; the agency chose this method to send the final agency decision to the appellant, and it cannot now disavow the record created.</p>
