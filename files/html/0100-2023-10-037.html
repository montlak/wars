<p class="noindent">In 2018 FLRA clarified criteria controlling unit exclusion of personnel office employees in <span class="Italic">VA Kansas City Med. Ctr. and AFGE</span>, 70 FLRA 465, 467-69 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting) (recon. den., <span class="Italic">VA Kansas City Med. Ctr. and AFGE</span>, 70 FLRA 960 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting)), permitting unit inclusion if the duties of the employees is "exclusively focused on administrative tasks like filing and typing":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7112(b)(3) excludes from a bargaining unit employees who are "engaged in personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity." In our view, many of the Authority's past interpretations of whether an employee was "engaged in personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity" are inconsistent with the Statute's plain language. We take this opportunity to clarify what &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3) of the Statute means.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Beginning with Executive Orders 10,988 and 11,491 that predated the Statute, bargaining units could not include "an employee engaged in Federal personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity." While the Orders and subsequently the Statute do not define these terms, earlier decisions under Executive Order 11,491 of the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor-Management Relations (Assistant Secretary) are instructive. Employees were found to be engaged in federal personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity when they "engaged in making determinations as to the [agency]'s manpower needs, screening job applicants and passing on their qualifications to fill job vacancies, and processing new hires and terminations";[31] provided advice and guidance on personnel matters;[32] assisted with hiring;[33] made recommendations that were followed;[34] had access to confidential personnel information;[35] actively participated in the development of policy and programs;[36] were "privy to essentially the same personnel[-]related <span id="Page_46"></span>information [as] [p]ersonnel [s]pecialists";[37] prepared vacancy announcements;[38] and prepared and processed personnel actions, such as promotions, reassignments, pay increases, and transfers.[39]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's earlier decisions, like <span class="Italic">Department of HHS, Region X, Seattle, Washington</span>,[43] found that an employee who set up an initial qualifying test for job applicants at the agency and who helped screen applicants was performing personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity.[44] In <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration, Washington, D.C. &#x0026; Veterans Administration Medical Center, Salisbury, North Carolina</span>,[45] the Authority found that a personnel assistant should be excluded from the bargaining unit as she served as the agency's resource on workers' compensation and retirement and death benefit programs.[46] In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Headquarters, 101st Airborne Division, Fort Campbell, Kentucky</span>,[47] the Authority found that employees who analyzed an agency's workload and made staffing recommendations were excluded from the unit.[48] However, in more recent decisions, the Authority has not excluded employees performing personnel work.[49] In determining whether a position was excluded, the Authority also required that the employee's duties not be performed in a routine manner and that the employee exercise independent judgment and discretion.[50]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We believe that the Statute's plain wording, and the understanding reflected in the earlier decisions of the Assistant Secretary, indicate that (1) employees engaged in personnel work were meant to be excluded from bargaining units unless their work was "purely clerical," and (2) "purely clerical" would mean that the employee was exclusively focused on administrative tasks like filing and typing. For this reason, personnel work that involves evaluating, advising, recommending, and making assessments is not purely clerical. So, any analysis of the &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3) exclusion must comport with the Statute's plain language, and we now reconsider and reverse prior Authority decisions[51] that overly relied on analyzing whether duties were performed in a routine manner or whether employees exercised independent judgment and discretion.[52]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[52]&#x2003;We note that the revised analysis applied in this case is consistent with Member Beck's dissent in <span class="Italic">Martinez</span>, 66 FLRA at 525-27.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3) as written, we find that the staffing assistants, at issue here, are excluded from the bargaining unit because the duties they perform are not purely clerical.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the staffing assistants do perform some clerical duties, several of the duties that they perform are not clerical. Staffing assistants are "responsible for answering whatever questions the [department] chiefs might have about staffing." They "respond to these inquiries by conducting research, reviewing personnel documents, and contacting employees' supervisors when necessary." They also provide advice on responding to staffing shortages, including recommending advertising vacancies using social media and newspapers. Furthermore, staffing assistants are responsible for qualifying job applicants. They "ensure that the applicant selection complies with applicable policies and procedures." In her decision, the RD highlighted one example of a staffing assistant who, based on a note, was concerned that a selection had violated merit system principles. The staffing assistant intervened and "made certain recommendations to mitigate the risk of a violation." Staffing assistants also decide whether or not to forward applicants' cover letters or other application materials to the hiring departments. Further, "[t]here are no governing [Agency] guidelines about where a [department] may post vacancy announcements," so staffing assistants cannot rely on them, and instead need to use their own judgment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the staffing assistants are engaged in personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3) and, as a result, we find that they are excluded from the bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent">The rationale of <span class="italic">VA Kansas City</span> was summarily reaffirmed, <span class="italic">USDA, Forest Serv. and NFFE, IAM, Region 1</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-53.html">72 FLRA 261</a> (2021) (Chairman DuBester dissenting) (human resources specialists and assistants).</p>
<p class="noindent">The decisions that follow, preceding <span class="Italic">VA Kansas City</span>, are not overruled (unless noted), but they need to be considered with the 2018 decision in mind.</p>
<p class="noindent">Staffing assistants and staffing clerks who performed purely clerical functions were in the unit. They were not engaged in personnel work in other than a clerical capacity. They screened applications for technical sufficiency, typed routine personnel notification forms, and kept files current. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, U.S. Naval Station, Panama and AFSCME Local 907</span>, 7 FLRA 489, 493 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3529 and DOD, DCAA</span>, 57 FLRA 633, 638 (2001) (customer service representative reviewed personnel actions to ensure that the proper steps were followed, but employee did not exercise independent judgment or perform duties in other than routine manner); <span class="Italic">VAMC, Prescott and AFGE Local 2401</span>, 29 FLRA 1313, 1315-16 (1987) (Personnel Staffing Assistant, GS-4, and Personnel Actions Clerk, GS-5, were involved in clerical work).</p>
<p class="noindent">Human resource specialists doing routine personnel work involving no exercise of independent judgment were within the unit in <span class="Italic">USDA, Forest Serv. and NFFE,</span> 64 FLRA 239, 239, 241-43 (2009) (overruled by <span class="Italic">VA Kansas City Med.

Ctr. and AFGE</span>, 70 FLRA 960 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the Decision, the RD rejected the Activity's claim that the fourteen HRS positions fall within &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3)'s exclusion for employees engaged in personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity. The RD applied the legal framework set forth in <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C., </span>36 FLRA 138, 144 (1990) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, the RD found that the duties performed by the employees in the HRS positions did not require the consistent exercise of independent judgment or discretion "rising above the routine" and "which, when utilized might result in actions adverse to bargaining unit members, or otherwise might have a direct impact on the work environment of the unit." The RD also found that the employees were "well trained subject matter experts and technicians working in an administrative capacity[,]" and that they "perform their duties in a routine manner, <span id="Page_47"></span>[and] in accordance with established policies and procedures." The RD concluded that there was no basis for excluding the HRS positions from the proposed bargaining unit under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity's challenge to the RD's finding that the disputed HRS positions should be included in the proposed bargaining unit is also unsupported. The RD rejected the Activity's claim that the HRS positions fall within the &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3) exclusion for employees engaged in personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD did not fail to apply established law when he resolved the unit status of the HRS positions. Looking to pertinent Authority precedent for guidance, the RD found that, even though the HRS employees perform duties as resource persons in personnel matters, they perform their duties in a routine manner in accordance with established Activity guidelines. The RD also determined that the HRS employees are not required to exercise independent judgment or discretion in carrying out those duties. Finally, the RD determined that the HRS employees do not perform their duties in a manner that would create a conflict of interest between their job duties and their union affiliation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The principles applied and the issues resolved by the RD in reaching these conclusions accurately reflect the principles and issues recognized as relevant by Authority precedent. <span class="Italic">See Local 3529</span>, 57 FLRA at 639; <span class="Italic">FDIC, San Francisco, Cal</span>, 49 FLRA 1598, 1602 (1994); <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 36 FLRA at 145. <span class="Italic">Cf. United States Dep't of the Army Headquarters, 101st Airborne Div., Fort Campbell, Ky.</span>, 36 FLRA 598, 603-04 (1990) (analysts excluded under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3) because they exercised independent judgment as to the appropriateness of the Activity's organizational structure, staffing, method of operation and capital investments). Moreover, the Activity does not dispute that the RD applied the correct principles; the Activity disputes only the results of that application. Therefore, we reject the Activity's contention that the RD failed to apply established law when he held that the HRS positions should be included in the proposed unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority decisions cited by the Activity are distinguishable. Some of the cited cases, unlike here, involved employees whose inclusion in bargaining units would create a conflict of interest between their job duties and their union affiliation. <span class="Italic">See 832nd Combat Support Group, Luke AFB, Ariz., </span>23 FLRA 768, 771 (1986) (citing <span class="Italic">SSA, </span>17 FLRA 239, 240 (1985); <span class="Italic">EPA, Region VII, Kansas City, Mo.</span>, 14 FLRA 25, 26 (1984); <span class="Italic">Veterans Admin., Washington, D.C.</span>, 11 FLRA 176, 177 (1983); and <span class="Italic">Dep't of Health and Human Serv., Region X, Seattle, Wash.</span>, 9 FLRA 518, 524-25 (1982)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping Agency, Hydrographic/Topographic Center, Providence Field Office</span>, 13 FLRA 407-08 (1983) is distinguishable because the employee at issue was "the resident expert on certain personnel matters[,]" "sat in on bargaining sessions dealing with performance appraisals[,] and shortly after ratification of the collective bargaining agreement conducted a training session for supervisors on the new performance appraisal system." The HRS employees do not perform any comparable duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the remaining cited cases are distinguishable because the employees were not excluded on &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3) grounds. <span class="Italic">See IRS</span>, 36 FLRA at 145-46: <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Housing and Urban Dev.</span>, 34 FLRA 207, 214 (1990); <span class="Italic">Headquarters Fort Sam Houston, Fort Sam Houston, Tex, </span>5 FLRA 339 (1981).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is also no merit to the Activity's contention that the RD committed clear and prejudicial errors concerning substantial factual matters regarding the HRS positions. The RD made extensive factual findings supporting his determination that the HRS employees exercise their duties in a routine manner, that they do not exercise independent judgment, and that they do not perform their duties in such a manner as to create a conflict of interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity does not directly challenge any of the RD's factual findings as unsupported by the record. Rather, the Activity cites assertedly contrary evidence to substantiate its claim that the RD erred. The evidence cited by the Activity does not directly controvert the RD's findings. The Activity's disagreement with the weight the RD ascribed to certain evidence does not provide a basis for finding that the RD committed clear errors in making factual findings. <span class="Italic">E.g., United States Dep't of Defense, Pentagon Force Protection Agency, Washington, D.C.</span>, 62 FLRA 164, 170 (2007) (disagreement over evidentiary weight not sufficient to find that RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter); <span class="Italic">Nat'l Credit Union Admin</span>., 59 FLRA 858, 862 (2004) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the RD's factual findings are supported by the record. The RD found, for example, that the HRS employees' performance "does not require the consistent exercise of independent judgment or discretion rising above the routine[.]" Supporting this finding, the record discloses, for example, that employees perform their duties in accordance with standardized guidelines such as manuals and handbooks that extensively explain policies and procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the record supports the RD's finding that the HRS positions do not perform their duties in such a manner as to create a conflict of interest. For example, the record includes testimony that the employees do not perform staffing level studies and are not involved in performance actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that review of the RD's Decision is not warranted on the ground that the RD failed to apply established law or committed clear and prejudicial errors concerning substantial factual matters relating to the HRS positions.</p>
<p class="noindent">A GS-6 Personnel Assistant was engaged in personnel work in other than a clerical capacity. She spent the majority of her time doing work related to the Workers' Compensation and Retirement and Death Benefit programs: counseling of employees and answering their questions; ensuring that all paperwork was properly processed; authorizing medical treatment and continuation of pay to affected employees. <span class="Italic">VA and AFGE</span>, 11 FLRA 176, 177 (1983). A GS-6 Personnel Assistant engaged in personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity. The employee monitored the incentive awards program, kept the automatic personnel data system current, processed personnel actions, answered employees' and supervisors' questions about personnel matters, handled college recruitment, ran training sessions, was the resident expert on certain personnel matters, attended bargaining sessions concerning performance appraisals, and was privy to personnel information on all employees of the activity. <span class="Italic">DMA, Hydrographic/Topographic Ctr., Providence Field Office and AFGE Local 1884</span>, 13 FLRA 407, 407-08 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">VA, St. Louis Healthcare System and AFGE</span>, 70 FLRA 247, 247 (2017) (HR assistants were within unit; their work on recruitment was not more than clerical: "The RD found that the HR assistants perform or plan to perform recruitment duties through creating and posting job announcements through USA Staffing. They create job announcements by editing prior announcements and relying on information provided by the hiring department, handbooks, guides, and manuals. This includes 'copy[ing] all the included information from boilerplate templates.' When job announcements close, HR assistants are responsible for qualifying applicants by reviewing their application materials to see if they have described performing similar duties. If the HR assistants are unsure whether an applicant is qualified, they ask a specialist or their supervisor. The RD found that the HR assistants 'do not interview applicants and do not determine which applicants are the best qualified.'").</p>
<p class="noindent">An administrative assistant, whose job was to maintain records of time and attendance, remained in the unit, <span class="Italic">FDIC, San Francisco, Cal. and NTEU</span>, 49 FLRA 1598, 1602 (1994) (overruled as to personnel office employees by <span class="Italic">VA Kansas City Med. Ctr. and AFGE</span>, 70 FLRA 465 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting) (limiting exemption to purely clerical or similar duties) (recon. den., <span class="Italic">VA Kansas City Med. Ctr. and AFGE</span>, 70 FLRA 960 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching that conclusion, we reject the Activity's contention that the RD failed to address whether Leider's inclusion in the bargaining unit would create a conflict of interest between his job duties and his unit membership. A conflict of interest between job duties and union affiliation may be created when an employee's duties would require the employee to act in a manner adverse to bargaining unit interests, such as recommending appropriate organizational structure and staffing levels, and is one of the factors which the Authority may look to in determining whether a position is involved in personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity. <span class="Italic">For example, Dept. of Army</span>, <span class="Italic">Headquarters, 101st Airborne Division, Fort Campbell</span>, <span class="Italic">Kentucky</span>, 36 FLRA 598, 602 (1990) (<span class="Italic">101st Airborne Division</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the RD found, and the Activity asserts, that while the majority of Leider's duties involve time and attendance record keeping, Leider prepares reports, tracks the use of official time by Union stewards, assists the Activity's labor relations staff in responding to information requests, and researches unit employees' leave usage at the request of supervisory officials. However, there is no evidence in the record that, in performing those duties, Leider is required to exercise independent judgment or discretion which might result in actions adverse to bargaining unit members, or which otherwise might have a direct impact on the work environment of the unit. Consequently, we have no basis on which to conclude that if he were included in the unit, a conflict of interest would be created. <span class="Italic">Compare 101st Airborne</span> Division, 36 FLRA at 603-04 (management analysts whose duties had a direct impact on the overall work environment of the bargaining unit, including the creation and elimination of unit jobs, were properly excluded from the bargaining unit).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Activity's claim that the RD's decision that the duties of the Administrative Assistant position were routine in nature departs from Authority precedent. We find that the RD correctly found, pursuant to applicable Authority precedent, that even though the incumbent serves as a resource person for time and attendance matters and other administrative subjects, and assists the labor relations staff, Leider performs his duties in a routine manner in accordance with established Activity guidelines and is not required to exercise independent judgment or discretion in carrying out those duties....</p>
<p class="noindent">Secretaries located in a recruitment and placement branch were neither <span id="Page_48"></span>confidential employees nor were they involved in personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity. They supplied employment information to individuals seeking the information and assisted applicants in filling out application forms; they were responsible for the distribution of mail and photocopying. As to their confidential status, their branch chief might be called on to provide information concerning formulation of regulations relating to placement and promotion policies, and he might attend meetings involving discussion of labor-management matters, but he was not an individual who formed or effectuated management policies in labor-management relations. There was no integral relationship between the secretaries and the branch chief when the supervisor performed duties in labor-management relations. Although the secretaries had access to grievance files and occasionally typed related correspondence, neither the access to nor the typing of occasional labor-management materials warranted exclusion of those employees on the basis of confidential status. As to their personnel duties, the work of the secretaries was purely clerical and routine. Employees who were computer aides, personnel clerks, and file clerks, whose work mainly involved entry into and retrieval of information from the computerized personnel records system, were involved in routine personnel work of a clerical nature and were neither confidential employees nor employees involved in excludable personnel work. Exclusion also was inappropriate for the secretary who provided primary clerical support for the Training and Development Branch. <span class="Italic">Hq., Ft. Sam Houston and AFGE Local 2154</span>, 5 FLRA 339, 340-44 (1981).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and AFSCME Council 26,</span> 63 FLRA 356, 360-61 (2009), affirmed unit exclusion of management analysts involved in staffing matters:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell,</span> the Authority found that certain management analysts performed personnel work in other than a clerical capacity, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3) of the Statute. 36 FLRA at 604-05. The Authority concluded that these analysts were properly excluded from a unit because they performed several functions "that involve personnel work or have a significant effect on personnel decisions.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 603 (emphasis added). The Authority described the functions as the study or analysis of "the appropriateness of the [agency's] organizational structure, staffing, method of operations and capital investments." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 604. The Authority explained that such functions affect personnel decisions and warrant the exclusion of employees because management relies on the judgment and ability of the analysts to determine the most efficient and effective method of performing the mission of the agency, which can have a direct impact on the elimination of jobs, the creation of positions, and the overall work environment of the bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Authority further concluded that these analysts were required to be excluded because the nature of this job would create a conflict of interest were they to be included in a bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In concluding that the primary function of Cook and Green is similar to the analysts excluded in <span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell,</span> the RD noted that their analyses considered the impact of new technology on staffing, both the number of staff and the duties of employees, particularly air traffic controllers. Consequently, he found that these employees are involved in work that affects the staffing of the Agency and the manner in which employees perform their duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record supports the RD's findings, which support the RD's conclusion. In particular, the testimony of Cook, Green, and their supervisor shows that, as in <span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell,</span> management relies on the work of Cook and Green to determine the most efficient and effective staffing and manner of performing work, and that their analysis and evaluation have a direct impact on the work environment. As an example, the RD acknowledged the supervisor's testimony that one study, involving both Cook and Green, evaluated the number of controllers needed and found that, as of 2014, "over a thousand" controller positions will not be needed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that <span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell</span> requires the performance of duties "that directly involve the Agency's internal personnel operations and decision-making. However, contrary to the Union's assertion, <span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell</span> expressly extends beyond internal personnel operations to work that can directly impact staffing and the overall work environment. <span class="Italic">See Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,</span> <span class="Italic">S.F.,</span> 49 FLRA 1598, 1602 (1994);<span class="Italic"> Ft. Campbell,</span> 36 FLRA at 604. In addition, in view of the testimony of the supervisor of Cook and Green as to their projects that affected staffing and the manner of performing work, the Union's reliance on the supervisor's testimony that their study of navigation and weather systems did not involve staffing fails to demonstrate that the RD misapplied <span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In concluding that Gill and Tarbell perform a function similar to the analysts excluded in <span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell,</span> the RD found that Gill and Tarbell evaluate organizational processes and noted examples of their evaluations that resulted in recommendations to make organizations more effective and efficient. In excluding Gill and Tarbell, the RD also noted that, at the hearing, the Union acknowledged "that Tarbell and Gill worked on teams that make recommendations which may affect staffing of bargaining unit positions." Consequently, he found that the entire purpose of their work is to determine ways to make organizations more efficient and noted that "fairly radical changes to work of employees have resulted from their efforts."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record supports the RD's findings, which support the RD's conclusion. As is the case with respect to Cook and Green, the testimony of Gill, Tarbell, and their supervisor shows that, similar to the excluded analysts in Ft. Campbell, Gill and Tarbell "us[e] their judgment to determine...how to make the operations more effective and efficient" and make recommendations to management. <span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell,</span> 36 FLRA at 604. As one example of the "fairly radical changes to work of employees" that resulted from their efforts, the RD acknowledged testimony of Gill about a study that resulted in the replacement of a nine-region structure with three service areas, which affected "1,100 people" who had to relocate or transfer to other positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that Gill and Tarbell perform work that is almost identical to the work of the analysts included in the bargaining unit in <span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell,</span> which the Authority described as primarily involving studies of budgetary and other computerized systems that do not directly involve individual personnel actions. 36 FLRA at 605. However, unlike the analysts included in <span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell,</span> the record as to Gill and Tarbell shows that, similar to the excluded analysts in <span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell,</span> Gill and Tarbell "us[e] their judgment to determine what is occurring and how to make the operations more effective and efficient" and make recommendations to management. <span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell,</span> 36 FLRA at 604. Consequently, the Union fails to demonstrate that Gill and Tarbell are like the analysts included in the unit in Ft. Campbell.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Union fails to demonstrate that the RD failed to apply established law in ordering the disputed positions excluded under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">A budget analyst was in the unit. The position, although requiring advice to agency leadership on the budget implications of various personnel decisions, did not require substantive involvement in those decisions, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs, Millington and IFPTE Local 259</span>, 69 FLRA 436, 437, 439 (2016):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that Cowart "is a subject-matter expert on budgets, including manpower funding allocations" and "[h]e uses independent judgment and discretion in performing certain non-personnel, budget[-]related duties." The RD also found that, although the budget analyst performs some personnel duties, he "does not recommend whether the Agency should increase or decrease staffing or what type of staffing the Agency needs to meet its mission." Rather, the RD found, the budget analyst "performs his personnel[-]work responsibilities in a routine or purely clerical nature." Considering the record, the RD determined that the budget analyst does not perform personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that the RD failed to apply established law because she "failed to address the conflict[-]of[-]interest testimony and evidence in her [d]ecision."[44] As noted above, for a position to be excluded under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3), it must be determined both that the character and extent of the personnel duties of the incumbent are more than clerical in nature; and that the personnel duties of the position in question are not performed in a routine manner or are of such a nature as to create a conflict of interest between the incumbent's union affiliation and job duties.[45]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[44]&#x2003;Application at 16 (citing <span class="Italic">Keyport</span>, 68 FLRA at 436; <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 63 FLRA at 360-61; <span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell</span>, 36 FLRA at 604).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[45]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3529</span>, 57 FLRA 633, 637 (2001) (<span class="Italic">AFGE</span>); <span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell</span>, 36 FLRA at 602-03.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the RD determined that Cowart performed "personnel[-] work responsibilities in a routine or purely clerical nature." The Agency does not demonstrate that, once the RD determined that the position's personnel duties were purely clerical, Authority case law required the RD to also perform a conflict-of-interest analysis. As such, the RD did not fail to apply established law by not addressing the Agency's argument that the budget analyst's duties create a conflict of interest.</p>
