<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-28"><span class="space">a.</span> Proposal, Decision to Take Action</h5>
<p class="noindent">Section 7116(d) barred litigation through arbitration of a suspension first challenged during the proposal stage with a ULP charge and then challenged under the grievance procedure after the decision was issued. <span class="Italic">Fed. Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 3690</span>, 18 FLRA 314, 315-16 (1985), found an election of the ULP process through a challenge to a proposal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted, the charge alleged that the Activity had violated section 7116(a)(1) and (2) by proposing the discipline of the grievant because the charges were false and constituted a reprisal against the grievant for union activities, and the grievance alleged that the decision to suspend the grievant was not warranted because it simply constituted harassment of the grievant for his union activities. Thus, the Authority finds that the issue raised both by the charge and the grievance was the same, and it is not disputed that such issue was earlier raised under the unfair labor practice procedures by the filing of the charge. Finally, the selection of the unfair labor practice procedures was in the discretion of the grievant as the aggrieved party. The charge was filed two days after the discipline of the grievant was proposed and was clearly on his behalf as the local union president, and the grievance was not filed by the grievant until the determination not to issue a complaint was apparently imminent. In such circumstances the Authority finds that the filing of the unfair labor practice charge constituted the grievant's election of the unfair labor practice procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Local 2724</span>, 20 FLRA 743, 743-45 (1985), provided similar analysis concerning a ULP charge challenging a proposal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the record before the Authority, this case arose as the result of the reassignment of the grievant. On November 7, 1983, management proposed the suspension and reassignment of the grievant for conduct unbecoming a border patrol officer. On December 19, 1983, the Union filed an unfair labor practice charge, as to which there was subsequently a refusal to issue a complaint, claiming in general that on November 7, 1983, the Agency unilaterally changed working conditions and requesting specifically as redress that the reassignment of the grievant be held in abeyance. On December 29, 1983, the grievant was advised that as a final decision on the proposed disciplinary action he was being permanently reassigned. Thereafter, pursuant to the terms of the parties' agreement, arbitration was directly invoked by the Union in behalf of the grievant challenging that decision. The Arbitrator stated the initial issue to be whether the grievance was precluded from consideration under the Statute by the unfair labor practice charge. In this respect the Arbitrator noted that although the charge was broadly framed, the charge was clearly drawn to reflect and specifically relate to the grievant's reassignment for misconduct and the date given by the Union as when the charge arose was the date of the proposed action against the grievant. Consequently, he ruled that the substance of the issue raised in the grievance was substantially the same as the issue raised by the earlier-filed unfair labor practice charge. The Arbitrator further found with reference to the "discretion of the aggrieved party" language of section 7116(d) of the Statute that although the charge was formally filed by the Union, the filing was by election of the grievant. Accordingly, as his award the Arbitrator dismissed the grievance as being precluded by the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its exception the Union essentially maintains that the grievance was not precluded by section 7116(d) and that therefore the award is contrary to the Statute. Specifically, the Union argues that no issues of the charge and the grievance were the same and that the grievant was not the aggrieved party as to the charge. The Authority finds that the Union has failed to establish that the award finding the grievance precluded is contrary to section 7116(d) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7116(d) effectively provides that when in the discretion of the aggrieved party, an issue has been raised under the unfair labor practice procedures, the issue subsequently may not be raised as a grievance. In <span class="Italic">Department of Defense Dependents Schools, Pacific Region and Overseas Education Association,</span> 17 FLRA No. 135 (1985), <span class="Italic">petition for review filed sub nom. Overseas Education Association, NEA v. FLRA,</span> No. 85-1420 (D.C. Cir. July 10, 1985), the Authority summarized the requirements for section 7116(d) grievance preclusion: (1) the issue which is the subject matter of the grievance is the same as the issue which is the subject matter of the unfair labor practice; (2) such issue was earlier raised under the unfair labor practice procedures; and (3) the selection of the unfair labor practice procedures was in the discretion of the aggrieved party. In terms of this case, as has been noted, the Arbitrator determined that all the elements of section 7116(d) had attached. With respect to the first element, the Arbitrator primarily concluded that while broadly framed, the charge was clearly drawn to specifically relate to the reassignment of the grievant for misconduct. Thus, he ruled that the issue which was the subject matter of the grievance was substantially the same issue which was the subject matter of the unfair labor practice charge, and the Authority finds that the Union in its exception fails to establish otherwise. <span class="Italic">See Headquarters, Space Division, Los Angeles Air Force Station, California and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2429,</span> 17 FLRA No. 131 (1985). The Union in its exception also disputes that the selection of the unfair labor practice procedures was in the discretion of the grievant as the aggrieved party. The Authority has held with respect to the use of "party" that this element of section 7116(d) attaches when the choice of particular procedures has been made by the aggrieved party regardless of who is formally the filing party. <span class="Italic">DoDDS, Pacific Region.</span> In this regard, as has been noted, the Arbitrator observed that the general allegations of the charge, in addition to being drawn to specifically relate to relief for the grievant, also provided the date of receipt by the grievant of the proposed action as the date the charge arose. For these reasons the Arbitrator essentially found that the grievant was the aggrieved party and that both the Union's filing of the charge and invoking of arbitration was in a representative capacity in behalf of the grievant. Because the charge was indisputably filed first, the Arbitrator ruled that in terms of section 7116(d), this constituted the choice and selection of the unfair labor practice procedures by the grievant, and the Authority finds that the Union's exception provides no basis for finding such determination to be contrary to the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Federal Bureau of Prisons and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3690,</span> 18 FLRA No. 40 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Army Fin. and Accounting Ctr., Indianapolis and AFGE Local 1411</span>, 38 FLRA 1345, 1351-53 (1991) (Member Talkin dissenting), concerned a ULP directed against a suspension proposal and a grievance challenging the resultant suspension. The union filed the ULP charge. The suspended employee, a union official, filed the grievance. The arbitrator allowed the grievance to proceed, despite the agency's contention that the grievance was barred by the earlier ULP. FLRA thought differently and set aside an award that favored the grievant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator found, and both the Union and Agency state, that one of the allegations in the ULP charge involved the proposed suspension of the grievant for allegedly using abusive language toward a supervisor. Therefore, it is undisputed that the ULP charge and the grievance arise out of the same incident leading to the proposed, and actual, suspension of the grievant....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Union's argument that section 7116(d) does not bar the grievance because the ULP charge was filed to protect an institutional interest. While portions of the ULP charge appear to address the Union's institutional interest, it is clear that the ULP charge was not filed solely in the Union's institutional interest. As noted above, the ULP charge specifically alleges discrimination against an employee as well as interference with and a violation of the "5 USC 7102 rights of an employee" and, thus, addresses in part the grievant's rights as an individual....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note the Union's statement that the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt</span> supports its assertion that "[a] [u]nion may suffer institutional harm." Although the Court noted that section 7116(d) "does not preclude a union in its institutional capacity as an aggrieved party from filing an unfair labor practice charge to enforce its own independent rights merely because an employee has initiated an appeal or grievance procedure[,]" <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 472 U.S. at 665 n.20, because we have found that the Union in this case did not file the ULP charge solely to enforce its own independent rights, the statement in <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt</span> does not apply.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Local 1411</span> was affirmed, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1411 v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 176, 177-80 (D.C. Cir. 1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1411 filed an unfair labor practice (ULP) charge to protest the proposed suspension of an employee allegedly for conduct occurring in the course of union business. After the suspension was imposed, the employee herself filed a grievance, pursuant to the "Negotiated Agreement" between the Union and her governmental employer, challenging her suspension. Upon the employer's exception to the arbitrator's decision sustaining the grievance, the Federal Labor Relations Authority held that the grievance was barred by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(d), which requires an aggrieved party to choose between grieving and filing an ULP charge. Against the joint petition of the Union and the employee, we uphold the Authority's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I. BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In December 1987 Helen Owens, a pay clerk at the Army Finance and Accounting Center, was accused by her supervisor of using "abusive and offensive" language in a brief workplace encounter between them. As a result, the Army notified Owens that it proposed to suspend her without pay for 10 days. In response, Local 1411--of which Owens was acting vice president--filed an ULP charge with the Authority, alleging in relevant part that the Army had violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), (2), and (4) by proposing to suspend Owens for conduct related to official union activities. In due <span id="page_1717"></span>course Owens was in fact suspended for 10 days. While on suspension, she filed her grievance, in which she denied the alleged verbal offense and maintained that her suspension was without just cause.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In April the Regional Director of the FLRA declined to issue a complaint based upon the ULP charge filed by the Union.&#x2003;He reasoned that because the issues involved in the ULP charge had been raised in a prior grievance--an apparently erroneous premise--5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(d) barred their being raised anew as an ULP. Section 7116(d) states in relevant part that "issues which can be raised under a grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved party, be raised under the grievance procedure <span class="Italic">or</span> as an unfair labor practice...but not under both procedures." (emphasis added). The Union appealed that decision to the General Counsel of the FLRA without success.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a parallel proceeding, Owens exhausted the contractual grievance procedure and submitted her grievance to arbitration. Rejecting the Army's argument that Owens' grievance was barred by &#x00A7; 7116(d), the arbitrator revoked her suspension for want of just cause and awarded her back pay and reasonable attorney's fees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Army filed exceptions to the arbitrator's decision and the Authority overturned the arbitration award. The Authority ruled that because an "ULP charge was filed on the same issue in the discretion of the same aggrieved party, the later-filed grievance [was] barred." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, Army Finance and Acc'ting Center, Indianapolis, Indiana and Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Local 1411</span> (<span class="Italic">Owens</span>), 38 FLRA 1345, 1355 (1991). The Union and Owens petition for review of that decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA treats a grievance as duplicative and therefore barred by &#x00A7; 7116(d) when: (1) the same issue is the subject of the grievance and of the ULP charge, (2) that issue was raised in a prior ULP charge, and (3) the decision to file the ULP charge was within the discretion of the aggrieved party....&#8197;The petitioners claim that the Authority was arbitrary and capricious in determining that the first two conditions were met because the ULP charge implicated different issues and different interests than did the grievance and, in any event, the Authority was bound by the General Counsel's determination that Owens' grievance was filed first. The petitioners also insist that the Authority's application of the third condition contradicts the plain language of &#x00A7; 7116(d). In their view, the Authority may not presume that an ULP charge was filed "in the discretion" of the aggrieved employee simply because the record contains, as the FLRA said in the decision under review, "no indication that the employee had attempted to preclude the union from filing [the ULP charge] on the employee's behalf."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">A. Same Issues and Interests</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The petitioners assert that the issues and interests raised by the ULP charge and the grievance in this case are not the same because the ULP charge challenged the propriety of a proposed suspension while the grievance challenged the propriety of a final suspension.&#x2003;A challenge to a proposed suspension, say the petitioners, "is aimed at preventing or mitigating a potential harm to an employee," while "a challenge to an actual suspension...is aimed at the validity of management's decision that the employee's conduct has indeed warranted the serving of a suspension."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Authority that this difference is irrelevant to the purpose of &#x00A7; 7116, which is to preclude duplicative proceedings by requiring an aggrieved party to make an election of remedies. Regardless of whether a challenge occurs prior to or after the suspension, there can be no doubt that the same facts and the same decision are involved. Thus, to allow Owens' later-filed grievance based upon a distinction between proposed and actual agency action would drain &#x00A7; 7116(d) of much of its utility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our holding on this point is fully consistent with our decision in <span class="Italic">Overseas Education Association v. FLRA</span> (<span class="Italic">OEA</span>), 824 F.2d 61 (D.C. Cir. 1987)....&#8197;In that case, we held that an ULP charge alleging that agency management discriminatorily proposed to eliminate a position held by a union official did not bar a later-filed grievance protesting the union official's notice of dismissal. <span class="Italic">OEA</span> does not depend upon the distinction proffered here between proposed and actual agency action. Instead, as we noted in that case, the ULP and the grievance were based upon different factual and legal predicates: "Whereas in late 1981 [when the ULP charge was filed] the agency was only eliminating a particular position at one high school in the vast [DOD school] system, by early 1982 [when the grievance was filed] the employee was facing the prospect of outright termination." 824 F.2d at 72. Thus the court evidently understood the ULP charge to address a mere transfer of the employee, while the grievance addressed dismissal. Moreover, the ULP charge in <span class="Italic">OEA</span> alleged a violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a), while the grievance claimed a breach of the collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. By contrast, the ULP charge and the grievance in this case rest upon the same factual predicate--namely, that Owens did nothing to warrant her suspension--and allege the same statutory and contractual violations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The petitioners also argue that the ULP charge and the grievance serve to protect different interests.&#x2003;Thus, the ULP charge was filed in order to "combat a feared 'chilling effect'" that Owens' suspension might have upon union participation, while the grievance was filed in order to protect Owens' individual interest. In support of their claim that this difference between the interests involved is relevant to the purpose of &#x00A7; 7116(d), the petitioners cite a footnote in <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 472 U.S. 648, 665 n.20, 105 S. Ct. 2882, 2892 n.20, 86 L. Ed.2d 515 (1985), where the Court states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[Section 7116(d)] does not preclude a union in its institutional capacity as an aggrieved party from filing an unfair labor practice charge to enforce its own independent rights merely because an employee has initiated an appeal or grievance...based on the same factual situation to enforce his individual rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The distinction drawn in <span class="Italic">Cornelius</span> is inapposite to this case. The ULP charge alleged harms both to the Union and to Owens. Thus, it does not trample the Union's interest to bar a later-filed grievance seeking to vindicate only Owens' individual interest. Because that interest was already advanced in the ULP charge, the Authority properly precluded Owens' grievance under &#x00A7; 7116(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Prior ULP Charge</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the second condition, the petitioners urge that the Authority is bound by the General Counsel's erroneous determination that the ULP charge was the subject of a prior-filed grievance. Although they acknowledge that the ULP charge was in fact filed first, the petitioners argue that the General Counsel's finding to the contrary should bind the Authority. Otherwise, they claim, Owens' interest will remain totally unprotected because the ULP charge will be barred by the General Counsel's finding that Owens had previously filed a grievance, while the grievance will be barred by the Authority's finding that the Union had previously filed the ULP charge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Authority is not bound by the General Counsel's erroneous reason for not prosecuting the ULP charge, but neither are the petitioners precluded from seeking reconsideration of the General Counsel's decision not to issue a complaint based upon that ULP charge. The statute assigns prosecutorial and adjudicative roles respectively to the General Counsel and to the Authority. The General Counsel investigates ULP charges, issues complaints where warranted, and prosecutes those complaints before the Authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7104(f)(2). The Authority, in turn, decides ULP cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7105(a)(2)(G).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon this statutory division of functions, we have held that the Authority has no power to review a prosecutorial decision of the General Counsel or to order him to issue an ULP complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Turgeon v. FLRA</span>, 677 F.2d 937, 939-40 (D.C. Cir. 1982) [discussed in Chapter 10 of the <span class="Italic">Guide</span>] Similarly, we think that the statutory division of functions would be frustrated if a factual determination that the General Counsel makes in deciding whether to issue a complaint could bind the Authority in a subsequent proceeding upon a grievance. The factfinder designated by the Congress must be allowed to make the ultimate determination of fact....&#8197;Thus, we see no barrier to our agreement with the Authority's determination--which all parties know to be correct--that the Union filed its ULP charge before Owens filed her grievance and not vice versa.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nonetheless, the petitioners are not entirely foreclosed by the General Counsel's error from pursuing a remedy for the ULP they charged. The Authority represents that the petitioners are not barred by time or otherwise from seeking and receiving reconsideration of the General Counsel's decision not to prosecute the ULP charge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we uphold the Authority's decision that Owens' grievance was barred by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(d). The petition for review is accordingly denied.</p>
