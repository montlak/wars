<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-90"><span class="space">8.</span> Representation by Agency That Probation Is Not Required; Equitable Estoppel</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Compton v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> CH-315H-10-0626-I-1 (NP 4/8/2011), determined that the Board does not acquire jurisdiction over an appeal if the individual has not completed probation under an appointment requiring probation even if the employee was told by agency personnel that probation would not be required:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's claim that the agency represented that she would not have to serve a probationary period and that she only learned about the probationary period when she reported for duty is also unpersuasive. It is well-established that the parties cannot confer Board jurisdiction by agreement where it is otherwise lacking. <span class="Italic">See White v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 574, &#x00B6; 10 (2010); <span class="Italic">LaBoube v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 337, &#x00B6; 6 (2007); <span class="Italic">see also Toomey v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 10, 13-14 (1996) (the Board cannot waive jurisdictional rules because the agency agreed to shorten the appellant's probationary period to 90 days); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 48, 52 (1990) (an agency's error cannot confer jurisdiction). In addition, an employee selected for a career conditional appointment in the competitive service from a register is required to serve a probationary period, and this requirement cannot be waived. <span class="Italic">See Phillips</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. at 52. Further, the Board has held that an agency's failure to provide accurate information about the requirement to serve a trial period at the time of appointment is no basis for finding that the trial period was waived or otherwise completed ahead of schedule. <span class="Italic">See LaBoube</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 337, &#x00B6; 8. Moreover, when an appellant working for one agency accepts a new appointment at a second agency, the second agency is not obliged to inform the appellant that accepting the new position may result in a loss of his adverse action rights. <span class="Italic">See Park v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 527, 534-35 (1998). As a consequence, the appellant could not have become an employee, and created Board jurisdiction, by agreement, and the Board has no jurisdiction over her appeal. <span class="Italic">See generally Carrow v. Merit Systems Protection Boar</span>d, 626 F.3d 1348, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (the appellant's claim that he accepted the new position (and lost his Board appeal rights) involuntarily was irrelevant given the Board lacked jurisdiction over his claim).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pacheco v. DOD</span>, AT-315H-13-0378-I-1 (NP 8/19/2014) ("The appellant reiterates the argument she made below that the agency should have been bound by language contained in the vacancy announcement for the Auditor position: '<span class="Italic">Probationary Period</span>: You will be required to serve an initial probationary period of 1 year if one has not already been completed.' We disagree. As the Board observed early in its existence, 'federal employment is not governed by contract principles.... Appointment, not contract law, is the central concept.' <span class="Italic">Bartel v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 14 M.S.P.R. 24, 35-36 (1982). Even if the language in the vacancy announcement could be viewed as an 'offer' that the appellant 'accepted,' the terms of her employment are governed by the documents effecting her appointment. As discussed above, those documents required the appellant to complete a 1-year probationary period."); <span class="Italic">cf. Benoit v. Dept. of Army</span>, DC-3443-21-0386-I-1 (NP 4/27/2022) (rejecting argument that NTE appointment was, based on agency documentation errors or representations, a permanent appointment: "None of the equitable considerations raised by the appellant relieve him of his burden of proof regarding jurisdiction. The appellant's argument that the agency's errors created a binding legal contract granting him a permanent position and entitling him to due process rights is not a basis for finding Board jurisdiction.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency informs the employee that she has a one year period of probation, the agency's statement does not confer Board jurisdiction if the employee in an excepted appointment lacks the two years of service required to obtain appeal rights (assuming the employee does not have veterans preference status), <span class="Italic">Morris v. DHUD</span>, DC-0752-10-0136-I-1 (NP 12/16/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the administrative judge, in dismissing for lack of jurisdiction this appeal of the appellant's termination from her Trial Attorney position in the excepted service, improperly assumed that she was a "two year probationary employee." The appellant contends that the job announcement for her position indicated that she would serve a 1-year probationary period, she was never given any information contradicting that aspect of the job announcement, and a "plethora" of federal agencies use 1-year excepted service trial periods. Further, the appellant claims that the agency violated its own policies and procedures, and that a decision issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit provides that probationary employees have a right to procedural due process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These arguments are without merit. The vacancy announcement for the Trial Attorney position does provide that "[i]f the individual selected for this position has not previously served as a supervisor or manager <span id="Page_134"></span>in the Federal Service, he/she will be required to serve a probationary period," that "[t]his period will not exceed 1 year," and that "[i]f the individual does not satisfactorily complete the probationary period, he/she will be reassigned to a position of no lower grade and pay than the position from which transferred, reassigned, or promoted." However, this information tracks the provisions of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 315.901-.909, which provide for a probationary period upon initial appointment to a supervisory or managerial position. There is no indication in the vacancy announcement that the Trial Attorney position occupied by the appellant was a supervisory or managerial position. Thus, this language in the vacancy announcement referring to a 1-year probationary period may have been an error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, even if the parties had intended for the appellant to have Board appeal rights after completing a 1-year probationary or trial period in the excepted service, and even assuming that other agencies use 1-year probationary or trial periods for attorneys in the excepted service, the parties may not confer jurisdiction on the Board where it otherwise does not exist. <span class="Italic">See Metzenbaum v. General Services Administration</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 104, &#x00B6; 9 (2004); <span class="Italic">see also Carrow v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 2010 WL 4909471 (Fed. Cir. Dec. 3. 2010) slip op. at 9-11 (an agency's failure to provide complete information about appeal rights regarding an appointment in the excepted service did not confer Board jurisdiction over an appellant who did not meet the definition of "employee" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)). As the administrative judge found, a non-preference eligible in the excepted service, like the appellant, meets the definition of "employee" and may appeal an adverse action to the Board if she is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service, or if she has completed two years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in other than a temporary appointment limited to two years or less. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C). The appellant did not assert, nor can she establish, that she was serving in an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i). Thus, even if we agreed with the appellant's contention that she had completed her probationary period, she still would not be considered an "employee" because she was not serving in an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See Forest v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 47 F.3d 409, 412 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (excepted service employees, such as the staff attorney in <span class="Italic">Forest</span>, do not have a right to appeal after they complete a probationary or trial period because such an interpretation of the statute would render superfluous 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii), which requires two years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions under other than a temporary appointment limited to two years or less).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant does not meet the definition of "employee" under section 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii); she has not completed two years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in other than a temporary appointment limited to two years or less. The agency appointed the appellant effective October 14, 2008, and terminated her effective October 9, 2009. At the time of her termination, she had less than one full year of service and she did not assert, nor can she establish, that she had the two years of current continuous service necessary to be considered an "employee" under section 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Williams-Hargraves v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 176, &#x00B6; 13 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant relies on <span class="Italic">Bartholomew v. United States</span>, 740 F.2d 526, 533 (7th Cir. 1984), in support of her claim that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal, the court in <span class="Italic">Bartholomew</span> held that the procedures used by the Postal Service in discharging a probationary employee were adequate, and that the Postal Service's technical violations of its internal regulations did not provide a basis for reinstatement. The court noted that "[t]his is not to say that probationary employees have no right to procedural due process whatever, for there may be egregious circumstances in which a probationer's discharge is effected in so unfair a fashion as to warrant some form of relief." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We find that this statement is dicta, that the court did not describe the type of egregious circumstances that would warrant due process rights, and that the Board is not bound by the decisions of the Seventh Circuit. <span class="Italic">See Fairall v. Veterans Administration</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 33, 39 (decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit are controlling authority for the Board; other circuit courts' decisions may be persuasive, but not controlling, authority), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 844 F.2d 775 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Thus, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant is not entitled to appeal to the Board under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bryant v. Dept. of Army</span>, 2022 MSPB 1, &#x00B6; 10 (2022), applied a two year probationary period (required by a then-controlling statute affecting DOD employees) when the employee was misinformed that probation would be but a year:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not present any argument concerning the effect of the aforementioned statutes.[3] Instead, she simply reasserts that she completed 1 year of current continuous service before her removal, and that 1 year was all that was required to satisfy her probationary period. In doing so, the appellant points to the vacancy announcement and the original SF-50 that followed her appointment, each of which reflected that the position required only a 1-year probationary period. Nevertheless, the statutes control the Board's jurisdiction in this case, not the agency's misstatements. <span class="Italic">See Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (recognizing that the Board's jurisdiction is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule, or regulation); <span class="Italic">Grigsby v. Department of Commerce</span>, 729 F.2d 772, 776 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (finding that an "SF-50 is not a legally operative document controlling on its face an employee's status and rights"); <span class="Italic">see also Barrand v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 210, &#x00B6; 13 (2009) (explaining that an agency's erroneous notification of appeal rights cannot expand the Board's limited jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">cf. Williams v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 892 F.3d 1156, 1162-63 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (recognizing that an agency's failure to advise an employee that he would lose his Board appeal rights if he voluntarily transferred to a different position did not create appeal rights). The controlling statutes clearly establish that the threshold for the appellant to become a permanent competitive-service employee with chapter 75 appeal rights was 2 years. Absent jurisdiction over the appellant's termination, we cannot review whether the agency denied her due process. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Department of Defense</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 228, &#x00B6; 13 (2007) (explaining that the Board has no jurisdiction to review constitutional claims that are not coupled with independently appealable actions). We therefore must vacate the initial decision and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The appellant also states no basis for invoking the Board's limited regulatory jurisdiction over probationary terminations, despite being informed of the same. See 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806 (providing for Board jurisdiction over claims that a competitive-service probationary appointee's termination was for certain prohibited reasons).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An incorrect assessment that the appellant was entitled to 5-point veterans preference did not control the nature of the appellant's appointment, <span class="Italic">Scott-Williams v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, DC-315H-21-0414-I-1 (NP 12/15/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues that she detrimentally relied on the agency's affirmative misconduct, when it incorrectly afforded her a 5-point veterans' preference in appointing her to the position of Program Analyst, and that the doctrine of equitable estoppel precludes the Government from terminating her appointment. The administrative judge correctly found that the appellant failed to establish either of her theories. More simply, however, the appellant's claims of equitable estoppel and detrimental reliance fail because they are principles of contract law. In general, however, Federal employment is not governed by contract law. <span class="Italic">Klamm v. Department of Defense</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 276, &#x00B6; 9 (2004) (citing <span class="Italic">Bartel v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 14 M.S.P.R. 24, 35-36 (1982), <span class="Italic">aff'd as modified</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 451 (1986)); <span class="Italic">see Walton v. Department of the Navy</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 244, 250 n.14 (1989) (stating that Federal employees derive the benefits and emoluments of their positions from appointment rather than from a contractual or quasi-contractual relationship with the Government); <span class="Italic">Bartel</span>, 14 M.S.P.R. at 35 (finding that appointment, not contract law, is the central concept in Federal employment); <span class="Italic">see also Karahalios v. National Federation of Federal Employees, Local</span> 1263, 489 U.S. 527, 535 (1989) (stating in the context of a Federal-sector labor dispute that "Federal employment does not rest on contract in the private sector sense"). Because the appellant has not explained how her contract law theories show that she met the statutory definition of an employee, they do not constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ellis-Smith v. DOD</span>, DC-315I-13-0266-I-1 (NP 7/10/2014), eschewed a theory of detrimental reliance to avoid completion of supervisory probation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has asserted, under penalty of perjury and without contradiction, that she was assured by two agency officials, Major Blackington and Mr. Youman, that she would not be required to serve a supervisory probationary period because she had already served as a supervisor. These assurances were given both prior to and after her appointment to the GS-14 position at issue in this appeal. The appellant has asserted under penalty of perjury that she would not have accepted the GS-14 position without these assurances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's unrebutted assertions constitute nonfrivolous allegations that she reasonably relied on assurances that she would not be required to complete a supervisory probationary period. The question is whether such detrimental reliance provides a basis for the conclusion that she was not required to complete a supervisory probationary period as required by law and regulation. The legal doctrine most obviously pertinent to detrimental reliance on misinformation is equitable estoppel. Application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel requires proof of two elements, "affirmative misconduct" by the agency and reasonable reliance on that conduct. <span class="Italic">Perez Peraza v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 457, &#x00B6; 9 (2010). The negligent provision of misinformation does not constitute affirmative misconduct. <span class="Italic">McDonald v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 236, &#x00B6; 12 (2010), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Cerilli v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 404, &#x00B6; 10 (2013).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_135"></span>The appellant has not alleged that Major Blackington and Mr. Youman intentionally misled her into believing that she would not be required to complete a supervisory probationary period. They apparently believed, as did the appellant, that she would not be required to serve a supervisory probationary period because of her previous service as a supervisor with the Department of the Army. As discussed above, that belief turned out to be incorrect, but the officials' incorrect assurances to the appellant do not meet the requirements for the application of equitable estoppel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has cited <span class="Italic">dicta</span> in Board and United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decisions that suggest that something less than the "affirmative misconduct" required for equitable estoppel should be sufficient for a detrimental reliance assertion. In <span class="Italic">Grigsby v. Department of Commerce</span>, 729 F.2d 772, 776 (Fed. Cir. 1984), the court stated: "While we hold that the SF-50 is not legally binding, we note that the Government may not be free in all circumstances to elude the effects of its own errors." In <span class="Italic">Ramos v. Department of Justice</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 623, &#x00B6; 12 (2003), the Board held that the appellant was bound by the terms of a Probationary Period Agreement that he had signed but noted that the appellant had not alleged that he misunderstood the language of the agreement, that he was coerced into agreeing to the probationary period, or that the agency misrepresented the terms of his appointment.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Ramos</span>, the Federal Circuit reversed the Board's decision on the ground that the Board erred in applying a waiver theory, instead of applying the court's decision in <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2002), under which Mr. Ramos had appeal rights as an "employee" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii). <span class="Italic">Ramos v. Department of Justice</span>, 240 F. App'x 409, 410 (Fed. Cir. 2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">dicta</span> in cases such as <span class="Italic">Grigsby</span> and <span class="Italic">Ramos</span> is not a sufficient basis for concluding that negligent misrepresentation provides a basis for not enforcing the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3321, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.904, and the agency's regulations, that mandated that the appellant complete a 1-year supervisory probationary period in her position as GS-14 Supervisory Contract Specialist.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Negligence does not alter the duration or existence of probationary appointments, <span class="Italic">Francis v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, AT-0752-13-7722-I-1 (NP 1/13/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also contends that the administrative judge erred in finding that the doctrine of equitable estoppel did not preclude the agency from relying on any probationary period longer than that identified in the appellant's appointment SF-50. Affirmative misconduct is a prerequisite for invoking equitable estoppel against the government. <span class="Italic">See Perez Peraza v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 457, &#x00B6; 9 (2010). In addition, to invoke equitable estoppel against the government, the party claiming estoppel must have reasonably relied on the other party's misrepresentation to his detriment; moreover, detrimental reliance requires evidence that the appellant's position changed for the worse or that she relinquished a valuable right. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">King v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 181, &#x00B6; 19 (2010). Thus, there are two elements that must be shown to prove a claim of equitable estoppel, affirmative misconduct and reasonable reliance on that misconduct. <span class="Italic">Perez Peraza</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 457, &#x00B6; 9. Of particular relevance here, negligently providing misinformation does not constitute affirmative misconduct. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6; 10. We find that this rule is sufficient to resolve this case.</p>

USDA</span>, DC-0752-15-1179-I-2 (NP 10/21/2022) ("It is undisputed that at the time the appellant resigned from her position on September 20, 2015, she had not completed 1 year of service in her position with the Department of Agriculture. As such, the apparent inconsistencies on the SF-50s do not affect our analysis in this appeal, or change the fact that the appellant's position was subject to a 1-year probationary period, which she had not completed at the time of her resignation. <span class="Italic">Hurston</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 34, &#x00B6; 2 n.*."); <span class="Italic">cf.
