<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-333"><span class="space">c.</span> Assignment Rights; Retreat</h5>
<p class="noindent">When an agency releases an employee from her competitive level through a RIF, an arbitrator properly considers and evaluates the grievant's experience to determine the grievant's assignment rights to other positions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Energy, Oak Ridge and OPEIU Local 268</span>, 55 FLRA 1293, 1296 (2000). Although an agency is not bound to use RIF procedures when a reassignment does not involve the displacement of another employee, the agency is not precluded from using RIF procedures. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, San Antonio Air Logistics Ctr., Kelly AFB and AFGE Local 1617</span>, 44 FLRA 1195, 1200 (1992). [Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-14-568.html#sec6-569">Reductions in Force</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">RIF assignment rights were described in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1547 and Dept. of Air Force, Luke AFB</span>, 65 FLRA 624, 626-28 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The right to retreat pursuant to RIF regulations.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">RIF regulations provide that an employee may retreat only to a position that is "held by another employee with lower retention standing in the same tenure group and subgroup" and is "the same position, or an essentially identical position" as one "formerly held by the released employee on a permanent basis as a competing employee in a Federal agency[.]" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.701(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Arbitrator should have placed Employee 1 in the Grade 9 explosives position requested in the grievance because he had "previously held" the position. However, the Arbitrator found that it was "undisputed" that Employee 1 had never held that grade and position in his civilian career, making him ineligible to retreat to the explosives position. The Union does not contend that the award is based on a nonfact in this regard and, as stated previously, the Authority defers to an arbitrator's factual findings when assessing whether the award is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See NFFE</span>, 53 FLRA at 1710. As the Arbitrator's factual findings support his legal conclusion that the Agency did not violate Employee 1's retreat rights under RIF regulations, we find that the award is not contrary to law in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the Union argues that the Arbitrator should have placed Employees 3 and 4 in the proposed positions because it was "undisputed" that the positions sought were "virtually the same" as the positions the grievants previously held. However, the Arbitrator found that the duties of one of the proposed positions were "substantially different" from those of the positions held by the grievants, and, thus, the jobs were not identical for purposes of retreat. Regarding the second proposed position, the Arbitrator found that neither grievant had retreat rights because neither employee had held an identical position. The Union does not contend that the award is based on a nonfact in this regard and, as stated previously, the Authority defers to an arbitrator's factual findings when assessing whether the award is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See NFFE</span>, 53 FLRA at 1710. As the Arbitrator's factual findings support his legal conclusion that the Agency did not violate the retreat rights of Employees 3 and 4 under RIF regulations, we find that the award is not contrary to law in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Union argues that the Arbitrator should have placed Employee 2 in one of the positions that he was seeking despite the fact that Employee 2 held a reserve-membership position prior to the RIF and the available, post-RIF positions were all non-reserve-membership positions. However, the Arbitrator found that Agency policy required treating reserve-membership positions as <span class="Italic">not </span>"identical or substantially identical" to non-reserve-membership positions for the purposes of RIF rights. Although the Union argues that this policy was not "presented as evidence[,]" the Arbitrator credited the "undisputed testimony" that the Agency could not treat these positions as identical for retreat right purpose. Further, the Union does not contend that the award is based on a nonfact in this regard and, as stated previously, the Authority defers to an arbitrator's factual findings when assessing whether the award is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See NFFE</span>, 53 FLRA at 1710. As the Arbitrator's factual findings support his legal conclusion that the Agency did not violate Employee 2's retreat rights under RIF regulations, we find that the award is not contrary to law in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also argues that the Arbitrator erred by failing to place the grievants in positions held by employees with lower SCDs.&#x2003;As discussed above, the RIF regulations provide that an employee may retreat only to a position held by an employee with "lower retention standing...<span class="Italic">and</span>...[a position that is] the same position, or an essentially identical position, [as a position] formerly held by the released employee...." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.701(c) (emphasis added). As previously discussed, the Arbitrator found that none of the grievants had previously held positions that were identical, or essentially identical, to the positions to which they sought to retreat. The Union does not contend that the award is based on a nonfact in this regard and, as stated previously, the Authority defers to an arbitrator's factual findings when assessing whether the award is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See NFFE</span>, 53 FLRA at 1710. As the Arbitrator's factual findings support his legal conclusion that the grievants were not eligible to retreat to the positions that they sought, the allegedly lower SCDs of the employees that the Agency placed in those positions do not establish that the award is contrary to RIF regulations. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.701(c). Accordingly, we find that the award is not contrary to law in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Union's arguments concerning retreat rights do not provide a basis for setting aside the award as contrary to law, and deny the contrary-to-law exceptions regarding retreat rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The right to bump pursuant to RIF regulations.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to bump to a position, an employee need not have previously held the position, but "[t]he employee must be qualified for the offered position." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.701(a). In order to be "qualified" for a position, <span class="Italic">id.</span>, the employee must have "the capacity, adaptability, and special skills needed to satisfactorily perform the duties of the position without undue interruption[,]" <span class="Italic">id. </span>&#x00A7; 351.702(a)(4). RIF regulations define "[u]ndue interruption" to mean "a degree of interruption that would prevent the completion of required work by the employee [ninety] days after the employee has been placed in a different position" pursuant to RIF regulations. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>&#x00A7; 351.203. In addition, RIF regulations provide that an employee may only bump to a position that is "held by another employee in a lower tenure group or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group[.]" <span class="Italic">Id. </span>&#x00A7; 351.701(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's finding that Employee 1 was ineligible to bump to the explosives position was based on the Arbitrator's findings that Employee 1's previous military, administrative, Grade 8 explosives experience did not "qualif[y]" him for the civilian, "hands-on[,]" Grade 9 explosives position that he was seeking. Although the Union disputes the Arbitrator's conclusion that Employee 1 was not qualified for the proposed position, the Union does not dispute any of the Arbitrator's underlying factual findings or contend that the award is based on a nonfact in this regard, and, as stated previously, the Authority defers to an arbitrator's factual findings when assessing whether the award is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See NFFE</span>, 53 FLRA at 1710. As the Arbitrator's factual findings support his legal conclusion that the Agency did not violate Employee 1's bump rights under RIF regulations, we find that the award is not contrary to law in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that the Union's claim that no one with a lower SCD should have been placed in the positions sought by Employees 2, 3, and 4 could be construed as arguing that the Agency violated the bump rights of <span id="page_2333"></span>those grievants, the Arbitrator found that none of the positions to which these grievants proposed to bump were held by employees in a lower subgroup. The Union does not argue that the award is based on a nonfact in this regard, and, as stated previously, the Authority defers to an arbitrator's factual findings when assessing whether the award is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See NFFE</span>, 53 FLRA at 1710. As discussed above, the absence of a potential bumpee in a lower tenure group or subgroup means that a mandatory precondition for bumping under RIF regulations was not met. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.701(b)(1). As the Arbitrator's factual findings support his legal conclusion that the Agency did not violate the bump rights of Employees 2, 3, and 4 under the RIF regulations, we find that the award is not contrary to law in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Union's arguments concerning bump rights do not provide a basis for setting aside the award as contrary to law, and deny the contrary-to-law exceptions regarding bump rights.</p>
<p class="noindent">RIF retreat rights are narrow and specific. An employee may retreat, under 5 CFR Part 351, subpart G (2022), only to the same position or to an essentially identical position previously held by the employee. The similarity requirement is met if the jobs are in the same competitive level, a requirement that cannot be met if the jobs are at different grades. Appointments from OPM registers are not promotions and therefore may not be used to determine an employee's retreat rights. An employee is not promoted through the entry-level position if the employee is appointed at a higher grade level. <span class="Italic">USDA, Fed. Grain Inspection Serv. and AFGE Local 3157</span>, 23 FLRA 141, 144-45 (1986) (reviewing arbitration award).

<p class="noindent">FLRA noted in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., Maritime Admin. and NAIL Local 6</span>, 61 FLRA 816, 820-22 (2006), that it reviews <span class="Italic">de novo </span>arbitrators' assessments of assignment rights:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In evaluating claims that an award is contrary to OPM's RIF regulations, the Authority examines and applies MSPB precedent concerning RIF matters. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Navajo Area Office</span>, 53 FLRA 984, 992 (1997) (citing <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Va</span>, 49 FLRA 588, 593-95 (1994) and <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, San Antonio Air Logistics Ctr., Kelly Air Force Base, Tex</span>., 44 FLRA 1195, 1200 (1992)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency disputes the Arbitrator's determination that employee C was wrongly assigned to the Small Craft Operator position because the Agency claims employee C was trainable, and thus qualified, for the position, pursuant to &#x00A7; 351.702. When an appellant disputes assignment rights, the burden is on the agency to prove that it properly followed RIF regulations in effecting the disputed assignment. <span class="Italic">See Randall Goldman v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, 2005 MSPB Lexis 2829 at 9 (May 12, 2005) (citations omitted). In determining whether an agency afforded an employee proper assignment rights, the Board conducts a <span class="Italic">de novo </span>review to determine whether the agency has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee had "the capacity, adaptability, and special skills needed to satisfactorily perform the duties of the position without undue interruption." <span class="Italic">McMillan v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 476, 488-89 (1999) (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.702(a)(4) and <span class="Italic">Chambers v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 337, 342 (1998) (<span class="Italic">McMillan</span>). Consistent with this precedent, the Authority also reviews an arbitrator's determination of an employee's qualifications for a position under the RIF regulations <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See Tidewater Virginia Fed. Employees Metal Trades Council</span>, 53 FLRA 1149, 1159-60 (1998) (award not contrary to &#x00A7; 351.701 where conclusion that grievant was unqualified for a position was supported by the record) (<span class="Italic">Tidewater</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency may assign an employee to an occupied position under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.701 if the employee: (1) meets the OPM's requirements for the position; (2) is physically qualified to perform the duties of the position; (3) meets any special qualifying conditions which the OPM has approved for the position; and (4) can satisfactorily perform the duties of the position without undue interruption. <span class="Italic">See </span>&#x00A7; 351.702(a)(4). The term "undue interruption" means, as relevant here, "a degree of interruption that would prevent the completion of required work by the employee 90 days after the employee has been placed in a different position under this part." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.203.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Relying on &#x00A7; 351.702(a)(1)-(4), the Arbitrator found that employee C was wrongly assigned to the Small Craft Operator position because he "had no desire to work as a small craft operator and was not qualified" for the position, and because he "had no experience working in that capacity. As the Agency correctly notes, the employee's lack of desire to work as a Small Craft Operator is not relevant to the Agency's assignment decision, as accommodating an employee's personal desire is not required by regulation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Grayheart v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 10 MSPB 822, 823 (1982) (holding that, in a RIF action, an employee has no right to a choice of positions).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, &#x00A7; 351.702(a)(4) requires employees to have the "capacity, adaptability, and special skills needed to satisfactorily perform the duties of the position without undue interruption." The Agency claims it has met this requirement because it is undisputed that employee C was trainable for the position.[7] The Arbitrator did not find that employee C was not "trainable" for the position of Small Craft Operator. However, as the Union points out, the Arbitrator found that employee C was "not qualified" for the position. The Agency disagrees with the Arbitrator's finding and, relying on <span class="Italic">Hayes</span>, asserts that it is entitled to deference with respect to its determination that employee C was qualified for the position. The Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Hayes </span>is misplaced,<span class="Italic"> </span>however, because an agency is entitled to deference only as to its "determination of the <span class="Italic">requirements</span> that an individual <span class="Italic">must satisfy</span> to qualify for a particular position[,]" not to its determination of whether an employee actually meets those requirements. 829 F.2d at 1100 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;The Agency cites &#x00A7; 351.703, which permits an agency to assign an employee to a vacant position in certain circumstances without regard to OPM's standards and requirements. However, as the Union points out, &#x00A7; 351.703 applies only to vacant positions, <span class="Italic">see Hoover v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 352, 357 (1998), and the position to which employee C was assigned was not vacant. Thus, the Arbitrator correctly relied on &#x00A7; 351.702, which applies to occupied positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As previously explained, the Authority is required to review an employee's qualifications under &#x00A7; 351.702(a)(4) <span class="Italic">de novo. See McMillan</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. at 488-89; <span class="Italic">Tidewater</span>, 53 FLRA at 1159-60. For the following reasons, we find that the record is insufficient to permit the Authority to conduct a <span class="Italic">de novo </span>review of the Arbitrator's finding that employee C was not qualified. In this regard, the Arbitrator did not explain why he considered employee C unqualified. That is, the Arbitrator made no finding as to whether employee C has the "capacity, adaptability, and special skills" needed for the Small Craft Operator position. The Arbitrator also did not explain what evidence he relied on in reaching this conclusion. Moreover, there is no evidence in the record, and no discussion in the award, about the qualifications requirements of the Small Craft Operator position or about employee C's qualifications. For example, the record does not contain a position description for the Small Craft Operator position or a evidence (such as a resume) showing employee C's education and training credentials. When reviewing an agency's determination of an employee's qualifications, the Board considers, among other things, position descriptions, duties actually performed in the position, and employee credentials, including resumes. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., McMillan</span>,<span class="Italic"> </span>84 M.S.P.R. at 489-93. Such information is not in the record here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Arbitrator failed to explain what evidence he relied on in finding that employee C was not qualified for the Small Craft Operator position, and because the Agency failed to include pertinent documentary evidence with its exceptions, the record is insufficient for the Authority to review the award <span class="Italic">de novo</span> with respect to this arbitral finding. Where an arbitrator has not made sufficient factual findings for the Authority to assess or determine an arbitrator's legal conclusions, and those findings cannot be derived from the record, the Authority will remand. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 701</span>, 55 FLRA 631, 635 (1999) (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent">Following remand, an arbitrator denied the union's request for relief as to a grievant, and FLRA provided a synopsis of assignment rights, <span class="Italic">NAIL Local 6 and Dept. of Transp., Maritime Admin</span>., 63 FLRA 232, 234-35 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the parties' stipulations establish that the Agency violated OPM's RIF regulations by placing employee C in the Operator position and that employee H is entitled to the position as a remedy. In evaluating claims that an award is contrary to OPM's RIF regulations, the Authority examines and applies MSPB precedent concerning RIF matters. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., DOT, </span>61 FLRA at 820; <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, San Antonio Air Logistics Ctr., Kelly Air Force Base, Tex</span>., 44 FLRA 1195, 1200 (1992)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under OPM's RIF regulations, and with exceptions and limitations not relevant here, an employee released from his or her competitive level is entitled to "bump" another competing employee from his or her position if the bumped employee is, among other criteria, in a lower tenure group or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.701(b)(1); <span class="Italic">Warren v. Dep't. of Def., </span>87 M.S.P.R. 426, 432 (2001) (<span class="Italic">Warren</span>). Additionally, individuals may displace competing employees in the same tenure group and subgroup by "retreating" into positions occupied by the competing employees if, among other criteria, the replaced employees have a lower retention standing. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R.<span class="Italic"> </span>&#x00A7; 351.701(c)(1); <span class="Italic">Warren, </span>87 M.S.P.R.<span class="Italic"> </span>at 433. An employee's retention standing is determined by examining the employee's tenure of employment, veteran preference, and length of service. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.501(a). In order to exercise bump or retreat rights, the occupied position must be no more than three grades below the position from which the employee seeking to exercise their assignment rights was released. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 351.701(b)(2) and (c)(2); <span class="Italic">Henderson v. Dep't of the Interior, </span>79 M.S.P.R. 230, 232 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd </span>202 F.3d 1356 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Henderson</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2334"></span>Based on the foregoing precedent, employee H was not entitled to employee C's Operator position regardless of whether the Agency improperly placed employee C in that position. In this regard, the Union has not disputed the Agency's arguments that employees K, R, and S's lengthier service dates gave them higher retention standings for purposes of retreat rights and, therefore, superior assignment rights than employee H. To the contrary, the Union's evidence establishes that, although employees H, K, R, and S were all in the same tenure group and subgroup, employee H had the shortest service date. <span class="Italic">See </span>Exceptions, Attach., Register (listing the service dates for employees K, R, and S); Employee H's Separation Notice at 1 (listing service date for employee H). Consequently, under OPM's RIF regulations, employees K, R, and S's higher retention standings gave them superior assignment rights to employee C's Operator position. <span class="Italic">See Pezdek v. Dep't of Def., </span>80 M.S.P.R. 554, 561, <span class="Italic">vacated as to other matters and remanded, </span>215 F.3d 1348 (Table), <span class="Italic">aff'd in relevant part and modified as to other matters, </span>84 M.S.P.R. 585 (1999) (<span class="Italic">Pezdek</span>) (agency properly placed employee, rather than appellant, in a position following a RIF because employee's higher retention standing gave him superior assignment rights).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also asserts that the Agency could have alternatively offered employee H a vacant Guard position.&#x2003;Under OPM's RIF regulations, an agency is not required to fill vacant positions during a RIF. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.201(b); <span class="Italic">Treese v. United States Postal Serv., </span>77 M.S.P.R. 187, 195 (1998) (<span class="Italic">Treese</span>). However, if an agency elects to fill a vacancy during a RIF, then it must apply OPM's RIF regulations. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 351.201(b), 351.704(a)(1); <span class="Italic">Treese, </span>77 M.S.P.R. at 195. OPM's RIF regulations specify that an offer of assignment to a vacant position must satisfy the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.701. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.704(a)(1). As such, the three-grade limitation for bump and retreat rights set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 351.701(b)(2) and (c)(2) applies to offers of assignment to vacant positions made as part of the RIF. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also </span>Reduction in Force Offers of Vacant Positions, 63 Fed. Reg. 26531 (May 13, 1998) (codified at 5 C.F.R. Part 351) (it is OPM's "longstanding policy" to apply the three-grade limitation for offers of assignments to vacant positions in a RIF).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Union's claim, the Agency could not have offered employee H a GS-4 Guard position; employee H was released from a WG-13 position and the GS-4 guard position he sought was nine grade levels below his position. Consequently, the Guard position was well below the three-grade limitation for bump and retreat rights set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 351.701(b)(2) and (c)(2). As such, the Arbitrator properly determined that the Agency could not have made employee H an offer of assignment to any Guard position. <span class="Italic">See Henderson, </span>79 M.S.P.R. at 232-33 (agency properly refused to allow employee to exercise retreat rights to a GS-5 position because it was more than three grades below the GS-11 position from which she was released).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Arbitrator properly determined that employee H's substantive entitlements were not adversely affected by the Agency's decision to place employee C in the Operator position and deny the Union's contrary to law exception. <span class="Italic">See Pezdek, </span>80 M.S.P.R. at 565 (appellant's substantive entitlements were not affected by agency's failure to construct the appropriate number of competitive levels where agency established other employees had superior assignment rights to positions appellant could have occupied).</p>
