<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-220"><span class="space">c.</span> Accommodation Requirement; Disability Discrimination</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cronin v. USPS</span>, 2022 MSPB 13, &#x00B6; 21 (2022), revised the Board's analysis of accommodation claims in appeals involving agency restoration efforts:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged that the agency's denial of restoration was based on prohibited disability discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, we suggested that a claim of unlawful discrimination or reprisal for protected activity could serve as an "alternative means" of showing that a denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious. 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 58 n.27; <span class="Italic">see Paszko v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 207, &#x00B6; 15 (2013). This holding was incorrect because, as explained above, a denial of restoration is arbitrary and capricious for purposes of section 353.304(c) only if an agency fails to meet its obligation under section 353.301(d). <span class="Italic">See Bledsoe</span>, 659 F.3d at 1103-04. Determining whether an agency met its obligation under section 353.301(d) will turn on whether it "ma[d]e every effort" to restore a partially recovered employee "in the local commuting area" and "according to the circumstances in each case." If the agency makes the required effort but fails to find suitable work for the appellant, the denial of restoration is not arbitrary and capricious, and the agency's lack of success cannot be attributed to any improper motive on its part. If, on the other hand, the agency fails to make the effort required under section 353.301(d), the resulting denial of restoration is necessarily arbitrary and <span id="Page_4484"></span>capricious, and no further analysis is required. While an agency's failure to comply with section 353.301(d) may well be the result of prohibited discrimination or reprisal for protected activity, whether that is so is immaterial to the question of whether denying restoration in a particular instance is arbitrary and capricious for purposes of section 353.304(c).[12]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;We do not decide at present whether and how the Board should address discrimination and reprisal claims in the event jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c) has been independently established. <span class="Italic">See Latham</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 58 n.27 (observing that the concept of an "affirmative defense" fits better in matters such as adverse action appeals when the agency bears the burden of proof on the merits).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Desjardin v. USPS</span>, 2023 MSPB 6, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-21, 27-29 (2023), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, provided guidance on how the Board adjudicates disability discrimination (failure to accommodate) claims associated with a restoration rights appeal of a partially recovered employee</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board in <span class="Italic">Cronin</span> declined to address how it should address claims of discrimination and retaliation in restoration appeals within its jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Cronin</span>, 2022 MSPB 13, &#x00B6; 21 n.12. In <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, the Board stated that, in restoration appeals, claims of discrimination and reprisal should be understood as "independent claims" rather than as "affirmative defenses." <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 58 n.27. The Board indicated that the concept of an "affirmative defense" fits better in matters such as adverse action appeals when the agency bears the burden of proof on the merits.[11] <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;The Board in <span class="Italic">Latham</span> also noted the possibility that discrimination and reprisal claims could serve as alternative ways for an appellant to show that the denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious. <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 58 n.27. However, as we explained previously, that aspect of <span class="Italic">Latham</span> is no longer good law under <span class="Italic">Cronin. Supra</span> &#x00B6; 16.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the Board's criticism in <span class="Italic">Latham</span> of the use of the term "affirmative defense" to describe the adjudication of discrimination and retaliation claims in restoration appeals, the Board has continued to adjudicate those claims in the same manner as it did before <span class="Italic">Latham</span>. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Davis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 122, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-18 (2013), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Cronin</span>, 2022 MSPB 13. We see no reason to alter that approach. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1), if an employee "has been affected by an action which [he] may appeal" to the Board and "alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited by" certain enumerated anti-discrimination statutes, the Board is required to "decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action in accordance with the Board's appellate procedures." Thus, once the appellant has established that the challenged action is within the Board's jurisdiction, the Board is required by statute to adjudicate both the action itself and any claim that the action was based on one of the enumerated categories of prohibited discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged disability discrimination under both reasonable accommodation and disparate treatment theories. The Board adjudicates claims of disability discrimination raised in connection with an otherwise appealable action under the substantive standards of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">Pridgen v. Office of Management and Budget</span>, 2022 MSPB 31, &#x00B6; 35. The Rehabilitation Act has incorporated the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended by the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Therefore, we apply those standards here to determine if there has been a Rehabilitation Act violation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In particular, the ADAAA provides that it is illegal for an employer to "discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of a disability." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a). The Board recently clarified that only an otherwise qualified individual with a disability is entitled to relief, whether the individual alleges disability discrimination based on a disparate treatment or reasonable accommodation theory. <span class="Italic">Haas v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 2022 MSPB 36, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 28-29.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A qualified individual with a disability is one who can "perform the essential functions of the...position that such individual holds or desires" with or without reasonable accommodation. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(8). Thus, an appellant can establish that he is a qualified individual with a disability by showing that he can, with or without accommodation, perform either the essential functions of his position of record or those of a vacant funded position to which he could be assigned. <span class="Italic">See Clemens v. Department of the Army</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 11 (2014).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not allege that he could perform the essential functions of his City Carrier position with or without accommodation, and the medical restrictions submitted by his doctor precluded "route walking...for the delivery of mail." We therefore find that the appellant did not establish that he was qualified based on his ability to perform the essential functions of the position he held. Thus, he would need to identify a vacant funded position to which he could have been reassigned in order to establish that he is a qualified individual with a disability. In addressing the appellant's reasonable accommodation claim, the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to meet his burden to show that there was any vacant position he could perform within his medical restrictions, even with a reasonable accommodation. We agree with the administrative judge's finding because the record does not show any existing vacant position to which the appellant could have been reassigned.[13] We therefore find that the appellant's disability discrimination claims under both disparate treatment and reasonable accommodation theories fail because he has not established that he is a qualified individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13]&#x2003;Our finding that the agency failed to conduct a proper search for available positions within the local commuting area, <span class="Italic">supra</span> &#x00B6; 18, does not relieve the appellant of his burden to establish the existence of a position to which he could have been reassigned in order to establish that he is a qualified individual with a disability. The agency argued before the administrative judge that the appellant had not identified a position he could perform within his medical restrictions. The appellant acknowledged that argument and indicated that he had requested information in discovery regarding the availability of positions he could perform.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Washington v. USPS</span>, CH-0752-14-0172-I-3 (NP 3/22/2023), applied <span class="Italic">Cronin</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Cronin</span>, the Board clarified that claims of prohibited discrimination or reprisal cannot serve as an "alternative means" of showing that a denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious. <span class="Italic">Cronin</span>, 2022 MSPB 13, &#x00B6; 21. The Board acknowledged that an agency's failure to comply with section 353.301(d) may well be the result of prohibited discrimination or reprisal for protected activity; however, whether that is so is immaterial to the question of whether a denial of restoration is arbitrary and capricious for purposes of section 353.304(c). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, we vacate the administrative judge's analysis of the appellant's claim of disability discrimination insofar as it is not material to the jurisdictional issue.[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;In the absence of an otherwise appealable action, the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider the appellant's allegation of disability discrimination as an independent claim. <span class="Italic">See Cronin</span>, 2022 MSPB 13, &#x00B6; 22; <span class="Italic">see also Wren v. Department of the Army</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 1, 2 (1980) (holding that prohibited personnel practices under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b) are not an independent source of Board jurisdiction), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 681 F.2d 867, 871-73 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Law predating Cronin considered disability accommodation in the context of agency restoration responsibilities. Restoration rights for partially recovered employees, along with agency placement obligations and disability accommodation requirements were described in <span class="Italic">Sapp v. USPS</span>, 73 MSPR 189, 192-95 (1997) (Member Amador dissented) (following remand, again remanding for factual determination as the scope of the local commuting area, <span class="Italic">Sapp v. USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 411 (1999)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Agencies must make very effort to restore, according to the circumstances in each case, an employee or former employee who has partially recovered from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304; <span class="Italic">Leach v. Department of Commerce</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 8, 15 (1994). A "partially recovered" individual is one who has recovered sufficiently to return to less physically demanding work. <span class="Italic">See Leach</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 15. As noted above, the appellant is a former employee who suffered a compensable injury, and it is also undisputed that she has "partially recovered" from that injury because her physician (Dr. Miller) has released her for return to less physically demanding duty. The agency thus was obligated to make every effort to restore the appellant under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304. The Board will review an agency's actions with respect to that provision only to determine whether it acted arbitrarily and capriciously. <span class="Italic">See Leach</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's obligation to make every effort to restore the appellant included a duty to search throughout the agency but within the local commuting area for vacant positions to which she could have been restored and to consider her for any such vacancies. <span class="Italic">See Leach</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 19; <span class="Italic">Farrell v. Department of Justice</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 504, 510-13 (1991), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Leach v. Department of Commerce</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 8 (1994). In denying her request for restoration, the agency stated that it had conducted a search for available positions within the Santa Ana District (where the appellant had once worked) but that it had found none that met her medical restrictions. The headquarters of the Santa Ana District is in Santa Ana, California. An agency official confirmed the scope of the search in his testimony at the hearing. The administrative judge found that the agency's job search throughout the Santa Ana District satisfied its obligation to search throughout the local commuting area but offered no explanation for this conclusion. On petition for review, the appellant challenges this finding on the proper geographic scope of the agency's job search. For the reasons stated below, we find that this challenge has merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Code of Federal Regulations defines "local commuting area" to mean the geographic area that usually constitutes one area for employment purposes; it includes any population center (or two or more neighboring ones) and the surrounding localities in which people live and can <span id="Page_4485"></span>reasonably be expected to travel back and forth daily to their usual employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.203.[1] The administrative judge made no specific findings regarding whether the Santa Ana District geographically encompasses the entire local commuting area or whether the local commuting area includes localities outside the Santa Ana District from which the appellant could have commuted to her former duty station. As noted above, he merely concluded without explanation that the Santa Ana District was an "appropriate" search area. The record also contains no specific information on this point.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Although this definition falls under section 351 rather than section 353, we find that it is also instructive in this context and use it here. The broad nature of this definition is also consistent with the approach of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; it has held that a "commuting area" is determined on a case-by-case basis. <span class="Italic">See Santos v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> EEOC No. 05940573, slip op. at 4 (Jan. 23, 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is therefore necessary to remand the case to the regional office so that the parties may fully develop the record regarding whether the agency searched throughout the agency but within the local commuting area for positions to which she could be restored and considered her for such vacancies. <span class="Italic">See Leach</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 19. If the administrative judge determines on remand that the scope of the agency's search was inadequate, he shall order the agency to conduct a broader search encompassing the entire local commuting area, and the agency would then consider whether or not it could restore the appellant to duty. <span class="Italic">See Farrell</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. at 513.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One finding that the administrative judge made in the initial decision, however, does warrant clarification. He apparently determined that the restoration issue and the question of whether the appellant's undisputed disability of carpal tunnel syndrome could be reasonably accommodated were, in fact, only one issue, and that he did not need to decide them separately. This determination is not entirely correct. An agency's obligation to accommodate an employee's disability is similar in nature and purpose to its obligation to restore her after a compensable injury. <span class="Italic">See Leach,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. at 20.<span class="Italic"></span> In making that statement in <span class="Italic">Leach,</span> however, the Board relied on a provision of the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) stating that the obligation to restore partially recovered individuals meant "[a]t a minimum...treating these employees substantially the same as other handicapped individuals under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973..."<span class="Italic">See id.</span> (citing FPM ch. 353, subch. 2-4(d)(1) (June 21, 1988)). The phrase "at a minimum" seems to imply that an agency's obligation to restore an employee might be broader than its duty under the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That implication is indeed borne out by one important difference between the scope of the two obligations which is relevant here. Relying on a decision by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Board has held that the scope of an agency's obligation to accommodate a disabled employee is limited to offering reassignment to a vacant position that is, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, located within the same commuting area and serviced by the same appointing authority. <span class="Italic">See Joe v. Department of the Army</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 408, 412 (1994); <span class="Italic">Hurst v. Department of the Navy</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 277, 282 (1994). That standard is codified in the EEOC's regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(g). In analyzing an agency's duty to restore a partially recovered employee, the Board has relied on the FPM provision already quoted above; that provision stated that "agencies must make very effort to place an injured employee who is able to work in some capacity <span class="Italic">in the local commuting area</span>." <span class="Italic">See Farrell</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. at 511-12 (citing FPM ch. 353, subch. 2-4(d)(1)) (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast to the EEOC standard on reasonable accommodation, however, the FPM provision on restoration does not limit the agency's obligation by stating that the position to which an employee might be reassigned must be in the local commuting area <span class="Italic">and</span> serviced by the same appointing authority. We therefore have no basis for imposing such a limitation on an agency's obligation to restore a partially recovered employee and decline to do so. The administrative judge should bear this distinction in mind if the need arises on remand to address the appellant's affirmative defense of disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In accordance with our discussion above, the case is remanded to the regional office for a determination regarding whether the scope of the agency's search for vacant positions to which the appellant could be reassigned was adequate. If it was, the administrative judge shall issue an initial decision setting forth that conclusion and incorporating his previous findings on the remaining issues raised by the appeal; if not, he shall issue an initial decision ordering the agency to conduct an adequate search within the local commuting area and to consider the appellant for restoration based on the results of that search.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Accommodative requirements for partially recovered employees seeking restoration were also described in <span class="Italic">Taylor v. DHS</span>, 107 MSPR 306, 308-09 &#x00B6; 7-8, 2007 MSPB 276 (2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has not objected to the administrative judge's finding that the appellant was partially recovered from her compensable injury and that she therefore had restoration rights under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). Moreover, we see no error in that finding. <span class="Italic">See Hicks v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. 137, 142 (1995) ("the Board has held that an individual's current receipt of partial disability compensation would generally suffice to establish that he is a partially recovered individual" under part 353), <span class="Italic">quoted in Gilbert v. Department of Justice,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 375, &#x00B6; 17 (2005). Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d), an agency "must make every effort to restore in the local commuting area, according to the circumstances in each case, an individual who has partially recovered from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty." That regulatory paragraph provides further that these efforts require, "[a]t a minimum, treating these employees substantially the same as other handicapped individuals under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Rehabilitation Act standards that are relevant here are the standards that are applied under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), as amended, and they are set forth in 29 C.F.R. part 1630. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(b). Under those regulations, the agency must make reasonable accommodation of an employee's disability through means such as modifying or adjusting the duties of the position at issue, or reassigning the employee to a vacant position whose duties the employee can perform. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(1)(ii), (o)(2)(ii). Although an employee has a right to be assigned to a position for which she qualifies at her current grade level or, if no such position is available, to a position at a lower level, the agency's obligation to offer reasonable accommodation of the employee's medical condition does not entitle the employee to a position at a higher grade level. <span class="Italic">See Narcum v. Department of the Interior,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 645, &#x00B6; 8 (2005) (an agency's obligation to accommodate an employee's disability includes the obligation to assign the employee to a vacant position in the same commuting area, at or below the employee's current grade level); <span class="Italic">Clopton v. Department of the Navy,</span> 36 M.S.P.R. 373, 379 (1988) (to afford reasonable accommodation, an agency is not required to promote a qualified disabled employee to a higher-level position).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gillins v. USPS</span>, CH-0353-14-0337-I-2 (NP 2/27/2023), decided before Cronin, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, stated the basics of a disability discrimination claim coupled with a restoration rights appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board adjudicates claims of disability discrimination raised in connection with an otherwise appealable action under the substantive standards of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. <span class="Italic">Pridgen v. Office of Management and Budget</span>, 2022 MSPB 31, &#x00B6; 35. The Rehabilitation Act has incorporated the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended by the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Therefore, the Board applies those standards here to determine if there has been a Rehabilitation Act violation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In particular, the ADA provides that it is illegal for an employer to "discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a). A qualified individual with a disability is one who can "perform the essential functions of the...position that such individual holds or desires" with or without reasonable accommodation. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(8). An employer is also required to provide reasonable accommodations to an otherwise qualified individual with a disability. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(b)(5). Therefore, an appellant may establish a disability discrimination claim based on failure to accommodate by showing that: (1) she is a disabled person; (2) she is a qualified individual with a disability; (3) the action appealed was based on her disability; and (4) to the extent possible, that there was a reasonable accommodation under which she believes she could perform the essential duties of her position or of a vacant position to which she could be reassigned. <span class="Italic">See Haas v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 2022 MSPB 36, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 28-29....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The obligation of an agency to accommodate, through adjustments in duties, a disabled employee seeking restoration was touched upon but not developed in <span class="Italic">Mallard v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 28 MSPR 27, 33 (1985), involving a remand from EEOC, canceling a removal and directing retroactive priority consideration rights under 5 CFR 353.306 [now 5 CFR 353.301] . In <span class="Italic">Ballesteros v. USPS</span>, 88 MSPR 428, 434 &#x00B6; 11 (2001), the condition leading to the accommodation request was not the cause of the compensable injury, and the Board considered that the condition was not relevant to whether the agency's offer of restoration to the partially recovered employee was so unreasonable as to be an effective denial of restoration. The Board declined to find that an agency discriminated on the basis of disability when a lifting requirement was not modified in <span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, DA-0353-12-0520-I-1 (NP 7/19/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant challenges the administrative judge's credibility determinations regarding his finding that the accommodation sought by the appellant with respect to the lifting requirements and her inability to push or pull All Purpose Containers was not reasonable. The appellant argues that she could have requested the assistance of her co-workers to perform these functions as a reasonable accommodation. The administrative judge, however, credited the testimony of the supervisor of the unit who stated that such accommodation would work a hardship on the other employees, and the resulting decrease in productivity would be too significant to be considered reasonable. Because the <span id="Page_4486"></span>initial decision reflects that the administrative judge considered the evidence as a whole, drew appropriate inferences, and made reasoned conclusions, we discern no reason to re-weigh the evidence or substitute the Board's own judgment on credibility issues. <span class="Italic">Crosby v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 98, 105-06 (1997) (the Board will give due deference to the credibility findings of the administrative judge and will not grant a petition for review based on a party's mere disagreement with those findings); <span class="Italic">see Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (the Board may overturn credibility determinations that are implicitly or explicitly based on demeanor only when it has "sufficiently sound" reasons for doing so). Therefore, the appellant has provided no basis to disturb the administrative judge's finding that she is not a qualified individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There was no accommodative denial in <span class="Italic">Manning v. USPS</span>, CH-0353-11-0509-B-1 (NP 4/11/2014). The appellant did not identify positions that properly were within the scope of accommodation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Many of the positions identified by the appellant, however, were either higher-level supervisory positions or non-bargaining unit positions and did not qualify as vacant funded positions of employment for the purposes of a reassignment as a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id.; see Taylor v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 306, &#x00B6; 8 (2007). The record, moreover, demonstrates that the agency's reasonable accommodation committee met with the appellant, and the appellant has not presented any evidence of a vacant funded position within her medical restrictions into which she could have been transferred. We find that the appellant's disability discrimination allegation provides no support for her establishing jurisdiction over her restoration appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An accommodation for a partially recovered employee was not required when the agency was not made aware of the appellant's limitations. <span class="Italic">See Butts-Boler v. USPS,</span> SF-0353-15-0371-I-1 (NP 3/22/2016) ("However, the appellant failed to show that any agency employee who had a responsibility for reassigning her to a new set of limited duties due to her compensable injury was aware of the emotional condition or that the emotional condition was recorded in agency documents, such that an agency employee reassigning the appellant should have been aware of the condition. We find that, under these circumstances, the appellant did not establish that the agency was obligated to consider her emotional condition in any limited-duty reassignments that it offered her.").
