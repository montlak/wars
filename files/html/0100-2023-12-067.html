<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-67"><span class="space">b.</span> Due Diligence</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">There are practical limitations on the reopening process. A factor considered in an appellant's reopening request is his attention to his appeal: the Board will reopen an appeal only if the appellant exercised due diligence in seeking reopening. <span class="Italic">Langford v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 73 MSPR 129, 136-37 (1997); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Riley v. Dept. of Army</span>, 91 MSPR 336, 340 &#x00B6; 9 (2002) (appellant must exercise due diligence in seeking reopening). "[T]he same factors are generally relevant to the determination on reopening as are considered in the determination of whether good cause exists." <span class="Italic">Brakas v. USPS</span>, 90 MSPR 332, 336 &#x00B6; 12 (2001). In <span class="Italic">Anthony v. OPM</span>, 70 MSPR 214, 218-19 (1996), the Board considered both the delay and probable mootness of the appellant's reopening request to be sufficient reasons to decline to reopen the case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Several years was too long a time to elapse for the Board to reopen the AJ's factual findings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lynch v. Bennett</span>, 665 F. Supp. 62 (D.D.C. 1987) [discussed in Chapter 12, "<a href="0100-2023-19-058.html#sec12-55"><span class="Italic">Prima Facie</span> Case; Accommodation Requirements</a>"]. <span class="Italic">Gratehouse v. United States</span>, 512 F.2d 1104, 1109 (Ct. Cl. 1975), added:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We have many times held that an agency has the inherent power to reconsider and change a decision if it does so within a reasonable period of time....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">What is a short and reasonable time period will vary with each case, but absent unusual circumstances, the time period would be measured in weeks, not years. A correction of an error within a reasonable time period will have retroactive effect, or, in other words, will preclude any cause of action based on the original error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where reasonable time for reconsideration has expired, there is no longer an opportunity to correct the procedural error retroactively....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A delay of two years, among other factors, led the Board to decline reopening, <span class="Italic">Jennings v. SSA</span>, 123 MSPR 577, 584-85 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-19, 2016 MSPB 31 (2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In deciding whether to reopen a closed appeal, the Board will balance the desirability of finality against the public interest in reaching the correct result. <span class="Italic">Carson v. Department of Energy</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 213, &#x00B6; 37 (2008), <span class="Italic">aff'd per curiam</span>, 357 Fed. Appx. 293 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Thus, the Board will exercise its discretion to reopen an appeal only in unusual or extraordinary circumstances, such as an intervening event that directly bears on the result or the discovery of misrepresentation or fraud after the issuance of the initial decision, and generally within a short period of time after the decision becomes final. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.118. Such a short period of time is usually measured in weeks, not years. <span class="Italic">Murray v. National Aeronautics &#x0026; Space Administration</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 680, &#x00B6; 5 n.1 (2009), <span class="Italic">aff'd per curiam</span>, 387 Fed. Appx. 955 (Fed. Cir. 2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Jennings I</span> became final on January 6, 2009. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.113(b) (providing that an initial decision becomes final when the Board issues its last decision denying a petition for review). As set forth above, the appellant filed this USERRA appeal on February 3, 2011. We find that the appellant's request to reopen <span class="Italic">Jennings I</span> is far beyond the short period of time during which the Board will consider reopening. In addition, the administrative law judge's decision in this case does not constitute unusual or extraordinary circumstances that warrant reopening <span class="Italic">Jennings I</span>. There has been no discovery of misrepresentation or fraud after the issuance of that initial decision. Moreover, the administrative law judge's findings regarding the appellant's retroactive placement on LWOP and the calculation of the appellant's debt to the agency, as well as any evidence supporting those determinations, have no bearing on the decision in <span class="Italic">Jennings I</span> that the agency proved its charges by preponderant evidence and that there was good cause to remove the appellant from his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also has held that reopening may be appropriate when there is a clear and material legal error generally confined to a conflict between the holding of the decision and a controlling precedent or statute, either because of an oversight or a change in the controlling law between the date of the original decision and any reopening request. <span class="Italic">Hayes v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that her delay must be excused or her appeal reopened because the settlement agreement was procured by fraud. The appellant further asserts that she did not learn of the agency's alleged fraud until the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) dismissed her appeal based upon the settlement agreement that terminated her Board appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is correct that the discovery of fraud that renders a settlement invalid can provide both good cause for the untimely filing of a petition for review and a basis for reopening an appeal. <span class="Italic">See Linares-Rosado v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant acknowledges that the EEOC issued its dismissal order on August 19, 2010, and that she received it on August 24, 2010. The appellant also states that she hired counsel to assist her with challenging the settlement on September 14, 2010. Yet she did not file her request to reopen (which the Board also construed as a petition for review) with the Board until December 1, 2010,--more than 3 months after she learned of the potential fraud and more than 2 1/2 months after she engaged counsel.

This lack of due diligence also forecloses the reopening of her appeal. <span class="Italic">See McCoy</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 256, &#x00B6; 11 (the appellant's 6-month delay demonstrates that he was not duly diligent and his request to reopen must be denied); <span class="Italic">cf.

<p class="Body-Text">If a party is to seek reopening for a legitimate reason, for example, because it failed to receive a copy of a Board order directing that it provide a submission and first learned of the Board's action when it received the Board's decision, the motion to reopen must be prompt, within a short and reasonable time period. <span class="Italic">Jordan v.

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Marshall v. GPO</span>, 43 MSPR 346, 349-51 (1990), the Board stressed the limits on its authority to reopen a case. The litigation involved a 1981 removal, a Board final decision in 1986 on the merits, and an early 1989 compliance decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is axiomatic that the Board may reopen or reconsider a case on its own motion to correct its own errors or to modify its judgment, decree, or order.[3] However, because the policy of achieving the right result competes with the policy favoring finality of decisions, the Board and the courts have consistently held that any reopening and reconsideration must be obtained within a short and reasonable time period....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We note that, in some circumstances, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management may petition the Board for reconsideration. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(c).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the definition of a "short and reasonable time" necessarily varies with the circumstances of each case, "absent unusual circumstances, the time period would be measured in weeks, not years."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties must be especially cognizant of the "reasonable time" rule, because once this period has passed, the parties lose their opportunity to correct previous errors and the decision stands as final....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In all the many proceedings before the Board during the long history of this case, the agency has never, until now, seriously challenged the validity of the Board's 1986 final order.... We find that the agency's most recent argument regarding the Rehabilitation Act's applicability to GPO's employees could have been argued during the pendency of Marshall's appeal on the merits.

<p class="Body-Text">An appeal from the denial of restoration rights to a member of the National Guard was decided adversely to the appellant in 1990. The decision was that the appellant was not within the Board's jurisdiction because he was not an employee of an agency of the executive branch. In 1991, in another National Guardsman's appeal, the Board reversed its position on the jurisdictional issue. In 1992, the appellant from the 1990 case sought reopening by the Board based on its 1991 change in position. <span class="Italic">Moriarty v. Rhode Island Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 56 MSPR 144, 147-50 (1992), denied the petition to reopen, concluding that the balance of public interest in correct adjudication and the interest in final adjudication weighed against the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has statutory and regulatory authority to reopen, on its own motion, appeals in which it has rendered a final decision, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1)(B); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.117, and it has exercised this authority when it has found it proper to do so<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Stephens</span>, 30 MSPR 680; <span class="Italic">Woodall v. FERC</span>, 28 MSPR 192, 194-95 (1985). Nonetheless, even where jurisdiction to reopen is present, "its exercise has uniformly been held to be discretionary, and required only in extraordinary circumstances." <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Sullivan</span>, 7 MSPR 357, 359 (1981). A determination of whether to reopen an appeal involves "balancing the desirability of finality and the public interest in reaching what ultimately appears to be the right result." <span class="Italic">Woodall</span>, 28 MSPR at 195.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Clear and material legal error" based on a change in the controlling law is accepted as a standard for granting reopening, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>, 7 MSPR at 360, but it is not the sole consideration to be taken into account in determining whether to reconsider a closed case. A significant limitation on an agency's power to reconsider is that such authority must be exercised within a reasonable period of time. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Dawson v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 712 F.2d 264, 267 (7th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Department of Transportation</span>, 46 MSPR 341, 348 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 949 F.2d 404 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table); <span class="Italic">Woodall</span>, 28 MSPR at 194. Indeed, in the first decision to hold that the Board's predecessor agency, the Civil Service Commission, had the authority to reconsider its decisions, the Court of Claims ruled that the administrative action reopening a case must be conducted within "a short and reasonable time." <span class="Italic">Bookman v. United States</span>, 453 F.2d 1263, 1265 (Ct. Cl. 1972). The determination of a reasonable period of time varies with the circumstances of the case, but the Board has held that absent unusual circumstances, the time is generally measured in weeks rather than years<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, 46 MSPR at 349.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1651"></span>In this case, the Board's final decision was issued on September 7, 1990 and the motion for reopening was not filed until March 9, 1992, after the passage of 18 months. Although the change in controlling precedent might otherwise provide a basis for reopening the appeal, we hold that the passage of that amount of time requires a finding that the interest in finality outweighs the interest in correcting the error in our earlier decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, the Board has exercised its authority to reopen certain cases. Those cases are distinguishable, however. Unlike <span class="Italic">Stephens</span>, 30 MSPR 680, which also involved a change in the controlling law, the Board reopened its decision on attorney fees, which did not require reopening the appeal on the merits<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Marshall v. Government Printing Office</span>, 43 MSPR 346, 351 (1990). And, unlike <span class="Italic">Woodall</span>, 28 MSPR 192, where the change in the law had occurred while the appeal was pending, the request to reopen the appeal was filed within a month of the issuance of the final decision that failed to take notice of it. 28 MSPR at 194 &#x0026; n.4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rather, we find the instant case to be more like the situation in <span class="Italic">Marshall</span>, 43 MSPR 346. There, subsequent to the issuance of a final decision reversing the agency's action for failure to comply with the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the circuit court sitting in the jurisdiction in which the appellant lived and worked, held that the agency was not subject to the Act. When it sought reconsideration from the Board of its decision, it was denied. The Board found that "considerations of finality dictate that this case not be reopened 3 years after the decision on the merits." 43 MSPR at 351. While 3 years is a longer period than is at issue here, in so holding, the Board relied, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, on <span class="Italic">Gubisch v. Brady</span>, Civil Action No. 88-2031, slip op. at 23, 49 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1063, 1989 WL 44083 (D.D.C. April 20, 1989). There, it noted, the court found that the decision of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to reopen an appeal 11 months after the agency's motion to reopen and 16 months after the decision had become final could not be sustained because the period at issue was unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its decision in <span class="Italic">Bookman</span>, 453 F.2d at 1265, the court held that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[t]he importance of the right of reconsideration is dependent upon the importance of the challenged decision. That is to say, the public's interest in a "right result" is consonant with the expanding application of the decision either in terms of the number of individuals directly or presently affected, or in future precedent value.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we find the public interest factor does not weigh heavily. First, we note that the Federal Circuit has characterized "the public interest in the effectiveness of the Civil Service Reform Act [of 1978]" as "comparatively remote." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McCall v. US Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 667 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Second, because the decision finding jurisdiction has been applied consistently since the issuance of the reconsidered <span class="Italic">Kostan</span> decision, the interest in a "right result" has been vindicated since that time. In this regard, we note that the appellant's request, although based on an assertion that he is a federal employee, is grounded in his reading of a state unemployment compensation decision and proceedings, which are not binding on the Board, rather than on <span class="Italic">Kostan</span>, which is not mentioned in his request. We note further that the appellant's main concern in pursuing this matter, being restored to his position, would not be accomplished directly by a decision to reopen his appeal, inasmuch as the new law addresses only a preliminary issue. The Board has never addressed the merits of his claim to restoration and expresses no opinion on it now. Finally, the <span class="Italic">Kostan</span> decision was issued less than two years after the interpretation in the <span class="Italic">Gordon</span> decision that it overturned, so that there is only a relatively limited universe of cases which it could have affected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons, we conclude that the relatively limited interest in reopening to reconsider the jurisdictional issue is outweighed by the interest in finality. Accordingly, the request to reopen is denied and the decision of the Board at 46 MSPR 38 remains final....</p>

After he lost his appeal, the appellant received a service-connected disability rating from the VA that could have altered his RIF retention standing had he received the rating prior to the RIF. The Board declined to reopen the case, then approximately two years old, because of the need for finality in the RIF process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may reopen or reconsider a case on its own motion to correct its own errors or to modify its judgment, decree, or order. <span class="Italic">See Payne v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 69 MSPR 503, 506 (1996). The Board's exercise of its authority to reopen an appeal has uniformly been held to be discretionary, and required only in unusual or extraordinary circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Anthony v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 70 MSPR 214, 219 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the DVA's award of a 50% service-connected disability rating changes his standing on the agency's retention register, i.e., his subgroup would change from A to AD (preference eligible employees who have a compensable service-connected disability of 30% or more) and, therefore, his tenure group would become I-AD. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.501. He argues that this change in his tenure group would have resulted in his retention by the agency at the time that the 1995 RIF was conducted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A determination of whether to reopen involves balancing the desirability of finality and the public interest in reaching what ultimately appears to be the right result<span class="Italic">. See Payne</span>, 69 MSPR at 506. Balancing the various interests at issue here, we find that reopening is not appropriate. First, as found by the Board, the agency properly separated the appellant at the time of the RIF. Secondly, the appellant filed his disability rating application with the DVA in May 1995, approximately five months before the RIF became effective. However, the disability claim was based upon the appellant's military service that occurred in 1969-1970. There is no indication in the evidence submitted as to why the appellant did not pursue the claim at some earlier point during the intervening 25 years. Thirdly, it would be exceedingly onerous to the agency to require it to reconstruct its 1995 RIF based upon the retroactive effective date of the appellant's disability rating that was imposed by the DVA. <span class="Italic">Cf. Stephens v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 33 MSPR 292, 296-99 (1987) (the Board decided to reopen several appeals and apply a new rule of law retroactively, in part, because the burden on the affected agency would not be great). Finally, if it resulted in the appellant's reemployment, the repercussions of such a reconstruction on other employees could be significant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 351.506, 5 CFR, which sets forth the criteria for the effective date of retention standings, does not require a contrary result. Section 351.506(c), 5 CFR, states, "When an agency discovers an error in the determination of an employee's retention standing, it shall correct the error and adjust any erroneous reduction-in-force action to accord with the employee's proper retention standing as of the effective date established by this section." However, nothing in our review of the regulatory history regarding section 351.506 convinces us that the appellant's RIF rights should be enhanced by events that occur subsequent to the RIF. Our interpretation of this provision is that the agency is required to correct any error it makes regarding an employee's retention standing at the time that such a determination is made or soon after. The agency did not make an error in the present case. It not only acted on the basis of the information it had, but such information was correct at the time. That the appellant's status was subsequently changed by another entity does not make the agency's action erroneous. <span class="Italic">See generally Menoken v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 784 F.2d 365, 368-69 (Fed. Cir.) (in determining retention rights of former employees, the Board necessarily has to look at situation as it actually existed in agency when RIF took place, not to situation that might or should have existed on such date; RIFs deal with actual and not theoretical or possible situations), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 479 U.S. 883, 107 S. Ct. 273, 93 L. Ed.2d 249 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, this case is not similar to those cases in which we have reopened an appeal based upon the reversal of an appellant's criminal conviction. <span class="Italic">See generally Czubinski v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Treasury,</span> 76 MSPR 552, 556 (1997); <span class="Italic">Payne</span>, 69 MSPR at 508. In those cases, the dispositive evidence, i.e., the reversal of the appellant's conviction, did not exist at an earlier date. Unlike the appellants' situations in <span class="Italic">Payne</span> and <span class="Italic">Czubinski</span>, the disabling condition of the appellant in the present case did not change after he was separated; rather, because of the delay in applying, the disabling condition was not acknowledged by the DVA until after the RIF.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, because of the appellant's failure to pursue his claim earlier and the onerous effect this very late reopening would place on the agency and other employees, we decline to reopen this appeal. While we acknowledge that a retroactive change in tenure could have significant consequences for the appellant, we find that the totality of the circumstances weighs on the side of finality.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board permitted reopening after four months passed from the decision that the appellant sought to reopen in <span class="Italic">Golden v. USPS</span>, 60 MSPR 268, 273 (1994) ("Under the unique circumstances of this case, then, we find that the public interest in reaching the right result outweighs the desirability of finality.").

<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, contrary to the appellant's contention, we find that OPM's reopening of its prior reconsideration decision was not untimely. The general rule is that administrative agencies have the power to reconsider decisions on their own initiative, as long as proper notice is given and the right is exercised within a reasonably short period of time. <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 46 MSPR 341, 348 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 949 F.2d 404 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table). The Board has found that, absent unusual circumstances, the time period concerned should be measured in weeks rather than in years. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 349; <span class="Italic">see also Marshall v. Government Printing Office</span>, 43 MSPR 346, 349 (1990). Also, the Board has held "that a determination of whether to reopen and reconsider a decision involves 'balancing the desirability of finality and the public interest in reaching what ultimately appears to be the right result.'" <span class="Italic">Marshall</span>, 43 MSPR at 348-49, quoting <span class="Italic">Woodall v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 28 MSPR 192, 195 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we found above, however, there was no final adjudicatory decision on the merits in this appeal, and OPM issued its new reconsideration decision on July 21, 1992, approximately 5 1/2 months after the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued its February 6, 1992 decision, affirming the Board's final decision that dismissed the intervenor's appeal of OPM's original reconsideration decision as untimely. <span class="Italic">Rogers v. OPM</span>, 956 F.2d 1172 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). In <span class="Italic">Woodall</span>, 28 MSPR at 194-97, the Board reopened and vacated its final decision in that appeal, issued approximately 3 1/2 months earlier, finding that the decision conflicted with Federal Circuit precedent and that the need for finality was outweighed by the public interest in reaching what ultimately appeared to be the right result. We find similarly here that the 5 1/2 month delay was reasonable under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A six-month delay in reopening was excused in <span class="Italic">Robinson v. VA</span>, 72 MSPR 444, 447-50 (1996), a decision that downplayed the significance of the amount of time between an erroneous decision and a Board determination to reopen the case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant's petition for review is untimely filed, we find that it is unnecessary to determine whether the appellant has shown good cause for the 6-month delay in filing his petition for review. Instead, we reopen this appeal <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1)(B)[1] and 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.118 to address the appellant's argument that the initial decision is in error because the administrative judge failed to apply controlling precedent, namely the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Mays v. Department of Transportation</span>, 27 F.3d 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Section 7701(e)(1)(B) states, in pertinent part, as follows: "[A]ny decision under subsection (b) of this section shall be final unless...the Board reopens and reconsiders a case on its own motion."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, the agency informed the employee on December 1, 1992 that it would effect her removal on December 4, 1992. The employee retired effective December 4, 1992. <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, 27 F.3d at 1578. When the employee attempted to appeal her removal, the Board dismissed her appeal for lack of jurisdiction, reasoning that, because she retired on the effective date of her removal, the removal was merely proposed and not effectuated. The Federal Circuit reversed. It found that the employee's removal was not merely "proposed" because the agency made a final decision on December 1, 1992 to remove her on December 4, 1992. <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, 27 F.3d at 1580. The court also found that 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(j) states that retirement status may not be taken into account in determining the appealability of a removal action; the statute makes no distinction as to when retirement status becomes effective. <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, 27 F.3d at 1580. The court thus determined that the Board had jurisdiction over the employee's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Mays</span> issued approximately 6 weeks before the administrative judge issued his initial decision and (assuming that the appellant retired rather than resigned) it is clearly applicable in this appeal. Decisions of the Federal Circuit are controlling authority on the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hoover v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 57 MSPR 545, 552 (1993). Therefore, the administrative judge committed clear and material legal error by failing to apply the controlling precedent of our reviewing court in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress explicitly granted the Board the full authority to reopen any decision on our own motion. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1)(B). This authority was implemented in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.118, which provides that: "The Board may reopen an appeal and reconsider a decision of a judge on its own motion at any time, regardless of any other provisions of this part." <span class="Italic">See also Stevenson v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 55 MSPR 625, 629 (1992); <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 46 MSPR 341, 348 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 949 F.2d 404 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table). Our reviewing court has stated that the Board has "broad discretion" in deciding which initial decisions to review <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>. <span class="Italic">Azarkhish v. OPM</span>, 915 F.2d 675, 679 (Fed. Cir. 1990). It has further stated that the policy goal behind 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.118 presumably is aimed at assuring consistency between and among initial decisions." <span class="Italic">Azarkhish</span>, 915 F.2d at 679. The Federal Circuit has also taken cognizance of the policy considerations defined by the United States Supreme Court:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Whenever a question concerning administrative...reconsideration arises, two opposing policies immediately demand recognition: [T]he desirability of finality, on the one hand, and the public interest in reaching what, ultimately, appears to be the right result on the other.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Azarkhish</span>, 915 F.2d at 679 (quoting <span class="Italic">Civil Aeronautics Board v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.</span>, 367 U.S. 316, 321, 81 S. Ct. 1611, 1616, 6 L. Ed.2d 869 (1961)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recognized and applied these principles. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Stevenson</span>, 55 MSPR at 629; <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, 46 MSPR at 349, <span class="Italic">citing Woodall v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 28 MSPR 192, 195 (1985). In <span class="Italic">Woodall</span>, the Board stated that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[R]eopening and reconsideration may be appropriate where there is clear and material legal error, and a conflict between the holding of the decision and a controlling precedent or statute, either because of oversight or a change in the controlling law between the date of the original decision and the reopening request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board then found reopening warranted after determining that its decision conflicted with a Federal Circuit decision issued a few weeks earlier. The Board concluded that the need for finality was outweighed by the public interest in reaching what appeared to be the right result. As in <span class="Italic">Woodall</span>, we find that reopening this appeal to address a clear legal error in the initial decision reaches the proper balance between the competing public interests of preserving the finality of Board decisions and achieving what appears to be the correct result in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that in <span class="Italic">Woodall</span>, the motion to reopen was filed only a few weeks after the Board's final decision had issued as compared to the six month period at issue here. The Board in <span class="Italic">Woodall</span>, however, did not expressly rely on the short time period. It focused instead upon the clarity of the legal error in view of the fact that controlling precedent changed before the Board's final decision issued. <span class="Italic">See Woodall</span>, 28 MSPR at 195-96. The difference between a few weeks and 6 months is not of such a magnitude as to warrant a different result here. In both cases, the controlling precedent changed before the issuance of a final decision by the Board.[2] The difference of a few months in receiving notice of the error that occurred as a result of the change in precedent does not, under these circumstances, justify turning a blind eye to a clear and material legal error.[3] Moreover, the six month period at issue here fits within the time period considered reasonable in other cases involving <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> reopening of appeals<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Payne v. USPS</span>, 69 MSPR 503, 506-07 (1996) (13 months); <span class="Italic">Welber v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 98, 100-01 (1994) (18 months).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cf. Tipsword v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 66 MSPR 53, 56-57 (1994) (where <span class="Italic">Mays</span> issued more than 8 months <span class="Italic">after</span> the initial decision, the Board found that any interest in correcting an error was outweighed by the interest in finality).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In other contexts, both administrative judges and the Board have, <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, refused to turn a blind eye to clear error that affected an appellant's rights. The Board has a line of cases dating from our very earliest decisions that stands for the proposition that an administrative judge may <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> address an error that implicates an employee's basic procedural rights when cognizance of the error is necessary to prevent manifest injustice. <span class="Italic">See Parker v. DLA</span>, 1 MSPB 489, 1 MSPR 505, 517 n.9 (1980); <span class="Italic">Chance v. Dept. of</span> <span class="Italic">Transp.</span>, 16 MSPR 583, 588 (1983). While these cases typically concern an administrative judge's authority to raise an affirmative defense <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, the pertinent legal principle is applicable here, where the issue is whether the Board should <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> address the administrative judge's clear error of law that prevented the appellant from showing that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">More importantly, in a recent Board decision, a unanimous Board reopened an appeal to address an issue of law that was not raised by the appellant in a timely petition for review and, indeed, was not raised <span class="Italic">at all</span> by either party. In <span class="Italic">Henry v.</span> <span class="Italic">USPS</span>, 69 MSPR 555 (1996), the administrative judge dismissed the appellant's appeal as untimely refiled without a showing of good cause and the Board denied the appellant's petition for review. However, although neither the administrative judge nor either party to the proceeding had considered the effect of the tolling provisions of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act, the Board reopened the appeal to do so. <span class="Italic">Henry</span>, 69 MSPR at 558-59. The Board found that "orderly rules of procedure do not require sacrifice of the rules of fundamental justice." <span class="Italic">Henry</span>, 69 MSPR at 558 (<span class="Italic">citing Ricard v. Birch</span>, 529 F.2d 214, 216 (4th Cir. 1975)), and found the appeal was timely refiled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, reopening and reconsideration of the instant appeal is warranted under the principles governing the Board's authority to reopen decisions on its own motion. Furthermore, it is axiomatic that the power granted by Congress to the Board to reopen its final decisions entails the obligation to exercise that power to correct clear legal error <span id="Page_1653"></span>when, as here, all the conditions for the proper exercise of power have been met.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 46, 50 (1998) (in considering whether to reopen, the Board "will not turn a blind eye to a clear and material legal error"; six weeks passed between the issuance of the Board decision and the filing that brought the apparently erroneous holding to the Board's attention). Unless there are unusual circumstances, a year's delay would be too long to seek reopening. <span class="Italic">Romero v. OPM</span>, 66 MSPR 109, 111 (1995); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Felders v. USPS</span>, 89 MSPR 216, 218 &#x00B6; 10 (2001) (without unusual circumstances, four years is too long to reopen). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Humme v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 109 MSPR 678, 683 &#x00B6; 12, 2008 MSPB 205 (2008) ("We recognize that the initial decision became final approximately 3 years before the appellant requested reopening. However, we note that the appellant appears to have acted promptly in requesting reopening upon learning of the retroactive termination of the demonstration project."); <span class="Italic">Rivera v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 94 MSPR 216, 222 &#x00B6; 14 (2003) (similar to <span class="Italic">Tarrant</span>: a delay of about two years was permitted in a reopening proceeding involving intervening statutory revisions in the Board's jurisdiction over appeals from employees of the FAA).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Despite the timeliness issues and results involved in reopening petitions just discussed, the Board determined that extraordinary circumstances warranted a rather protracted reopening process, in <span class="Italic">Welber v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 98, 101-03 (1994), involving a two- or three-year period between a reopening petition and the several related decisions subject to the petition:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701(e) and 1204(a), the decisions of the Board in this appeal are final. Nonetheless, the Board may reopen even final decisions under certain circumstances, pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(e) and 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.117. A determination on whether to reopen a case is discretionary, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Sullivan</span>, 7 MSPB 239, 7 MSPR 357, 359 (1981), and involves "balancing the desirability of finality and the public interest in reaching what ultimately appears to be the right result," <span class="Italic">Woodall v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 28 MSPR 192, 195 (1985). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Department of Transportation</span>, 46 MSPR 341, 348-49 (1990). A case may be reopened "in the interests of justice," <span class="Italic">Parkinson v. US Postal Service</span>, 58 MSPR 393, 397 (1993), particularly where the evidence is of such weight as to warrant a different outcome, <span class="Italic">see Carey v. USPS</span>, 50 MSPR 359, 361 (1991); <span class="Italic">Sansom v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 7 MSPB 661, 8 MSPR 185, 188 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is a substantial limitation on an agency's authority to reopen an appeal, however. That is, such authority must be exercised within a reasonable period of time. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Dawson v. MSPB</span>, 712 F.2d 264, 267 (7th Cir. 1983). Because the time period is generally "measured in weeks, not years," <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, 46 MSPR at 349, the Board has rejected requests for reopening that have been filed beyond that time frame, even where there has been an intervening change in the controlling law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Moriarty v. Rhode Island Air National Guard</span>, 56 MSPR 144 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The instant case clearly involves a delay of more than just weeks. We find it to be distinguishable, though, from other cases in which reopening has been denied or found to be erroneous on that basis. Unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">Moriarty</span>, where the Board had addressed only preliminary issues and not the appellant's entitlement to the restoration he requested, here the appellant has been found entitled to priority consideration for restoration, and the agency's petition for review challenging that finding was filed well beyond the regulatory deadline, without a showing of good cause for the delay. This case is also unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">Lynch v. Bennett</span>, 665 F. Supp. 62 (D.D.C. 1987), where the court found that the Board's decision to reopen was not only made after the expiration of a reasonable period but was also beyond its limited scope of authority under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702 to act on a case already reviewed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. And, unlike <span class="Italic">Gubisch v. Brady</span>, Civil Action No. 88-2031, slip op. at 23, 49 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1063, 1989 WL 44083 (D.D.C. April 20, 1989), in which the EEOC was taken to task for its decision to reopen merely to reconsider the same facts and law, here there has been a material change in the controlling facts of the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, in this case, the Board previously reopened the appeal on its own motion because of an OWCP decision that materially affected the appellant's right to restoration, the same change that has recently occurred again. <span class="Italic">See Welber</span>, 50 MSPR at 561. There is no question that the change in OWCP's position is the dispositive evidence of the appellant's entitlement to compensation. <span class="Italic">See Hicks v. USPS</span>, 19 MSPR 18 (1984) (OWCP decision vacating earlier rejection of the appellant's claim for compensation constituted new and material evidence warranting reversal of initial decision); <span class="Italic">Elias v. VA</span>, 7 MSPB 1, 7 MSPR 66 (1981) (inadvertent omission from record considered by Board of OWCP decision accepting the appellant's claim for compensation constitutes basis for reopening and reversing earlier decision).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the centrality of the evidence presented by the appellant to the issue of his appeal, we also find it significant that the evidence was not in existence, and therefore not available at an earlier date, through no fault of his. Not only had the appellant diligently pursued a change in the OWCP position, but he submitted it to the Board within eight days of its issuance. <span class="Italic">See Lopez v. Dept. of</span> <span class="Italic">Justice</span>, 55 MSPR 644, 646 (1992) (petition for review filed more than five years late showed good cause for its untimeliness where it was based on evidence not available to the appellant until days before he submitted it to Board; that evidence, reversal of an element of the appellant's past record on which the agency relied in imposing adverse action, required mitigation of the penalty). Nor was the matter ever completely closed, because although the Board had issued final decisions, both parties were aware of the continued pendency of the appellant's claim with OWCP for reversal of the order denying him benefits. One purpose of that claim, of course, was to provide the appellant with a basis for being restored to duty. Finally in this regard, we note that during the compliance proceedings before the Board, the agency asserted that it had complied with the June 8, 1990 initial decision, and submitted documentation in support of its position. Thus, there is no apparent prejudice to the agency and renewed compliance proceedings should not be unduly burdensome to it. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stephens v. OPM</span>, 33 MSPR 292, 296-99 (1987) (Board decided to reopen appeals and apply a new rule of law retroactively, in part because burden on affected agency would not be great).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Holloway v. VA</span>, 65 MSPR 363, 366 (1994) (although a new OWCP decision affected the appellant's restoration rights, he did not request the reopening in the short period following the issuance of the OWCP decision); <span class="Italic">King v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 90 MSPR 341, 346 &#x00B6; 8 (2001) (the Board did not reopen a prior case that was settled when, years after the issuance of the decision, the OWCP issued a decision granting benefits for at least part of period charged as AWOL; there was no allegation of fraud as to the settlement; remanding the case for evaluation of claimed restoration rights).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Recognizing the usual requirement that a reopening petition be filed quickly, there are a few decisions, discussed earlier and in the sections that follow, that permit reopening, despite a considerable passage of time, under extraordinary circumstances.</p>
