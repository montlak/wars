<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-271"><span class="space">k.</span> Statutory Pay Systems; Statutory Pay Premiums; Bonuses</h5>
<p class="noindent">An arbitration award was overturned for misconstruction of the prevailing rate statute as it defined lead agency authority to set wages. 5 USC 5341-5349. <span class="Italic">Army, Watervliet Arsenal and NAGE, Local R2-98</span>, 10 FLRA 670, 672 (1982). But an award was sustained awarding back pay under the Prevailing Rate Act to employees whose pay was lowered through a faulty local wage survey. <span class="Italic">DOD, AAFES and AFGE</span>, 45 FLRA 674, 685-90 (1992), determined that FLRA was not reviewing a reduction in pay case (a contrary result would have divested FLRA of review jurisdiction), and that the award, based on the Prevailing Rate Act, did not impermissibly infringe the doctrine of sovereign immunity:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Agency fails to establish that the award of backpay by the Arbitrator is deficient.&#x2003;We find a waiver of sovereign immunity based on the Prevailing Rate Systems Act of 1972 (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5341-5349) and AR 60-21/AFR 147-15.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The stipulated issue in this case was whether the commission rate paid to the grievants had been adjusted in accordance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. The Arbitrator ruled that the adjustment was not in accordance with the requirements of the Prevailing Rate Systems Act and FPM Supplement 532-2, Appendix V. Because the claim of the grievance resolved by the Arbitrator's award is based on the Prevailing Rate Systems Act, we find that sovereign immunity has been waived. We conclude that the grievance and the award are founded on an Act of Congress, providing a substantive right to money damages enforceable against the United States, within the meaning of section 1346(a)(2) and section 1491 and that, therefore, the Claims Court would have jurisdiction over the type of claim asserted in the grievance and a U.S. district court would have concurrent jurisdiction over such a claim to the extent that individual claims did not exceed $10,000. <span class="Italic">Best v. U.S.</span>, 10 Cl. Ct. 213 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Best</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Best</span>, the plaintiffs were Federal employees in positions covered by the Prevailing Rate Systems Act. They filed an action claiming that they had been deprived of the compensation to which they were entitled under the Prevailing Rate Systems Act and that the Act conferred on them a substantive right to money damages enforceable against the United States. The Claims Court confirmed that it and U.S. district courts have subject matter jurisdiction over such claims based on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5341-5343. 10 Cl. Ct. at 215-16.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because claims under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5341-5343 are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Federal courts, we reject the Agency's contention that the Arbitrator's award is precluded by sovereign immunity. In rejecting the contention, we acknowledge that after <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span>, 909 F.2d 1452 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">Carter</span>), which limits access to Federal courts for matters covered by the negotiated grievance procedure, a court likely would have dismissed a lawsuit asserting the claims of the grievance in this case. However, we find no basis on which to sustain the claim of sovereign immunity simply because the exclusivity of the negotiated grievance procedure precludes access to Federal courts by unit employees. In dismissing claims pursuant to <span class="Italic">Carter</span> that otherwise would have been within the court's jurisdiction, the Claims Court has given no indication that resort to the forum recognized as the exclusive and mandated means of resolving the disputed matter would be futile because of sovereign immunity.... Certainly, with respect to the negotiated grievance procedure, there is no exclusion by Congress of the Agency or its employees or the type of claims of the grievants from the coverage of the Statute. It is clear that under section 7103 of the Statute, both the Agency and its employees are covered by the Statute, and the claims of the grievants are grievable and arbitrable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In rejecting the Agency's claim of sovereign immunity, we also disagree with the Agency's position that although it may be governed by the administrative adoption of the Back Pay Act in AR 60-21/AFR 147-15, that regulation has no effect on the remedies that may be granted by an arbitrator. We are guided by the approach of the Comptroller General to judging the propriety of arbitration awards of backpay. In expanding the authority of arbitrators to award backpay, the Comptroller General ruled that in cases involving the payment of money by an agency, "a binding arbitration award must be given the same weight as any other exercise of administrative discretion, i.e., the authority to implement the award should be refused only if the agency head's own decision to take the same action would be disallowed...." <span class="Italic">For example</span>, 54 Comp. Gen. 312, 316 (1974). As the Agency concedes, it has since 1973 exercised its discretion to remedy unjustified or unwarranted personnel actions with awards of backpay to affected employees. Consequently, we refuse to deny that same authority to arbitrators who are empowered to resolve grievances under the Statute....</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We first note that the Authority has long held that the SAA is an amendment to the PRSA, and that both provisions read together govern the wages at issue here.[34] The Union claims that this Authority precedent is incorrect and asserts that the SAA did not amend the PRSA but "is merely identified as a supplemental note" and therefore should be considered separate from the PRSA--excluding [bargaining-unit] employees from the PRSA's normal rate-setting provisions. We disagree.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Union's argument, it is the effect of the SAA, rather than its form, that controls its application.[36] "[A]ny change of the scope or effect of an existing statute, by addition, omission, or substitution of provisions, which does not wholly terminate its existence, whether by an act purporting to amend, repeal, revise, or <span class="Italic">supplement</span>...is treated as amendatory."[37] Amendatory acts are construed as part of the existing statute, so that the provisions of the existing statute and its amendment "are given effect and reconciled."[38] Thus, despite its identification as a supplementary note to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5343 and despite its exclusionary language, the SAA did not "terminate" or supersede the PRSA, but merely modified the provision to explain that certain U.S. Army Corps of Engineers employees' wages shall also be consistent with the wages of DOE and DOI employees performing similar work.39 Consequently, the provisions must be read together so that the terms of each provision are reconciled. On this basis, we affirm Authority precedent and find that the SAA amends the PRSA, so that their provisions must be read together.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Given our precedent, we find that the Union fails to show that the Arbitrator erred in finding that the PRSA, as amended by the SAA, governs the wages at issue here, and that any adjustment to those wages therefore constitutes a "statutory[-]pay adjustment" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 147(b)(2)(A) of the Pay Freeze Act. We also find that the Union's contention that the Agency's supplement to the now-defunct OPM Federal Personnel Manual evidences that wage adjustments under the PRSA do not apply to the bargaining-unit employees, provides no basis upon which to conclude that the Arbitrator's award is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2213"></span>As an alternative argument, the Union claims that the Pay Freeze Act does not apply because the bargaining-unit employees' pay adjustments under the SAA do not equate to "similar adjustment[s]" under &#x00A7; 147(b)(2)(B) of the Pay Freeze Act. However, as we find that the Arbitrator's conclusion pertaining to statutory-pay adjustments under &#x00A7; 147(b)(2)(A) of the Pay Freeze Act is not contrary to law, we find that there is no need to address the Union's alternative argument concerning &#x00A7; 147(b)(2)(B), which challenges a separate and independent ground for the Arbitrator's award.</p>

<p class="noindent">An award was set aside that directed payment of premium pay for work performed on Sundays and holidays when the work performed consisted of union representation functions.

<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The grievant is not entitled to premium pay for the performance of representational duties on the Columbus Day holiday in 2000</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award requires the Agency to pay premium pay to the grievant for the representational activity that he performed on the Columbus Day holiday in 2000.&#x2003;With respect to holiday premium pay, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5546(b) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[a]n employee who performs work on a holiday...is entitled to pay at the rate of his basic pay, plus premium pay....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question presented by the Agency's exception is whether the grievant's performance of union representational activities on the Columbus Day holiday is compensable for purposes of premium pay. The answer to this question is determined by examining whether, when the grievant performs union representational activities, the grievant "performs work" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 5546(b), for which the grievant is entitled to be compensated with premium pay. For the following reasons, we conclude that the grievant did not "perform work on a holiday" for which he must be compensated at the holiday rate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 5546(b) does not address whether the performance of representational activities constitutes the performance of work within the meaning of that provision. However, the Authority has specifically addressed in two different contexts the relationship between the work of an agency and an employee's performance of representational activities under &#x00A7; 7131(d) of the Statute. In both contexts, the Authority determined that the performance of representational activities does not constitute the "work" of the agency within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In considering the meaning of the technology of performing work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), the Authority has held that the performance of representational activities under &#x00A7; 7131(d) does not involve the performance of the work of an agency. <span class="Italic">See AFGE Council 214, AFL-CIO, </span>31 FLRA 1259 (1988). The Authority has similarly held that the performance of representational activities does not involve "work" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Def., Army and Air Force Exchange Serv., Dallas, Tex., </span>53 FLRA 20 (1997). We find no reason to construe the term "performs work on a holiday" under &#x00A7; 5546(b) any differently. Accordingly, we find that just as the performance of representational activities does not constitute the "work" of an agency within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, the performance of representational activities does not constitute the performance of "work on a holiday" under &#x00A7; 5546(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, Union representational activities are not considered "work" in other contexts. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU v. Gregg, </span>No. 83-546 (D.D.C. Sept. 28, 1983) (negotiations on behalf of a federal union do not constitute work that can be compensated because it cannot be considered primarily for the benefit of the agency); 60 Fed. Reg. 43,935, 43,937 (1995) (in revising part 430 (Performance Management) of title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations, OPM rejected a suggestion that union officials be granted presumptive ratings of fully successful; OPM concluded that it would be inappropriate to include the performance of representational activities in an appraisal of employee job performance because the appraisal of an employee must be based solely on the performance of work, duties, and responsibilities that accomplish the agency mission and for which the employee is accountable to the employing agency).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, the grievant's performance of representational activities on the Columbus Day holiday cannot be considered "perform[ing] work on a holiday" and cannot be considered compensable for purposes of premium pay. Accordingly, the remedy of compensation of premium pay is deficient as contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5546(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The performance of representational activities on Sundays and holidays is not compensable for purposes of premium pay</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the national grievance alleged that the Agency violates the collective bargaining agreement whenever it denies use of official time for union representational activities because the requested day is a Sunday or a holiday. As a remedy, the Union requested that the Arbitrator declare that the Agency's denial of official time on Sundays and holidays violates the parties' collective bargaining agreement. The Arbitrator sustained the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the national grievance did not seek a particular monetary remedy and the award does not expressly order one, it is clear from both parties' submissions that the parties construe the award as mandating the payment of premium pay for employees who perform only representational duties on Sundays and holidays. In this respect, the Arbitrator's statement that "a binding past practice was established...in connection with the payment of the appropriate premium pay for performance of representational duties on Sunday[s] and holidays[ ]" is consistent with a conclusion that his award directed a remedy of premium pay for performance of representational duties on Sundays and holidays. We agree that the award effectively requires the payment of premium pay for employees who perform only representational duties on Sundays and holidays, and that the exceptions challenge this award. As so construed, we find that the award is deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons stated above, the performance of representational activities on a holiday cannot be considered "perform[ing] work on a holiday" and cannot be considered compensable for purposes of premium pay under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5546(b). Thus, with respect to the national grievance, the award of premium pay for the performance of representational activities on a holiday is similarly deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The same analysis and conclusion apply with respect to the performance of representational activities on Sundays.&#x2003;Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5546(a), an employee who "performs work" on a Sunday during a regularly scheduled 8-hour period of service which is not overtime work as defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542(a) is entitled to premium pay. However, the performance of representational activities on a Sunday cannot be considered the performance of "work" and cannot be considered compensable for purposes of premium pay under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5546(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, this conclusion is further supported by the Agency's appropriations acts. As asserted by the Agency and not disputed by the Union, the Agency's appropriations acts since 1995 have included the following provision:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Provided further, that none of the funds in this Act shall be available for paying premium pay under 5 U.S.C. [&#x00A7;] 5546(a) to any [Agency] employee unless such employee <span class="Italic">actually performed work</span> during the time corresponding to such premium pay[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Washington, D.C.</span>, 54 FLRA 584, 585 (1998) (emphasis added). This wording "provides that no funds be used to pay Sunday premium pay to an employee unless the employee actually performs work on Sunday" and "does not by its terms allow any exception to its coverage." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 589.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the performance of representational activities on Sundays is not compensable for purposes of premium pay under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5546(a). As such, the award of premium pay for the performance of representational activities on a Sunday is deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the Arbitrator found a binding past practice in connection with the payment of premium pay for the performance of representational activities on Sundays and holidays. However, the Authority has consistently held that there can be no binding practice that requires the performance of an unlawful or illegal act. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, Customs Serv., New Orleans, La., </span>38 FLRA 163, 174 (1990). Because the payment of premium pay for the performance of representational activities on Sundays and holidays is contrary to law, the Arbitrator's reliance on a past practice cannot support a conclusion requiring the payment of premium pay in these circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA considered customs inspectors' pay for holiday work and overtime under 19 USC 267, the Act of February 13, 1911 (or, so-called "1911 pay") in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv., New Orleans and NTEU Chap. 168</span>, 38 FLRA 163, 171-72 (1990), sustaining an arbitrator's award of that premium pay after consideration of the legislative history of the premium and case law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 143 and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 56 FLRA 304, 308-09 (2000) <span id="page_2214"></span>(considering award pertaining to claimed 1911 overtime pay under 19 USC 267 (1988) and 19 CFR 24.16 (1992-93)).

<p class="noindent-1">The statutory basis for Sunday premium pay for ATCSs is 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5546(a). Section 5546(a) states that an employee who performs work during part of a regular shift on a Sunday is entitled to receive Sunday premium pay for the entire shift. Employees using credit/comp time are not performing work and, based solely on the language of section 5546(a), are not entitled to receive Sunday premium pay when they use credit/comp time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Armitage [v. United States</span>, 23 Cl. Ct. 483 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd in</span> <span class="Italic">part</span>, 991 F.2d 746 (Fed. Cir. 1993)], the court ruled that employees on paid leave on a regularly scheduled Sunday shift are entitled to receive the regular and customary pay, that is, the Sunday premium pay, they would have received had they worked on that Sunday shift. <span class="Italic">Armitage</span> dealt only with annual and sick leave usage; the court was not presented with the issue of other approved paid absences, including the use of credit/comp time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that there is no authority for payment of Sunday premium pay in the circumstances of this case.&#x2003;As set forth above, neither section 5546(a) nor <span class="Italic">Armitage</span> authorizes Sunday premium pay for use of credit/comp time.[6] Therefore, the Arbitrator's award is inconsistent with section 5546(a) and is deficient as contrary to law under section 7122(a) of the Statute. Accordingly, we will set aside the award....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;We note that the Agency's determination not to pay Sunday premium pay to employees using credit/comp time apparently was not based on the absence of statutory authority to do so, but rather, as the Arbitrator found, on FPM Letter 550-79. In FPM Letter 550-79, OPM provided guidance to agencies on implementing <span class="Italic">Armitage</span>, and specifically directed agencies not to pay Sunday premium pay when the employee does not take paid leave on a Sunday because the employee takes compensatory time off, or uses credit hours under a flexible work schedule. <span class="Italic">See</span> note 4 <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Although FPM Letter 550-79 has expired, it applies in this case. <span class="Italic">See Landgraf v. USI Film Products</span>, __U.S.__, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 1501-05 (1994) (the Court stated that where the application of a new law would "impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed[,]" the traditional presumption against retroactivity operates to deny such retroactive effect in the absence of clear Congressional intent to the contrary). Not applying the FPM Letter in this case would impair rights the Agency possessed when it denied the requested Sunday premium pay. There is no indication in the FPM Sunset Document that OPM intended such retroactive result by its action abolishing the Letter. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Little Rock, Arkansas</span>, 51 FLRA 216, 224-25 (1995).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the Arbitrator's award is contrary to law because &#x00A7; 7454(b)(3) is ambiguous and the Arbitrator should have deferred to the Agency's interpretation of that provision. Under <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, the decision-maker first must determine whether Congress has spoken directly to the question at issue. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Nat'l Park Serv., Pictured Rocks Nat'l Lakeshore, Munising, Mich., </span>61 FLRA 404, 407 (2005) (<span class="Italic">NPS</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">Chevron, </span>467 U.S. at 842-43). If the intent of Congress is clear, then that is the end of the matter. However, if Congress has not spoken directly to the question, an agency that is charged with interpreting the statutory provision at issue receives considerable deference in interpreting the provision. Specifically, the decision-maker must defer to the agency's interpretation if it is "based on a 'permissible construction of the statute.'" <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(quoting <span class="Italic">Chevron, </span>467 U.S. at 843).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In &#x00A7; 7454(b)(3), Congress has spoken directly to the question of what employees are covered. In this connection, &#x00A7; 7454(b)(3) provides: "Employees appointed under section 7408 of [Title 38] shall be entitled to additional pay on the same basis as provided for nurses in section 7453(c) of [Title 38]." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7454(b)(3). Thus, under the plain wording of this provision, if an employee is "appointed under" &#x00A7; 7408, then that employee "shall be entitled" to Saturday premium pay "on the same basis as provided for nurses in" &#x00A7; 7453(c). <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, both the plain wording of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7408 and 7454(b)(3) and its context among other provisions of Title 38 demonstrate that &#x00A7; 7408 is an appointment authority. As an initial matter, various provisions of Title 38 allow the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs (Secretary) to appoint certain types of employees without regard to various civil-service laws, rules, and regulations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7401 (allowing certain "[a]ppointments"); &#x00A7; 7403 (stating that some appointments are "without regard to civil-service requirements"; &#x00A7; 7405 (permitting certain employment "without regard to civil service or classification laws, rules, or regulations"). Section 7408(a) states that "[t]here shall be appointed by the Secretary under civil service laws, rules, and regulations, [certain] additional employees"--i.e., employees in addition to those that are appointed under other provisions of Title 38. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7408(a). The wording stating that the Secretary shall appoint employees "under civil service laws, rules, and regulations[ ]" distinguishes the employees appointed under &#x00A7; 7408 from the employees appointed under the preceding sections--i.e., those employees who are appointed <span class="Italic">without </span>regard to civil-service laws, rules, and regulations. Put simply, &#x00A7; 7408 provides the Secretary authority to appoint employees who are not appointed under other provisions of title 38, but makes clear that civil-service laws, rules, and regulations apply to those employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, &#x00A7; 7408(b) provides that "[t]he Secretary...may <span class="Italic">appoint</span>" certain individuals "to a position...at a rate of pay above the minimum rate of the appropriate grade." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7408(b) (emphasis added). This too plainly establishes that &#x00A7; 7408 grants the Secretary appointment authority, not only pay authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, any ambiguity that exists in &#x00A7; 7408 is eliminated by &#x00A7; 7454(b)(3). In this connection, &#x00A7; 7454(b)(3) expressly refers to employees "appointed under section 7408[,]" which further reinforces both that &#x00A7; 7408 is an appointment authority and that, in drafting &#x00A7; 7454(b)(3), Congress viewed &#x00A7; 7408 as such. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7454(b)(3). Any conclusion that &#x00A7; 7408 is not an appointment authority (including the dissent's) would nullify this wording in &#x00A7; 7454(b)(3), "contrary to the 'fundamental principle of statutory construction that effect must be given, if possible, to every word, clause, and sentence of a statute...so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void, or insignificant." <span class="Italic">U.S. Gov't Printing Office, Wash., D.C.</span>, 57 FLRA 299, 302 (2001) (quoting <span class="Italic">Indianapolis Power &#x0026; Light Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n</span>, 687 F.2d 1098, 1101 (7th Cir. 1982)) (internal quotations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts, and the dissent agrees, that &#x00A7; 7408(a) and (b) apply to significantly different groups of people. However, even assuming that this is the case, it would not render &#x00A7; 7454(b)(3) ambiguous; it would mean only that different groups of employees are covered under &#x00A7; 7454(b)(3). In this regard, &#x00A7; 7454(b)(3) discusses appointment under &#x00A7; 7408 generally--not under either specific subsection of &#x00A7; 7408. Thus, &#x00A7; 7454(b)(3) would apply to both groups (assuming that they are, in fact, different groups).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, &#x00A7; 7454(b)(3) is unambiguous: It applies to all employees appointed under &#x00A7; 7408. As Congress has spoken directly to the issue of the employees to which &#x00A7; 7454(b)(3) applies, we find it unnecessary to reach the second <span class="Italic">Chevron </span>inquiry, i.e., whether the Agency's interpretation is based on a permissible interpretation of &#x00A7; 7454(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that, in arguing that FWS employees are excluded from coverage of &#x00A7; 7454(b)(3), the Agency asserts that: (1) related compensation-enhancement statutes exclude FWS employees; and (2) the SVAC does not have subject matter jurisdiction to enact legislation concerning FWS employees. We reject both of these assertions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2215"></span>With regard to the first assertion, a comparison of &#x00A7; 7454(b)(3) to the compensation-enhancement statutes cited by the Agency supports a conclusion that &#x00A7; 7454(b)(3) does not exclude FWS employees. In this connection, unlike 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5371(c) and 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7455(a)(2)(B)(ii), which limit compensation enhancement to General Schedule (GS) positions that provide direct patient-care services or services incident to direct patient-care services, &#x00A7; 7454(b)(3) contains no such limiting language; in fact, it does not even mention GS employees. The presence of express language in &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7455 and 5371 that limits their application to GS employees, and the absence of such language in &#x00A7; 7454(b)(3), indicates that Congress did not intend to limit &#x00A7; 7454(b)(3) to GS employees. <span class="Italic">See EEOC, </span>53 FLRA 465, 482-83 (1997) (citing <span class="Italic">Russello v. U.S., </span>464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983)) (the presence of certain language in a statutory provision established that the exclusion of similar language in a related statute was intentional).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the second assertion, the Agency cites no precedent to support a conclusion that the Standing Rules of the Senate are persuasive guides for determining Congressional intent. In fact, the Agency's argument that the SVAC lacked jurisdiction to promulgate bills concerning FWS employees is undercut by the fact that the bill was presented to, and enacted by, Congress. In addition, the Agency cites no authority to support its assertion that the Standing Rules prevent the SVAC from enacting legislation concerning FWS employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, with regard to the Agency's assertion that the Arbitrator's direction of pre-decisional involvement by the Union is contrary to &#x00A7; 7454(b)(3), nothing in that statutory provision either addresses or precludes pre-decisional involvement by an exclusive representative of employees. Accordingly, there is no basis for finding the supplemental award contrary to law in this respect.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of premium pay for shore leave denied was set aside when the denial of the leave was consistent with the contract, but the determination to deny the leave was insufficiently documented. The failure to provide the union the documentation supporting the leave denial did not cause a loss of back pay. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Military Sealift Command and IAM, MEBA</span>, 70 FLRA 671 (2018) (Member Abbott concurring; Member DuBester dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent">The complexities of the statutes establishing the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, and the reservation to its Director of the authority to set pay and award levels led FLRA to determine in <span class="Italic">DOD NIMA and AFGE Local 1827</span>, 57 FLRA 837, 843 (2002) (rev'd, <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 302 and Dept. of Treasury, OCC</span>, 65 FLRA 746 (2011) (overruled as legal authority in <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 302 and Dept. of Treasury, OCC</span>, 65 FLRA 746, 747-50 (2011), in turn overruled, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Energy, WAPA and AFGE Local 3824</span>, 71 FLRA 111 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting))), discussed in Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-13-008.html#sec5-9">Matters Statutorily Entrusted to Agency Discretion</a>")), that an arbitrator lacked authority to entertain a grievance concerning the pay level assigned to several grievants.

<p class="noindent">When an agency invalidly implemented a plan to offer a retention bonus to retain the services of respiratory therapists, an arbitrator could not award a bonus under the plan. It was for the agency, not the arbitrator, to implement the plan under OPM regulations, 5 CFR 575.303 &#x0026; 305(a)(1). <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Bragg and AFGE Local 1770</span>, 60 FLRA 545, 547 (2005). But when the contract provided for employee bonuses and an arbitrator directed impact bargaining to remedy the agency's failure to conduct impact bargaining over a change to the financial structure for bonuses, FLRA declined to set the award aside on the agency's protest that the award interfered with its right to determine the agency budget, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 12</span>, 67 FLRA 287, 289-90 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has applied a two-part test to determine whether an award affects management's right to determine its budget under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute.[31] Under the test, the Authority will find that an award affects an agency's right to determine its budget if: (1) the agency shows that the award prescribes the particular programs to be included in the agency's budget, or the amount to be allocated in the budget;[32] or (2) the agency substantially demonstrates that an increase in costs is significant and unavoidable, and is not offset by compensating benefits.[33]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As for the first part of the test, the award does not prescribe the amount to be allocated in the Agency's budget. In fact, the Arbitrator specifically found that the Agency could unilaterally allocate money to fund bonus pools for performance awards and change the amounts of the awards. With respect to the second part of the test, the Agency neither alleges nor shows that impact-and-implementation bargaining over the bonus-pool decision increases costs to its overall budget. Accordingly, we find that the Agency has failed to show that the award affects management's right to determine the Agency's budget, and we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">OPM regulations barred grievances challenging termination of retention-incentive service agreements or incentives, leading FLRA to set aside an award enforcing the agreements in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2145 and VAMC Richmond</span>, 69 FLRA 7 (2015).</p>
<p class="noindent">The existence of Operational Responsibility Differential Pay was noted in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 60 FLRA 565 (2005) (sustaining award of the benefit). FLRA set aside an award interpreting and enforcing a contract article call for an alternative to statutory special pay rates.
