<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-63_1"><span class="space">1.</span> Review of Board Decisions That Include EEO Defenses or Both EEO and Whistleblower Reprisal Defenses</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Albeit substantially qualifying its decision in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. USPS</span>, 120 MSPR 87, 92-93 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12, 2013 MSPB 68 (2013), <span class="Italic">post</span>, the Board extended <span class="Italic">Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, 133 S. Ct. 596 (2012), in <span class="Italic">Mills v. USPS</span>, 119 MSPR 482, 485-87 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9, 2013 MSPB 40 (2013), to decide that a mixed case cannot be unmixed, with the result that judicial review is through a district court even if the appellant does not wish to pursue the EEO defense in the Federal Circuit. The Board's interesting reasoning, based on a brief nonprecedential Federal Circuit procedural ruling, was:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where, as here, the appellant was affected by an action that is appealable to the Board and claims that the action constituted discrimination, the dispute is referred to as a "mixed case appeal." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(a)(2). At the Board level, a mixed case is governed by the procedures set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702. The relevant statutory provision governing judicial review in mixed cases provides that "[c]ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;] 7702...shall be filed" in district court under the applicable anti-discrimination statute. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2). A related statutory provision, which governs judicial review in cases not involving discrimination, provides that "a petition to review a final order or final decision of the Board shall be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1)(A). In the past, the notice of review rights included at the end of a Board decision in a mixed case has informed the appellant of the right to file a civil action in district court concerning "discrimination and other claims." The notice has further described the alternative of filing a petition for review with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit "[i]f you do not want to request review of this final decision concerning your discrimination claims, but you do want to request review of the Board's decision without regard to your discrimination claims." <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Quinlan v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 362, 373-74 (2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Doe v. Department of Justice</span>, No. 2012-3204, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 9095 (Fed. Cir. May 3, 2013) (nonprecedential), the appellant sought review of a Board decision in a mixed case before the Federal Circuit. Although the appellant did not seek review of the Board's conclusion that he had failed to prove his discrimination claim, the court transferred the case to district court because judicial review lay in that forum under the plain language <span id="Page_5251"></span>of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2). The <span class="Italic">Doe</span> decision relied in large part on <span class="Italic">Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, 133 S. Ct. 596 (2012), where the Court held that, under the plain terms of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2), judicial review in a mixed case lies in district court, not the Federal Circuit, even if the Board's final decision does not decide a discrimination claim. Although <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> did not deal with the precise question of whether an appellant has the option of seeking judicial review in a mixed case before the Federal Circuit on issues other than discrimination, <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> clearly stands for the notion that sections 7702 and 7703(b)(2) should be read literally. Although we are not bound by the <span class="Italic">Doe</span> decision because it is nonprecedential, we follow it because it is consistent with the Supreme Court's literal reading of the statutory provisions governing mixed cases in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>. <span class="Italic">See Worley v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 237, &#x00B6; 8 (2000) (the Board is not bound by a nonprecedential decision of the Federal Circuit, but it may follow such a decision if it finds the decision persuasive).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The pertinent statutory language states that a request for review in a mixed case "shall be filed" in district court. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2). The statute does not state that the appellant can transform a mixed case into a nonmixed case after the Board has issued a decision simply by not seeking judicial review on a discrimination claim. As a result, from now on the Board will not inform appellants in mixed cases that they may seek judicial review before the Federal Circuit on issues other than discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It would have been better had the Federal Circuit defined its jurisdiction in an appeal involving a dropped EEO allegation, and, as will be seen in the discussion in the earlier subsections of this chapter and that follows, the Federal Circuit seems to accept jurisdiction if the appellant expressly waives an EEO claim made before the Board. Some guidance arrived in an order from the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Brooks v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP No. 2013-3033), <span class="Italic">post</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board qualified <span class="Italic">Mills:</span> an allegation of discrimination, when clearly withdrawn, will not bar Federal Circuit review, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. USPS</span>, 120 MSPR 87, 92-93 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12, 2013 MSPB 68 (2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Supreme Court recently clarified an appellant's right to seek review in federal court of a final Board decision in a mixed-case appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702 in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, 133 S. Ct. 596 (2012). Consistent with the Supreme Court's decision, we recently held that the Board will provide notice of mixed-case appeal rights in all cases in which the appellant was affected by an action that she may appeal to the Board and alleges prohibited discrimination, regardless of whether we decide the claim of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. Department of the Army</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 147, &#x00B6; 14 (2013).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant appealed her removal, an action that is appealable to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(1), 7513(d) and 7701(a), and she alleged prohibited discrimination in her appeal. However, during the adjudication of her appeal, the appellant, through counsel, clearly and unequivocally withdrew her discrimination claim. Although the appeal was a mixed-case appeal when filed, it became a non-mixed appeal when the appellant withdrew her discrimination claim.[2] As such, this is no longer an appeal in which the appellant "alleges prohibited discrimination." <span class="Italic">See Kloeckner</span>, 133 S. Ct. at 603-04; <span class="Italic">Cunningham</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 147, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14. This case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Mills v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 9 (2013), where we state that an appellant cannot "transform a mixed case into a non-mixed case after the Board has issued a decision simply by not seeking judicial review of a discrimination claim," as the appellant herein withdrew her discrimination claim before the administrative judge issued a decision. Accordingly, we afford the appellant notice of non-mixed appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The Board's regulations similarly provide that an appellant may raise a claim of prohibited discrimination during the adjudication of her Board appeal, meaning that an appeal can be non-mixed when filed but become mixed while the appeal is pending. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.156(b).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reconciling <span class="Italic">Mills</span> and <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, <span class="Italic">Richard v. USPS</span>, DE-0752-12-0398-I-1 (NP 7/14/2014), declared:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Because the appellant did not object or attempt to withdraw the discrimination claim until after the Board had issued a decision, this case remains an appeal in which the appellant alleges prohibited discrimination and he is provided noticed of mixed-case appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Compare Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 87, &#x00B6; 12 (2013) (appellant clearly and unequivocally withdrew her discrimination claim prior to hearing, so the appeal became a non-mixed-case appeal, and the appellant was provided with notice of non-mixed-case appeal rights), <span class="Italic">with Mills v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 9 (2013) (appellant cannot transform a mixed-case into a non-mixed-case by not seeking judicial review of the discrimination claim after the Board has issued a decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An examination of <span class="Italic">Doe v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP No. 2012-3204), shows a brief decision that does not appear to be as broad as the Board inferred in <span class="Italic">Mills</span>, the court stating as to an appeal that appeared to embrace an EEO issue before the Federal Circuit:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to those motions, this court ordered the parties to respond why this case should not be dismissed or transferred to a district court, in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision of <span class="Italic">Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, 133 S. Ct. 596 (2012). In <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, the Supreme Court held that a federal employee who claims that an agency action appealable to the Merit Systems Protection Board violates an antidiscrimination statute listed in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) should seek judicial review in district court, not in the Federal Circuit.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> This case involves an agency action removal that the employee "may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board," and in which the applicant "alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1). Judicial review is therefore assigned to the district court. <span class="Italic">See Conforto v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, [713 F.3d 1111], No. 2012-3119 (Fed. Cir. Apr. 18, 2013) (Federal Circuit has jurisdiction if underlying action would not be appealable to the Merit Systems Protection Board).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Department of Justice argues that dismissal is required because judicial review is only appropriate for a final board order, and it argues that the order from which Doe appeals is not final. Doe argues that transfer is appropriate, in light of <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> is clear that judicial review of a Board decision in a mixed case, such as this, that includes a discrimination claim, is assigned to the district court, rather than this court, we agree with Doe that transfer is the appropriate remedy. The Department of Justice may raise its arguments regarding the finality of the Board decision in the district court.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Then the Federal Circuit issued an order <span class="Italic">Brooks v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP No. 2013-3033), stating that if a case starts with the Board as a mixed case, it cannot be unmixed at the Federal Circuit through waiver of EEO claims; the case remains mixed and is properly heard in district court:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, the Supreme Court held that a federal employee who claims that an agency action appealable to the Board violates an antidiscrimination statute listed in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) should seek judicial review in district court, not in the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 607. This case involves an agency removal action that the employee "may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board," and in which the employee "alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1). Judicial review is therefore assigned to the district court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Brooks and the Department of the Air Force argue that this court has jurisdiction to hear the petition for review. Because Brooks's proffered Statement Concerning Discrimination indicates that "[a]ny claim of discrimination by reason of race, sex, age, national origin, or handicapped condition raised before and decided by the [Board]...has been abandoned or will not be raised or continued in this or any other court." According to the parties, this "waiver" of any discrimination claim triggers this court's jurisdiction. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Brooks's appeal before the Board alleged discrimination based on age and race. As the Board recently observed, there is nothing in the statutes suggesting "that the appellant can transform a mixed case into a nonmixed case after the Board has issued a decision simply by not seeking judicial review on a discrimination claim." <span class="Italic">Mills v. USPS</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 482 &#x00B6; 9 (2013) (concluding that "from now on the Board will not inform appellants in mixed cases that they may seek judicial review before the Federal Circuit on issues other than discrimination"); <span class="Italic">see also Doe v. Dep't of Justice</span>, No. 2012-3204, 2013 U.S. App. Lexis 9095 (Fed. Cir. May 3, 2013) (transferring to the district court a petition for review in which the petitioner had indicated in his Statement Concerning Discrimination that any claim of discrimination was abandoned).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> is clear that judicial review of a Board decision in a mixed case that includes a discrimination claim is assigned to the district court, rather than this court, we transfer the petition for review to the appropriate district court, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Yet in <span class="Italic">Taylor v. MSPB</span>, 544 Fed. Appx. 973, 976 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP), we find the court alluding to the possibility of waiver of discrimination claims and preservation of Federal Circuit review authority:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court recently held that the district court's jurisdiction also extends to review of a mixed case appeal that the Board dismissed on procedural grounds, such as untimeliness. <span class="Italic">Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, 568 U.S. __, 133 S. Ct. 596, 607 (2012); <span class="Italic">Conforto</span>, 713 F.3d at 1116. As a result, the district court, not this court, is vested with jurisdiction over any mixed case appeal that the Board resolves either on the merits or on procedural grounds. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. That, in effect, means that any case in which the Board exercises its jurisdiction to decide a discrimination claim, and in which the employee seeks review of that decision, is not appealable to this court. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1348 n.6 (Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702, "this court can review the merits of a mixed case only if the petitioner waives his discrimination claims."). That is the case before us, as Taylor has not waived her discrimination claims.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, waiver of an EEO claim at the Federal Circuit level permitted that court to review the merits of the adverse action appeal in <span class="Italic">Sanders v. DHS</span>, 625 Fed. Appx. 549, 551 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP):</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_5252"></span>[1]&#x2003;Mr. Sanders presented a discrimination claim in his initial appeal as decided by the administrative judge. However, Mr. Sanders did not appeal the administrative judge's ruling in favor of Homeland Security on the discrimination claim to the full board. Mr. Sanders further does not appeal the discrimination claim to this court and has affirmatively waived any such claim. As such, we have no reason to question our jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Cf. Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, 133 S. Ct. 596 (2012).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Thurman v. MSPB</span>, 566 Fed. Appx. 957, 960-61 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP), concluded that the court had jurisdiction over a Board timeliness dismissal when the appellant clearly abandoned an EEO claim arguably raised before the Board:</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In this court, Mr. Thurman squarely asserts that "[t]he case is not a 'case of discrimination' that is excluded from this court's jurisdiction by 5 U.S.C. 7702 and 7702(b)(2)," that he "did not claim a 1964 civil rights violation in [his] Board appeal," and that he "did not present a claim to the Board that made this a 'case of discrimination.'" <span class="Italic">Thurman v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, No 14-3045 (Fed. Cir. May 21, 2014) (ECF No. 22). We take those statements to be an abandonment, for purposes of his MSPB case No. SF-3443-12-0727-I-1, of any allegation that would make this a case of discrimination. On that basis, we conclude that we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9) and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1)</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Then, in <span class="Italic">New-Howard v. VA</span>, 590 Fed. Appx. 972, 973-74 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP), the court determined:</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As an initial matter, the VA asserts that this is a "mixed case" involving allegations of discrimination and that this court consequently does not possess jurisdiction to hear this case. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, 133 S. Ct. 596, 607 (2012) (holding that "mixed cases" should be appealed to the district court and not the Federal Circuit). But Ms. New-Howard has expressly "waived her discrimination claim that the agency's denial of her sick leave was motivated by discrimination." As such, this case is no longer "mixed," and although it may have been more efficient for the district court to hear this appeal, we do possess jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703; <span class="Italic">Toyama v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 481 F.3d 1361, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2007) ("[P]arties may appeal directly to this court if willing to waive discrimination issues.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The weight of nonprecedential authority suggests that--Board pronouncements notwithstanding--the Federal Circuit accepts jurisdiction over a Board appeal if an EEO claim before the Board is expressly waived at the court. The Federal Circuit's Form 10 and its Rule 15(c) both contemplate and facilitate waiver of EEO claims to permit circuit jurisdiction to decide other issues.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Splitting jurisdictional hairs, the Board qualified <span class="Italic">Mills</span> in <span class="Italic">Vaughn v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 119 MSPR 605, 613-15 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-24, 2013 MSPB 50 (2013), adding to the general confusion by stating that an appellant with both a discrimination and a whistleblower reprisal claim may drop the EEO claim and seek review in the Federal Circuit (or, under WPEA, in another circuit appellate court):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board is not required to notify appellants of their appeal rights from a final Board decision, it is our custom to do so. We recognize that the appellate review process can be confusing, and we therefore attempt to make it more accessible by providing clear and accurate notice of those rights. To that end, we apply recent changes in the law to the instant appeal, in which the Board has issued a final decision deciding both whistleblower and discrimination claims in the context of an otherwise appealable action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Cases within the Board's jurisdiction that involve claims of discrimination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(B) are known as "mixed case appeals" and are governed by the procedures set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702. <span class="Italic">Mills v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 2013 MSPB 40, &#x00B6; 7. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2), judicial review of mixed case appeals lies exclusively in federal district court of competent jurisdiction.[4] <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (citing <span class="Italic">Doe v. Department of Justice</span>, No. 2012-3204, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 9095 (Fed. Cir. May 3, 2013) (nonprecedential)). On the other hand, cases that involve whistleblower claims,[5] i.e., claims that the actions or decisions under appeal were based on the prohibited personnel practices described under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), or 2302(b)(9) (A)(i), (B), (C), or (D), "shall be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or any court of appeals of competent jurisdiction." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1)(B). Thus, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b) provides different paths of judicial review for final Board decisions involving covered discrimination claims and whistleblower claims. The instant appeal involves both. Consistent with the plain language of the statute, <span class="Italic">see Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, 133 S. Ct. 596, 603-04 (2012), we find that the appellant has the following three options to seek review of the Board's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;If an appellant only wishes to challenge the Board's findings on her discrimination claims, she also has the option of seeking administrative review by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;In this decision, any reference to a claim of "whistleblower" reprisal is also intended to cover a claim of retaliation for certain other protected activity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) that is not whistleblowing<span class="Italic"> per se</span>, but that has been made subject to the procedures for seeking corrective action for whistleblower reprisal under a recent change in the law. <span class="Italic">See</span> Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-199, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 101(b), 108(a), 126 Stat. 1465, 1466, 1469 (amending 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1214, 1221, and 7703).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant wishes to challenge the Board's findings on her &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(B) discrimination claims alone, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(b)(1) provides that she may petition the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for review. The statute does not limit this right to administrative review based on any other claims that the appellant might have raised, although it does limit the scope of review to the discrimination issues.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant wishes to challenge the Board's findings on her discrimination claims and any other matters in addition thereto, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2) provides that she may file a civil action in the appropriate United States district court under the applicable anti-discrimination statute. At the district court, the appellant has the right to a trial <span class="Italic">de novo</span> on her discrimination claims. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c)(3). The court has jurisdiction to review the other aspects of the Board's decision as well, including the merits of the underlying action and any whistleblower claims, under the deferential standard of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c). <span class="Italic">Coons v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 383 F.3d 879, 888 (9th Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">Hayes v. Government Printing Office</span>, 684 F.2d 137, 138-41 (D.C. Cir. 1982). This is the most comprehensive path of review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If, however, the appellant wishes to challenge the Board's decision on her whistleblower claim, to the exclusion of any discrimination claim or other alleged prohibited personnel practice described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b), she has yet a third option for review under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1)(B). That subparagraph provides, in relevant part, that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">a petition to review a final order or final decision of the Board that raises no challenge to the Board's disposition of allegations of a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b) other than practices described in section 2302(b)(8), or 2302(b)(9) (A)(i), (B), (C), or (D) shall be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or any court of appeals of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1)(B). Under the plain language of the statute, an appellant who has raised claims of discrimination and whistleblower reprisal in the same Board appeal may drop her discrimination claims after the Board issues its final decision and seek review under this section based on her whistleblower and other non-discrimination claims alone. Although &#x00A7; 7702(b)(2) does not state that an appellant can transform a mixed case into a non-mixed case after the Board has issued a decision simply by not seeking judicial review on a discrimination claim, <span class="Italic">Mills</span>, 2013 MSPB 40, &#x00B6; 9, section 7703(b)(1)(B) does--at least where an allegation of whistleblower reprisal is involved.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant alleges at the Board that managers' actions were discriminatory, and if the discrimination claim raised at the Board is abandoned in the Federal Circuit, the appellant is not precluded from arguing in court that management's actions were otherwise improper and invalidated a performance-based action (although the argument was not successful), <span class="Italic">Harris v. SEC</span>, 972 F.3d 1307, 1317-18 (Fed. Cir. 2020):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A mixed case is one in which a federal employee (1) complains of having suffered a serious adverse personnel action appealable to the MSPB and (2) attributes the adverse action, in whole or in part, to bias prohibited by federal antidiscrimination laws. <span class="Italic">Perry</span>, 137 S. Ct. at 1979; <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 715 F.2d 1485, 1487 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(a); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.151. It is undisputed that Ms. Harris presented a mixed case to the Board when she appealed her performance-based removal, asserting twin affirmative defenses that her removal was due to race discrimination and prohibited retaliation, <span class="Italic">see Williams</span>, 715 F.2d at 1487 (discrimination claims before the MSPB appear as "allegation[s] in the nature of an affirmative defense").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But whereas the Board has jurisdiction to hear appeals of mixed cases, we do not. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) (granting the MSPB jurisdiction to "decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action"), <span class="Italic">with id</span>. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1)(B) (granting the Federal Circuit jurisdiction over a "final decision of the Board that raises <span class="Italic">no challenge</span> to the Board's disposition of allegations of a prohibited personnel practice" covered by federal antidiscrimination law, among others) (emphasis added)); <span class="Italic">see Perry</span>, 137 S. Ct. at 1988 ("[I]n mixed cases...in which the employee (or former employee) complains of serious adverse action prompted, in whole or in part, by the employing agency's violation of federal antidiscrimination laws, the district court is the proper forum for judicial review.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Still, a petitioner's explicit waiver of her discrimination claims in such a case effectively converts the case to a standard appeal of the adverse personnel action--providing this court with jurisdiction to review the Board's decision (without considering any discrimination claims). <span class="Italic">See Diggs v. Dep't of Hous. &#x0026; Urban Dev</span>., 670 F.3d 1353, 1355 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (noting that in a mixed case, "we have jurisdiction over the adverse action claim if 'any claim of discrimination...raised before the Board has been abandoned and will not be raised or continued in this or any other court'" (quoting Fed. Cir. R. 15(c) (June 2011)) (omission in original). Ms. Harris <span id="Page_5253"></span>availed herself of that option here. After filing her petition for review in this court, she submitted a Form 10 Statement Concerning Discrimination averring that "[a]ny claim of discrimination...raised before and decided by the Merit Systems Protection Board or arbitrator has been abandoned or will not be raised or continued in this or any other court."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the government, having thus formally waived her discrimination and retaliation claims, Ms. Harris cannot now assert <span class="Italic">any</span> arguments that the PIP was pretextual or that her termination was predetermined without returning this appeal to mixed case status. That is not so. In challenging the MSPB's final decision in this court, Ms. Harris is as free as any other litigant to press any argument not based on claims of prohibited discrimination or retaliation. And the pretext and predetermination arguments contained in her briefs here do not rest on the discrimination and retaliation claims she presented to the MSPB. She does not suggest, for instance, that any racial animus or illegal retaliation motivated her PIP placement and eventual removal. She simply argues that the reasons given for placing her on the PIP, and the poor assessment of her performance during the PIP, were insincere and contradicted by record evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Also, under <span class="Italic">Harris,</span> the existence of an appellant's lawsuit in district court concerning discriminatory practices other than the personnel action before the Federal Circuit does not oust the appellate court of its review jurisdiction, 972 F.3d 1307, at 318-19:</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The government also suggested at oral argument that Ms. Harris's ongoing district court case against the SEC belies her Form 10 waiver of discrimination claims filed in this court. Ms. Harris's district court complaint alleges violations of federal antidiscrimination laws arising from a variety of allegedly adverse actions by SEC management preceding her termination, some of which are also mentioned in her briefing here. Complaint &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 31, 37, 42, <span class="Italic">Harris v. Clayton</span>, No. 18-cv-1840 (D.D.C. Aug. 6, 2018); <span class="Italic">see L.A. Biomedical Rsch. Inst. at Harbor-UCLA Med. Ctr. v. Eli Lilly &#x0026; Co</span>., 849 F.3d 1049, 1062 n.6 (Fed. Cir. 2017) ("We can properly take judicial notice of the records of related court proceedings."). The complaint does not in any way challenge her removal itself--the only adverse personnel action appealed to the MSPB, and the only personnel action we now review. Contrary to the government's representation at oral argument, Ms. Harris's district court complaint does not seek "reinstatement" as relief; it seeks damages for allegedly discriminatory conduct that transpired before her removal. By seeking damages for the agency's other purported adverse employment actions, Ms. Harris has not impermissibly bifurcated review of the MSPB's decision regarding her removal. <span class="Italic">See Williams</span>, 715 F.2d at 1488-90. Indeed, Ms. Harris filed her district court complaint before the Administrative Judge had even rendered his initial decision in this case. What impact, if any, Ms. Harris's Form 10 waiver might have on her district court claims is a question best left to the district court. The existence of that concurrent action does not diminish our authority to review the present case, which no longer involves any claims of discrimination.</p>
