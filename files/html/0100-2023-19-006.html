<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-7"><span class="space">b.</span> Authority of Judge to Strike Frivolous EEO Allegation; Summary Judgment</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The cases included in this section describe how the Board arrived at a rule that required a hearing, on an appeal otherwise within the Board's jurisdiction, on EEO claims even if those claims were frivolous. Until it was reversed in 2015 in <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of Army</span>, 122 MSPR 612, 2015 MSPB 51 (2015), <span class="Italic">Redd v. USPS,</span> 101 MSPR 182, 2006 MSPB 32 (2006), overruled precedent and decided that summary judgment may be used to dismiss, prior to hearing, EEO affirmative defenses that do not present a genuine issue of disputed material fact. [<span class="Italic">Redd</span> is explored in Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-10-121.html#sec3-121">Summary Judgment</a>."] The Board's intent in <span class="Italic">Redd</span> was to harmonize MSPB practice with that of EEOC, whose judges routinely adjudicate cases through summary judgment. The <span class="Italic">Redd</span> decision applied only to EEO affirmative defenses. The decisions that follow, particularly <span class="Italic">Currier</span>, <span class="Italic">post</span>, and its kin, were overruled by <span class="Italic">Redd</span> and reinstated by <span class="Italic">Savage,</span> to the extent they address summary disposition of EEO affirmative defenses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Overruling <span class="Italic">Redd</span> (and it was not likely that many EEO defenses to adverse actions were tossed through summary judgment), <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of Army,</span> <span class="blue">122 MSPR 612</span>, 636-37 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 45-46, 2015 MSPB 51 (2015), explained as to summary judgment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By contrast, there is no comparable provision in the statute--or, for that matter, anywhere else in Title VII--granting enforcement authority to the Board.[9] The Board's authority to adjudicate and remedy alleged violations of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16 is instead a matter of civil service law. One source of that authority is 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(B), which provides that in any case where an appellant affected by an action appealable to the Board alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited by 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16, the Board shall "decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action[.] " The statute further specifies that the issues are to be decided "<span class="Italic">in accordance with the Board's appellate procedures</span> under [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701 and 7702]." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added). Hence, while the substantive "issue of discrimination" is defined by the standard set forth by 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a), it is civil service law that defines the procedures by which we decide whether a violation of that statute has taken place.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;Indeed, it was the intent of Congress in passing the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 to transfer to the EEOC the enforcement authority formerly vested in the Board's predecessor agency, the Civil Service Commission. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 92-238, at 2158-60, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1972 U.S.C.A.A.N. 2137, 2160.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Significantly, the Board's procedures do not provide for summary judgment. <span class="Italic">Crispin v. Department of Commerce,</span> 732 F.2d 919, 922 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1) (providing that an appellant "shall have the right to a hearing").[10] In determining if summary judgment is appropriate in a case where the plaintiff alleges that the contested personnel action is motivated solely by discrimination, the courts and the EEOC have traditionally followed the burden-shifting scheme of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</span> 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973). However, because the Board has no authority to grant summary judgment, and decides discrimination claims only after the record is complete, the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework has no application to our proceedings in this or any other appeal. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v.

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 182, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12 (2006), we declined to follow <span class="Italic">Crispin</span> based on the erroneous assumption that our procedures for deciding discrimination claims were a matter of substantive discrimination law. <span class="Italic">Redd</span> is hereby overruled.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before it was overruled by <span class="Italic">Savage,</span> <span class="Italic">Redd</span> determined, 101 MSPR at 185-89:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We interpret the appellant's argument on review to be that the AJ's disallowance of his sole witness in support of his race discrimination claim amounted to a denial of his right to attempt to prove discrimination at a hearing. In <span class="Italic">Currier v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 177, 182 (1998), the Board held that when an appellant who claims discrimination has <span id="Page_3317"></span>requested an evidentiary hearing, the AJ may not find against the appellant on the discrimination claim without holding such a hearing. For the following reasons, we overrule <span class="Italic">Currier</span> and hold that an appellant does not have an unconditional right to an evidentiary hearing on discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Currier</span> decision is based primarily on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1), which provides that when an individual who has been affected by an appealable action claims before the Board that the action was based on unlawful discrimination, the Board "shall...decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action in accordance with the Board's appellate procedures under [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;] 7701." Section 7701(a)(1) provides that an appellant has "the right to a hearing." In <span class="Italic">Currier,</span> the Board observed that section 7702 "does not distinguish between frivolous and nonfrivolous allegations or between facts sufficient to support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination and facts insufficient to support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination." 79 M.S.P.R. at 180 (citation omitted). Based on this, coupled with a statement in the legislative history of section 7702 describing the merits of the appealable action and the discrimination claim as "two sides of the same question which must be considered together," the Board concluded that an appellant who claims discrimination must be allowed to present evidence in support of his claim at a hearing when one is requested. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The shortcoming in this reasoning is that an appellant does not always have relevant, admissible evidence on a disputed fact to present at a hearing. This case is such an example, at least based on the record developed thus far. In assessing the sufficiency of a discrimination claim that is based on circumstantial evidence,[3] the first step is to determine whether the appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination; if a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is established, the burden of going forward shifts to the party that took the action under challenge to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action; and if the party that took the action articulates a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, it will prevail unless the individual claiming discrimination can show that this reason was merely a pretext for discrimination. <span class="Italic">Poole v. Department of Defense,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 456, &#x00B6; 4 (2001) (relying on <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks,</span> 509 U.S. 502 (1993), and <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</span> 411 U.S. 792 (1973)). To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case under this framework, the individual must show that he is a member of a protected group, he was similarly situated to an individual not a member of that group, and he was treated more harshly than the other individual. <span class="Italic">Buckler v. Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 476 (1997).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;"Direct evidence" is a written or oral statement or policy that "both reflect[s] directly the alleged discriminatory attitude and bear[s] directly on the contested employment decision." <span class="Italic">George v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 M.S.P.R. 71, 80 (1997) (citations omitted). The appellant in the present case does not claim to have such evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The step-wise analysis described above should not be employed when both parties have had a full opportunity to present all their evidence on discrimination at a hearing. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors v. Aikens,</span> 460 U.S. 711, 714-15 (1983); <span class="Italic">Beam v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 77 M.S.P.R. 49, 55 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant alleges that white employee M.K. was AWOL for an extended period and that the agency offered him a last chance agreement under which he would not be removed if he successfully completed treatment for alcoholism. In the present case, it is undisputed that the appellant was AWOL for over two months, during which time he was "getting high." The appellant claims that the agency committed disparate treatment race discrimination by removing him instead of offering him a last chance agreement. While evidence of the terms under which an agency and another employee settled litigation before a neutral body may not be relied upon to support a disparate treatment claim, an appellant may attempt to show disparate treatment with evidence that the agency is willing to negotiate, at the agency level, less severe discipline for members of some groups than members of other groups who have committed similar misconduct and are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">See Spahn v. Department of Justice,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 195, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-24 &#x0026; n.7 (2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On this record, the appellant has not made out a prima face case of discrimination, as he has not proffered evidence that, if credited, would show that he and M.K. worked in the same unit for the same supervisors, that their most recent misconduct and past disciplinary records were comparable, and that they were otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">See Wentz v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 91 M.S.P.R. 176, &#x00B6; 22 (2002);<span class="Italic"> Parker v. Department of the Navy,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 343, 350 (1991). Assuming for the moment that the appellant had a full and fair opportunity to develop the record on his disparate treatment claim--below we address his argument that he did not--that claim would fail, and an evidentiary hearing would serve no purpose. There are few things more basic to the employer-employee relationship than the employee's duty to report to work as scheduled or to justify his absence. Here the appellant did neither, for months, and he has a history of attendance-related discipline. Based on the record developed thus far, a reasonable factfinder could not infer that the appellant's removal for AWOL was a pretext for race discrimination; taking the appellant's allegations as true, a factfinder could not conclude that the appellant is similarly situated to M.K.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Not only did the <span class="Italic">Currier</span> decision fail to recognize that in some cases the appellant will have no relevant, admissible evidence on a disputed fact to present at a hearing, but it also did not acknowledge that an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) AJ is expressly authorized to render a decision without an evidentiary hearing when the "material facts" are not "in genuine dispute."<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(g). This standard mirrors the standard for summary judgment employed in federal court, <span class="Italic">see</span> Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 56, and indeed, a discrimination claim in federal court may be disposed of by summary judgment.<span class="Italic"> See, e.g., Lawton v. State Mutual Life Assurance Co.,</span> 101 F.3d 218 (1st Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Adams v. West Publishing Co.,</span> 25 F.3d 635 (8th Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Kizer v. Children's Learning Center,</span> 962 F.2d 608 (7th Cir. 1992). The<span class="Italic"> Currier</span> decision simply did not explain why the Board should be prohibited from disposing of a discrimination claim without an evidentiary hearing when the EEOC and federal courts are permitted to do so. Furthermore, <span class="Italic">Currier</span> did not explain why Congress would have intended that an evidentiary hearing be held when the AJ could not reasonably find that the agency committed discrimination. We do not believe that Congress so intended. <span class="Italic">Cf. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.,</span> 530 U.S. 133, 148 (2000) (a trial court should not treat discrimination differently "from other ultimate questions of fact").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also absent from the <span class="Italic">Currier</span> decision is a discussion of the longstanding doctrine that an AJ has broad discretion to exclude witnesses where the proffered testimony is not shown to be material and non-repetitious. <span class="Italic">See Fulton v. Department of the Army,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 79, &#x00B6; 11 (2003); <span class="Italic">Warren v. Department of Defense,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 426, &#x00B6; 7 (2001). When an AJ correctly exercises this discretion to disallow all of the appellant's proposed witnesses, under a literal application of <span class="Italic">Currier</span> the AJ would still be obligated to hold an evidentiary hearing on discrimination. This means that the AJ would have to permit some token amount of irrelevant or repetitious testimony before sustaining an objection and disallowing further testimony, making the hearing an empty ritual. In at least one case, the Board treated the AJ's refusal to engage in this futile ceremony as "error," but declined to remand the case for an evidentiary hearing because the appellant was not prejudiced. <span class="Italic">See Steck v. Department of the Interior,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 105 (1999). The better approach would have been to say that the AJ did not commit error in the first place, as the Board concluded that, under the undisputed facts of that case, the agency could not have committed discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As additional support for the holding in <span class="Italic">Currier,</span> the Board relied on <span class="Italic">Crispin v. Department of Commerce,</span> 732 F.2d 919, 922 (Fed. Cir. 1984), where the Federal Circuit held that the Board may not render "summary judgment." <span class="Italic">See</span> 79 M.S.P.R. at 181. Given that the Federal Circuit has no authority to review the Board's findings on the <span class="Italic">substance</span> of a discrimination claim, <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of the Army,</span> 715 F.2d 1485 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), a fortiori the <span class="Italic">Crispin</span> decision is not an authoritative source for the <span class="Italic">procedures</span> the Board must follow in adjudicating discrimination claims. It is also worth noting that although the Board suggested in <span class="Italic">Currier</span> that the EEOC disfavored Board resolution of a discrimination claim without a hearing, <span class="Italic">see</span> 79 M.S.P.R. at 181-82, <span class="Italic">Currier</span> did not cite a single EEOC decision holding that the Board must consider irrelevant testimony or convene an evidentiary hearing to address undisputed facts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that, notwithstanding <span class="Italic">Currier,</span> when an appellant's allegations in support of a discrimination claim are deficient as a matter of law, the claim may be disposed of without a hearing.<span class="Italic"> See Browder v. Department of the Navy,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 71, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8 (1999) (taking as true the appellant's allegation that he suffered from a sexual behavior disorder that caused the misconduct for which he was disciplined, his disability discrimination claim failed as a matter of law because his asserted condition was excluded from the definition of "disability" under the Rehabilitation Act), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 250 F.3d 763 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Table). We now hold that when the appellant's factual allegations in support of a discrimination claim, taken as true, could not support an inference that the agency's action was a pretext for discrimination, the AJ is not required to permit the appellant to attempt to prove his allegations at an evidentiary hearing. In other words, when there is no genuine dispute of material fact regarding discrimination, an evidentiary hearing on discrimination need not be conducted. When a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) does not exclude reduction in force (RIF) actions from its coverage, the CBA's negotiated grievance procedures are the exclusive means for contesting RIF actions that would otherwise be appealable to the Board, except where the appellant claims discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d), (g). In <span class="Italic">Cooper v. Department of Defense,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 313 (2005), the Board, relying in part on <span class="Italic">Currier,</span> held that section 7121 does not require an appellant who files a RIF appeal and claims discrimination to make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination for the Board to assert <span id="Page_3318"></span>jurisdiction over the appeal and to decide the discrimination claim. Our decision in the present case is not intended to modify <span class="Italic">Cooper.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A factual dispute is "material" if, in light of the governing law, its resolution could affect the outcome. <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</span> 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). A dispute is "genuine" if there is sufficient evidence favoring the party seeking an evidentiary hearing for the AJ to rule in favor of that party should that party's evidence be credited.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 249. We expect AJs to be extremely cautious in applying these standards and exercising their new authority to resolve discrimination claims without evidentiary hearings. In fact, often an AJ will be holding an evidentiary hearing on the merits anyway, and in the interest of having a complete record should either party seek review it will generally be preferable for the AJ to allow the appellant to present whatever evidence he has on discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without explaining exactly what it was doing, <span class="Italic">Simon v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 111 MSPR 381, 385-86 &#x00B6; 14, 2009 MSPB 95 (2009), determined that <span class="Italic">Redd</span> essentially authorized AJs to issue orders to appellants requiring them to produce evidence in support of their affirmative defense and to then bar the introduction of supporting evidence at the hearing if the appellant failed to comply with the affirmative defense order:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...It is well-settled that when an appellant fails to come forward with factual allegations which, taken as true, support an inference that the agency's action was pretextual, "the AJ is not required to permit the appellant to attempt to prove his allegations at an evidentiary hearing." <span class="Italic">Redd v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 182, &#x00B6; 13 (2006). In the absence of any evidence supporting the appellant's affirmative defenses, the AJ could have simply denied those defenses as unproven. In the alternative, the AJ might have drawn an inference in favor of the agency with regard to the information that the agency sought. <span class="Italic">See Roth v. Department of Transportation</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 172, 175-76 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 988 F.2d 130 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There were other problems with the appellant's responses to orders, including discovery orders, in <span class="Italic">Simon,</span> but the case authorized AJs to issue show cause orders having the effect of summary judgment proceedings on affirmative defenses.</p>

Under that rule, a plaintiff facing a well-supported summary judgment motion risks losing if he or she fails to produce sufficient evidence of a triable issue of fact. <span class="Italic">See Anderson</span>, 477 U.S. at 249; <span class="Italic">Celotex v. Catrett</span>, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). Moreover, summary judgment is circumscribed by a number of well-established rules. Specifically, the court "must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party,...and draw 'all justifiable inferences' in the non-moving party's favor and accept the non-moving party's evidence as true.[5] <span class="Italic">Ragsdale v. Holder,</span> 668 F. Supp.2d 7, 15 (D.D.C. 2009) (citing <span class="Italic">Anderson,</span> 477 U.S. at 255). However, a nonmoving party "cannot rely on 'mere allegations or denials,' and 'conclusory allegations unsupported by factual data will not create a triable issue of fact.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (internal citations and quotations omitted).

<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;However, it is important to note that in deciding a summary judgment motion, a judge may not weigh the evidence or make credibility determinations with regard to the merits of the claim over which there exists a genuine dispute. <span class="Italic">See Anderson</span>, 477 U.S. at 255.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, the administrative judge dismissed the appellant's discrimination claims for failure to allege facts that, if proven, would establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. In doing so, he applied a standard that is inconsistent with that articulated in <span class="Italic">Redd</span> which authorizes dismissal of discrimination claims without a hearing only when there is no genuine dispute of material fact. Moreover, the administrative judge erred in dismissing the appellant's discrimination claims without notifying her of the requisite standard for obtaining an evidentiary hearing on those claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also erred because he did not perform the requisite substantive analysis necessary to dispose of a discrimination claim without a hearing. An administrative judge must make findings of fact and conclusions of law on all material issues of fact and law presented in an appeal. <span class="Italic">Mahaffey v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 347, &#x00B6; 9 (2007). This duty extends to the dismissal of claims of prohibited discrimination. Accordingly, the appellant is entitled to a written decision on whether she has raised a genuine dispute of material fact regarding her affirmative defenses of race and sex discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the administrative judge prematurely dismissed the appellant's affirmative defenses of race and sex discrimination without a hearing. Consequently, the Board cannot reasonably assess the record as it presently exists to reach any determination on the merits of her discrimination claims.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1998 the Board had prohibited AJs from striking frivolous EEO affirmative defenses.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7701(a)(1) of title 5 of the U.S. Code provides that where an employee "submit[s] an appeal to [the Board] from any action which is appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation," he "shall have the right to a hearing." Section 7702(a)(1) of title 5 states that, "in the case of any employee..." who "has been affected by an action which the employee...may appeal to [the Board] " and who "alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination[,] ...the Board shall...decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action[.] " (Emphasis added.)</p>

Rather, a review of the legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), Pub. L.

<p class="Block-Quote1">To summarize: section 7701(a)(1) of title 5 gives an appellant a right to a hearing in any appeal brought to the Board under "any law, rule, or regulation" (emphasis added); sections 7701(a)(1) and 7702(a)(1) state that the Board "shall decide" any allegation of discrimination in any appeal which is brought to it under any law, rule, or regulation; and the Board in <span class="Italic">Bennett</span> held that section 7702 does not distinguish between frivolous and nonfrivolous allegations of discrimination or between facts sufficient or insufficient to support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. The appellant here filed his appeal under the RIF regulation at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.901; thus, his appeal falls under section 7701(a)(1). Accordingly, he has a right to a hearing under the statute.

Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 41 MSPR 521, 523-24 (1989). Striking a discrimination claim as frivolous without a hearing from a mixed-case appeal could constitute summary judgment for the agency on the action and the relevant affirmative defense of discrimination. The Board recognized this in <span class="Italic">Crawford.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Crawford</span>, the Board recognized that striking a discrimination claim before a hearing constitutes summary disposition of the claim when it noted that "EEOC's own procedural regulations provide that a discrimination claim may be dismissed without a hearing in appropriate cases, under <span class="Italic">summary judgment</span> procedures," which the EEOC has incorporated into its regulations at 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.109(e). 70 MSPR at 421 (emphasis added). As explained above, the Board lacks summary judgment authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commission) determined in <span class="Italic">Clenney v. Rice,</span> EEOC Pet. No. 03920116, 93 FEOR 3050 (Sept. 23, 1992), that, "as a matter of EEO law," it is error for the Board to reject a discrimination claim prior to a hearing. 93 FEOR at *4. The EEOC reasoned that "[b]y rejecting appellant's allegation prior to the hearing, the [administrative judge] effectively restricted the development of the record in that regard and thereby precluded the Commission from reviewing the claim as it is required to do under its statutory mandate." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In <span class="Italic">Crawford</span> the Board interpreted <span class="Italic">Clenney</span> "more narrowly than [its] broad language would suggest," finding that the EEOC only meant that a Board administrative judge "may not, based on his factual determinations, strike the discrimination claim before a hearing." 70 MSPR at 421. However, since the Board issued <span class="Italic">Crawford</span>, the EEOC, acknowledging that decision, has restated its view that, as a matter of discrimination law, it is error for an administrative judge to reject a discrimination claim prior to a hearing and has referred cases back to the Board where the administrative judge struck a discrimination claim before a hearing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Stephens-Jones v. Runyon</span>, EEOC Pet. No. 03970089, 1997 WL 741190 at *2 (Nov. 20, 1997); <span class="Italic">Harmon v. Runyon</span>, EEOC Pet. No. 03960125, 1997 WL 138405 at *2-3 (Mar. 17, 1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following the Board's interpretation of 7702(a)(1) in <span class="Italic">Bennett</span> and consistent with the legislative history of the CSRA, <span class="Italic">Crispin</span>, and EEOC case law, we find that an administrative judge may not strike a discrimination claim before a hearing upon finding that, in the administrative judge's view, the claim is frivolous. Rather, an appellant who has a right to a hearing under section 7701(a)(1) because he has filed an appeal from an action that is appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation has a right, under section 7702(a)(1), to have the Board decide any allegation of discrimination raised in that appeal based on evidence presented at the hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Other cases decided before <span class="Italic">Redd</span> (before <span class="Italic">Redd</span> was overruled in 2015 by <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>), followed the approach laid out by <span class="Italic">Currier.</span> <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. USPS</span>, 81 MSPR 16, 21 &#x00B6; 7 &#x0026; n.4 (1999) ("[S]ection 7702 does not distinguish between frivolous and nonfrivolous allegations of discrimination or between facts sufficient to support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination and facts insufficient to support such a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case"; "[W]hile an administrative judge may not strike a claim of prohibited discrimination based on the judge's conclusion that the evidence proffered would not establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, the judge retains the authority to rule on the admissibility of evidence and its relevance."). Having the authority to rule on the admissibility of evidence on a discrimination claim did not permit a AJ effectively to strike an EEO defense by refusing to receive evidence from witnesses who would testify to disparate treatment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Owens v. Dept. of Army</span>, 82 MSPR 279, 283 &#x00B6; 8 (1999). <span class="Italic">Steck v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 83 MSPR 105, 106-07 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-4 (1999), involved an appeal from an alleged denial of rights under a reemployment priority list. Appellant sought to raise an issue of discrimination by motion, but the AJ denied the motion. On PFR, the Board ruled the AJ should not have precluded the appellant from raising the EEO issue. The Board cured the error by determining itself, rather than through remand, that discrimination had nothing to do with the claimed RPL violation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit, perhaps not having been briefed on the niceties of MSPB mixed case jurisdiction, suggested in a nonprecedential opinion that an EEO allegation must be nonfrivolous to support MSPB jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Gittens v. DHS</span>, 124 Fed. Appx. 653, 654-55 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP), stated in a suitability appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the agency withdrew its unsuitability finding, Gittens continued to pursue his allegation of race discrimination and to urge that the Board had jurisdiction. Under the Board's precedent, before an appeal is dismissed as moot, appellants must be given an opportunity to raise a specific claim for compensatory damages when a general claim of prohibited discrimination has already been made and the underlying adverse action has been rescinded. <span class="Italic">Currier v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 191, 197-98 (1996). On February 11, 2004, Gittens was ordered by the Administrative Judge ("AJ") to show cause why his appeal should not be dismissed as moot. Gittens provided a response, which the AJ considered insufficient to demonstrate that race was a "motivating factor" in the unsuitability determination. <span class="Italic">Gittens v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, No. SE-0731-04-0116-I-1 (M.S.P.B. February 27, 2004) at 3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree that Gittens failed to demonstrate the Board's jurisdiction over his appeal. The Board has jurisdiction over discrimination claims only where there is a non-frivolous allegation that discrimination is the basis for the adverse personnel action being appealed. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1). The Board may exercise such jurisdiction "if the government employee makes non-frivolous allegations of jurisdiction supported by affidavits or other evidence." <span class="Italic">Dick v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 290 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2002). "Non-frivolous allegations cannot be supported by unsubstantiated speculation in a pleading submitted by petitioner." <span class="Italic">Dorrall v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 301 F.3d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Gittens' claim that the unsuitability determination for the position of Center Adjudication Officer was motivated by race is limited to general allegations of rude and insulting behavior on the part of DHS officials in connection with his April 2003 application. Gittens provides no evidentiary support for race's being a motivating factor in the DHS rejection of his April 2003 application--such as declarations, affidavits, or other documents--and thus fails to establish the Board's jurisdiction....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although under <span class="Italic">Currier</span> an AJ could not strike a discrimination claim raised under any law, rule, or regulation in an action otherwise appealable to the Board, the AJ could still determine that a claim of discrimination was not made. In <span class="Italic">Browder v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 81 MSPR 71 (1999), the appellant defended his removal with an allegation that the agency discriminated against him on the basis of a disabling condition in the nature of a paraphilia, defined as a type of abnormal sexual activity. The AJ struck the EEO claim. The Board determined that the AJ's action was not harmful error, because 1992 amendments to the Rehabilitation Act excluded from its coverage persons with sexual behavior disorders such as paraphilia. <span class="Italic">Browder</span> did not provide notice of EEOC appeal rights; the Board essentially precluded access to any tribunal other than the Federal Circuit to review whether the Board's analysis of the Rehabilitation Act was correct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the 1998 <span class="Italic">Currier</span> decision and the 2006 <span class="Italic">Redd</span> decision and <span class="Italic">Savage</span> in 2015, overruling <span class="Italic">Redd</span>, <span class="Italic">Crawford v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 416, 420-26 (1996), permitted AJs to preclude wholly unmeritorious EEO allegations from reaching the stage of a hearing and adjudication in an initial decision. Other pre-<span class="Italic">Currier</span> decisions defining the process to be followed before an AJ was allowed to strike a nonsubstantive EEO claim include <span class="Italic">Totten v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 532, 536 (1996), and <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 74 MSPR 53, 58 (1997). Pre-<span class="Italic">Currier</span> decisions also required specificity in pleading EEO allegations. An unsupported and perfunctory allegation of discrimination was insufficient to invoke Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cohen v. GSA</span>, 48 MSPR 451, 461 (1991); <span class="Italic">Carter v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 29 MSPR 500, 502 (1985) (on PFR: "appellant has not produced evidence supporting these allegations and, therefore, has failed to meet her burden of proof, we will not consider what relevancy, if any, her assertions might have <span id="Page_3320"></span>relative to the specific charges leading to the demotion"). An allegation of discrimination was to provide specific examples of discrimination and could not be made late in a Board appeal if no reason had been provided for failing to address the EEO issue earlier. <span class="Italic">Anderson v. VA</span>, 3 MSPR 71, 74, 3 MSPB 188 (1980). "To meet the jurisdictional burden of proof requires more than 'the mere filing of allegations,' but a proffer of evidence sufficient to enable an administrative judge reasonably to conclude that they are not frivolous. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">In re Stephens</span>, 52 MSPR 522, 528 (1992)." <span class="Italic">McCann v.
