<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-426"><span class="space">1.</span> When Application May Be Made</h4>
<p class="noindent">Although the parties may set their own time limits for submission of and response to fee petitions, <span class="Italic">VAMC, Ann Arbor and AFGE Local 2092</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v56/56-026.html">56 FLRA 216</a>, 225 (2000), and if they set a time limit FLRA will not overturn an award denying a fee petition by conducting a review of statutory criteria, <span class="Italic">NTEU Chapter 67 and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 67 FLRA 630 (2014), most do not. The general rule governing timing of a fee application to an arbitrator is stated in <span class="Italic">AFGE Council of Prison Locals and DOJ, FCI Texarkana</span>, 55 FLRA 192, 192-93 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Back Pay Act confers jurisdiction on an arbitrator to consider a request for attorney fees at any time during the arbitration or within a reasonable period of time after the arbitrator's award of backpay becomes final and binding. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Army, Red River Army Depot, Texarkana, Texas and</span> <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local</span> <span class="Italic">R14-52, </span>54 FLRA 759, 761 n.1 (1998) <span class="Italic">(NAGE Local</span> <span class="Italic">R14-52); U.S. Department of the Army, Red River Army</span> <span class="Italic">Depot, Texarkana, Texas and National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-52</span>, 39 FLRA 1215, 1221 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Red River Army Depot</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and Philadelphia Metal Trades Council, </span>32 FLRA 417 (1988)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, parties can negotiate into their collective bargaining agreement time limits and other procedures to govern the filing of requests for attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Logistics</span> <span class="Italic">Agency, Defense Distribution Region East, New Cumberland, Pennsylvania and American Federation of</span> <span class="Italic">Government Employees, Local 2004, </span>47 FLRA 791, 794-96 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Defense Distribution Region East</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Back Pay Act conferred jurisdiction on the Arbitrator in this case to consider on the merits the Union's request for attorney fees raised in its post-hearing brief, even though the request was not made in the grievance or any other pre-arbitration documents and was not litigated or referenced at the hearing. <span class="Italic">See NAGE Local R14-52, </span>54 FLRA at 761 n.1; <span class="Italic">Red</span> <span class="Italic">River Army Depot, </span>39 FLRA at 1221. Unless precluded by the parties' agreement, the Arbitrator was compelled to address the merits of the Union's request, and the Arbitrator's articulated basis for denying the Union's request is inconsistent with the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Defense Distribution Region East, </span>47 FLRA at 794-95; <span class="Italic">Red River Army Depot, </span>39 FLRA at 1221. Accordingly, we remand the award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, to consider the Union's request for an award of attorney fees, in accordance with the Back Pay Act, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.807, and applicable provisions of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See Defense Distribution Region East,</span> 47 FLRA at 795-96.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Under Authority precedent applying the Back Pay Act and its implementing regulations, an attorney-fees request generally may be filed within a "reasonable time" after the backpay award becomes "final and binding."[87] An award does not become "final and binding" until, as relevant here, the Authority resolves any exceptions to the award.[88] However, parties may modify the general rule by agreeing to a time period within which attorney-fees requests must be filed with an arbitrator.[89] Further, a party <span class="Italic">may</span> request attorney fees during the course of an arbitration proceeding, but nothing in the Back Pay Act and implementing regulations <span class="Italic">requires</span> a party to do so.[90] In sum, absent a contrary agreement, the default rule is that an attorney-fee request under the Back Pay Act may be filed within a reasonable time <span class="Italic">after</span> the backpay award becomes final and binding.[91]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator--without referencing any provision of the parties' agreement--required the Union to file an attorney-fees request within thirty days of the issuance of the remedial award. Because the parties did not agree to modify the default rule--requiring a fee request to be filed a reasonable time <span class="Italic">after</span> the backpay award becomes <span class="Italic">final and binding</span>--the Arbitrator's imposition of a thirty-day limit is inconsistent with Authority precedent applying the Back Pay Act.[94] Accordingly, we <span id="page_2489"></span>grant the Union's exception and remand the matter of attorney fees back to the parties.

Rather, at arbitration, the Union requested that "the Arbitrator retain jurisdiction for purposes of resolving any question of attorney fees" if the grievance was "sustained in whole or in part."

<p class="noindent">There is no prohibition against filing the fee petition before the award becomes final, i.e., after the award is received and before the time runs for filing or adjudication of exceptions. <span class="Italic">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and Philadelphia Metal Trades Council</span>, 32 FLRA 633, 636 (1988) (also noting that if counsel notifies arbitrator and opposing party that he was representing union, his later application for fees is considered to be submitted on behalf of union as party to arbitration).</p>
<p class="noindent">A fee petition may be filed with the arbitrator after the underlying award is issued providing a back pay remedy. <span class="Italic">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and Philadelphia Metal Trades Council</span>, 32 FLRA 417, 420-21 (1988), provided additional guidance concerning when a fee application should be made to and considered by an arbitrator:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the Act and its implementing regulations authorize the filing of an attorney fees request after an arbitrator has issued an award of backpay. The purpose of the Act is to provide backpay and attorney fees only after certain conditions have been satisfied. To require that a request for attorney fees be filed with an arbitrator before the prerequisites for fees have been met would not further the purpose of the Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, determinations as to whether a grievant is a prevailing party and whether backpay is a legally authorized remedy cannot be made until an award becomes final and binding. Therefore, it would be premature for an arbitrator to decide requests for attorney fees before an award becomes final and binding. While such requests may be submitted during the course of an arbitration proceeding, nothing in the Act or OPM regulations requires that a request for attorney fees be made before an award is final and binding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our conclusion is consistent with the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Washington Flight Service Station</span>, 21 FLRA 169 (1986). In that case, the Authority upheld an award of attorney fees where, as here, the request was filed after the arbitrator issued his award resolving the grievance. Our conclusion also accords with the practice of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), which permits attorney fees requests to be filed within specified time limits after a decision on the merits. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.37 (1988), requiring a motion for attorney fees to be filed within 20 days of the date that an initial decision becomes final under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.113 or within 25 days of the date of a final decision under section 1201.116 (issuance of a final decision at the Board level). <span class="Italic">See also</span> the Authority's proposed rule for Attorney Fees Under the Back Pay Act, Section 2431.5, 53 Fed. Reg. 10885 (April 4, 1988), which would permit an application for attorney fees in an unfair labor practice case to be filed after entry of a final order establishing that an applicant has prevailed in the proceeding or in a significant and discrete portion of the proceeding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are mindful of the <span class="Italic">functus officio</span> doctrine, which provides that an arbitrator is without authority to proceed further in a case after completion and delivery of an award. <span class="Italic">See, for example, Overseas Federation of Teachers, AFT, AFL-CIO and Department of Defense Dependents Schools, Mediterranean Region</span>, 32 FLRA No. 62 (1988), slip op. at 6. However, we find that where the Back Pay Act confers statutory jurisdiction on an arbitrator to consider an attorney fees request, the <span class="Italic">functus officio</span> doctrine does not preclude an arbitrator from considering the request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude, therefore, that the Back Pay Act confers jurisdiction on an arbitrator to consider an attorney fees request filed after an arbitrator's decision awarding backpay. Parties may agree to establish a time period governing when an attorney fees request may be filed with an arbitrator. In the absence of such an agreement, a request for attorney fees must be filed within a reasonable time after an award, which includes a backpay remedy, becomes final and binding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Union filed timely exceptions to the award. Therefore, the award did not become final and binding until the Authority issued its decision on August 13, 1987. The request was filed with the Arbitrator within 25 days after this decision. We find that the request was filed in a timely manner.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As the BPA confers statutory jurisdiction on the Arbitrator to resolve any Union request for attorney fees, there is no need for the Authority to remand the matter for a determination of fees. Accordingly, we deny the Union's request for a remand.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-106 and Dept. of Air Force, Langley AFB</span>, 32 FLRA 1159, 1164 (1988) (arbitrator was required to consider fee petition filed on day award became final as result of withdrawal of agency's exceptions to award).</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator has jurisdiction to decide requests for counsel fees after an award becomes final and binding. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Dams Project Office, Parker and Davis Dams and IBEW Local 640</span>, 42 FLRA 76, 81 (1991) (noting that arbitrator had retained jurisdiction to allow union to file a fee application) (citing <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R4-106 and Dept. of Air Force, Langley AFB</span>, 32 FLRA 1159, 1163-64 (1988)). "[No] law or regulation...prohibits an arbitrator from considering a request for attorney fees filed within a reasonable time after an award becomes final and binding." <span class="Italic">DOD, <span id="page_2491"></span>DLA, Defense Distribution Region East, New Cumberland and AFGE Local 2004</span>, 47 FLRA 791, 794 (1993). The law was summarized in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1156 and DLA Mechanicsburg</span>, 56 FLRA 1024, 1026 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, parties are not required to request attorney fees, and arbitrators are not required to decide such requests, before an award of backpay becomes final and binding. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Treasury, United States Customs Serv., Nogales, Ariz.,</span> 48 FLRA 938, 940 (1993); <span class="Italic">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard,</span> 32 FLRA 417, 421 (1988). Where an arbitrator retains jurisdiction to resolve a fee request or does not make any determination regarding such a request in an award on the merits of a grievance, an exception filed with the Authority regarding attorney fees is premature. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Coatesville, Pa.</span>, 53 FLRA 1426, 1431-32 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As nothing in the Back Pay Act required the Arbitrator to have issued a fee award at the time he issued an award on the merits of a grievance, the failure of the Arbitrator to address the fee request in that award is not contrary to the Back Pay Act. Moreover, because the Arbitrator has not yet addressed the merits of the fee request, the parties' arguments in that regard are premature. Accordingly, we conclude that the award is not contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(ii), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.807, and dismiss the exception without prejudice.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2054 and VA Central Arkansas Healthcare Sys.</span>, 58 FLRA 163, 164 (2002) (if arbitrator does not address entitlement to counsel fees in merits award, once that award becomes final (following resolution of exceptions), union may file fee petition with arbitrator).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs, Huntington Dist. and AFGE Local 3729</span>, 59 FLRA 793, 799 (2004), summarized law concerning the timing of exceptions to an award that does not award counsel fees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union states that the Arbitrator's award is deficient because it fails to award attorney fees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.807(a), an award of attorney fees is premised on the request of a grievant or a grievant's representative. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Army, Red River Army Depot, Texarkana, Tex.</span>, 54 FLRA 759, 762 (1998) (<span class="Italic">Red River</span>). Such a request must be made to the arbitrator, who is the "appropriate authority" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.807(a) to render such an award in the case of an arbitration proceeding. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 762-63. Further, there is no legal requirement that arbitrators issue a fee award at the time that they issue an award on the merits of a grievance. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1156</span>, 56 FLRA 1024, 1026 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Local 1156</span>). Where an arbitrator does not make any determination regarding a request for attorney fees in an award on the merits of a grievance, an exception filed with the Authority regarding such fees is premature. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Coatesville, Pa.</span>, 53 FLRA 1426, 1431-32 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a brief statement in his award, the Arbitrator indicated that the Union, as the grievant's representative, requested that the Arbitrator award attorney fees. However, the Arbitrator failed to address that request, which, as noted above, he was not under an obligation to do. The Union's exception as to attorney fees is premature and does not demonstrate that the award is deficient. <span class="Italic">See Local 1156</span>. Accordingly, consistent with Authority practice in these circumstances, we dismiss the Union's exception as to attorney fees without prejudice to the Arbitrator's consideration of the Union's request for such fees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator need not specifically retain jurisdiction to consider a fee request filed after the award of the merits, according to <span class="Italic">Alabama ACT and Alabama NG</span>, 51 FLRA 1262, 1263-64 (1996). The right to petition for fees is statutory. The union need only submit the fee application; it need not request permission to do so--at least that was the implication of <span class="Italic">Alabama ACT</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, and implementing regulations, 5 C.F.R. Part 550, an arbitrator may retain jurisdiction after issuing an award for the purpose of considering requests for attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service, Nogales, Arizona and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 116</span>, 48 FLRA 938, 940 (1993). However, an arbitrator is not required to do so in order to entertain a request for attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and Philadelphia Metal Trades Council</span>, 32 FLRA 417, 420-22 (1988) (<span class="Italic">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard</span>). Instead, as the "Back Pay Act confers statutory jurisdiction on an arbitrator to consider an attorney fee request[,]" such a request may be submitted to an arbitrator after issuance of an award, provided the request is submitted within whatever time limits have been agreed upon by the parties or, in the absence of an agreement, within a "reasonable time after an award...becomes final and binding." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Union has not submitted a request for attorney fees, there is no basis on which to conclude that the Arbitrator erred in failing to award such fees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">International Association of Fire Fighters, Local F-89 and U.S. Department of the Army, Headquarters, Fort Sam Houston, Fort Sam Houston, Texas</span>, 50 FLRA 327, 329 (1995) (<span class="Italic">International Association of Fire Fighters</span>). Moreover, as the Arbitrator was not required by law, regulation, or Authority precedent to retain jurisdiction in this case, his failure to do so does not render the award deficient under section 7122(a) of the Statute. Accordingly, we will deny the Union's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notwithstanding the foregoing, as the Union filed exceptions to the award, it did not become final and binding until the date of this decision. <span class="Italic">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard</span>, 32 FLRA 420-422. As such, even though the Arbitrator did not retain jurisdiction, the Union may file a request for fees, within a reasonable time from this date, consistent with the Arbitrator's statutory jurisdiction over this matter. <span class="Italic">International Association of Fire Fighters</span>, 50 FLRA at 329.</p>
<p class="noindent">In an interesting twist, after FLRA decided <span class="Italic">Alabama NG</span>, the arbitrator still refused to entertain the union's fee petition. The arbitrator declared that he had "fulfilled [his] function, discharged the office, accomplished the purpose, and therefore [had] no other force or authority in [the] case." FLRA again sustained the union's exceptions and determined that "to expedite resolution of this matter, we will direct both parties to jointly request the Arbitrator to proceed." <span class="Italic">Alabama ACT and Alabama NG</span>, 52 FLRA 1386, 1387, 1389 (1997). On remand the arbitrator issued an award that stated, in its entirety (according to the FLRA report): "This Arbitrator has thoroughly reviewed the Arbitration, Exhibits, Decisions, and Correspondence in this case and finds[&#8197;] [that] [t]he Union's request for Attorney's fees in [this case] is herewith denied." <span class="Italic">Alabama ACT and Alabama NG</span>, 54 FLRA 229, 230-31, 234 (1998). Finding the analysis insufficient to permit review, FLRA remanded the case again to the parties for submission to the arbitrator to resolve the fee request under the "pertinent statutory requirements." If the arbitrator was unwilling or unavailable to consider the case on resubmission, the parties were to jointly submit the question of attorney fees to another arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force Hq., 832d Combat Support Group, DPCE, Luke AFB and AFGE Local 1547</span>, 32 FLRA 1084, 1094 (1988), a fee petition would be untimely if filed with an arbitrator three years after the date of the arbitration award. FLRA was asked to remand a fee petition for time spent in arbitration to the arbitrator. The petition should have been submitted directly to the arbitrator and could not be considered to have been reasonably delayed because of extensive enforcement proceedings that followed the issuance of the arbitration award. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923 and DHHS, HCFA</span>, 48 FLRA 1117, 1122 (1993), declined to find that an arbitrator erred as a matter of law by refusing to entertain a fee petition 60 days after the last date the arbitrator thought that the issues submitted to arbitration were completely and unambiguously resolved. FLRA noted in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923</span> that it "has held that it will apply equitable considerations to the timeliness of motions for attorney fees under the Back Pay Act and will be guided to the extent practicable by FLRA regulations for the filing of applications for fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act," citing <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Ray Brook and AFGE Local 3882</span>, 32 FLRA 20, 25 (1988), <span class="Italic">rev'd in part and remanded sub nom. AFGE Local 3882 v. FLRA</span>, 944 F.2d 922, 927 (D.C. Cir. 1991), <span class="Italic">on remand</span>, 46 FLRA 1002 (1992). The FLRA regulation, &#x00A7; 2430.7, governing EAJA applications, permits a party, 30 days after an FLRA order becomes final to file an EAJA fee application. Without much by way of legal analysis, <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 70 FLRA 52 (2016) (Member DuBester dissenting in part), declined to overturn an award that concluded a union's fee petition was untimely following an underlying award of FLSA overtime. The union presented no legal authority demonstrating error by the arbitrator or a particular standard governing submission of the fee application that the arbitrator failed properly to apply.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator properly considers a request for supplementary fees for time spent responding to the agency's opposition to the underlying fee request. <span class="Italic">See DOL, OWC and AFGE Local 2513</span>, 72 FLRA 489 (2021) (Member Abbott concurring) (remanding for more particularized analysis of the supplementary fee request).</p>
