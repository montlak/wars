<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-266"><span id="Page_1864"></span><span class="space">a.</span> Effect of Arbitration Award on Board Appeal</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Williams v. USPS</span>, 35 MSPR 581, 592 (1987), <span class="Italic">modified in</span> <span class="Italic">Kroeger v. USPS</span>, 865 F.2d 235 (Fed. Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">post</span>, the Board explained how it would treat arbitrators' decisions affecting Postal Service preference eligibles who also appealed to the Board. The AJ applied collateral estoppel to an arbitrator's decision. The Board determined that arbitration decisions are not entitled to preclusive effect for several reasons: the union rather than the employee controls the presentation of the grievance; arbitral factfinding may be abbreviated; the record is not as complete; and some procedures common to civil litigation, e.g., discovery, are often not available in arbitration. The Board decided that it would not disregard the arbitrator's decision but, instead, would defer to it and the deference would be considerable:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Toward that end, the Board will, in most cases, defer to Postal Service arbitration decisions and will only set them aside or modify them where the appellant shows that the arbitrator erred in interpreting civil service law, rules, or regulation. Furthermore, the Board's review of arbitration decisions to ensure their conformity with civil service law will be based upon Board precedent. <span class="Italic">See Cornelius v. Nutt,</span> 472 U.S. 648, 105 S. Ct. 2882, 2889, 86 L. Ed.2d 515 (1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The approach in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> would be overruled by the Federal Circuit in its <span class="Italic">Kroeger</span> decision, <span class="Italic">post</span>, requiring collateral estoppel effect to be given to arbitrations involving Postal Service employees. [Refer to Chapter 4, "<a href="0100-2023-11-131.html#sec4-132">Labor Arbitrations Awards</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kroeger v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 31, 34-35 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Kroeger v. USPS</span>, 865 F.2d 235 (Fed. Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">post</span>, provides an example of analysis of an arbitrator's award that received deference rather than collateral estoppel effect in the appeal of an adverse action--an approach that would be overruled by the Federal Circuit:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant contends that, in applying collateral estoppel based on the arbitrator's findings on the charge of mishandling postal funds, the administrative judge deprived him of crucial credibility findings in relation to whether the individual who wrote him the checks received postal products or stamps. He further states that the checks made payable to him were cashed, not at the post office, but at a tavern. He argues that confrontation and cross-examination were the only effective means available for the Board to fairly determine these issues and to afford him the hearing to which he was entitled by law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the issuance of the initial decision in this case, the Board has issued its decision in <span class="Italic">Williams v. United States Postal Service,</span> 35 MSPR 581 (1987). There, the Board held that it will defer to Postal Service arbitration decisions and will only set them aside or modify them where the appellant shows that the arbitrator erred in interpreting civil service law, rules, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 592. The Board further stated that its review of arbitration decisions to ensure their conformity with civil service law will be based on Board precedent. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 592.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant has not shown that the arbitrator erred in interpreting civil service laws, rules, or regulations. Both the agency and appellant were given an opportunity to present witnesses and evidence before the arbitrator. The complainant testified at the hearing. The arbitrator found that her testimony was credible and that it established without a doubt that, over a period of years, appellant received checks from her payable to himself or the Postmaster, and that she did not receive postal products or stamps in exchange for the checks. To the contrary, the arbitrator found appellant to be lacking in credibility, pointing out that he was "evasive, sly and purposefully misleading." The arbitrator found that appellant then cashed the checks, removing an equal amount of money and leaving a balanced amount of funds in his cash drawer. He further found that appellant "knowingly and repeatedly violated a clear and important principle regarding check handling procedures," that he had an extensive prior disciplinary record, and that he took the fullest advantage of the system. Therefore, he found no basis to modify the removal and denied the grievance. The administrative judge properly adopted these findings in light of our holding in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit reviewed application of collateral estoppel to arbitration awards in <span class="Italic">Kroeger v. USPS</span>, 865 F.2d 235, 238-39 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Although the court affirmed the Board's result (sustaining the termination), the court decided that the Board's approach was wrong. A standard of collateral estoppel, not deference, could readily be applied to arbitrators' decisions. The court suggested that it would be a waste of judicial resources not to apply estoppel:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The grant of a right to appeal does not in itself limit the decisionmaking mechanisms available to the appellate tribunal. This court, as did the D.C.

Moreover, the policy underlying collateral estoppel, i.e. contributing to the efficient administration of justice by averting unnecessary relitigation, is equally applicable before the board. <span class="Italic">Graybill</span>, 782 F.2d at 1571 (citing <span class="Italic">Chisholm v.

Similarly, though the foregoing authorities dealt with the board's application of collateral estoppel to court decisions, the same underlying policy would justify its application to arbitration decisions in appropriate cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether the decision of a labor arbitrator can result in collateral estoppel before the board is a matter of first impression in this court.

We see no reason why an arbitrator's decision should not be given collateral estoppel effect before the board in the appropriate case, and no reason, in such cases, to force witnesses (if still available) to return for a repeat performance of their testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, after determining that Postal Service preference eligible employees should be treated no differently respecting the applicability of particular legal doctrines, 35 M.S.P.R. at 587, the board found it inappropriate to apply collateral estoppel in relation to arbitrators' decisions, citing distinctive elements in the nature of an arbitral proceeding. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 590-91. The board went on, however, to accord the arbitrator's decision "deference," saying "the board will, in most cases, defer to Postal Service arbitration decisions and will only set them aside or modify them where the appellant shows that the arbitrator erred in interpreting civil service law, rules, or regulation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 592. Thus the board employed language applicable to direct appeal of an arbitrator's decision to the question of whether collateral estoppel may bar relitigation of issues determined by an arbitrator in an appeal of the agency's decision by a Postal Service employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board listed in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> three criteria for application of collateral estoppel: identical issues; actual litigation of the issue in the prior action; necessity of the prior determination to the judgment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 594. In describing cases in which it declined to apply collateral estoppel, the board noted reasons: <span class="Italic">Aulik v. United States Postal Service</span>, 1 MSPB 485, 1 M.S.P.R. 501, 502 (1980) (employee not a party to grievance proceeding); <span class="Italic">Mortensen v. Department of the Army</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 433, 436-37 (1985) (employee not fully represented). The board described its actions in those cases as declining to apply collateral estoppel on public policy grounds "even where the requirements for collateral estoppel are met." As noted below, the requirements set forth by this court would not have been met in those cases. Where the requirements are not met, it would be error to apply collateral estoppel; where the requirements are met, it would not be error (though it may waste judicial resources) to decline to apply collateral estoppel. The board's indication in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, that collateral estoppel may never be applied to preclude re-litigation of issues that had been submitted to binding arbitration, is incorrect. There are and will be cases in which application of collateral estoppel to an arbitrator's decision is justified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Justification of Collateral Estoppel in This Case</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Collateral estoppel is justified on the facts here. In <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> this court identified the criteria for application of collateral estoppel:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003;the issue previously adjudicated is identical with that now presented, (ii) that issue was "actually litigated" in the prior case, (iii) the previous determination of that issue was necessary to the end-decision then made, and (iv) the party precluded was fully represented in the prior action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">794 F.2d at 664 (citing <span class="Italic">Mother's Restaurant, Inc. v. Mama's Pizza, Inc</span>., 723 F.2d 1566, 1569, 221 USPQ 394, 397 (Fed. Cir. 1983)). As above indicated, the ALJ applied the precise criteria set forth in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>. Hence the board did not err in holding that the ALJ properly adopted the arbitrator's findings, and would not have erred if it had approved the ALJ's application of collateral estoppel in this case to bar Kroeger from relitigating facts found by the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Kroeger does not say he was denied opportunity to litigate the facts fully and fairly before the arbitrator. Nor does he set forth anything that was not presented to the arbitrator, but would be presented at a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> hearing before the ALJ. Nor does he argue that the arbitration proceeding failed to meet any of the criteria set forth in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>. He simply labels the application of collateral estoppel "unfair." Some courts have cited fairness as a fifth criterion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Otherson</span>, 711 F.2d at 272. Unfairness, however, is not an abstract concept supportable by mere assertions that procedures may in some cases differ before the ALJ and the arbitrator. <span id="Page_1865"></span>Unfairness sufficient to bar application of collateral estoppel requires a specific showing that the precise dispute was not fairly litigated and resolved before the arbitrator. Kroeger has made no such showing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[<span class="Italic">Kroeger</span> is discussed in Chapter 4, "<a href="0100-2023-11-099.html#sec4-100">Collateral Estoppel</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Berkey v. USPS</span>, 42 MSPR 24, 27-30 (1989), attempted to square Board thinking with that of the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Kroeger</span>, but the Board explained that it would still not apply collateral estoppel to arbitrators' findings on EEO claims in Postal Service cases. <span class="Italic">Berkey</span> stated that collateral estoppel would not be applied if the issues of the successive cases were dissimilar:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequent to...our decision in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> [<span class="Italic">v. USPS</span>, 35 MSPR 581 (1987)], the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decided <span class="Italic">Kroeger</span>. The court held that, although it was not error for the Board to decline to apply collateral estoppel to arbitral proceedings where the requirements for collateral estoppel are met, it would be "a waste of judicial resources" not to do so. <span class="Italic">See Kroeger</span>, 865 F.2d at 239....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, however, we find that the requirements for the application of collateral estoppel have not been met and that the administrative judge therefore erred in applying collateral estoppel. Here, the issues before the Board are not the issues which were actually litigated before the arbitrator. The issues before the arbitrator were based on the appellant's removal from his position in February 1985.... [T]he arbitrator considered the agency's charge that the appellant was physically unable to perform the duties of his position at that time. The arbitrator determined that, at that time, the agency had fully accommodated the appellant by attempting to find him another position within his medical restrictions, but that there were no positions available at the facility. The arbitrator also determined that the appellant was not entitled to a light duty position under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. Finally, the arbitrator found that the Postal Service had violated two provisions of the collective bargaining agreement by failing to afford the appellant a minimum of one year of leave without pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issues before the Board in this appeal are based on the appellant's removal, in March 1986, for his physical inability to perform the duties of his position at that time. The question of whether the appellant was physically unable to perform the duties of his position in March 1986 is significantly different from whether he could perform those duties in February 1985. Similarly, the question of whether the agency afforded the appellant reasonable accommodation is dependent upon facts and circumstances existent in March 1986....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Not only do we find that the administrative judge erred in applying collateral estoppel to the arbitrator's findings on the handicap discrimination issue, we also hold here that, in appeals involving Postal Service preference eligible employees, the Board will not apply collateral estoppel to an arbitrator's findings on discrimination of the kind prohibited under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1). In <span class="Italic">Robinson v. DHHS</span>, 30 MSPR 389, 397, <span class="Italic">reconsideration</span> <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 31 MSPR 479 (1986), the Board held that it would decide both discrimination and other appealable issues within its limited scope of review of arbitration decisions under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d), which provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice under section 2302(b)(1) of this title which also falls under the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may raise the matter under a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure, but not both.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the Board stated that it would not provide <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of arbitration decisions that meet the jurisdictional requirement of that section....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find the instant case distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Robinson</span>, in that 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d) is inapplicable to Postal Service preference eligible employees affected by a prohibited personnel practice under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1). Thus, Postal Service preference eligible employees may proceed with allegations of prohibited personnel practices under the negotiated grievance procedure and before the Board at the same time....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since, in cases involving Postal Service preference eligible employees, there is no specific statutory provision requiring election of a forum, such cases may be analogized to <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co.</span>, 415 U.S. 36 (1974). In that case, the collective bargaining agreement between the employer and the union contained a clause prohibiting discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or ancestry.... The agreement also provided that an arbitrator's decision on disputed matters would be final and binding on the parties concerned....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court considered the question of whether an employee's statutory right to a trial <span class="Italic">de novo</span> under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 could be foreclosed by prior submission of his claim of discrimination to arbitration under a collective bargaining agreement. It noted that "[t]here [was] no suggestion in the statutory scheme that a prior arbitral decision either forecloses an individual's right to sue or divests federal courts of jurisdiction."... The Court declined to adopt a rule that would require Federal courts to defer to an arbitrator's decision on a discrimination claim.... It reasoned, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that arbitral procedures made arbitration a comparatively inappropriate forum for the resolution of rights created under Title VII, and the specialized competence of arbitrators pertained primarily to the law of the shop, not the law of the land.... Further, the Court determined that the Federal court should consider the employee's discrimination claim <span class="Italic">de novo</span>....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Likewise, in the instant case, there is no "statutory scheme," such as 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d), that forecloses the appellant's right to a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> hearing before the Board on his discrimination claim, even though the arbitrator has already decided that claim. Thus, the appellant has a statutory right to have the Board resolve his allegation of handicap discrimination.... [H]e is entitled to a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> hearing before a Board administrative judge on that allegation of discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the circuit decision in <span class="Italic">Kroeger</span>, <span class="Italic">Shrider v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 650, 653-55 (1988), considered an arbitration award, properly reasoned and reached after due process to the appellant, deferred to by the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both the appellant and the agency were given an opportunity to present and cross-examine witnesses, and to introduce evidence before the arbitrator. Although the appellant did not testify at the arbitration hearing, the evidence before the arbitrator included the contemporaneous handwritten notes of the supervisor threatened, the testimony of agency officials to whom the supervisor reported the incident immediately following his return to the post office, the statement and testimony of a witness, and pictures of the street scene where the confrontation occurred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The arbitrator noted the two distinct versions of what occurred between the appellant and the supervisor while the appellant was delivering mail. After comparing and contrasting the testimony of the supervisor and the appellant's eye-witness, the arbitrator found that the supervisor had the better opportunity to know what he said and to hear what the appellant said since they were together at the mail relay box, while the witness was sixty feet away and her ability to hear the appellant, who spoke in a normal tone of voice, was less than her ability to hear the supervisor, whom she stated spoke in a loud voice. In addition, the arbitrator found that the supervisor's contemporaneous record of the conversation, his report to his supervisors immediately upon return to the post office, and the supervisor's emotional state upon reporting what occurred, were all indicia of truthfulness. He, therefore, concluded that the supervisor's version of the incident faithfully and accurately reported the exchange between the supervisor and the appellant. The arbitrator further found that the agency's penalty, considering the appellant's past disciplinary record, was appropriate. He, therefore, found no basis to modify the removal and dismissed the grievance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant claims he was deprived of a fair hearing before the arbitrator because: (1) there was no live testimony by the supervisor; (2) "proof of cause" was presented second hand; (3) there was no opportunity to confront and cross-examine his principal accuser; (4) he was denied effective cross-examination because he was not permitted to present evidence of discrimination; (5) the arbitrator disregarded the rules of evidence and allowed hearsay evidence; (6) the arbitrator considered three suspensions that were challenged on the basis of discrimination and were not final decisions; and (7) the arbitration decision did not discuss the discrimination issues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the supervisor died before the hearing; the agency, however, provided evidence through other witnesses who were available for cross-examination. The appellant was given a full opportunity to examine witnesses on the discrimination issue at the Board, and the administrative judge, in the remand initial decision, based his holding that the appellant did not support his charges of discrimination and retaliation by a preponderance of the evidence on detailed findings and conclusions. The administrative judge fully considered the discrimination issue in the context of the charges, and the appellant's substantive rights were not adversely affected by the fact that the initial adjudication of the charges and the affirmative defenses took place in different forums.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Strict adherence to the Federal Rules of Evidence is not mandatory in administrative proceedings, <span class="Italic">see Behensky v. Department of Transportation,</span> 27 MSPR 690, 696 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">Brandis v. Department of Transportation,</span> 795 F.2d 1012 (Fed. Cir. 1986), and the assessment of the probative value of hearsay evidence necessarily depends on the circumstances of each case<span class="Italic">. See Borninkhof v. Department of Justice,</span> 5 MSPB 150, 5 MSPR 77, 83, 87 (1981). We find no error in the arbitrator's analysis of and reliance on hearsay evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the arbitrator noted that two grievances, filed with regard to the appellant's prior suspensions, were resolved by the time of the hearing. An employee's past disciplinary record is relevant in determining the appropriateness of a penalty. <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration,</span> 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280, 305 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the appellant's allegation, he was not precluded from challenging the credibility of witnesses at the arbitration hearing. Nor has he submitted any new evidence or identified any evidence of record <span id="Page_1866"></span>establishing error by the arbitrator in reaching his decision. The arbitrator in his Opinion and Award fully set forth the evidence presented, his credibility findings, and conclusions, and we find the Opinion and Award to be in conformity with Board precedent. We, therefore, find that the arbitrator's decision is entitled to full deference and that the appellant has had a full and fair opportunity to present his case on the merits of the charge and the affirmative defenses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board reiterated but did not fully define the concept of deference in <span class="Italic">Epstein v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 662, 664-65 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the administrative judge finds that this appeal was timely filed and that the Board has jurisdiction, the appellant is entitled to adjudication of the merits of his appeal. In addressing the merits, the arbitrator's decision is to be reviewed under the same standard applicable to preference eligible employees of other agencies. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. United States Postal Service</span>, 35 MSPR 581, 588 (1987). The Board will, in most cases, defer to Postal Service arbitration decisions and will only set them aside or modify them where the appellant shows that the arbitrator erred in interpreting civil service law, rules, or regulation.... In cases in which a question arises about the appropriateness of deferral, the Board will follow the guidance of relevant Federal court decisions.... All requests for review must include a statement of the grounds on which review is requested, evidence of record or rulings bearing on the issues before the Board, arguments in support of the stated grounds with specific reference to the pertinent documents and citations of authority, and legible copies of the award and other pertinent documents....</p>

As to other issues, the Board follow an arbitrator's ruling when the <span class="Italic">Kroeger</span> conditions are met: the issue adjudicated by the arbitrator is the same as the issue before the Board; the issue was actually litigated in the prior case; the prior determination of the issue was necessary to the end decision then made; and the party precluded was fully represented in the prior action. <span class="Italic">Gamble v.

USPS</span>, 80 MSPR 205, 210-11 &#x00B6; 13 (1998) (applying collateral estoppel under the conditions stated in <span class="Italic">Gamble</span> as to an arbitrator's determinations on issues before the Board: the facts underlying removal and the mitigation of penalty). <span class="Italic">Cavanagh</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, reiterating <span class="Italic">Berkey</span>, explained the portions of an arbitration award that are and are not given collateral estoppel effect, 44 MSPR at 490-91:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Williams v. United States Postal Service,</span> 35 MSPR 581 (1987), the Board reopened an appeal in order to consider whether the doctrine of collateral estoppel should be applied to an arbitrator's decision on a grievance that, like the arbitrator's decision in the case now before the Board, was filed by a Postal Service employee. It found that the nature of the arbitral proceeding militated against affording such decisions preclusive effect, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 590, and that it therefore would be inappropriate to do so in that case, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 591.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequently, however, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit overruled the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>. In <span class="Italic">Kroeger v. United States Postal Service,</span> 865 F.2d 235 (Fed. Cir. 1988), the court addressed the same question the Board addressed in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>. It concluded that, although it would not be error for the Board to decline to apply collateral estoppel when the requirements for application of that doctrine were met, it might be a waste of judicial resources to do so. It also held that there were cases in which application of collateral estoppel to arbitrators' decisions would be justified. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 239. In <span class="Italic">Berkey v. United States Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 42 MSPR 24, 28 (1989), the Board modified its <span class="Italic">Williams</span> holding so that it was consistent with <span class="Italic">Kroeger.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the prerequisites for application of collateral estoppel are present in this case with respect to (1) the arbitrator's finding that the appellant was unable to perform his mail handler duties when he was removed, (2) his finding that the agency had complied with the applicable provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, and (3) his finding that the removal was not motivated by reprisal for the appellant's prior union activities. The arbitrator, in making those findings, was addressing issues identical to those raised in this appeal; the issues before the arbitrator were "actually litigated in the prior action"; and the findings were necessary to the resulting judgment<span class="Italic">. See Chisholm v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 3 MSPB 273, 3 MSPR 171, 175 (1980), <span class="Italic">remanded for further consideration,</span> 656 F.2d 42 (3d Cir. 1981). Accordingly, we find that the administrative judge properly gave collateral estoppel effect to the findings identified above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also alleges that the administrative judge erred in declining to give collateral estoppel effect to the arbitrator's finding that the agency had fulfilled its responsibilities under the Rehabilitation Act. Giving collateral estoppel effect to that finding, however, would be inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Berkey.</span> In that decision, the Board held that, in appeals involving Postal Service preference eligible employees, it would not give collateral estoppel effect to an arbitrator's findings on discrimination of the kind prohibited under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1). <span class="Italic">Berkey,</span> 28-31. It held further that an employee's discrimination claim should receive <span class="Italic">de novo</span> consideration. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Discrimination on the basis of handicap, as it is prohibited under section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 USC &#x00A7; 791), is prohibited under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1)(D). Accordingly, we find that collateral estoppel effect should not be given to the arbitrator's finding that the agency had fulfilled its responsibilities under the Rehabilitation Act, and that the administrative judge's <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of the handicap discrimination issue therefore was proper.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming an otherwise adequate arbitration award, if the Postal Service appellant wins before an arbitrator without alleging EEO violations concerning the adverse action, and if the employee then timely appeals to the Board following a final agency EEO decision, the Board adjudicates the EEO issue <span class="Italic">de novo</span> while providing deference to the arbitrator's factual findings. <span class="Italic">Simonton v. USPS</span>, 35 MSPR 594, 596 (1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board will ensure conformity of the awards with civil service law based on Board precedent, <span class="Italic">Williams v. USPS</span>, 35 MSPR 581, 585-92 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Should Postal Service preference eligibles be treated differently than other employees with respect to the application of legal doctrines?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Postal Reorganization Act (PRA), Pub. L. No. 91-375, 84 Stat. 719 (1970), established the Postal Service as an independent establishment of the Executive Branch, subject to very limited application of federal employment law. <span class="Italic">See</span> 39 USC &#x00A7; 201. The PRA states that "except as otherwise provided in this title...no Federal law dealing with...employees...including the provisions of chapters 5 and 7 of title 5, shall apply to the exercise of the powers of the Postal Service." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00A7; 410(a). Rather, the PRA was designed to bring postal labor relations within the private sector framework subject, to the extent not inconsistent with the PRA, to the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> 39 USC &#x00A7; 1209(a). The PRA also adopted grievance-arbitration procedures modeled on private sector collective bargaining agreements for the resolution of labor disputes. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201-09.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An exception to the preclusion of Title 5, 39 USC &#x00A7; 1005(a)(2), pertains to preference eligible employees as defined in 5 USC &#x00A7; 2108. The procedural and substantive provisions of Title 5 are applicable to preference eligible Postal Service employees "in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the...officer or employee were subject to the competitive service under [Title 5.]"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, in addition to being able to invoke the grievance procedures provided by the collective bargaining agreement specified in 39 USC &#x00A7; 1206(b), preference eligible employees of the Postal Service are granted the public right, under 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) and 7513(d), to appeal to the Board those adverse actions listed in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512. <span class="Italic">See Hall v.

The collective bargaining agreement may provide that once an appeal to the Board is initiated, the right to elect the grievance procedure is waived past a particular step of the procedure. <span class="Italic">See Malone v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 526 F.2d 1099, 1103, 1105 (6th Cir. 1975). The right to appeal to the Board, however, cannot be limited by the collective bargaining agreement<span class="Italic">. See</span> 39 USC &#x00A7; 1005(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although section 1005(a)(2) is broadly written, the legislative history indicates that it was intended to have a narrower effect<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.,</span> Remarks of Senator Hartke, 116 Cong. Rec. 22337 (1970). Thus, &#x00A7; 1005(a)(2) has been interpreted to mean that Postal Service preference eligible employees do not have the same rights as federal employees in the competitive service, but only those rights granted to veterans by the Veterans' Preference Act. <span class="Italic">See Bredehorst v. United States,</span> 677 F.2d 87, 89, 230 Ct. Cl. 399, 403 (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since Postal Service preference eligibles are to be afforded rights equal to, but no greater than, other veterans with respect to their employment, the Board has generally found that their right to appeal to the Board, and the procedures applicable to both the effectuation of the action and the vindication of their rights before the Board, should parallel the rights of other preference eligibles. Only where, because of a specific exemption from Title 5 or its implementing provisions, it would violate 39 USC &#x00A7; 410(a) to treat Postal Service employees exactly as it does employees of other agencies, does the Board consider Postal Service preference eligibles under different rules than non-Postal Service preference eligibles. Even in such cases, however, the different treatment accorded Postal Service employees is limited to the particular narrow exception, and other relevant Board law applies to its full extent. Significantly, the Board's regulations governing hearing procedures for appellate cases, 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.11-1201.113, and petitions for review of initial decisions, 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.114-1201.119, make no distinctions between Postal Service preference eligibles and those in other agencies. We, therefore, find no basis for concluding that the two groups should be treated differently regarding the applicability of particular legal doctrines.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Should the Board view Postal Service arbitration decisions in the same way in which it views other arbitration decisions?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1867"></span>As a practical matter, in proceedings before the Board, the issue of the applicability of collateral estoppel to arbitration decisions remains to be settled only as to appeals from Postal Service preference eligibles. Under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d), which is inapplicable to the Postal Service, employees affected by a prohibited personnel practice under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) which also falls under the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may "raise the matter" under the statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure, but not both. The statute then provides the method of election of the forum and further provides that selection of the negotiated procedure in no manner prejudices the employee's right to request the Board to "review the final decision" rendered in the negotiated procedure. Thus, unlike Postal Service preference eligibles, other employees may not proceed in both fora at once. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.3(b). They may bring an arbitrator's final decision before the Board only if they allege discrimination. <span class="Italic">id.</span> at &#x00A7; 1201.3(b)(3). In such cases, the Board has determined that it will not afford <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, but will give deference to the arbitrator's decision and will set aside or modify the award only if the employee establishes that the arbitrator erred in interpreting civil service law, rules, or regulations. <span class="Italic">See Robinson v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 30 MSPR 389, 392-95 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have found that the PRA grants to preference eligible Postal Service employees only those rights enjoyed by other preference eligible employees. We have also found that the latter, along with non-preference eligibles, may have their arbitration decisions reviewed by the Board under a deferential standard where discrimination is alleged. Given the legislative purpose of the PRA, the basic similarities between arbitration in the Postal Service and under 5 USC Chapter 71, the like treatment accorded by the Board's regulations to employees of the Postal Service and of other agencies, and the remaining factors discussed above, we find that affording arbitration decisions concerning Postal Service preference eligibles review under the same standard applicable to preference eligibles of other agencies would be in keeping with the congressional intent of the PRA that such employees be provided with administrative review.[9]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;While we recognize that the language in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d) providing for Board review of arbitration decisions differs from the language in &#x00A7; 7513(d) which allows a right of appeal to the Board, in light of the considerations just discussed, the Board finds that no different result is required.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Are there compelling reasons why the more complete preclusive effect of collateral estoppel should be applicable to Postal Service arbitration decisions?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has applied the doctrine of collateral estoppel to decisions of administrative tribunals. For example, the Board has given collateral estoppel effect to issues involving the adequacy of an employee's job performance, which it had previously adjudicated in connection with a prior appeal of a separate action. <span class="Italic">See Boles v. Department of Transportation</span>, 27 MSPR 686, 688 (1985); Payer, 19 MSPR at 537. Similarly, the Board has found its own administrative determination conclusive in an agency action based upon facts decided in the employee's prior appeal of a constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. General Services Administration</span>, 27 MSPR 401, 406-07 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 794 F.2d 661 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to issues decided in its own cases, the Board has given collateral estoppel effect to a state court decision suspending an employee from the practice of law based on his failure to maintain a basic qualification for his position and unprofessional conduct. <span class="Italic">See McGean v. National Labor Relations Board</span>, 15 MSPR 49, 53 (1983). Furthermore, the Board does not examine military assignments and transfers, <span class="Italic">see Zimmerman v. Department of the Army</span>, 755 F.2d 156, 157 (Fed. Cir. 1985), or the refusal of a branch of the military to promote a member of its Reserves, even though failure to attain promotion resulted in the loss of active reserve membership, a condition of the employee's civilian employment. <span class="Italic">See Buriani v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 777 F.2d 674, 677 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The reasons that the Board does not look behind these decisions, and affords them collateral estoppel effect, may be summarized as follows. The Board's decision to apply collateral estoppel to issues adjudicated in its prior decisions presents the hornbook example of how the doctrine is properly applied, and can be likened to a court's decision to apply the doctrine to issues previously decided in the context of a prior judgment. Particularly, in this situation, the Board can be certain of the exact nature of the proceeding below, since, pursuant to its own procedures, the party against whom estoppel is raised had by definition a fair and full opportunity to prove the claim before the tribunal statutorily charged with adjudicating federal employee appeals and issuing appropriate decisions. <span class="Italic">See Bruszewski v. United States</span>, 181 F.2d 419, 421 (3d Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 340 U.S. 865, 71 S. Ct. 87, 95 L. Ed. 632 (1950); 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the Board's refusal to examine reasons for bar decertification where the employee is removed for failure to maintain bar membership is firmly grounded in its refusal to collaterally attack the decision of another tribunal, statutorily charged with the authority to render the decision under review. <span class="Italic">See McGean</span>, 15 MSPR at 53. Moreover, the individual can obtain review of the underlying facts pertinent to loss of bar certification by appropriate judicial process. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also affords discretion to the military on matters peculiarly within its expertise because "[t]he military constitutes a specialized community governed by a separate discipline from that of the civilian" and it is not within the role of the judiciary to intervene in the orderly execution of military affairs. <span class="Italic">Orloff v.</span> <span class="Italic">Willoughby,</span> 345 U.S. 83, 94, 73 S. Ct. 534, 540, 97 L. Ed. 842 (1953).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In other situations, however, the Board has declined to apply the doctrine of collateral estoppel. For example, in <span class="Italic">Aulik v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 1 MSPB 485, 1 MSPR 501, 502 (1980), the Board found that an employee who was demoted by reason of a grievance brought by a fellow employee was not bound by the result of the grievance proceeding since his interests were not represented in that proceeding and he was not a party to it. Further, the Board has twice declined to give collateral estoppel effect to the benefit eligibility decisions of state unemployment compensation boards<span class="Italic">. See Andrez v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 27 MSPR 145, 147 n.1 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 785 F.2d 326 (Fed. Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 476 U.S. 1173, 106 S. Ct. 2901, 90 L. Ed.2d 986 (1986); <span class="Italic">Ahr v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Justice,</span> 23 MSPR 238, 242 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Mortensen v. Department of the Army,</span> 27 MSPR 433, 436-37 (1985), the Board declined to apply collateral estoppel against an employee in a removal proceeding based on previous Special Counsel corrective action, even though the elements of collateral estoppel existed. The Board reasoned that application would compromise the purpose and policy behind an employee's right to a hearing before the Board since the employee was not afforded an opportunity to personally rebut the charges or provide guidance to her representative in the Special Counsel corrective action. In addition, the Board considered that affording collateral estoppel effect to Special Counsel corrective actions would force appellants to intervene in such actions to assure that their interests were satisfactorily represented and that such intervention could hamper the Special Counsel's pursuit of a case. However, the Board found that the agency was collaterally estopped from relitigating issues decided against it in the prior proceeding since it was a party to the prior proceeding and had a full and fair opportunity to litigate its case. Thus the Board has recognized, both explicitly and implicitly, that, even where the requirements for collateral estoppel are met, public policy considerations may preclude its application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons discussed below, we find that such is the case with respect to Postal Service arbitration decisions. In so finding, we also rely upon the absence of any persuasive reason to treat Postal Service preference eligibles differently from preference eligibles of other agencies with respect to collateral estoppel principles. Such a distinction would be flatly inconsistent with the congressional aim of equal treatment codified in &#x00A7; 410(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the nature of the arbitral proceeding itself militates against affording such decisions preclusive effect. An arbitrator's task is to effectuate the intent of the parties.[10] His source of authority is the collective bargaining agreement, and the interpretation and application of that agreement remains his sole authority<span class="Italic">. See Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Company,</span> 415 U.S. 36, 53-54, 94 S. Ct. 1011, 1022-1023, 39 L. Ed.2d 147, 161 (1974). Moreover, many arbitrators are laymen selected for their familiarity with the parties, <span class="Italic">see Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc.,</span> 450 U.S. 728, 743, 101 S. Ct. 1437, 1446, 67 L. Ed.2d 641 (1981), and, in any case, their expertise "pertains primarily to the law of the shop, not the law of the land." <span class="Italic">Alexander,</span> 415 U.S. at 57, 94 S. Ct. at 1024. Furthermore, since the union has control over the manner and extent to which an individual grievance is presented, the union's interests and those of the individual employee may not always be identical or even compatible. <span class="Italic">See McDonald v. City of</span> <span class="Italic">West Branch, Michigan,</span> 466 U.S. 284, 291, 104 S. Ct. 1799, 1803, 80 L. Ed.2d 302 (1984). Finally, arbitral factfinding may be abbreviated and generally is not equivalent to judicial factfinding. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The record is not as complete, the usual rules of evidence do not apply, and certain rights and procedures common to civil trial, such as discovery, cross-examination, and testimony under oath, are often unavailable or limited. <span class="Italic">Alexander,</span> 415 U.S. at 57-58, 94 S. Ct. at 1024-1025.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10] "A proper conception of the arbitrator's function is basic. He is not a public tribunal imposed upon the parties by superior authority which the parties are obliged to accept. He has no general charter to administer justice for a community which transcends the parties. He is rather part of a system of self-government created by and confined to the parties. He serves their pleasure only, to administer the rule of law established by their collective agreement." Shulman, <span class="Italic">Reason, Contract, and Law in Labor Relations</span>, 68 Harv. L.Rev. 999, 1016 (1955).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For all of these reasons, we think it is inappropriate to apply collateral estoppel in this case. Our reasoning, however, does not compel us to disregard the arbitrator's decision altogether. Indeed, federal common <span id="Page_1868"></span>law has created a principle of judicial deference to arbitral decisions under a functional standard which recognizes arbitration's unique role in labor-management relations. This broad rule of deference has been enunciated and adopted by the Supreme Court with respect to the merits of arbitrators' awards in the private sector. <span class="Italic">See United Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel &#x0026;</span> <span class="Italic">Car Corp.,</span> 363 U.S. 593, 80 S. Ct. 1358, 4 L. Ed.2d 1424 (1960). Since, as noted, arbitration under the PRA was modeled after the private sector experience, it is particularly appropriate to consider the private sector analogy in this context. While cautioning that arbitrators are not authorized simply to dispense their "own brand of industrial justice," the <span class="Italic">Enterprise</span> Court stated that any award that "draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement," is entitled to judicial acceptance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 597-98, 80 S. Ct. at 1361. The Court further noted that an arbitrator's award should only be vacated when his words "manifest an infidelity to this obligation," and that in making this determination, any doubts concerning the propriety of the merits of an arbitrator's decision must be resolved in favor of the decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Of course, judicial review of awards for consistency with the requirements of statutory law and public policy does not conflict with deference accorded an arbitrator's interpretation and construction of the collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See Newspaper Guild, Local 35 v. Washington Post,</span> 442 F.2d 1234 (D.C. Cir. 1971).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An equally deferential standard of review has been sanctioned for arbitral decisions in the public sector where only if the court determines that the arbitrator erred as a matter of law in interpreting a civil service law, rule, or regulation can it upset his decision<span class="Italic">. See Devine v. White,</span> 697 F.2d 421, 440 (D.C. Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds, Cornelius v. Nutt,</span> 472 U.S. 648, 105 S. Ct. 2882, 86 L. Ed.2d 515 (1986).[11]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11] Congress also recognized this policy of judicial deference in providing for review of arbitration decisions by the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA). In 5 USC &#x00A7; 7122(a), Congress provided for FLRA modification of an award if it is: (1) contrary to any law, rule, or regulation; or (2) deficient on other grounds, similar to those applied by federal courts in private sector labor-management relations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 2425.3(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According Postal Service arbitration decisions deference is consistent with judicial and congressional policy favoring arbitration, advances the PRA's express authorization and adoption of grievance arbitration, and provides consistency with respect to the way in which the Board views arbitration decisions of employees from other agencies. <span class="Italic">See Robinson,</span> 30 MSPR at 396. Toward that end, the Board will, in most cases defer to Postal Service arbitration decisions and will only set them aside or modify them where the appellant shows that the arbitrator erred in interpreting civil service law, rules, or regulation.[13] Furthermore, the Board's review of arbitration decisions to ensure their conformity with civil service law will be based upon Board precedent. <span class="Italic">See Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 472 U.S. 648, 105 S. Ct. 2882, 2889, 86 L. Ed.2d 515 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13] In <span class="Italic">Denson v. Veterans Administration,</span> 30 MSPR 383, 386 (1986), the Board held with respect to requests for review of arbitrators' decisions under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d), that a sufficient record must exist so that the Board may determine if the arbitrator erred as a matter of law. All requests for review must now include a statement of the grounds on which the review is requested, evidence of record or rulings bearing on the issues before the Board, arguments in support of the stated grounds with specific reference to the pertinent documents and citations of authority, and legible copies of the award and other pertinent documents. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(b). Although, as previously noted, neither this regulation nor 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d) applies to the Postal Service, the requirements set forth in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(b) may be instructive in Postal Service cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">How do these principles apply to the case before the Board?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In applying these principles to the present case, we first defer to the arbitrator's factual findings. We will, therefore, not consider appellant's objections in this regard. Moreover, he has not alleged that the arbitrator committed any specific error in interpreting civil service law, rules, or regulation, and our own review has disclosed no such error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Review by the Board for civil service errors remains the case after <span class="Italic">Kroeger</span>. Under <span class="Italic">Lockridge v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 613, 621 (1996), collateral estoppel will not be applied to an arbitration award that does "not comply with civil service law in adjudicating the charges on which the removal decision...rests." In <span class="Italic">Lockridge</span>, the arbitrator failed to make specific findings on charged misconduct but instead generally sustained the charges. The lack of specific adjudication left the award without collateral estoppel effect. <span class="Italic">Green v. USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 661, 667 (1991), involving a disability discrimination defense by a USPS preference eligible, determined that the appellant has the right to Board resolution of the discrimination allegation through a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> hearing on the allegation. In <span class="Italic">Green</span>, the Board decided to make an issue of whether the appellant may "present evidence in support of his claim of discrimination that is a collateral attack on the arbitrator's findings...." Specifically, the issue in <span class="Italic">Green</span> was whether the appellant could produce additional medical evidence before the Board to show that he was capable of physical job requirements the arbitrator found he could not meet. <span class="Italic">Green</span>, that "because consideration of this evidence is necessary to afford the appellant <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of his discrimination claim, it is admissible, but only with regard to the discrimination claim and not with regard to the merits."</p>
