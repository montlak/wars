<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-204"><span class="space">a.</span> Factual Determination on Cause of Separation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The determination of whether an employee's separation arose by reasons of misconduct or poor performance, or if it resulted because of a compensable injury, may be a matter of fact decided through analysis of conflicting evidence, <span class="Italic">Ruppert v. USPS</span>, 8 MSPR 593, 595-97 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Office of Personnel Management was given authority in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b) to issue regulations providing for the restoration of employees who fully recover from compensable injuries within one year. The regulations issued pursuant to that authority are found at 5 C.F.R. Part 353. Section 353.103(c)(1) of that part limits employees entitled to restoration to those who were "...separated or furloughed from a position without time limitation as a result of compensable injury..." OPM further explained this entitlement in its Federal Personnel Manual at chapter 353, subchapter 2, paragraph 2-6a(1):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The agency is required to restore the employee unless he or she was separated because of reduction in force, for cause, or for other reasons unrelated to the injury.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Miller,</span> the Board held that an employee who had been removed for failure to meet attendance requirements and for absence-without-leave and whose grievance concerning the action had been finally decided was not entitled to restoration because the removal was clearly for cause unrelated to the injury. Both the appellant in this case and the OPM suggest that <span class="Italic">Miller</span> [v. USPS, 3 MSPR 336 (1980)] does not reflect a correct articulation of the law and regulation, but neither argues that the separation in that case was related to the compensable injury. In fact, in <span class="Italic">Miller</span> the appellant was removed for extensive absences which began considerably before his injuries and continued until his removal. A grievance filed by the appellant in <span class="Italic">Miller</span> resulted in a determination that just cause existed for the removal, and to the extent that any of the absences were related to his injury, he had his opportunity to argue before the arbitrator that they did not constitute cause for removal. The Board finds no basis for concluding that <span class="Italic">Miller</span> represents an incorrect application of law or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's second argument is that his case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Miller.</span> The rating form which was used by his supervisor offered three possible recommendations: (1) satisfactory performance--retain the employee; (2) not fully satisfactory but merits continued employment; or (3) unsatisfactory--separate the employee. On July 7, 1980, appellant's supervisor indicated that he was not fully satisfactory but merited continued employment. On July 11, 1980, the appellant was injured and placed in a leave-without-pay (LWOP) status. On August 20, 1980, while still on LWOP, appellant was issued a notice of termination of his employment because of unsatisfactory performance. In its October 2, 1980, letter to the Regional Office, the agency commented that, after the appellant was injured and off-duty, there was no opportunity for him to improve his performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that there is a relationship between his injury and the reason for his separation. The Board agrees. Appellant's supervisor had the choice of recommending appellant's separation only days before his injury but, instead, he recommended retention. The agency does not assert that appellant's performance deteriorated during those few days but rather admits that the basis for the separation was the absence of any opportunity for appellant to demonstrate improved performance once he was injured. It is obvious, then, that while the injury may not have been the precise reason given for the separation, e.g., the reason recorded on the SF-50, the separation indisputably would not have occurred in the manner that it did had appellant not been injured. The Board finds that appellant's separation was substantially related to his injury.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nothing in the applicable law, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(1), precludes entitlement to restoration under the circumstances of appellant's case. OPM asserts that, under its regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.103(c)(1), a restoration right applies if the separation is substantially related to the compensable injury. <span class="Italic">See</span> OPM brief at 4, April 30, 1981. The Board gives great weight to the OPM interpretation of its own regulation, <span class="Italic">see United States v. Larionoff,</span> 431 U.S. 864, 872-73 (1977); <span class="Italic">National Distributing Co. v. U.S. Treasury Department,</span> 626 F.2d 997, 1019 (D.D.C. Cir. 1980), and we find that we are in accord. The Board finds that an employee is entitled under 5 C.F.R. 353 to restoration where his or her separation or furlough either resulted from or was substantially related to compensable injury.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding the fact that appellant received a notice of termination for cause, i.e., unsatisfactory performance, the Board finds upon examination of the facts that appellant's separation was substantially related to his compensable injury. Accordingly, the Board finds that the appellant was entitled to restoration rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Houston v. USPS</span>, 12 MSPR 576 (1982) (reviewing facts and deciding the appellant was separated for abandonment position, with no right to restoration, rather than as a result of a compensable injury); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Manning v. USPS</span>, 118 MSPR 313, 2012 MSPB 86 (2011) (remanding the appeal when the appellant submitted an arbitrator's award reversing a removal for cause that earlier prevented a finding that the appellant was absent from her job by reason of a compensable injury).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When the appellant was terminated for filing a false OWCP claim, although the reason for the termination was related to the injury leading to an OWCP coverage determination, the basis for the discharge defeated the employee's restoration claim, <span class="Italic">Miner v. USPS</span>, 31 MSPR 369 (1986) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Minor v. MSPB</span>, 819 F.2d 280, 372-73 (Fed. Cir. 1987), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, we find that appellant's removal did not result from or substantially relate to her injury within the meaning of the test set forth in the above case. In reaching this conclusion, we recognize that appellant's injury precipitated the chain of events which ended in her removal. Had appellant not been injured, the claim which formed the basis of her removal would not have existed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The essence of the removal action, however, was appellant's falsification. Appellant's injury to her stomach and back did not cause the misconduct of falsification in the manner contemplated by Board cases which have found that the removal resulted from or was substantially related to the compensable injury. For example, in <span class="Italic">Ruppert, supra,</span> appellant was removed for unsatisfactory performance. That separation, however, was substantially related to the compensable injury because the injury caused appellant's absence which eliminated his opportunity to improve. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">McKoy v. Department of the Army,</span> 18 M.S.P.R. 636 (1984)], appellant was removed for inability to perform her duties. Appellant's inability, however, resulted from her injury.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The instant case is clearly distinguishable from these situations because appellant's injuries here did not cause her to utter a false statement. Further, to the extent that her false statement was related to her injuries, appellant had the opportunity to argue before the arbitrator that the <span id="Page_4452"></span>falsification did not constitute cause for removal. <span class="Italic">See Ruppert, supra</span> 8 M.S.P.R. at 595.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that OWCP's ultimate determination that appellant suffered a compensable injury does not specifically contradict the arbitrator's conclusion that appellant made a false statement in connection with her compensation claim. In deciding that appellant established the fact of an injury, the Employee's Compensation Appeals Board found that OWCP did not meet its burden of proving its original determination was incorrect, and that appellant's claim that she injured her stomach and back on an escalator was substantiated by the examining physicians. That Board did not address the issue of whether the escalator malfunctioned. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue of the alleged malfunction, however, was the essence of the arbitration decision concerning appellant's false statement. Further, the arbitrator conceded that a question existed as to whether some accident occurred, but concluded that it did not occur in the manner described by appellant. Thus, the determination by the Employee's Appeals Board does not contradict the arbitration decision's finding that appellant made a false statement.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In light of this finding that the two decisions in question are not contradictory, we need not decide how much deference to give an OWCP determination in a restoration case where there is a conflicting determination as to the validity of the compensation claim. For example, in <span class="Italic">Stith v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. 328 (1984), the Board found that appellant's removal for absence without leave could not be sustained in light of OWCP's grant of the compensation claim because the claim provided an appropriate excuse for appellant's failure to report to work. In <span class="Italic">Miller v. United States Postal Service</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 210 (1985), however, the Board found that OWCP's grant of a compensation claim does not bar the Board from determining whether appellant committed fraudulent actions in obtaining benefits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The reviewing court affirmed, <span class="Italic">Minor v. MSPB</span>, 819 F.2d 280, 281-83 (Fed. Cir. 1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 19, 1980 petitioner allegedly suffered an injury while riding an escalator at her place of work. She asserted that the escalator step upon which she was standing collapsed and that this accident resulted in a compensable on-the-job injury. She subsequently filed a claim with the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) in the Department of Labor. OWCP at first awarded Minor a 45-day continuance of pay and allowed workers' compensation benefits until July 28, 1982 at which time OWCP terminated all benefits. In 1981 the Postal Service became suspicious about the accident and conducted an investigation into petitioner's medical history and the operation of the escalator. At the completion of the investigation, the Service concluded that the accident could not have occurred in the manner claimed by petitioner, and therefore opposed her compensation claim (as to which an award had already been made).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency sent petitioner a letter on August 14, 1981 informing her that she would be removed from the position of distribution clerk effective September 18, 1981 because she had filed a false injury claim. Minor grieved the removal action and was put in a non-pay, non-duty status pending resolution. She subsequently sought arbitration when the grievance was not resolved. On November 2, 1982 the arbitrator, after analyzing the site of the accident and hearing testimony, concluded that the accident could not have happened as Minor described. The arbitrator advised her that she could resign effective September 18, 1981 and have the removal notice deleted from her file, or, alternatively, consider the notice of removal to be for just cause. Minor did not voluntarily resign and the Postal Service removed her on December 14, 1982.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In October 1982 the agency asked OWCP to review its compensation award and, after a hearing, OWCP rejected petitioner's compensation claim on the ground that the accident had never occurred. In August 1984, the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board overturned that decision and remanded to OWCP for a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> decision. It was then that OWCP finally terminated all petitioner's benefits as of July 28, 1982.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Minor then sought restoration to the position she had held with the Postal Service in the manner provided by 5 C.F.R. Sec. 353.307 (implementing 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8151(b)).[2] By letter of December 31, 1985, the agency denied her request because she was removed for cause after filing a false claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. Sec. 353.307 declares:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee who was separated because of a compensable injury and whose recovery takes longer than 1 year from the date compensation began (or from the time compensable disability recurs if the recurrence begins after the injured employee resumes regular full-time employment with the United States), is entitled to priority consideration for restoration to the position he or she left or an equivalent one provided he or she applies for reappointment with 30 days of cessation of compensation. (<span class="Italic">See</span> Parts 302 and 330 of this chapter for more information on how this may be accomplished for the excepted and competitive services, respectively.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Minor appealed to the Board, contending that the Postal Service had wrongfully refused to restore her to duty under 5 C.F.R. Sec. 353.307, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. In an initial decision (March 21, 1986), the presiding official found that Minor had been removed for cause, having filed a false claim, and not for reasons substantially related to a compensable injury. The presiding official therefore concluded that Minor was not entitled to restoration. On Minor's petition for review of the initial decision, the full Board discussed the matter and upheld the presiding official's position. 31 M.S.P.R. 369 (1986). This appeal to us followed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. Sec. 353.307, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> an employee who has been separated due to a compensable injury or for reasons substantially related to a compensable injury,[3] and whose recovery takes longer than one year, is entitled to priority consideration for restoration to the position previously held, or to a position substantially equivalent. <span class="Italic">See Ruppert v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> 8 MSPB 256, 8 M.S.P.R. 593 (1981). An employee who has been denied reinstatement can properly take an appeal to the Board. 5 C.F.R. Sec. 353.401.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The addition of "or for reasons substantially related to a compensable injury" appears in MSPB decisions, not in the statute or regulation. We accept it for this case without holding definitively that it is a proper gloss. The Federal Personnel Manual (ch. 353, subch. 2, p 2-6a(1)) speaks of a requirement of restoration unless the employee "was separated because of reduction in force, for cause, or for other reasons unrelated to the injury."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question is therefore whether Minor was separated as a result of a "compensable injury." An employee who has been removed for cause rather than a compensable injury is not entitled to restoration and cannot appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">Cox v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 817 F.2d 100, 101 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">see also Miller v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> 3 MSPB 418, 3 M.S.P.R. 336 (1980). As this court stated in <span class="Italic">Cox</span>: "[b]y definition, separation as a result of a compensable injury excludes a valid removal for cause unrelated to the employee's compensable injury" (emphasis in original). In Ms. Minor's case the record is plain that (1) she was first removed by the Postal Service for falsifying the accident which she had reported as the cause of her compensable injury; and (2) the arbitrator, after a hearing, upheld that removal on the very basis the agency placed it. The arbitrator's decision has become final and Minor was, in fact, removed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The complexity arises from the formal ruling of the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board (in August 1984) that the escalator incident had occurred as Ms. Minor had described it. Thus there are two final determinations directly opposing each other--one made by the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board and the other by the arbitrator. Which is dominant in this case?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner points first to 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8151(b), giving employees whose compensable injury has been "overcome" certain restoration rights; she contends that the clause provides an unqualified right to such restoration. But the statute, especially as filled out and interpreted by the Office of Personnel Management regulation, fn.2, <span class="Italic">supra</span> (a regulation is expressly authorized and called for by the legislation) gives such right only to those employees separated because of the injury. Ms. Minor was, however, not separated because of her injury, but because of her falsification.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, petitioner invokes the federal employees compensation statute (5 U.S.C. Sec. 8128(b)) providing that the "action of the Secretary [of Labor] or his designee in allowing or denying a payment" under that Act "is (1) final and conclusive for all purposes and with respect to all questions of law and fact; and (2) not subject to review by another official of the United States or by a court by mandamus or otherwise." That provision obviously relates only to the Labor Department's decisions on the making or denying of compensation awards. That realm is the Labor Department's authorized area, and Sec. 8128(b) does not prevent an employing agency from deciding, in an authorized adverse action, that the employee had received a compensation award through making a false claim for which removal is the appropriate penalty. That is the sphere of the employing agency and of the MSPB or arbitrator on review of the adverse action.[4] And as this court said in <span class="Italic">Cox,</span> a decision of OWCP or the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board "does not bind" the MSPB acting within its own separate statutory sphere of deciding the propriety of restoration. Certainly, in deciding the reason for petitioner's separation, the MSPB is authorized to accept the agency's and the arbitrator's final and lawful decisions that petitioner had falsified her report of injury and been removed for that reason. Even though much the same facts and evidence may have been before the agency-plus-arbitrator and also before the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board, it was the agency-and-arbitrator that had power to decide her fraudulent acts and to remove her on that ground. Within the meaning of the applicable regulations, that separation for falsification was not "because of a compensable injury" nor was it "substantially related to her compensable injury" nor was it for a reason "related to the [compensable] injury."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_4453"></span>[4]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Miller v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 26 M.S.P.R. 210, 213 (1985), the MSPB held, on review initiated by a preference eligible of such an adverse action, that Sec. 8128 did not bar the Board from ruling "upon the issue of whether the [employee] committed fraudulent actions in obtaining those benefits. While the issue of [an employee's] entitlement to FECA [Federal Employees Compensation Act] benefits is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the OWCP, the issue of the [employee's] fraudulent conduct in those proceedings is not."</p>
