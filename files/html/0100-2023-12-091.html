<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-90"><span class="space">5.</span> Dismissal of PFR for Failure to Provide Interim Relief</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board elaborated on the need for careful and timely substantial agency compliance with interim relief requirements if agencies are to avoid summary dismissal of their PFRs, <span class="Italic">Bryant v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 523, 525-26 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an agency files a petition for review of an initial decision that orders the provision of interim relief, the petition must be accompanied by evidence that the agency has provided the required interim relief. 5 CFR 1201.115(b)(1) &#x0026; (b)(2). An agency's failure to submit such evidence "will result in the dismissal" of its petition for review. 5 CFR 1201.115(b)(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to avoid summary dismissal of its petition for review under section 1201.115(b), an agency must substantially comply with the procedural requirements of the regulation. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">DeLaughter v. USPS</span>, 55 MSPR 380, 383 (1992) (so long as the timely-filed evidence before the Board shows that the agency has fulfilled its interim relief obligations, the agency's "technical failure to fully meet the regulatory requirements" will not result in dismissal of its petition for review).... Where an agency substantially complies with the regulation, the Board will adjudicate the petition for review on the merits without further inquiry into the interim relief issue unless the appellant raises a timely, nonfrivolous challenge to the sufficiency of the agency's interim relief measures.... If, however, an agency does not substantially comply with the procedural requirements of 5 CFR 1201.115(b), it may not cure such failure (thereby avoiding dismissal of its petition for review) after the period for filing a petition for review has expired. <span class="Italic">Mascarenas v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 54 MSPR 303, 307 (1992); <span class="Italic">Baughman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 49 MSPR 415, 417-18 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency is confused, or if it believes that it is being subjected to conflicting administrative orders (from EEOC and MSPB) as to the appellant's entitlement to a position, the agency may make an "undue disruption" determination to avoid placing the employee into a position that is the subject of the conflicting orders, <span class="Italic">Davis v. DOJ</span>, 67 MSPR 316, 322 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...If the agency believed that it was subject to conflicting administrative orders, i.e., if it believed that returning the appellant to the Supervisory Correctional Officer position would put it in violation of the decision on the EEO complaint, here too it could have determined that it would be unduly disruptive to the work environment to comply fully with the administrative judge's decision. As to legislative intent, Congress required agencies to provide the relief ordered in initial Board decisions pending final resolution of appeals, unless to do so would be unduly disruptive to the work environment. The agency does not explain why this statutory mandate should not be enforced here.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although older cases strictly applied interim relief provisions to dismiss some agency PFRs, recent Board decisions are more forgiving. Board regulations interpreting the statutory interim relief provisions changed to provide the Board with more discretion to determine how to handle interim relief problems. That discretion is honored by the Federal Circuit, <span class="Italic">Singletary v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 104 Fed. Appx. 155, 157 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Singletary argues that because she was not returned to her regular duties and the Agency did not make a proper "undue disruption" determination, the Agency's petition for review should have been dismissed. She argues that the Board should not be permitted to overlook the untimely undue disruption determination and that undue disruption determinations must be explicit under the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The applicable statute governing appeals from the Merit Systems Protection Board requires interim relief for the affected employee unless "the employing agency...determines that the return or presence of such employee or applicant is unduly disruptive to the work environment." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A)(ii)(II) (2000). The applicable regulation states: "Failure by an agency...to provide evidence of compliance in response to a Board order...<span class="Italic">may</span> result in the dismissal of the agency's petition...for review." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(b)(4) (2004) (emphasis added). In 1999, the Board changed the regulation to read "may" instead of "will." <span class="Italic">Guillebeau v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> 362 F.3d 1329, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2004). In <span class="Italic">Guillebeau v. Department of the Navy,</span> we said that, in view of the Board's revision of the regulation, dismissal of a petition for review was no longer mandatory, and the Board has discretion to "dismiss or not dismiss an appeal if the government fails to comply with an interim relief order." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1332-33.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Board held that the Agency complied with the interim relief order. The Board held that the Agency's proffered justification for limiting Singletary's duties--"the nature of the appellant's serious misconduct, and the agency's justified loss of trust in her"--supported an undue disruption determination. <span class="Italic">Final Decision,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. at 557-58. Although the justification for the Agency's actions was provided in a reply brief to the Board and thus, was untimely, the Board held that the delay was excusable because of "the confusing language in the initial decision's penalty determination regarding the relief to which the appellant is entitled." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 556-58. While the Board did not explain what language it found confusing, its citation to <span class="Italic">Purzycki v. General Services Administration,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 188 &#x00B6; 13 (1999), and <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Department of Justice,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 167 &#x00B6; 15 (1999), makes clear that it was referring to the failure of the AJ to explain what constitutes an undue disruption determination. Singletary has not pointed us to any statute that the Board violated in this case. Moreover, the regulation provides the Board with discretion in determining whether to dismiss a petition for review. Thus, we see nothing in the Board's determination that was contrary to law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The discretionary nature of Board action when an agency fails to provide interim relief was emphasized in an appeal involving the suspension of an employee's security clearance (and pay) after the initiation of interim relief, <span class="Italic">Guillebeau v. Dept. of Navy,</span> <a href="https://openjurist.org/362/f3d/1329/guillebeau-v-department-of-the-navy">362 F.3d 1329</a> (Fed. Cir. 2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Guillebeau first argues that the Board erred in declining to dismiss the government's appeal from the Initial Decision for failure to comply with the interim relief order. The pertinent statute provides that an employee who prevails in an Initial Decision "shall be granted the relief provided in the decision effective upon the making of the decision, and remaining in effect pending the outcome of any petition for review." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A). The statute further provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If an agency makes a determination [that returning the employee to work would be unduly disruptive to the work environment] that prevents the return or presence of an employee at the place of employment, such employee shall receive pay, compensation, and all other benefits as terms and conditions of employment during the period pending the outcome of any petition for review....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(B). The Initial Decision ordered the Navy to cancel Guillebeau's removal and ordered interim relief if either party filed a petition for review. Guillebeau argues that the order was violated when, after the Initial Decision, the Navy suspended her pay on September 2, 2001. However, the Board's pertinent regulation merely provides: "Failure by an agency...to provide evidence of compliance in response to a Board order...may result in the dismissal of the agency's petition or cross petition for review." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(b)(4) (emphasis added). On its face, the regulation simply gives the Board discretion to dismiss an appeal if the government does not comply with an interim relief order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This interpretation is bolstered by the history of the regulation itself, which was originally drafted to require dismissal of an appeal, providing: "Failure of the agency to submit evidence that it has complied with the granting of interim relief..., or that it has provided notification that interim relief will not be granted fully..., will result in the dismissal of the agency's petition or cross petition for review." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(b)(4) (1990) (emphasis added). We considered the earlier version of this regulation in <span class="Italic">DeLaughter v. United States Postal Service</span>, 3 F.3d 1522 (Fed. Cir. 1993). In that case, we held that "[b]ecause the Postal Service failed to comply with the directives contained in [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;] 7701(b)(2)(A), the Board had no choice but to dismiss the Postal Service's petition for review." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1525. Accordingly, we remanded the case "to the Board with directions to dismiss the Postal Service's petition for review pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(b)(4)." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board amended the regulation on May 24, 1999, after the <span class="Italic">DeLaughter</span> case, replacing the word "will" with "may." <span class="Italic">See</span> 64 Fed. Reg. 27,899, 27,900 (May 24, 1999). The amendment was clearly designed to eliminate the mandatory dismissal requirement and to give the Board discretion to dismiss or not dismiss an appeal if the government fails to comply with an interim relief order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner here argues that, although dismissal of the Navy's petition for review was not mandatory, the Board was required to provide a more specific explanation for its action. We disagree. The Board stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The appellant has filed a motion to dismiss the agency's [petition for review] for failure to comply with the [administrative judge's] interim relief order. Although the appellant acknowledges that she was initially restored to pay status, she asserts that the agency subsequently suspended her without pay and that the suspension violated the [administrative judge's] order....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">After due consideration, and finding no basis upon which to grant the appellant's motion to dismiss the agency's [petition for review] for failure to comply with the [administrative judge's] interim relief order, we DENY the motion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Final Order, 93 M.S.P.R. at 381-82 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). The Board thus appeared to hold that that the interim relief order was not violated. The record supports such a finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Neither the Whistleblower Protection Act [of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16] nor the interim relief order can insulate an appellant from a subsequent adverse action so long as that action is not inconsistent with the initial decision." <span class="Italic">Barcliff v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 428, 433 (1994) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also Rothwell v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 466, 468 (1995); <span class="Italic">Shumate v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 288, 290 (1994); <span class="Italic">Crespo v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 125, 129 (1992). In these cases, the Board held that the interim relief order only protects the appellant from adverse actions based on the events underlying the action in which the interim relief order was granted, not events that are unrelated to the interim relief order. Here, the original Navy action removing Guillebeau was not based on the suspension of her security clearance, and the Board did not consider the suspension as a basis for the personnel action. In contrast, the Navy's later decision to suspend Guillebeau without pay effective September 2, 2001, did result from the suspension of Guillebeau's security clearance and access to classified information, "without [which she could not] perform the full range of duties of [her] position." Because the record supports a finding that the indefinite suspension of Guillebeau's security clearance and access to classified information, rather than events related to Guillebeau's failure to complete her work, was the cause of her September 2, 2001, suspension without pay, and because the indefinite suspension occurred after the interim relief order, the Board could properly conclude that the suspension was not inconsistent with the interim relief order. <span class="Italic">See In re Huston</span>, 308 F.3d 1267, 1280-81 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (holding that agency rulings may be upheld if they are supported by the record).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the Board's opinion were read as simply declining to dismiss without regard to the alleged violation, there still would be no reversible error. Granting the remedy of dismissal is not mandatory, and, even if the Board believed that the agency's action violated the order, it could appropriately conclude that the employee should have pursued another remedy, such as an enforcement action after the Final Order pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.182.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Citing <span class="Italic">Guillebeau,</span> <span class="Italic">Stack v.

In <span class="Italic">Stack,</span> the agency's certification of interim relief compliance was "less than adequate" because it did not properly explain the appellant's earnings calculations. But the Board did not dismiss the PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hoofman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 526 Fed. Appx. 982, 985 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP) ("We note, however, the relevant regulation provides discretion to dismiss or not dismiss. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.116(e) ('Failure by an agency to provide the certification required by paragraph (a) of this section with its petition or cross petition for review, or to provide evidence of compliance in response to a Board order...<span class="Italic">may</span> result in the dismissal of the agency's petition or cross petition for review.')

To the extent that the Army violated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.116(e) when it filed its Petition for Review, such a violation does not warrant dismissal of the Petition under the circumstances of this case."); <span class="Italic">Parbs v. USPS</span>, 107 MSPR 559, 563 &#x00B6; 6, 2007 MSPB 302 (2007) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Parbs v. USPS</span>, 301 Fed. Appx. 923 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP)) ("mere shortcomings in the agency's certification of compliance are not sufficiently serious to warrant dismissing the PFR"); <span class="Italic">Kolenc v. DHHS</span>, 120 MSPR 101, 105 &#x00B6; 11, 2013 MSPB 70 (2013) ("Under the circumstances of this case, we exercise our discretion not to dismiss the agency's petition for review because the agency has submitted evidence to show that it has complied with the interim relief order, that its delayed compliance with the order was inadvertent, and that the shortcomings in the agency's certification of compliance were not sufficiently serious to warrant dismissal.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency files a PFR and the appellant's only action was a cross-PFR, dismissal of the agency's PFR for failure to comply with interim relief requirements could result in dismissal of the cross-PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Guidry v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 61 MSPR 453, 456 (1994) (agency cancels the removal and substitutes demotion ordered by the AJ but the demotion is made retroactive to the effective date of the removal: "Because we are dismissing the action as moot, we need not discuss the appellant's cross petition for review because it has been effectively rendered a nullity."). A different (and better) approach was stated in <span class="Italic">Kilgour v. VA</span>, 67 MSPR 544, 548-49 (1995), involving mitigation of a demotion to a suspension. The agency's PFR was dismissed because of faulty interim relief, but as to the appellant's cross-PFR:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that although mitigation of the demotion action is no longer a live case or controversy that the agency can raise to the Board because it has cancelled the demotion, the appellant's cross petition is not removed from controversy as moot because he alleges that he has not gotten all of the relief to which he is entitled. Namely, the appellant challenges the sustaining of the charge and the imposition of the 60-day suspension. Mootness occurs either when issues are no longer "live" or where the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome of the litigation. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 6A James W. Moore <span class="Italic">et al.</span>, <span class="Italic">Moore's Federal Practice</span> &#x00B6; 57.13 (2d ed. 1993). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Horner v. MSPB</span>, 815 F.2d 668, 670-71 (Fed. Cir. 1987). The appellant has a claim for relief on the suspension which, therefore, is a live claim and he also has a legally cognizable interest in the outcome of the litigation of that matter before the Board....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the AJ errs in granting interim relief, it appears that the Board will not consider on PFR whether the agency complied with the interim relief order. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mosley v. USPS</span>, AT-0353-11-0927-I-1 (NP 11/26/2012) ("Because we find that the appellant is not necessarily entitled to retroactive restoration and back pay as ordered by the administrative judge, the Board need not consider whether the agency complied with the interim relief order. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brownlow v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 349, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6 (2000) (the Board need not consider whether an agency is in compliance with an interim relief order when the administrative judge erred in ordering interim relief).").</p>
