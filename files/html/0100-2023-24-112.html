<h2 class="h2" id="sec17-108"><span class="space">IV.</span> JUDICIAL RELIEF OUTSIDE THE REFORM ACT</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">Whether or not relief is available through the Board, federal employees ask about the possibility of relief through suits for damages or injunctions in the federal courts. Some employees may have no administrative remedies; some seek to avoid the administrative process and move their claims to a federal district court; some seek to pursue every possible remedy in every possible tribunal. The courts seek to avoid adjudicating controversies that are within the scope of administrative processes, and whether or not there are administrative processes available those courts generally lack jurisdiction to entertain claims unless a statute provides that jurisdiction. Some federal employees would like to sue their supervisors or higher-level agency executives. But, in general, federal employees are left to pursue their administrative remedies, with judicial involvement, if any, at the point of review by an appellate court of a decision by an administrative tribunal; discrimination cases may generally be pursued in district court. There are some narrow exceptions that vary from circuit to circuit. Those who consider seeking extraordinary judicial relief also should understand that the law is developing. To have a chance of success, one will likely have to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a motion for summary judgment, or both, before the merits of the case are considered by the court. Then there is the likely appeal by one or both parties. <span class="Italic">Pro</span> <span class="Italic">se</span> litigants should be especially wary. The government and any individual defendants are sure to be represented by competent counsel familiar with the law, practice, and procedure in the federal courts. For any who choose to venture on, what follows is a summary of some jurisdictional rulings. The decisions that follow are indicative of jurisdictional resolutions. Extensive research is required, far beyond the discussion presented here, on any jurisdictional issue in federal court.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The bottom line is a conservative one."The role of the federal government as an employer has expanded rapidly over the last quarter century, and so too has its obligation to deal fairly and equitably with its employees." <span class="Italic">Donovan v. United States</span>, 580 F.2d 1203, 1204 (3d Cir. 1978). But the prevailing philosophy--that employees' remedies are either limited to those established by the Reform Act or are not likely to exist unless there is plain statutory intent to create a remedy--is expressed by an opinion of the Federal Circuit, determining that a district court lacked jurisdiction to enforce a settlement of a grievance under an agency administrative grievance procedure, <span class="Italic">Bobula v. DOJ</span>, 970 F.2d 854, 857 (Fed. Cir. 1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRA was intended to be a comprehensive and exclusive legislative scheme to govern federal personnel matters....&#8197;As such, the only avenues of relief in personnel matters covered by the CSRA are those provided for in the CSRA....&#8197;The CSRA, however, cannot be read to repeal other statutes unless it does so explicitly....&#8197;Therefore, if another statute independently and specifically provides an avenue of relief in a case that would otherwise be governed exclusively by the CSRA, that statute must be given effect if the CSRA did not explicitly repeal it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because of the comprehensive nature of the CSRA, however, that rule does not extend to statutes which have been merely judicially interpreted as providing another avenue of relief or which by mere implication provide another avenue of relief....&#8197;Therefore, the CSRA can repeal by implication judicial interpretations or implications of preexisting statutes.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1988, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a previously recognized remedy under the Back Pay Act for a nonpreference eligible excepted service employee. <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 108 S. Ct. 668 (1988). Although limited to the jurisdiction of the Claims Court [now the U.S. Court of Federal Claims] in cases involving employees arguably covered by the CSRA, <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> has significant repercussions as to employees not covered by the CSRA or the Due Process Amendments extending MSPB appellate jurisdiction to many members of the excepted service. [<span class="Italic">Fausto</span> is discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-24-140.html#sec17-136">Back Pay Act</a>."] The decision should be read in its entirety before pursuing any implied judicial remedy outside of the ordinary channels specifically established by statute. As good a decision as can be found interpreting the preclusive effect of the Reform Act, as informed by <span class="Italic">Fausto,</span> is <span class="Italic">Ayrault v. Pena</span>, 60 F.3d 346, 347-50 (7th Cir. 1995), stating that courts other than the Federal Circuit (following appeal from MSPB) generally lack the jurisdiction to determine whether individuals are "employees" with appeal rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) employs students as part of a Cooperative Education Program designed to provide employees qualified to staff various FAA positions. In order to qualify for the Co-op Program, students must be enrolled on a full-time basis in a curriculum leading to a bachelor's degree. In order to stay in the Co-op Program, they must retain full-time student status while remaining in good academic standing. Within 120 days of completing these educational requirements and meeting certain other work criteria, co-op students are eligible for noncompetitive conversion to the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Kathy Ayrault entered the Co-op Program in early 1989 as a student at the FAA's Cleveland Air Route Traffic Control Center. In January 1992, after 30 months of service as a co-op student with the FAA, the FAA removed her from her position for allegedly disregarding her supervisor's direction and for being argumentative. A removal letter documented her termination and apprised her of the legal option of using the Equal Employment Opportunity Complaints Procedure if she believed she had been the victim of discrimination. The letter did not apprise Ayrault of any other rights she might have, such as a possible appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ayrault opted to file a complaint in the district court, contending that she had been removed unlawfully because she had not been afforded certain procedural protections of the Civil Service Reform Act, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC 7511-13, which generally require notice of the proposed termination, a right to a statement of reasons supporting the proposed termination and a right to reply....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 5 USC (1988 &#x0026; Supp. V 1993)), elaborated a comprehensive framework for handling the complaints of civil service employees faced with adverse personnel decisions. <span class="Italic">See generally United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 108 S. Ct. 668, 98 L. Ed.2d 830 (1988). In <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, the Supreme Court held that the CSRA's failure to give nonpreference members of the excepted service a right to judicial review precluded resort to legal remedies that had been available prior to the CSRA's enactment. <span class="Italic">See also LeBlanc v. United States</span>, 50 F.3d 1025, 1029 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Allowing resort to alternative remedies for complaints about matters within the statute's scope would undermine the CSRA because the statute "prescribes in great detail the protections and remedies applicable to such action, including the availability of administrative and judicial review." <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. at 443, 108 S. Ct. at 671. Lower courts, following <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, have recognized that the CSRA essentially preempted the field by "supersed[ing] preexisting remedies for all federal employees." <span class="Italic">LeBlanc</span>, 50 F.3d at 1030; <span class="Italic">Bodine v. United States</span>, 14 Cl. Ct. 661 (Cl. Ct. 1988), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 865 F.2d 269 (Fed. Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 490 U.S. 1048, 109 S. Ct. 1958, 104 L. Ed.2d 427 (1989). <span class="Italic">See also Schrachta v. Curtis</span>, 752 F.2d 1257, 1260 (7th Cir. 1985) (pre-<span class="Italic">Fausto</span> case concluding that Congress intended the remedies provided by the CSRA to be the exclusive means to remedy violations of its substantive provisions).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Part and parcel of the CSRA's comprehensive scheme is the stated congressional intention that one agency, and one court, have the primary responsibility for interpreting the CSRA's provisions. As the Supreme Court stated in <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, Congress recognized the primacy of both the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and the Federal Circuit in interpretive matters under the CSRA. Delegating the task of interpreting the CSRA solely to these two bodies fosters the development "of a unitary and consistent Executive Branch position on matters involving personnel action, avoids an unnecessary layer of judicial review in lower federal courts, and encourages more consistent judicial decisions...." 484 U.S. at 449, 108 S. Ct. at 674 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the statute envisions a uniform system of appeals. An employee who wishes to complain of an adverse personnel decision must first appeal to the MSPB. 5 USC 7513(d), 7701(a). <span class="Italic">McNabb v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 754 F. Supp. 118, 121 (E.D. Tenn. 1990) (failure to exhaust administrative remedies through MSPB precludes judicial review); <span class="Italic">Liles v. United States</span>, 638 F.

Complaints about the manner in which the MSPB handles matters, by the same token, must be taken to the Federal Circuit as part of an established course of judicial review. 5 USC 7703. <span class="Italic">Bodine</span>, 14 Cl. Ct. at 662 (Federal Circuit is appropriate forum to review order of MSPB); <span class="Italic">Liles</span>, 638 F. Supp. at 969 (same); <span class="Italic">Solar</span>, 600 F.

Cir. 1981) (failure to seek judicial review of MSPB's order as required by statute forecloses later complaint about that order in different proceeding), and <span class="Italic">Forest v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 47 F.3d 409 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Federal Circuit reviews MSPB's interpretation of 7511(a)(1)(C)'s definition of "employee").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These principles are of particular relevance to the present case, where Ayrault claims a right to the CSRA's comprehensive scheme of protections. She specifically asks that we interpret the term "employee" as used in 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(C) to extend the CSRA's protections to the class of employees to which Ayrault belongs. Ayrault, as a co-op student, is part of the excepted service. She is therefore <span class="Italic">possibly</span> an intended beneficiary of 7511(a)(1)(C). That section was specifically designed "to extend procedural protections to certain employees in the excepted <span id="Page_5330"></span>service who have completed 2 years of current continuous service in an Executive agency." 136 Cong. Rec. S11134, 11135 (July 30, 1990) (statement of Sen. Pryor).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed, however, that besides being a member of the excepted service, Ayrault also holds a probationary position. Section 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) thus apparently excludes her from "employee" status. The section states that an "employee" is</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003;an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible)--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) &#x0026; (ii). She argues that although she appears to be excluded from the definition of "employee" under subsection (i), she is included under subsection (ii) because she served as a co-op student for approximately 30 months (well over the two years provided in subsection (ii)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we may be sympathetic to Ayrault's dilemma, it is not our place to pass on this question. If Ayrault is an "employee," as she claims to be, then the statutory scheme deprives us of jurisdiction. She apparently has not, to our knowledge, filed a claim with the MSPB. This failure to exhaust administrative remedies waives a right to judicial review. <span class="Italic">McNabb</span>, 754 F. Supp. at 121. Even if she were entitled to judicial review, the appropriate forum for such review would be the Federal Circuit, 5 USC 7703(b)(1). <span class="Italic">See also Bodine</span>, 14 Cl. Ct. at 662. The CSRA obligated Ayrault to follow this established statutory route to obtain relief as a federal employee--if that is indeed her position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Forest</span>, 47 F.3d at 410-11 (Federal Circuit reviews MSPB's interpretation of 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) &#x0026; (ii)); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 63 MSPR 99, 100 (1994) (MSPB interprets &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)); <span class="Italic">Kane v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 60 MSPR 605, 609-10 (1994) (same).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This result may appear unjust: in the face of a fair question about Ayrault's status as an employee, we are demanding that she follow the route established for employees (and this when she never received the notice afforded to employees). Although this is effectively our conclusion on the matter, it is supported by several considerations. First, if Ayrault is not an "employee" within the meaning of the CSRA, <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> makes clear that she lacks any remedy at all. <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> holds that the absence of a provision for certain workers (there, nonpreference members of the excepted service):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...is not an uninformative consequence of the limited scope of the statute, but rather manifestation of a considered congressional judgment that they should not have statutory entitlement to review for adverse action of the type governed by Chapter 75.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">484 U.S. at 448-89, 108 S. Ct. at 674. The Supreme Court also stated that a similar conclusion would be inescapable in cases involving probationary employees. <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. at 450, 108 S. Ct. at 675 (characterizing probationary employees, like nonpreference excepted service employees, as a "disfavored class"). <span class="Italic">See also LeBlanc</span>, 50 F.3d at 1030 (probationary employee not entitled to complain of type of personnel action falling within scope of CSRA). Ayrault's probationary status convinces us that, if she is not entitled to the CSRA's protections as an "employee," she is entitled to no remedy at all. Because her complaint is precisely that the FAA failed to adhere to the provisions of Chapter 75 during her removal, she falls squarely within a category of workers whom the CSRA deprives of a remedy. If she does not qualify as an "employee" (a matter which we do not decide), she is thus not otherwise entitled to maintain a claim based on the FAA's personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Resolution of the statutory issue that the parties would have us resolve is thus unnecessary. If she is not an "employee," she lacks any remedy, and if she is an "employee," she has failed to pursue her rights as mandated by statute--first with the MSPB and second with the Federal Circuit. Under these circumstances, it is not inappropriate to demand that, if Ayrault seeks the rights of other employees, she follow the route established for them in order to obtain those rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our conclusion in this regard is buttressed by <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>'s concern about avoiding the pre-CSRA "patchwork" of outcomes, and facilitating "the comprehensive and integrated review scheme of the CSRA." 484 U.S. at 454, 108 S. Ct. at 677. The district court is not, in the first instance, the appropriate forum to expound on the meaning of the CSRA's various provisions. That task was delegated to the MSPB, with later review by the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Forest</span>, 47 F.3d at 410-11 (reviewing the MSPB's interpretation of &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)). Whatever Ayrault's claim under the CSRA, the appropriate forums in which to pursue it were the MSPB, and then, the Federal Circuit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Resolution of the parties' disagreement over the terms of the statute is not necessary. Unless Ayrault is an "employee," she lacks a remedy under the CSRA. Yet a conclusion that Ayrault is an "employee" will only trigger application of statutory provisions depriving us of jurisdiction. Whatever the resolution of the statutory dispute, the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear Ayrault's case, as we do her appeal. Because Ayrault is only asserting a complaint under the CSRA, we REMAND to the district court with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

Ct. 2126</a>, 2126-40 (2012) (Justices Alito, Ginsburg, Kagan dissenting), determining that the availability (and use) of an MSPB to challenge the statutory basis for a termination (a problem with Selective Service registration), precluded a district court action for relief on the same theory presented in the Board appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, certain federal employees may obtain administrative and judicial review of specified adverse employment actions. The question before us is whether the CSRA provides the exclusive avenue to judicial review when a qualifying employee challenges an adverse employment action by arguing that a federal statute is unconstitutional. We hold that it does.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRA "established a comprehensive system for reviewing personnel action taken against federal employees." <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 455 (1988). As relevant here, Subchapter II of Chapter 75 governs review of major adverse actions taken against employees "for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7503(a), 7513(a). Employees entitled to review are those in the "competitive service" and "excepted service" who meet certain requirements regarding probationary periods and years of service. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1). The reviewable agency actions are removal, suspension for more than 14 days, reduction in grade or pay, or furlough for 30 days or less. &#x00A7; 7512.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an employing agency proposes a covered action against a covered employee, the CSRA gives the employee the right to notice, representation by counsel, an opportunity to respond, and a written, reasoned decision from the agency. &#x00A7; 7513(b). If the agency takes final adverse action against the employee, the CSRA gives the employee the right to a hearing and to be represented by an attorney or other representative before the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513(d), 7701(a)(1)-(2). The MSPB is authorized to order relief to prevailing employees, including reinstatement, backpay, and attorney's fees. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1204(a)(2), 7701(g).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee who is dissatisfied with the MSPB's decision is entitled to judicial review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. That court "shall review the record and hold unlawful and set aside any agency action, findings, or conclusions" that are "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law," "obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed," or "unsupported by substantial evidence." &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7703(a)(1), (c). The Federal Circuit has "exclusive jurisdiction" over appeals from a final decision of the MSPB. 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1) (judicial review of an MSPB decision "shall be" in the Federal Circuit).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners are former federal competitive service employees who failed to comply with the Military Selective Service Act, 50 U.S.C. App. &#x00A7; 453. That Act requires male citizens and permanent-resident aliens of the United States between the ages of 18 and 26 to register for the Selective Service. Another federal statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3328 (hereinafter Section 3328), bars from employment by an Executive agency anyone who has knowingly and willfully failed to register. Pursuant to Section 3328, petitioners were discharged (or allegedly constructively discharged) by respondents, their employing agencies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5331"></span>Among petitioners, only Michael Elgin appealed his removal to the MSPB. Elgin argued that Section 3328 is an unconstitutional bill of attainder and unconstitutionally discriminates on the basis of sex when combined with the registration requirement of the Military Selective Service Act. The MSPB referred Elgin's appeal to an administrative law judge (ALJ) for an initial decision. The ALJ dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, concluding that an employee is not entitled to MSPB review of agency action that is based on an absolute statutory bar to employment. The ALJ also held that Elgin's constitutional claims could not "confer jurisdiction" on the MSPB because it "lacks authority to determine the constitutionality of a statute."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Elgin neither petitioned for review by the full MSPB nor appealed to the Federal Circuit. Instead, he joined the other petitioners in filing suit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, raising the same constitutional challenges to Section 3328 and the Military Selective Service Act. Petitioners sought equitable relief in the form of a declaratory judgment that the challenged statutes are unconstitutional, an injunction prohibiting enforcement of Section 3328, reinstatement to their former positions, backpay, benefits, and attorney's fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The District Court rejected respondents' argument that it lacked jurisdiction and denied petitioners' constitutional claims on the merits. <span class="Italic">See Elgin v. United States</span>, 697 F. Supp.2d 187 (Mass. 2010). The District Court held that the CSRA did not preclude it from hearing petitioners' claims, because the MSPB had no authority to determine the constitutionality of a federal statute. Hence, the District Court concluded that it retained jurisdiction under the general grant of federal-question jurisdiction in 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1331. 697 F. Supp.2d, at 194.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit vacated the judgment and remanded with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 641 F. 3d 6 (2011). The Court of Appeals held that challenges to a removal are not exempted from the CSRA review scheme simply because the employee argues that the statute authorizing the removal is unconstitutional. According to the Court of Appeals, the CSRA provides a forum--the Federal Circuit--that may adjudicate the constitutionality of a federal statute, and petitioners "were obliged to use it."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> to decide whether the CSRA precludes district court jurisdiction over petitioners' claims even though they are constitutional claims for equitable relief. <span class="Italic">See</span> 132 S. Ct. 453 (2011). We conclude that it does, and we therefore affirm.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin with the appropriate standard for determining whether a statutory scheme of administrative and judicial review provides the exclusive means of review for constitutional claims. Petitioners argue that even if they may obtain judicial review of their constitutional claims before the Federal Circuit, they are not precluded from pursuing their claims in federal district court. According to petitioners, the general grant of federal-question jurisdiction in 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1331, which gives district courts authority over constitutional claims, remains undisturbed unless Congress explicitly directs otherwise. In support of this argument, petitioners rely on <span class="Italic">Webster v. Doe</span>, 486 U.S. 592, 603 (1988), which held that "where Congress intends to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims[,] its intent to do so must be clear." The <span class="Italic">Webster</span> Court noted that this "heightened showing" was required "to avoid the 'serious constitutional question' that would arise if a federal statute were construed to deny any judicial forum for a colorable constitutional claim." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians</span>, 476 U.S. 667, 681, n.12 (1986)). Petitioners contend that the CSRA does not meet this standard because it does not expressly bar suits in district court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners' argument overlooks a necessary predicate to the application of <span class="Italic">Webster's</span> heightened standard: a statute that purports to "deny any judicial forum for a colorable constitutional claim." 486 U.S., at 603. <span class="Italic">Webster's</span> standard does not apply where Congress simply channels judicial review of a constitutional claim to a particular court. We held as much in <span class="Italic">Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich</span>, 510 U.S. 200 (1994). In that case, we considered whether a statutory scheme of administrative review followed by judicial review in a federal appellate court precluded district court jurisdiction over a plaintiff 's statutory and constitutional claims. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 206. We noted that the plaintiff 's claims could be "meaningfully addressed in the Court of Appeals" and that the case therefore did "not present the 'serious constitutional question' that would arise if an agency statute were construed to preclude all judicial review of a constitutional claim." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 215, and n.20 (quoting <span class="Italic">Bowen</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 681, n.12). Accordingly, we did not require <span class="Italic">Webster's</span> "heightened showing," but instead asked only whether Congress' intent to preclude district court jurisdiction was "'fairly discernible in the statutory scheme.'" 510 U.S., at 207 (quoting <span class="Italic">Block v. Community Nutrition Institute</span>, 467 U.S. 340, 351 (1984)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Like the statute in <span class="Italic">Thunder Basin</span>, the CSRA does not foreclose all judicial review of petitioners' constitutional claims, but merely directs that judicial review shall occur in the Federal Circuit. Moreover, as we explain below, the Federal Circuit is fully capable of providing meaningful review of petitioners' claims. <span class="Italic">See infra</span>, at 12-17. Accordingly, the appropriate inquiry is whether it is "fairly discernible" from the CSRA that Congress intended covered employees appealing covered agency actions to proceed exclusively through the statutory review scheme, even in cases in which the employees raise constitutional challenges to federal statutes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To determine whether it is "fairly discernible" that Congress precluded district court jurisdiction over petitioners' claims, we examine the CSRA's text, structure, and purpose. <span class="Italic">See Thunder Basin</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 207; <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, 484 U.S., at 443.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is not the first time we have addressed the impact of the CSRA's text and structure on the availability of judicial review of a federal employee's challenge to an employment decision. In <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, we considered whether a so-called "nonpreference excepted service employe[e]" could challenge his suspension in the United States Claims Court, even though the CSRA did not then afford him a right to review in the MSPB or the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 440-441, 448. Citing "[t]he comprehensive nature of the CSRA, the attention that it gives throughout to the rights of nonpreference excepted service employees, and the fact that it does not include them in provisions for administrative and judicial review contained in Chapter 75," the Court concluded that "the absence of provision for these employees to obtain judicial review" was a "considered congressional judgment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 448. The Court thus found it "fairly discernible" that Congress intended to preclude all judicial review of Fausto's statutory claims. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 452 (citing <span class="Italic">Block, supra</span>, at 349).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Just as the CSRA's "elaborate" framework, 484 U.S., at 443, demonstrates Congress' intent to entirely foreclose judicial review to employees to whom the CSRA <span class="Italic">denies</span> statutory review, it similarly indicates that extrastatutory review is not available to those employees to whom the CSRA <span class="Italic">grants</span> administrative and judicial review. Indeed, in <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> we expressly assumed that "competitive service employees, who are given review rights by Chapter 75, cannot expand these rights by resort to" judicial review outside of the CSRA scheme. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., at 450, n.3. As <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> explained, the CSRA "prescribes in great detail the protections and remedies applicable to" adverse personnel actions against federal employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 443. For example, Subchapter II of Chapter 75, the portion of the CSRA relevant to petitioners, specifically enumerates the major adverse actions and employee classifications to which the CSRA's procedural protections and review provisions apply. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511, 7512. The subchapter then sets out the procedures due an employee prior to final agency action. &#x00A7; 7513. And, Chapter 77 of the CSRA exhaustively details the system of review before the MSPB and the Federal Circuit. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701, 7703; <span class="Italic">see also Fausto, supra</span>, at 449 (emphasizing that the CSRA's structure evinces "the primacy" of review by the MSPB and the Federal Circuit). Given the painstaking detail with which the CSRA sets out the method for covered employees to obtain review of adverse employment actions, it is fairly discernible that Congress intended to deny such employees an additional avenue of review in district court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners do not dispute that they are employees who suffered adverse actions covered by the foregoing provisions of the CSRA. Nor do they contest that the CSRA's text and structure support implied preclusion of district court jurisdiction, at least as a general matter. Petitioners even acknowledge that the MSPB routinely adjudicates some constitutional claims, such as claims that an agency took adverse employment action in violation of an employee's First or Fourth Amendment rights, and that these claims must be brought within the CSRA scheme. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of Transp</span>., 106 MSPR 59, 78-79 (2007) (applying <span class="Italic">Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty</span>., 391 U.S. 563 (1968), to an employee's claim that he was suspended in retaliation for the exercise of his First Amendment rights); <span class="Italic">Garrison v. Department of Justice</span>, 67 MSPR 154 (1995) (considering whether an order directing an employee to submit to a drug test was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment). Nevertheless, petitioners seek to carve out an exception to CSRA exclusivity for facial or as-applied constitutional challenges to federal statutes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The text and structure of the CSRA, however, provide no support for such an exception. The availability of administrative and judicial review under the CSRA generally turns on the type of civil service employee and adverse employment action at issue. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) (defining "employee"), 7512 (defining "[a]ctions covered"), 7513(d) (providing that "[a]n employee against whom an action is taken under this section is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board"), 7703(a)(1) (providing that "[a]ny employee...adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order or decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board may obtain judicial review of the order or decision" in the Federal Circuit). Nothing in the CSRA's text suggests that its exclusive review scheme is inapplicable simply because a covered employee challenges a covered action on the ground that the statute authorizing that action is unconstitutional. As the Government correctly notes, "[t]he plain language of [the CSRA's] provisions applies to an employee who challenges his removal on the <span id="Page_5332"></span>ground that the statute requiring it is unconstitutional no less than it applies to an employee who challenges his removal on any other ground."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In only one situation does the CSRA expressly exempt a covered employee's appeal of a covered action from Federal Circuit review based on the type of claim at issue. When a covered employee "alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination" prohibited by enumerated federal employment laws, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(B), the CSRA allows the employee to obtain judicial review of an unfavorable MSPB decision by filing a civil action as provided by the applicable employment law. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2). Each of the cross-referenced employment laws authorizes an action in federal district court. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(f); 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(c); &#x00A7; 216(b). Title 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2) demonstrates that Congress knew how to provide alternative forums for judicial review based on the nature of an employee's claim. That Congress declined to include an exemption from Federal Circuit review for challenges to a statute's constitutionality indicates that Congress intended no such exception.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The purpose of the CSRA also supports our conclusion that the statutory review scheme is exclusive, even for employees who bring constitutional challenges to federal statutes. As we have previously explained, the CSRA's "integrated scheme of administrative and judicial review" for aggrieved federal employees was designed to replace an "'outdated patchwork of statutes and rules'" that afforded employees the right to challenge employing agency actions in district courts across the country. <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, 484 U.S., at 444-445. Such widespread judicial review, which included appeals in all of the Federal Courts of Appeals produced "wide variations in the kinds of decisions...issued on the same or similar matters" and a double layer of judicial review that was "wasteful and irrational." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 445 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRA's objective of creating an integrated scheme of review would be seriously undermined if, as petitioners would have it, a covered employee could challenge a covered employment action first in a district court, and then again in one of the courts of appeals, simply by alleging that the statutory authorization for such action is unconstitutional. Such suits would reintroduce the very potential for inconsistent decisionmaking and duplicative judicial review that the CSRA was designed to avoid. Moreover, petitioners' position would create the possibility of parallel litigation regarding the same agency action before the MSPB and a district court. An employee could challenge the constitutionality of the statute authorizing an agency's action in district court, but the MSPB would remain the exclusive forum for other types of challenges to the agency's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners counter that doctrines regarding claim splitting and preclusion would bar parallel suits before the MSPB and the district court. But such doctrines would not invariably eliminate the possibility of simultaneous proceedings, for a tribunal generally has discretion to decide whether to dismiss a suit when a similar suit is pending elsewhere. <span class="Italic">See</span> 18 C. Wright <span class="Italic">et al., Federal Practice and Procedure</span> &#x00A7; 4406 (2d ed. 2002 and Supp. 2011). In any event, petitioners point to nothing in the CSRA to support the odd notion that Congress intended to allow employees to pursue constitutional claims in district court at the cost of forgoing other, potentially meritorious claims before the MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that a jurisdictional rule based on the nature of an employee's constitutional claim would deprive the aggrieved employee, the MSPB, and the district court of clear guidance about the proper forum for the employee's claims at the outset of the case. For example, petitioners contend that facial and as-applied constitutional challenges to statutes may be brought in district court, while other constitutional challenges must be heard by the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See supra</span>, at 8-9; <span class="Italic">infra</span>, at 13, n.5. But, as we explain below, that line is hazy at best and incoherent at worst. <span class="Italic">See ibid</span>. The dissent's approach fares no better. The dissent carves out for district court adjudication only facial constitutional challenges to statutes, but we have previously stated that "the distinction between facial and as-applied challenges is not so well defined that it has some automatic effect or that it must always control the pleadings and disposition in every case involving a constitutional challenge." <span class="Italic">Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm'n</span>, 130 S. Ct. 876, 893 (2010) (slip op., at 14). By contrast, a jurisdictional rule based on the type of employee and adverse agency action at issue does not involve such amorphous distinctions. Accordingly, we conclude that the better interpretation of the CSRA is that its exclusivity does not turn on the constitutional nature of an employee's claim, but rather on the type of the employee and the challenged employment action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners raise three additional factors in arguing that their claims are not the type that Congress intended to be reviewed within the CSRA scheme. Specifically, petitioners invoke our "presum[ption] that Congress does not intend to limit [district court] jurisdiction if 'a finding of preclusion could foreclose all meaningful judicial review'; if the suit is 'wholly collateral to a statute's review provisions'; and if the claims are 'outside the agency's expertise.'" <span class="Italic">Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd</span>., 130 S. Ct. 3138, 3150 (2010) (slip op., at 8) (quoting <span class="Italic">Thunder Basin</span>, 510 U.S., at 212-213). Contrary to petitioners' suggestion, none of those characteristics are present here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, petitioners argue that the CSRA review scheme provides no meaningful review of their claims because the MSPB lacks authority to declare a federal statute unconstitutional. Petitioners are correct that the MSPB has repeatedly refused to pass upon the constitutionality of legislation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Malone v. Department of Justice</span>, 13 MSPB 81, 83 (1983) ("[I]t is well settled that administrative agencies are without authority to determine the constitutionality of statutes"). This Court has also stated that "adjudication of the constitutionality of congressional enactments has generally been thought beyond the jurisdiction of administrative agencies." <span class="Italic">Thunder Basin</span>, 510 U.S., at 215 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;According to petitioners, the MSPB can decide claims that an agency violated an employee's First or Fourth Amendment rights (and those claims consequently must be brought within the CSRA scheme), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 8-9, because such claims allege only that an agency "acted in an unconstitutional manner" and do not challenge the constitutionality of a federal statute either facially or as applied. That distinction is dubious at best. Agencies are created by and act pursuant to statutes. Thus, unless an action is beyond the scope of the agency's statutory authority, an employee's claim that the agency "acted in an unconstitutional manner" will generally be a claim that the statute authorizing the agency action was unconstitutionally applied to him. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty</span>., 391 U.S. 563, 565 (1968) (holding that the statute authorizing a government employee's termination was unconstitutional as applied under the First and Fourteenth Amendments where the employee was fired because of his speech). In any event, the curious line that petitioners draw only highlights the weakness of their position, for it certainly is not "fairly discernible" from the CSRA's text, structure, or purpose that the statutory review scheme is exclusive for so-called "unconstitutional manner" claims but not for facial or as applied constitutional challenges to statutes. <span class="Italic">See supra</span>, at 7-11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not, and do not, decide whether the MSPB's view of its power is correct, or whether the oft-stated principle that agencies cannot declare a statute unconstitutional is truly a matter of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See ibid</span>. (describing this rule as "not mandatory"). In <span class="Italic">Thunder Basin</span>, we held that Congress' intent to preclude district court jurisdiction was fairly discernible in the statutory scheme "[e]ven if " the administrative body could not decide the constitutionality of a federal law. <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. That issue, we reasoned, could be "meaningfully addressed in the Court of Appeals" that Congress had authorized to conduct judicial review. <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. Likewise, the CSRA provides review in the Federal Circuit, an Article III court fully competent to adjudicate petitioners' claims that Section 3328 and the Military Selective Service Act's registration requirement are unconstitutional.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners insist, however, that the Federal Circuit cannot decide their constitutional claims either. Emphasizing the Federal Circuit's holdings that its jurisdiction over employee appeals is coextensive with the MSPB's jurisdiction, petitioners argue that the Federal Circuit likewise lacks jurisdiction to decide their challenge to the constitutionality of a federal statute. Petitioners are incorrect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have explained, the CSRA makes MSPB jurisdiction over an appeal dependent only on the nature of the employee and the employment action at issue. <span class="Italic">See supra</span>, at 1-2, 8-9; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.3(a) (stating that "[t]he Board has jurisdiction over appeals from agency actions" and enumerating covered actions); <span class="Italic">Todd v. Merit Systems Protection Bd</span>., 55 F. 3d 1574, 1576 (CA Fed. 1995) (explaining that the employee "has the burden of establishing that she and the action she seeks to appeal [are] within the [MSPB's] jurisdiction"). Accordingly, as the cases cited by petitioners demonstrate, the Federal Circuit has questioned its jurisdiction when an employee appeals from a type of adverse action over which the MSPB lacked jurisdiction. But the Federal Circuit has never held, in an appeal from agency action within the MSPB's jurisdiction, that its authority to decide particular legal questions is derivative of the MSPB's authority. To the contrary, in <span class="Italic">Briggs v. MSPB</span>, 331 F. 3d 1307, 1312-1313 (2003), the Federal Circuit concluded that it could determine the constitutionality of a statute upon which an employee's removal was based, notwithstanding the MSPB's professed lack of authority to decide the question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners next contend that even if the Federal Circuit could consider their claims in the first instance, resolution of the claims requires a factual record that neither the MSPB (because it lacks authority to decide the legal question) nor the Federal Circuit (because it is an appellate court) can create. To the contrary, we think the CSRA review scheme fully accommodates an employee's potential need to establish facts relevant to his constitutional challenge to a federal statute. Even without factfinding capabilities, the Federal Circuit may take judicial notice of facts relevant to the constitutional question. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Rothe Development <span id="Page_5333"></span>Corp. v. Department of Defense</span>, 545 F. 3d 1023, 1045-1046 (CA Fed. 2008) (judicially noticing facts relevant to equal protection challenge). And, if resolution of a constitutional claim requires the development of facts beyond those that the Federal Circuit may judicially notice, the CSRA empowers the MSPB to take evidence and find facts for Federal Circuit review. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1204(b)(1)-(2) (providing that the MSPB may administer oaths, examine witnesses, take depositions, issue interrogatories, subpoena testimony and documents, and otherwise receive evidence when a covered employee appeals a covered adverse employment action). Unlike petitioners, we see nothing extraordinary in a statutory scheme that vests reviewable factfinding authority in a non-Article III entity that has jurisdiction over an action but cannot finally decide the legal question to which the facts pertain. Congress has authorized magistrate judges, for example, to conduct evidentiary hearings and make findings of fact relevant to dispositive pretrial motions, although they are powerless to issue a final ruling on such motions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 636(b)(1)(A)-(B); <span class="Italic">United States v. Raddatz</span>, 447 U.S. 667, 673 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners nonetheless insist that the MSPB will never reach the factfinding stage in an appeal challenging the constitutionality of a federal statute, pointing to the ALJ's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction in petitioner Elgin's case. Again, petitioners are incorrect. When a covered employee appeals a covered adverse action, the CSRA grants the MSPB jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">See supra</span>, at 14. If the employee attacks the adverse action on the ground that a statute is unconstitutional, the MSPB may determine that it lacks authority to decide that particular issue; but absent another infirmity in the adverse action, the MSPB will affirm the employing agency's decision rather than dismiss the appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Briggs, supra</span>, at 1311. The Federal Circuit can then review the MSPB decision, including any factual record developed by the MSPB in the course of its decision on the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to petitioners' suggestion, Elgin's case does not illustrate that the MSPB will invariably dismiss an appeal challenging the constitutionality of a federal statute before reaching the factfinding stage. The ALJ dismissed Elgin's case on the threshold jurisdictional ground that he was not an "employee" with a right to appeal to the MSPB because his employment was absolutely barred by statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> App. to Pet. for Cert. 100a-101a. The Government conceded before the First Circuit that this jurisdictional argument was incorrect, <span class="Italic">see</span> Brief for United States 10, and the Court of Appeals agreed, <span class="Italic">see</span> 641 F. 3d, at 10-11. The parties do not raise that issue here, and we do not address it. What matters for present purposes is that the particular circumstances of Elgin's case do not demonstrate that the MSPB will dismiss an appeal that is otherwise within its jurisdiction merely because it lacks the authority to decide a particular claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the CSRA grants the MSPB and the Federal Circuit jurisdiction over petitioners' appeal because they are covered employees challenging a covered adverse employment action. Within the CSRA review scheme, the Federal Circuit has authority to consider and decide petitioners' constitutional claims. To the extent such challenges require factual development, the CSRA equips the MSPB with tools to create the necessary record. Thus, petitioners' constitutional claims can receive meaningful review within the CSRA scheme.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners next contend that the CSRA does not preclude district court jurisdiction over their claims because they are "wholly collateral" to the CSRA scheme. According to petitioners, their bill-of-attainder and sex discrimination claims "have nothing to do with the types of day-today personnel actions adjudicated by the MSPB," Brief for Petitioners 29, and petitioners "are not seeking the CSRA's 'protections and remedies.'" We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As evidenced by their district court complaint, petitioners' constitutional claims are the vehicle by which they seek to reverse the removal decisions, to return to federal employment, and to receive the compensation they would have earned but for the adverse employment action. A challenge to removal is precisely the type of personnel action regularly adjudicated by the MSPB and the Federal Circuit within the CSRA scheme. Likewise, reinstatement, backpay, and attorney's fees are precisely the kinds of relief that the CSRA empowers the MSPB and the Federal Circuit to provide. <span class="Italic">See supra</span>, at 2; <span class="Italic">see also Heckler v. Ringer</span>, 466 U.S. 602, 614 (1984) (holding that plaintiffs' claims were not wholly collateral to a statutory scheme of administrative and judicial review of Medicare payment decisions, where plaintiffs' constitutional and statutory challenge to an agency's procedure for reaching payment decisions was "at bottom" an attempt to reverse the agency's decision to deny payment). Far from a suit wholly collateral to the CSRA scheme, the case before us is a challenge to CSRA-covered employment action brought by CSRA-covered employees requesting relief that the CSRA routinely affords.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relatedly, petitioners argue that their constitutional claims are not the sort that Congress intended to channel through the MSPB because they are outside the MSPB's expertise. But petitioners overlook the many threshold questions that may accompany a constitutional claim and to which the MSPB can apply its expertise. Of particular relevance here, preliminary questions unique to the employment context may obviate the need to address the constitutional challenge. For example, petitioner Henry Tucker asserts that his resignation amounted to a constructive discharge. That issue falls squarely within the MSPB's expertise, and its resolution against Tucker would avoid the need to reach his constitutional claims. In addition, the challenged statute may be one that the MSPB regularly construes, and its statutory interpretation could alleviate constitutional concerns. Or, an employee's appeal may involve other statutory or constitutional claims that the MSPB routinely considers, in addition to a constitutional challenge to a federal statute. The MSPB's resolution of those claims in the employee's favor might fully dispose of the case. Thus, because the MSPB's expertise can otherwise be "brought to bear" on employee appeals that challenge the constitutionality of a statute, we see no reason to conclude that Congress intended to exempt such claims from exclusive review before the MSPB and the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">See Thunder Basin</span>, 510 U.S., at 214-215 (concluding that, where administrative Commission's expertise "could be brought to bear" on appeal, Commission's exclusive review of alleged statutory violation was appropriate despite its lack of expertise in interpreting a particular statute (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).</p>
