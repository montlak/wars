<p class="Body-Text">The Board exercises adverse action appellate jurisdiction over removals due to physical inability to perform work--removals lacking personal fault or misconduct. Unless there is some accommodative responsibility of the agency, removal for physical disability promotes service efficiency. <span class="Italic">D'Leo v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 53 MSPR 44, 51 (1992). A clear and direct relationship exists between the grounds for the action and the appellant's ability to accomplish his duties satisfactorily. <span class="Italic">Woodhouse v. USPS</span>, 29 MSPR 98, 100 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">McPherson v. USPS</span>, 48 MSPR 624, 632-34 (1991) (citing <span class="Italic">Jackson v. USPS</span>, 666 F.2d 258 (5th Cir. 1982) (removing an employee who is physically incapable of performing position duties promotes service efficiency). The source of the physical inability to work is immaterial, i.e., the appellant is no less subject to removal because his injury warrants workmen's compensation. <span class="Italic">Black v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 272, 274 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. VA</span>, 101 MSPR 366, 370 &#x00B6; 11, 2006 MSPB 56 (2006) (as to a removal based upon inability to perform the duties of a position, the cause of the appellant's medical condition is not relevant to the determination of whether the agency proved the charge).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The burden of proof in physical impairment cases was summarized, <span class="Italic">Sebald v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 32 MSPR 164, 165 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that when an employee is removed for physical <span id="Page_2201"></span>inability to perform, there must be a clear and direct relationship between the employee's ability to accomplish his or her duties satisfactorily or some other legitimate government interest promoting the efficiency of the service.... In addition, the Board has held that an agency cannot rely solely on the existence of a disabling condition or on speculation that it will affect the employee's ability to perform.... Instead, the Board has found, a nexus must be established between the medical condition and observed deficiencies in work performance or employee conduct or a high probability of hazard....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The burden of proof in an appeal involving removal of an employee for physical inability to perform a job was explored in <span class="Italic">Marshall-Carter v. VA</span>, 94 MSPR 518 (2003). The Board stated the elements of the charge of physical inability to perform: a nexus between the employee's medical condition and observed deficiencies in her performance or conduct, or a high probability, given the nature of the work involved, that her condition may result in injury to herself or others. The ability of the agency to place the appellant in a vacant position through reassignment or demotion goes to mitigation of the removal penalty, and it is the appellant's burden to demonstrate the existence of a suitable position. The obligation of the agency to consider the appellant for assignment to another position as an accommodation for a disability arises only if the appellant pleads and proves a disability discrimination defense. Although the Board did not explain the practical distinction between an analysis of reassignment or demotion under an approach involving mitigation rather than disability accommodation, when an agency makes a mitigation determination, its decision is given deference unless the appellant can demonstrate that the decision is unreasonable; when an agency makes an accommodation decision by failing to reassign an employee to an arguably available position, the agency has the burden of demonstrating that the reassignment would constitute an undue burden upon its operations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board provided a detailed analysis of the law and the evidence in <span class="Italic">Marshall-Carter</span>, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-15:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish a charge of physical inability to perform, an agency is required to prove a nexus between the employee's medical condition and observed deficiencies in her performance or conduct, or a high probability, given the nature of the work involved, that her condition may result in injury to herself or others. <span class="Italic">See Yates v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 70 M.S.P.R. 172, 176 (1996). In finding that the agency established that the appellant was unable to perform the duties of her assigned position, the administrative judge cited the testimony of head nurse, Julie M. Renfrew, who described the surgical schedule at the hospital where the appellant worked. Renfrew testified that the surgical staff was rotated through overlapping shifts for coverage of seven to nine operating rooms on a daily basis, and that technicians, such as the appellant, could be called upon to perform duties in any of the operating rooms, including rooms dedicated to orthopedic cases which could require the staff to wear the helmet the appellant was physically incapable of wearing. Renfrew also testified that technicians must be able to wear the helmets when they are "on call" in the event that they are called in to the hospital to assist in an emergency orthopedic surgery that would require "clean air" procedures. The administrative judge also noted that the requirement for the use of the helmet was contained in the appellant's position description and was a matter of hospital policy. The administrative judge also noted that, although the appellant requested that the agency accommodate her medical restriction by exempting her from "clean air" cases, Renfrew testified that such an arrangement was not feasible because the appellant would be unable to take her turn "on call" and disruption of the scheduling pattern would cause serious personnel and morale problems. Based on this evidence, the administrative judge found that the duty restriction imposed by Dr. Klein, which provided that the appellant was unable to wear the headgear required in "clean air" cases, was inconsistent with the safe and efficient performance of the core duties of the appellant's position as an operating room technologist, and he therefore concluded that the agency had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the appellant was unable to perform the duties of her position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not contested the administrative judge's conclusion that she was unable to perform the full range of duties of her position, and we discern no basis for overturning the administrative judge's findings in this regard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the agency established a nexus between the appellant's medical condition and observed deficiencies in the appellant's performance or conduct, namely, her inability to perform her duties in cases requiring "clean air" procedures, and affirm the administrative judge's conclusion that the agency established that the appellant was physically unable to perform the duties of her position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, to the extent that the administrative judge stated that the agency was also required to prove that it could not reassign the appellant to a vacant position for which she was qualified in order to sustain its charge, we disagree. The case which the administrative judge cited as support for this proposition, <span class="Italic">Trammell v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. 79 (1993), involved an appellant who raised the affirmative defense of disability discrimination. Although the Board stated in <span class="Italic">Trammell</span> that it found that the appellant's removal was appropriate and promoted the efficiency of the service because the appellant could not perform the essential functions of her position with or without reasonable accommodation and the agency had no vacant positions to which it could assign her, <span class="Italic">Trammell,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. at 90, the Board did not state that the agency was required to establish that there were no vacant positions to which it could reassign the appellant in order to sustain the charge of physical inability to perform. Instead, the Board in <span class="Italic">Trammell</span> considered the agency's ability to reassign the appellant only when adjudicating the appellant's claim of disability discrimination, an affirmative defense which the appellant has the burden of raising and proving<span class="Italic">. Trammell,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. at 84-88; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(iii) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(C)] (the appellant has the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, with respect to affirmative defenses). In <span class="Italic">Jackson v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 46, 53 (1998), the Board described the appellant's burden of proof with respect to the affirmative defense of disability discrimination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In a disability discrimination case where the appellant seeks some form of accommodation, her <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case consists of a showing that she is a disabled person, and that the action appealed was based on her disability, and, to the extent possible, she must articulate a reasonable accommodation under which she believes she could perform the essential duties of her position or of a vacant funded position to which she could be reassigned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board noted that the agency had an obligation under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(g) to identify vacant funded positions in the same commuting area, at or below the employee's current grade or level, to which a disabled employee could be reassigned, it stated that an agency's failure to meet this obligation "does not relieve the appellant of her burden of ultimately showing, before the Board, that such positions existed and were available." <span class="Italic">Jackson,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. at 54.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant did not raise disability discrimination as an affirmative defense. Therefore, whether the agency was able to reasonably accommodate the appellant's medical condition by reassigning her to a vacant position for which she was qualified was not at issue in this appeal, at least with respect to the agency's burden of proving its charge. Therefore, upon finding that the agency established that the appellant's medical condition prevented her from being able to safely and efficiently perform the core duties of her position, the administrative judge should have sustained the agency's charge and found that the agency's action was taken for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See Woodhouse v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 29 M.S.P.R. 98, 100 (1985) (where an appellant was unable to perform the duties of his position because of a physical disability, the Board found that the appellant's removal promoted the efficiency of the service because a clear and direct relationship existed between the grounds for the action and the appellant's ability to accomplish his duties satisfactorily); <span class="Italic">Owens v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 8 M.S.P.R. 580, 583-84 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the evidence had established that the appellant was capable of performing the duties of a vacant lower-graded position to which she could have been reassigned, the administrative judge could have properly considered this fact in determining whether the agency-imposed penalty of removal, as opposed to reassignment to a position within the appellant's medical restrictions, fell within the tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 306 (1981) (in determining the appropriateness of a penalty, the Board considers, <span class="Italic">inter alia,</span> the adequacy and effectiveness of alternative sanctions); <span class="Italic">see also Brown v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 10 M.S.P.R. 411, 414 (1982) (in affirming an appellant's reduction in grade to a less strenuous position based on a charge of physical inability to perform, the Board noted that the agency properly considered the appellant's limitations and determined that the appellant met the physical requirements of the lower-graded position to which the agency reassigned him). However, the evidence of record indicates that the appellant did not cooperate in the agency's attempts to determine the extent of her physical limitations. For example, as set forth in the background section, the appellant failed to acknowledge the agency's request for medical documentation concerning her condition, and she refused to sign a release which would have authorized Dr. Klein to release medical information concerning the appellant to the agency regarding the extent of the appellant's physical limitations. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-5, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. In light of the appellant's apparent unwillingness to cooperate with the agency in its attempts to determine the extent of her physical limitations, we do not find that the agency abused its discretion when considering the reasonableness of the penalty by failing to consider reassignment to positions for which the appellant may not have been physically qualified as an alternative to removal. Accordingly, we find that, despite the appellant's length of service, the penalty of removal did not exceed the tolerable limits of reasonableness in this case. <span class="Italic">Cf. Jackson,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. at 54 (the Board sustained a removal based on physical inability to perform <span id="Page_2202"></span>where the appellant failed to identify any vacant funded position at or below her grade level the duties of which she could perform). Because we have determined that the agency sustained its charge, established that its actions was taken for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service, and established the reasonableness of the penalty imposed, we REVERSE the initial decision and AFFIRM the agency action.</p>

VA</span>, AT-0752-12-0171-I-2 (NP 9/23/2013) ("Moreover, because the appellant waived her disability discrimination claim, whether the agency was able to accommodate her medical condition by reassignment to a vacant position for which she was qualified was not at issue with respect to the substantive charge in the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> [<span class="Italic">Marshall-Carter v. VA</span>, 94 MSPR 518, &#x00B6; 13]. Nevertheless, if the evidence had established that the appellant was capable of performing the duties of a vacant lower-graded position to which she could have been reassigned, the administrative judge could have properly considered this fact in determining whether the agency-imposed penalty of removal, as opposed to reassignment to a position within the appellant's medical restrictions, fell within the tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Douglas v.

However, the appellant identified no such position. Further, the administrative judge noted the appellant's admission that there was no reasonable accommodation that would have allowed her to perform the essential functions of her position at the time of her removal.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency improperly reassigns an individual into a job beyond the appellant's physical capability, then the disability separation may be canceled on appeal and the appellant returned to his original job. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bonggat v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 56 MSPR 402, 413 (1993) (reassignment a reprisal; overturning separation for disability). If the appellant is a qualified disabled employee, and the agency can accommodate his needs without undue burden, e.g., a restructured schedule, then his removal for physical inability to perform the job with accommodation will be reversed as discriminatory. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Roberts v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 5 MSPR 387, 389, 5 MSPB 403 (1981) (sheet metal worker, suffering from rhinitis, required a restructured work schedule).

Cl. 1973) (noting a line of authority that removal for cause denotes disciplinary action, while an involuntary retirement is viewed as a nondisciplinary type of action). If the agency removes an employee for a misconduct charge, e.g., absence without leave, but could have removed the employee for inability to perform his or her position as a result of a medical condition, the Board will not revisit the characterization of the adverse action. According to <span class="Italic">Carr v. DOD</span>, 61 MSPR 172, 176 (1994), the Board cannot adjudicate an appeal on the basis of a charge that was not brought.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board examines the essential duties of a position and compares them with the appellant's restrictions. It is not a defense to the charge of physical inability to do the job that other individuals in similar positions do not perform all the duties called for in the position description. The Board reasons that the duties described in the position description encompass those duties that an incumbent must be able to perform. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 53 MSPR 537, 540 (1992). The Board evaluates the medical evidence.

<p class="Body-Text">In a removal for physical inability to perform, at issue will be whether the employee was able to perform the functions of his position and whether the agency considered disability accommodation for the appellant's inability to perform. <span class="Italic">Schoening v.

<p class="Body-Text">The existence of a disabling condition alone is not sufficient to warrant discharge: there must be a connection to job performance. The employee cannot be fired because he cannot meet OPM physical qualifications standards that apply only to applicants. <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 22 MSPR 255, 256-57 (1984). <span class="Italic">Spencer v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 73 MSPR 15, 21-24 (1997), determined that an employee was improperly removed, and that his removal constituted disability discrimination, when the employee's impairment was regarded by the agency as disabling but did not impede the employee's ability to perform his job:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To remove an employee for his physical inability to perform the duties of his position, the agency must establish a nexus between his medical condition and observed deficiencies in his performance or conduct, or a high probability of hazard when his condition may result in injury to himself or others because of the kind of work he does<span class="Italic">. See Yates v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 70 MSPR 172, 176 (1996); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 MSPR 255, 257 (1984). Here, the agency did not specify whether it was proposing the appellant's removal based on the deficient performance or the high probability of hazard test. We find, however, that the agency has not established that the appellant was physically unable to perform the duties of his position under either test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency has not claimed that there are any deficiencies in the appellant's performance as a result of his sleep apnea condition. Moreover, the appellant's performance appraisals for the period of March 7, 1994 through June 30, 1995, indicate that the appellant received a "fully successful" rating in all of the critical elements of his Supply Clerk position during that period. These satisfactory performance appraisals, we find, provide sufficient evidence to rebut the agency's claim that the appellant was unable to perform the duties of his position. As such, the agency has not met its burden of proving that the appellant was physically unable to perform his duties under the deficient performance test<span class="Italic">. See Yates</span>, 70 MSPR at 176; <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 22 MSPR at 257.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor has the agency established that the appellant is physically unable to perform the duties of his Supply Clerk position under the second test--e.g., that there is a high probability of hazard if he were to continue working in that position. The administrative judge found that, notwithstanding the fact that his performance had been satisfactory, the appellant's condition was inherently dangerous, and he found, therefore, that the agency had met its burden under the probability of hazard test. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's ability to perform his full duties, with no apparent difficulty, is a significant factor in determining whether there is a high probability of hazard in his continued employment<span class="Italic">. See Yates</span>, 70 MSPR at 176-78 (finding that the employee's continued employment as a Letter Carrier did not result in a high probability of hazard to himself or others where he successfully performed the full duties of that position for the 5 months preceding his removal despite his knee condition and his doctors did not recommend that he be barred from employment in that position). Here, the appellant, as discussed above, successfully performed all of the duties of his Supply Clerk position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, while the administrative judge found that sleeping on duty was inherently dangerous, the record does not contain sufficient evidence that the appellant did in fact sleep on duty. In her October 31, 1994 and December 19, 1994 memoranda, Lynch claimed that the appellant was still being observed sleeping on duty. In addition, Mims noted that he had seen the appellant take a nap on one unspecified occasion. Other than these general references to sleeping on duty, however, the agency has not identified any specific incidents when the appellant was observed sleeping on duty. Nor has the agency even alleged that the appellant was ever observed sleeping on duty after the October 31, 1994 and December 19, 1994 memoranda were issued. We find, therefore, that the agency has not shown that the appellant's condition of obstructive sleep apnea caused him to sleep while on duty, or otherwise interfered with the safe performance of his duties. Thus, even assuming that sleeping while on duty is inherently dangerous, we cannot agree with the administrative judge's finding that this was the case here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we note that while Dr. Tucker opined in his December 13, 1994 letter that the appellant's sleep apnea "contributes to his problems of daytime sleeping," and "can indeed be a hazard to his health as well as his occupational responsibilities," he did not support this opinion with any explanations or references to the specific duties of the appellant's <span id="Page_2203"></span>Supply Clerk position. We therefore find that Dr. Tucker's opinion in this regard does not establish that the appellant's continued employment as a Supply Clerk would result in a high probability of hazard<span class="Italic">. See Royster v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 68 MSPR 655, 659 (1995) (finding unpersuasive a medical report that did not show familiarity with the employee's job duties and did not explain how her medical condition prevented her from performing those duties), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 91 F.3d 170 (Fed. Cir.) (Table), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, No. 96-6123 (U.S. Nov. 12, 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, there is no indication in the record that Dr. Tucker, or any other health care provider, ever thought it was necessary to bar the appellant from employment in his Supply Clerk position. <span class="Italic">See Yates</span>, 7 MSPR at 177-78. Dr. Tucker's suggested medical restrictions, while recommending in part a total restriction against working around moving vehicles, were qualified by the addition of the phrase, "if possible." Moreover, as indicated by the position description, a GS-5 Supply Clerk, who works primarily in an office environment, has only limited exposure to moving vehicles.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under all of these circumstances, we find that the agency has not met its burden of proving the existence of either a nexus between the appellant's sleep apnea and observed deficiencies in his performance or conduct, or a high probability of hazard from his continued employment as a Supply Clerk<span class="Italic">. See Yates</span>, 70 MSPR at 176-78. We therefore do not sustain the agency's removal action based on the charge of inability to perform the duties of his position.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In law as well as logic, there must be a clear and direct relationship demonstrated between the articulated grounds for an adverse personnel action and either the employee's ability to accomplish his or her duties satisfactorily or some other legitimate governmental interest promoting the "efficiency of the service." Absent a nexus between the "cause" asserted--here the appellant's physical disability--and "promotion of the efficiency of the service," the courts have consistently held that the action must be condemned as arbitrary and capricious for want of a discernible rational basis. It is also well settled that a physical disability may warrant the agency taking an adverse action against an employee. However, in undertaking such medical disability proceedings, an agency must not rely solely upon a showing that the employee has a disabling condition, even when the agency has obtained a medical opinion of incapacity. The agency must establish a link between the medical conclusion and observed deficiencies in work performance or employee behavior or a <span class="Italic">high probability of hazard</span> when the disabling condition may result in injury to the employee or others because of the kind of work the employee does.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">If the medical evidence demonstrates physical inability to perform the job safely, removal will be sustained. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Neal v. TVA</span>, 28 MSPR 284, 286 (1985) (structural iron worker was unable to work at heights above 10 feet). Under <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, the speculative opinion by an agency medical officer (there had been no fitness exam) that an appellant's medical condition could be worsened by his duties was not sufficient to establish that the condition created a high probability of risk warranting removal. The Board cited <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of Army</span>, 9 MSPR 575, 577, 9 MSPB 200 (1982), in support of its analysis in <span class="Italic">Smith</span>. Under <span class="Italic">White</span>, the agency may not rely solely on a showing that the employee has a disabling condition. The agency must establish a nexus between the medical condition and observed deficiencies in work performance or employee conduct, or a high probability of hazard when the condition may result in injury to the employee or others because of the kind of work the employee does. To determine the appellant's true medical condition, the Board examines all the medical evidence of record, not just a single report that in isolation suggests a conclusion contrary to the rest of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of Army</span>, 46 MSPR 63, 67-68 (1990). The opinion of a physician may be discounted if it is not based on observation of the work site, independent diagnostic tests, clinical evaluation based on a physical examination, the relation of the appellant's medical condition to the specific duties of his position, and consideration of whether modifications to the job could accommodate the disability. <span class="Italic">Schrodt v.
