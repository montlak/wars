<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-196"><span class="space">c.</span> Itemization of Time</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Time should be itemized. Even if it is apparent that some time was spent, it will not be awarded unless it is claimed and documented. <span class="Italic">McGovern v. EEOC</span>, 42 MSPR 399, 413-14 (1989) (reversing an award of fees for time spent preparing the fee petition when the time was not documented and the fee was not specifically claimed). If the information is not supplied with the motion, the AJ should require its submission. An hourly breakdown of work performed must be submitted; it is insufficient to list the hours spent each month and the type of services performed during those months. <span class="Italic">Nealen v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 25 MSPR 70, 73 (1984); <span class="Italic">Hanson v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 23 MSPR 396, 402-03 (1984) (insufficient to state a figure based on the total hours and hourly rate without an hourly breakdown; remanding to permit the appellant to present time records). The itemization should be comprehensible. The Board noted in <span class="Italic">Key v. USPS</span>, 33 MSPR 142, 153 (1987), that counsel's documentation of time spent on an appeal is adequate when the "itemized bill sufficiently identifies the client, the attorney performing the task, the nature of the work performed, and the amount of time expended." But as to 26.5 hours claimed as time spent on telephone calls, there should have been a showing of who was called and what was discussed. <span class="Italic">Hodnick v. FMCS</span>, 8 MSPR 508, 511 (1981). The bottom line is that the documentation showing how time was spent and how it is to be charged against the government should show how specific activities were necessary for the successful prosecution of a case; the same is true as to costs. <span class="Italic">Ford v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 48 MSPR 298, 304 (1991) ("[t]he fee submission contains no indication of who the appellant's attorney spoke with during these telephone calls, or any other indication that these calls were related to the appellant's appeal[.] ").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Appellants' counsel are urged to keep timesheets from the beginning of the case on a daily basis. The practice may be advisable for agency counsel as well. If the agency is to challenge the reasonableness of a fee claimed by the appellant's lawyer, the agency would do well to be able to show the time it invested in the appeal. Keep the entries legible. Give detail: what a conference was about and who participated; what research was performed and the nature of correspondence or email traffic sent or reviewed. A computerized timekeeping program can be a real aid in the maintenance and production of time records.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Wilson v. DHHS</span>, 834 F.2d 1011, 1012 (Fed. Cir. 1987), counsel challenged the Board's reduction of an associate's time, determined by the AJ (with no objection by the agency) to be inadequately described. The associate's time was entered as "research" or as "prepare brief," general descriptions of his work on the case. The government's briefs in the <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> litigation did not really suggest that any legal standard required greater detail; the government's argument was that the court should defer to the Board's judgment. The court disagreed with that approach:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official deleted the work-time of the associate on the grounds that...his time-sheets were inadequate....&#8197;These findings are not supported by substantial evidence. As they stand, the associate's time-sheets, although not fulsome or detailed, showed the time he spent and the general matters he worked on. They are comparable to many other time-sheets kept by attorneys in private practice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wilson</span> observed that had the AJ wanted more information about the investment of time, she could have asked for it. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Logan v. DHUD</span>, 23 MSPR 345, 348 (1984) (AJ properly reduced 29 hours claimed for "research," not further described). As a practical matter, most counsel provide general descriptions of time. It takes too much time to turn a simple exercise in billing into a complex production report. The greater the detail, the less likely there will be a dispute or question about what the attorney has done with time that he seeks to charge to the government. Some common entries, e.g., "review file," deserve greater explanation so that it can be understood why the file was being reviewed. Entries concerning conversations with clients or others should state the purpose of the conversation. The same is true as to correspondence and email. A few moments of attention to timekeeping may save hours of later litigation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For an example of the type of fee motion that will be denied for lack of detail, consider <span class="Italic">Owen v. United States</span>, 861 F.2d 1273 (Fed. Cir. 1988), denying an EAJA petition that apparently included several substantive entries: an entry showing a claim for "administrative support cost" (150 hours at $35 per hour), another entry for "senior counsel, research and factual investigation and brief preparation" (140 hours at $125 per hour), and "associate counsel, research and preparation of brief and submission of costs" (145 hours at $100 per hour). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Community Heating &#x0026; Plumbing v. Garrett</span>, 2 F.3d 1143, 1146 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (an EAJA petition: "Sufficient documentation requires 'contemporaneous records of exact time spent on the case, by whom, their status and usual billing rates, as well as a breakdown of expenses such as the amounts spent copying documents, telephone bills, mail costs and other expenditures related to the case.'" (quoting <span class="Italic">Naporano Iron &#x0026; Metal Co. v. U.S.</span>, 825 F.2d 403, 404)). But time need not be itemized on a minute-by-minute basis. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rumsey v. DOJ</span>, 123 MSPR 502, 515 &#x00B6; 24, 2016 MSPB 28 (2016) ("Mr. Burka did not provide a minute-by-minute breakdown of what he specifically discussed during their telephone calls, which admittedly would be difficult to do.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For an example of what will be allowed without extensive litigation, consider <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 430, 435 n.5 (1990), approving time entries: "Review of employment records of Stephen Kelly," "Review of regulations re: police standards of conduct," "Review of shipyard instructions," and "Review and investigation of Stephen Kelly's prior police experience." Under <span class="Italic">Kelly</span>, the Board seems inclined to accept time charges for phone conversations if the time entries identify the person with whom counsel spoke and the nature of the conversation. As to a number of hours billed under the heading of conferences with the client, in <span class="Italic">Harris v. USDA</span>, 48 MSPR 189, 196-97 (1991), the attorney provided some explanation of elements of his work, and the Board, considering the explanation on PFR (after the AJ declined to consider the material when it was received following the close of the record), concluded the explanations were acceptable:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant's counsel explained...that he reviewed the appellant's files in an attempt to document by date what was discussed at each conference with the appellant or his witnesses....&#8197;Counsel further noted that he entered his time on his log sheets, following each action taken, and that, while some memos were dated, he did not date each and every memorandum of each conference. He further explained that his <span id="Page_4730"></span>conferences with the appellant were often working conferences during which he drafted pleadings, responses, and letters while the appellant sat in his office to insure the accuracy of the documents being prepared. The appellant's counsel also makes clear...that the total hours claimed for "conferences with client" were directly related to work on the appellant's appeal before the Board....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...While the appellant's counsel could not provide specific information concerning the actual task he performed during each and every hour claimed for "conference with client," we find his general representations of what types of tasks were performed during these hours, in conjunction with his assertion that every hour claimed was spent on work performed directly relating to the appellant's appeal, as well as our detailed review of the record with regard to his efforts in this appeal, is sufficient to justify the additional 32 hours and 55 minutes claimed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Time entries may be too abbreviated, and counsel may not exclude information concerning time claimed on the basis of attorney-client or similar privilege (counsel strikes a balance in entering time to show what was done without disclosing privileged information), <span class="Italic">Marquiz v. DOD</span>, SF-4324-15-0099-A-1 (NP 2/15/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The descriptions of his work consist of cursory notes such as "legal research" and "[c]omm w client" or "[c]omm w consultant." They do not contain any additional details that could bolster the claim of reasonableness, such as the topics researched, the type of consultant(s) used, why all the communication with the client was necessary for a purely legal question, or even if all of that communication was with the appellant in this appeal, rather than a mix of the appellant and others that he hoped to include in his proposed class action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...He has not explained, for example, how attorney-client privilege prevents him from disclosing even the most basic information about his billing, such as a general accounting for why more than 20 hours for client communication was reasonable in this case, which involved a purely legal question and no factual dispute of significance. <span class="Italic">See generally Grimes v. Department of the Navy</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 7, &#x00B6; 6 (2005) (recognizing that attorney-client privilege is intended "to encourage full and frank communications between attorneys and their clients") (quoting <span class="Italic">Upjohn Co. v. United States</span>, 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981)). He has not explained how work product privilege prevents him from disclosing a general accounting of who he consulted with or what types of legal research he conducted....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency is to successfully object to the time entries of appellant's counsel, the agency's objections should be specific, <span class="Italic">Heath v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 66 MSPR 101, 106-07 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e find that the documentation of time spent on the appeal is adequate, because Ms. Davis's itemized bill sufficiently identifies the client, the attorney performing the task, the nature of the work performed, and the amount of time expended. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Key v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 33 MSPR 142, 153 (1987). Although the agency contends that the documentation should have been more detailed, it has not presented a specific basis upon which to question Ms. Davis's billing practices or the propriety of the numbers billed. We therefore reject its assertion that the documentation is insufficient to support the number of hours found compensable by the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">See Key</span>, 33 MSPR at 153-54; <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Coast Guard</span>, 28 MSPR 539, 555 (1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If some of counsel's fees claims are inadequately documented or supported, the Board still must determine if some time is compensable when the prevailing party test is met, <span class="Italic">Rumsey v. DOJ</span>, 866 F.3d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2017):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We have held that "[w]here documentation is inadequate, the district court is not relieved of its obligation to award a reasonable fee." <span class="Italic">Slimfold Mfg. Co. v. Kinkead Indus., Inc</span>., 932 F.2d 1453, 1459 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (quoting <span class="Italic">Norman v. Hous. Auth</span>., 836 F.2d 1292, 1303 (11th Cir. 1988)). In <span class="Italic">Slimfold</span>, the district court determined that the case was exceptional for the purposes of attorney's fees under 35 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 285 but found the patentee's showing to be deficient. We reversed one of the infringement findings on appeal and remanded for reconsideration of &#x00A7; 285. We noted that, as here, the "fee application certainly had its flaws, [but] it is fairly detailed and extensive," and "a district court itself has experience in determining what are reasonable hours and reasonable fees, and should rely on that experience and knowledge if the documentation is considered inadequate." <span class="Italic">Slimfold</span>, 932 F.2d at 1459; <span class="Italic">see also Thompson v. Pharmacy Corp. of Am., Inc</span>., 334 F.3d 1242, 1246 (11th Cir. 2003) ("[t]he district court's conclusion that Ms. Munson should receive no compensation for the time she spent on the fee issue was an abuse of discretion.&#8197;...[w]e are confident that some legitimate time was expended....").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although <span class="Italic">Slimfold</span> involved attorney's fees under 35 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 285, as the Supreme Court has recognized, the construction of one provision "may be influenced by language of other statutes which are not specifically related, but which apply to similar persons, things, or relationships." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Fed'n of Fed. Emps. v. Dep't of Interior</span>, 526 U.S. 86, 105 (1999) (quoting 2B N. Singer, <span class="Italic">Sutherland on Statutory Construction</span> &#x00A7; 53.03, at 233 (5th ed. 1992)); <span class="Italic">see also Richlin Sec. Serv. Co. v. Chertoff</span>, 553 U.S. 571, 580 (2008) (relying on <span class="Italic">Missouri v. Jenkins</span>, 491 U.S. 274 (1989), which construed the attorney's fee provision of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1988, to construe 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 504(b)(1)(A)). This is indeed an easier case than <span class="Italic">Slimfold</span>, since &#x00A7; 285 provides that a court "<span class="Italic">may award</span> reasonable attorney fees," whereas 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(B) is mandatory and provides that "[c]orrective action <span class="Italic">shall include</span> attorney's fees and costs."
