<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-243"><span class="space">5.</span> Benefits Upon Restoration</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 8151 provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;In the event the individual resumes employment with the Federal Government, the entire time during which the employee was receiving compensation under this chapter shall be credited to the employee for the purposes of within-grade step increases, retention purposes, and other rights and benefits based upon length of service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 CFR 353.107 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Service credit upon reemployment</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon reemployment, an employee absent because of uniformed service or compensable injury is generally entitled to be treated as though he or she had never left. This means that a person who is reemployed following uniformed service or full recovery from compensable injury receives credit for the entire period of the absence for purposes of rights and benefits based upon seniority and length of service, including within-grade increases, career tenure, completion of probation, leave rate accrual, and severance pay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under<span class="Italic"> Gallo v. United States</span>, 529 F.3d 1345, 1348-50 (Fed. Cir. 2008), Section 8151 restoration of benefits upon resumption of employment does not depend upon the time for recovery:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first address the government's argument that the Court of Federal Claims correctly determined that section 8151(a) (quoted above) does not create a distinct cause of action because it is merely a preamble to section 8151(b). Specifically, the government asserts that the overlap between subsections (a) and (b) of section 8151 suggests that subsection (a) merely sets out the general policy Congress intended, while subsection (b) contains the specific provisions through which that policy is to be implemented.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government's argument is contradicted by the plain language of the statute. Subsection (b) provides employees with the right to be restored to the same or an equivalent position--including the same attendant rights, such as tenure and promotion eligibility--as the employee occupied before the compensable injury, or the right to priority consideration for such a position, depending on the length of the employee's recovery time. Subsection (a), however, provides that, once an employee has been restored as directed by subsection (b), the entire time during which the employee was receiving compensation must be credited for purposes of calculating rights and benefits that are based on length of service. Construing subsection (a) to have independent substantive force is required by "the elementary canon of construction that a statute should be interpreted so as not to render one part inoperative." <span class="Italic">Colautti v. Franklin</span>, 439 U.S. 379, 392, 99 S. Ct. 675, 58 L. Ed.2d 596 (1979). This is particularly true of provisions such as section 8151(a) which, as the Court of Federal Claims noted, is "written in mandatory terms." J.A. at 17. Furthermore, this reading does not render subsection (a) superfluous for employees who recover from compensable injuries within one year. Section 8151(b) grants such employees the right to be restored to their <span id="Page_4518"></span>former or an equivalent position, whereas section 8151(a) confers the right to have the time when they were receiving compensation credited for purposes of within-grade step increases, retirement, and other rights and benefits based on length of service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulations also make clear that section 8151(a) has independent substantive force. A separate regulatory provision tracks the language of section 8151(a):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Upon reemployment, an employee absent because of...compensable injury is generally entitled to be treated as though he or she had never left. This means that a person who is reemployed following...full recovery from compensable injury receives credit for the entire period of the absence for purposes of rights and benefits based upon seniority and length of service, including within-grade increases, career tenure, completion of probation, leave rate accrual, and severance pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.107. This regulation makes clear that OPM itself understood section 8151(a) to confer separate substantive rights from those afforded by section 8151(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of section 8151 confirms that the two subsections are directed to different substantive rights. The report of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare explains the dual purposes of section 22 of the bill, which became section 8151 of the statute:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;"resumes employment with the Federal Government"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Gallo argues that the Board erred by construing "resumes employment with the Federal Government" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a) to require the employee to physically leave the federal government upon a compensable injury. This court reviews the Board's statutory interpretations <span class="Italic">de novo. Jones v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8151(a) provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In the event the individual <span class="Italic">resumes employment with the Federal Government,</span> the entire time during which the employee was receiving compensation under this chapter shall be credited to the employee for the purposes of <span class="Italic">within-grade step increases, retention purposes, and other rights and benefits based upon length of service.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a) (emphases added). Section 8151(b), relevant to the interpretation of subsection (a), provides:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b) (emphases added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Gallo argues that &#x00A7; 8151(a) provides restoration rights to federal employees, such as herself, who resume employment in their former positions, or in positions equivalent thereto, after recovering from a compensable injury, regardless of whether the employee remains otherwise employed by the federal government while receiving OWCP benefits under FECA. Gallo cites FECA's legislative history as evidence that Congress intended that "Federal employees...who are injured on the job and receiving disability compensation...<span class="Italic">will incur no loss of benefits which they would have received absent the injury or disease.</span>" Appellant's Br. 17 (quoting S. Rep. No. 93-1081, reprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5341, 5344) (emphasis added). According to Gallo, the Board was required to interpret FECA liberally "to effectuate its humanitarian purposes, with exemptions and exceptions narrowly construed and doubts resolved in favor of the employee." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">Brown v. Jefferson</span>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8972276453208871804&q=">451 A.2d 74</a>, 77 (D.C.1982)). Gallo argues that, instead of resolving doubts in her favor, the Board "recognize[d] the apparent unfairness in the fact that an employee who remains off duty while injured potentially has greater statutory protection than one who works in another position while injured," <span class="Italic">Board Decision</span> at 6, but nevertheless declined to interpret the ambiguous statute in favor of the employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Department counters that the Board correctly interpreted the language "resumes employment with the Federal Government" in &#x00A7; 8151(a) to require physical separation from the federal government. According to the Department, a reading of the statute that does not require physical separation renders the words "with the Federal Government" superfluous, and Congress would not have included the limiting phrase "with the Federal Government" if it did not intend to incorporate a physical separation requirement. The Agency contends that if the statute did not require physical separation, Congress would have clarified that "resumes employment" means "returning to the time of injury position, duties, or craft," which it did not do. Appellee's Br. 16 (citing 120 Cong. Rec. 27,675 (1974) ("The bill further helps to assure that Federal employees...who are injured on the job and <span class="Italic">return to Federal employment</span> within 1 year, that during their period of disability they will incur no loss of benefits that they would have received absent the injury or disease.") (emphasis in Brief)). To the extent the statute provides greater protection to federal employees who remain "idle" while injured, the Department responds that "it is up to Congress to change the law." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> 20. The Department also contends that the OPM's implementing regulations interpreting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a) and (b) exclude employees like Gallo, who accept a different position within the federal government at the same grade.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court disagrees that &#x00A7; 8151(a) requires physical separation from the federal government. On its face, the language of the statute is ambiguous. On the one hand, it may be reasonable to interpret the statute as the Department argues--to require physical separation based on the presence of the modifier "with the Federal Government," modifying "resumes employment"; on the other hand, it is also just as reasonable to conclude that Congress included the phrase "with the Federal Government" simply to indicate that &#x00A7; 8151(a) applies only to Federal employees who resume employment within the federal government--i.e., not elsewhere, such as the private sector or state government. Interpreting the phrase "with the Federal Government" in this sense, the phrase is not superfluous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">FECA's legislative history indicates congressional intent to protect injured Federal employees who are receiving OWCP compensation under the Act, regardless of whether or where the injured employee worked while receiving that compensation. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 93-1081, reprinted in 1974 <span id="Page_4519"></span>U.S.C.C.A.N. 5341, 5352 ("The amendment made by [&#x00A7; 8151] would assure injured employees <span class="Italic">who are able to return to work at some later date</span> that, during their period of disability, <span class="Italic">they will incur no loss of benefits that they would have received were they not injured.</span>" (emphases added)); 120 Cong. Rec. 27,675 (1974) ("It is essential that injured or disabled employees of all covered departments and agencies...be treated in a fair and equitable manner. The Federal Government should strive to attain the position of being a model employer.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The language of &#x00A7; 8151(a) stating that "the entire <span class="Italic">time during which the employee was receiving compensation under [FECA]</span><span class="Italic"></span> shall be credited" indicates that it is not separation from the federal government, but rather the entitlement to compensation under FECA that is the deciding factor in determining eligibility under &#x00A7; 8151(a). This court agrees with the dissenting opinion below that "Congress intended section 8151(a) to encompass situations, such as exists here, in which an employee resumes her former position or equivalent thereof after having been forced to leave it due to a compensable injury, but who remained otherwise employed by the Federal Government during the interim period while receiving OWCP compensation." <span class="Italic">Board Decision</span> at 14 (Wagner, J. dissenting).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's narrow interpretation of &#x00A7; 8151(a), to exclude employees who do not physically separate from the federal government, is contrary to the OPM's interpretation of the statute in its implementing regulations. OPM regulation 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.103(b) defines an eligible employee under &#x00A7; 8151(a) as one "who was <span class="Italic">separated or furloughed from an appointment</span> without time limitation...as a result of a compensable injury"; and OPM regulations 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(a) and (b) define an eligible employee under &#x00A7; 8151(b)(1) and (2) to include an employee who "<span class="Italic">accepts a lower-graded position in lieu of separation</span> and subsequently fully recovers" (emphases added). Gallo fits squarely within 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.103(b)'s definition of an eligible employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a) as one who resumed employment after "separation...<span class="Italic">from an appointment</span>...as a result of compensable injury." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.103(b) (emphasis added). The Department admits that Gallo was separated from her ATCS "appointment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(a) and (b), an injured employee who "accepts a lower-graded position <span class="Italic">in lieu of separation</span> and subsequently fully recovers" qualifies for restoration under &#x00A7; 8151(b). In <span class="Italic">Gallo I,</span> this court explained that under "[s]ubsection (a)..., once an employee has been restored <span class="Italic">as directed by subsection</span> (<span class="Italic">b</span>), the entire time during which the employee was receiving compensation must be credited for purposes of calculating rights and benefits that are based on length of service." <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18112798712408568151&q=">529 F.3d at 1349</a> (emphasis added). Thus, under the OPM's implementing regulations, to which we accord deference under <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc</span>., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14437597860792759765&q=">467 U.S. 837</a>, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed.2d 694 (1984), and under the statutory scheme as interpreted by this court, subsection (a) cannot properly be interpreted to require physical separation from the federal government. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(a) and (b); <span class="Italic">Gallo I</span>, 529 F.3d at 1349.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, this court holds that physical separation from the federal government is not required to "resume[&#8197;] employment with the Federal Government" under &#x00A7; 8151(a). Because Gallo was undisputedly separated from her appointment as an ATCS, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.103(b), and because she received compensation under FECA during the entire period of her "separation," she qualifies for restoration benefits "based on length of service" under &#x00A7; 8151(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the court concludes that Gallo directly qualifies for any rights and benefits to which she may be entitled under &#x00A7; 8151(a), this court need not address whether Gallo was entitled to or received priority consideration for restoration under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2), despite the parties' extensive briefing on this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;"rights and benefits based upon length of service"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board determined that "even if [Gallo] had resumed employment with the Federal Government, she would not be entitled to the relief she seeks" because "the benefits she seeks are not based upon length of service." <span class="Italic">Board Decision</span> at 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Gallo cites OPM regulation 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.107, which provides that an employee who is restored after compensable injury is "entitled to be treated as though he or she had never left," and argues that she is "entitled to both the pay and retirement credit that she would have received had she not been injured. According to Gallo, "benefits and pay increases are [&#8197;] determined by an employee's service in a specific position," and not in government service generally. Gallo's argument tracks the dissenting opinion below, which finds that benefits based on length of service, for example, within-grade pay increases, "are very much determined by an employee's service in a specific position." <span class="Italic">Board Decision</span> at 16 (Wagner J., dissenting).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Department counters that the benefits Gallo seeks are not benefits based on length of service. The Department argues that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(1) confers to employees who fully recover within one year the right to immediate restoration "as well as <span class="Italic">all other attendant rights</span> which the employee would have had, or acquired, in his former position had he not been injured." The Government goes on to point out, however, that because Gallo did not recover within one year, she is not entitled to be treated under that section and instead falls only under &#x00A7; 8151(a), under which an employee's rights are not as broad. <span class="Italic">See Burtch v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. 518, 521 (1991). According to the Department, Gallo already "received all rights and benefits based on length of service to which she was entitled, as her service as a Federal employee was uninterrupted during the entire time of her injury." Although the legislative history indicates that injured employees will "incur no loss of benefits" upon restoration, 120 Cong. Rec. 27,675, the Department argues that "that entitlement is not limitless." Appellee's Br. 28 (citing <span class="Italic">Smit v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 492, 495-96 (1991)) (the right to administratively uncontrollable overtime is not encompassed under either &#x00A7; 8151(a) or (b)(1)); <span class="Italic">Burtch,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. at 522 (the right to earn sick and annual leave is not encompassed under either &#x00A7; 8151(a) or (b)(1)); <span class="Italic">Nixon v. Dep't of Treasury,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 189, 194 (2006) (no entitlement to restoration to a position of the same standing within the organization); and <span class="Italic">True v. Office of Pers.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Gallo "resume[d] employment with the Federal Government" and made a claim for improper restoration under &#x00A7; 8151(a), she is entitled to "the rights and benefits based upon length of service" guaranteed in &#x00A7; 8151(a). The remaining question is whether seniority within the AT pay system and time credit "as if she had never left" her ATCS position are "right[s] and benefit[s] based upon length of service" under &#x00A7; 8151(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8151(a) guarantees that "the entire time during which the employee was receiving compensation under this chapter shall be credited to the employee for the purposes of within-grade step increases, retention purposes, and other rights and benefits based upon length of service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a). In turn, OPM regulation 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.107, which "tracks the language of [&#x00A7;] 8151(a)," <span class="Italic">Gallo I</span>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18112798712408568151&q=">529 F.3d at 1349</a>, provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Upon reemployment, an employee absent because of uniformed service or compensable injury is <span class="Italic">generally entitled to be treated as though he or she had never left.</span> This means that a person who is reemployed following...full recovery from compensable injury receives credit for the entire period of the absence for purposes of rights and benefits based upon seniority and length of service, including within-grade increases, career tenure, completion of probation, leave rate accrual, and severance pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.107 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although these "rights and benefits based upon length of service" seem to be broadly articulated, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.107 uses the term "generally" in qualifying the language "entitled to be treated as though he or she had never left." Moreover, &#x00A7; 8151(a) must be interpreted in the context of the statutory scheme as a whole, so as not to render the language in &#x00A7; 8151(b)(1) superfluous. <span class="Italic">See Gallo I</span>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18112798712408568151&q=">529 F.3d at 1349</a> ("Construing subsection (a) to have independent substantive force is required by `the elementary canon of construction that a statute should be interpreted so as not render one part inoperative.'") (quoting <span class="Italic">Colautti v. Franklin</span>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11995294142285279951&q=">439 U.S. 379</a>, 392, 99 S. Ct. 675, 58 L. Ed.2d 596 (1979)). Indeed, <span class="Italic">Gallo</span> agrees that &#x00A7; 8151(b)(1) conveys a broader scope of restoration rights to employees who return to service within one year of compensable injury than does &#x00A7; 8151(a), but contends that many of the rights guaranteed under &#x00A7; 8151(a) and (b)(1) may overlap.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history also supports the proposition that the scope of restoration rights guaranteed under &#x00A7; 8151(a)--which does not specify a period of absence--must be construed more narrowly than the scope of restoration rights under &#x00A7; 8151(b)(1)--which is limited to employees who return to employment within one year. While the Senate Committee Report indicates Congressional intent that &#x00A7; 8151 serves to "assure [that] injured employees who are able to return to work at some later date...will incur no loss of benefits that they would have received were they not injured," S. Rep. No. 93-1081, reprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5341, 5352, the legislative history also evidences a clear intention that the Act would provide greater protection for employees restored within one year:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The bill further helps to assure that Federal employees...who are injured on the job <span class="Italic">and return to Federal employment within 1 year</span>...will incur no loss of benefits that they would have received absent the injury or disease. Additionally, it provides a <span class="Italic">guaranteed right</span> to an injured Federal employee <span class="Italic">to return to his former or equivalent position if he recovers within 1 year.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">120 Cong. Rec. 27,675 (1974) (emphases added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A comparison of &#x00A7; 8151(a) and (b)(1) is helpful to ascertain the restoration rights and benefits guaranteed under &#x00A7; 8151(a). Section 8151(b)(1) guarantees "all...attendant rights which the employee would have had, or acquired, <span class="Italic">in his former position</span> had he not been injured or disabled, including the rights to tenure, promotion, and safeguards in reductions-in-force procedures." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(1) (emphasis added). <span id="Page_4520"></span>Section 8151(b)(1) specifically mentions the employee's former position, whereas &#x00A7; 8151(a) only references "time." &#x00A7; 8151(a) (guaranteeing <span class="Italic">time credit</span> for the purposes of "<span class="Italic">within-grade step increases, retention purposes,</span> and <span class="Italic">other rights and</span> <span class="Italic">benefits based on length of service</span>" (emphasis added)). Moreover, &#x00A7; 8151(b)(1) includes the right to merit or quality based "promotion" and "tenure," which are <span class="Italic">not</span> based on time generally, but rather time in a specific position, and fall outside the scope of &#x00A7; 8151(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board considered the additional pay that Gallo seeks to be "based on length of service in a particular position, i.e., an operational ATCS position, rather than length of service in government generally." <span class="Italic">Board Decision</span> at 7 ("We find that the term `length of service' in the statute refers to overall government service."). The Board reasoned that the specific examples of "rights and benefits based upon length of service" in &#x00A7; 8151(a)--within-grade step increases and retention rights--are <span class="Italic">not</span> determined based on length of service in any specific position, but rather based on the completion of the requisite number of weeks of "creditable service," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.405(a), which is defined as "[c]ivilian employment in any branch of the Federal Government," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.406(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we agree that under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 531.405(a) and 531.406(a), "creditable service" is based on government service generally, we disagree with the Board's conclusion that Gallo is not entitled to the <span class="Italic">time</span> that she spent serving the government as an automation specialist. Indeed, the Board even states that "OPM's regulations specifically contemplate combining service in different positions for purposes of completing the waiting period [required for a within-grade pay increase] . When Gallo was restored to her ATCS position, and later promoted, she was entitled to her creditable service time--which the Department admits includes service in any branch of the federal government, and thus <span class="Italic">must include Gallo's service time as an automation specialist.</span> The Board erred to the extent it held that Gallo would not be entitled to her service <span class="Italic">time</span> as an automation specialist, and that this <span class="Italic">time</span> could not be credited to her for the purposes of determining her appropriate rating or "grade" within the AT system.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When Gallo was restored to her ATCS position, and later promoted, she was entitled to her creditable service time towards the equivalent of "within grade step-increases" in the AT pay system, based on creditable service <span class="Italic">time.</span> We hold that Gallo was not entitled to position specific promotions (i.e., promotions not based solely on creditable service time), however, which fall outside of her benefits based on "length of service" with the federal government generally. Accordingly, this court remands to the Board for the Board to: (1) reinstate Gallo's creditable service time as an automation specialist; (2) determine Gallo's appropriate seniority level and corresponding pay under the AT compensation system based upon her creditable service time, including her time spent serving as an automation specialist (the AT compensation system is not present in the record on appeal, and thus we do not hold one way or another whether her creditable service time will or will not impact her compensation level in the AT pay system, and leave this inquiry to the Board on remand); and (3) award Gallo any additional compensation to which she was entitled, effective to the date of her restoration to the supervisory ATCS position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2) (Feb. 14, 2012 amendment) (The Board possesses authority to award compensation under the Back Pay Act.).</p>

On March 14, 2007, an Administrative Judge of the Board ordered Palmer to submit evidence and argument to support Board jurisdiction over his appeal. Palmer filed a response, arguing that jurisdiction was proper under the USPS Employee and Labor Relations Manual. USPS filed a response, arguing that the Board lacks jurisdiction over appeals such as Palmer's. On March 30, 2007, the Administrative Judge dismissed Palmer's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Palmer petitioned the Board for review, requesting damages of $5.5 million in addition to the previously requested award of annual and sick leave. On August 22, 2007, the Board denied Palmer's petition for review, and the Administrative Judge's initial decision became final. This appeal followed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his response to the Administrative Judge's order to submit evidence and argument supporting jurisdiction, Palmer argued that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal under sections 546.3 and 546.4 of the USPS Employee and Labor Relations Manual. The cited sections do not purport to create an independent basis for Board jurisdiction, but merely advise employees who return to employment (or, in the argot of the regulations, are "restored") after leave and who believe they were improperly restored that they may appeal to the Board under the provisions of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353. <span class="Italic">See</span> U.S. Postal Service, Employee and Labor Relations Manual, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 546.3, 546.4 (ELM 17.6, Feb 15, 2007), available at <a href="http://www.usps.com/cpim/manuals/elm/elmarch.htm">http://www.usps.com/cpim/manuals/elm/elmarch.htm</a>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Code of Federal Regulations in turn grants the Board jurisdiction over certain appeals by employees who are partially recovered from a compensable injury and seek to return to work:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section,</span> an injured employee or former employee of an agency in the executive branch (including the U.S. Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission) may appeal to the MSPB an agency's failure to restore, improper restoration, or failure to return an employee following a leave of absence. All appeals must be submitted in accordance with MSPB's regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;An individual who fully recovers from a compensable injury more than 1 year after compensation begins may appeal to MSPB as provided for in parts 302 and 330 of this chapter for excepted and competitive service employees, respectively.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">An individual who is partially recovered from a compensable injury</span> may appeal to MSPB for a determination of whether the agency is acting arbitrarily and capriciously in denying restoration. Upon reemployment, a partially recovered employee may also appeal the agency's failure to credit time spent on compensation for purposes of rights and benefits based upon length of service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.304 (1999) (emphasis added).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we did not discuss our reasoning at length, we held that the combination of subsection (a) of the regulation with subsection (c) means that an employee, "having been restored to duty after a partial recovery, may not appeal the details or circumstances of her restoration to the board." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 519. Because the employee in <span class="Italic">Booker</span> was not denied restoration and did not allege that USPS failed to credit the time she spent on compensation for purposes of rights and benefits based upon length of service, we found that the Board lacked jurisdiction over her appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our holding in <span class="Italic">Booker</span> was mandated by a fair reading of the regulation. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.304(a) provides for appeals to the Board of improper restoration "except as provided below." Below, &#x00A7; 353.304(c) states that an individual who is partially recovered may appeal denials of restoration and failure to credit time spent on compensation for purposes of rights and benefits based upon length of service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The establishment of jurisdiction for failure to credit time spent on compensation facilitates enforcement of the Federal Employee's Compensation Act, which provides, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In the event the individual resumes employment with the Federal Government, the entire time during which the employee was receiving compensation under this chapter shall be credited to the employee for the purposes of within-grade step increases, retention purposes, and other rights and benefits based upon length of service.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee covered by &#x00A7; 353.304(c) cannot appeal "improper restoration" claims not involving &#x00A7; 8151(a) rights; the employee may appeal only on the limited grounds enumerated in subsection (c).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">The word "except," as used in section 353.304(a), simply alludes to the fact that not all employees to whom sections 353.304(b) and 353.304(c) apply have restoration rights in all circumstances. It does not mean that any employee who is within the scope of subsection <span id="Page_4521"></span>(b) or (c), and is granted statutory restoration rights, does not have the right to appeal an improper restoration under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Furthermore, other aspects of the OPM regulations suggest that section 353.304(a) applies broadly to all improper restoration claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1351.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts in <span class="Italic">Gallo</span> make clear that this language should not be read to suggest that a partially recovered employee, who, according to <span class="Italic">Booker,</span> may appeal to the Board only under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.304(c), may also appeal under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.304(a) an allegedly improper restoration not involving rights under 5 USC &#x00A7; 8151(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The employee in <span class="Italic">Gallo,</span> Jane L. Gallo, was an air traffic controller with the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA"). <span class="Italic">Gallo</span>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18112798712408568151&hl=en&as_sdt=2,47">529 F.3d at 1346</a>. After she suffered an on-the-job injury in January 1995, Gallo received OWCP benefits until March 1995, when she returned to light duty. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In January 1996, however, an FAA physician determined that Gallo was indefinitely incapacitated and unable to work as an air traffic controller. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In April 1996, Gallo transferred to another FAA position that did not require medical certification. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1347 Because the new position did not provide the same pay or retirement benefits as Gallo's air traffic controller position, Gallo received differential OWCP benefits. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In April 2000, a physician determined that Gallo had recovered from her injury. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In June 2000, Gallo's OWCP benefits were terminated, and in August 2000, Gallo accepted a supervisory air traffic controller position. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Gallo's salary for the new position did not take into account pay increases that had been granted to air traffic controllers while she worked in another position due to her injury; Gallo apparently alleged that the salary calculation amounted to a failure to credit her for a right or benefit based upon length of service in violation of 5 USC &#x00A7; 8151(a). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In <span class="Italic">Gallo</span> we simply held that employees like Gallo whose recovery took longer than one year could recover under &#x00A7; 8151(a) and could not bring &#x00A7; 8151(a) claims in the Court of Federal Claims, "[b]ecause an action under section 8151(a) is within the Board's appellate jurisdiction under the [Civil Service Reform Act of 1978] and the Board's regulations, the Court of Federal Claims lacks jurisdiction over such an action." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1352.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Gallo</span> should not be read as overruling our earlier holding in <span class="Italic">Booker. George E. Warren Corp. v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Palmer, of course, did return to employment and does not allege a denial of restoration. Nor does Palmer allege that USPS failed to credit his time for purposes of such a right or benefit. To establish Board jurisdiction based on failure to credit time spent on compensation, an appellant must:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">allege facts that, if proven, would show that: (1) He was absent from his position due to a compensable injury; (2) the agency restored him to duty on a part-time basis, to light duty, or to a position with less demanding physical requirements; and (3) the agency failed to credit time spent on compensation for the purposes of rights and benefits based upon length of service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Foley v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 307, 312 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Palmer's allegations are not entirely clear, he apparently alleges that USPS failed to credit him for annual and sick leave accrued while he was on leave without pay and receiving OWCP benefits. This is not an allegation of failure to credit time spent on compensation <span class="Italic">for purposes of rights and benefits based upon length of service.</span> By contrast, that was exactly the claim made in <span class="Italic">Gallo,</span> a claim for compensation <span class="Italic">after</span> restoration based on length of service. Whether USPS allows Palmer to accrue leave while on leave without pay is not dependent on his length of service with USPS. Rather, a set number of hours of leave is accrued during each pay period an employee works. <span class="Italic">See</span> United States Postal Service, Employee and Labor Relations Manual, &#x00A7; 512.311 (ELM 17.6, Feb 15, 2007), available at <a href="http://www.usps.com/cpim/manuals/elm/elmarch.htm">http://www.usps.com/cpim/manuals/elm/elmarch.htm</a>. The <span class="Italic">rate</span> at which leave accrues during each pay period is a benefit based on length of service. An employee earns four hours of leave per pay period if he has served fewer than three years, six hours per pay period if he has served between three years and fifteen years, and eight hours per pay period if he has served fifteen years or more. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> But Palmer does not allege that he currently is accruing leave at the wrong rate. Rather, he alleges that USPS erred by not allowing him to accrue leave while he was on leave. Because this claim challenges only a "detail[&#8197;] or circumstance[&#8197;] " of Palmer's restoration, he has not met his burden of alleging jurisdictional facts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Palmer was not denied restoration and because he has not alleged that USPS failed to credit his time for purposes of a right or benefit based on length of service, the Board was correct that it lacked jurisdiction over Palmer's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his informal brief, Palmer suggests that <span class="Italic">Hatch v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 204 (2005), somehow supports his position. Palmer's reliance on <span class="Italic">Hatch</span> is misplaced. <span class="Italic">Hatch</span> addressed the issue whether partially recovered employees who receive OWCP benefits while working part-time should be treated as full-time employees for the purpose of computing retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 207-08. The <span class="Italic">Hatch</span> case has no bearing on whether the Board has jurisdiction over Palmer's appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Cited in and clarified by <span class="Italic">Palmer</span> was <span class="Italic">Booker v. MSPB</span>, 982 F.2d 517, 518-19 (Fed. Cir. 1992), affirming the Board's decision that it lacked jurisdiction over the assertion of an OWCP recipient that he suffered reprisal because of complaints made concerning administration of his compensation claims:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Booker sustained a back injury in 1980 which prevented her from continuing her duties at the Bulk Mail Center of the United States Postal Service in Dallas, Texas. The United States Department of Labor awarded her worker's compensation benefits for the injury. By about September 20, 1990, Booker had made a partial recovery sufficient to allow her to return to work on limited duty in a position modified to accommodate her medical condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Booker was dissatisfied with the circumstances of her restoration, and on June 26, 1991, she filed an appeal with the Merit Systems Protection Board. She told the board that some of her problems were the result of reprisals against her because of complaints she made to the inspector general of the Postal Service about delays in the completion of her compensation claims. She also complained that she was discriminated against by the Postal Service's injury compensation specialist.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision of the board, the administrative judge held that because Booker was not appealing a denial of restoration, only the circumstances of her restoration, her claim did not fall within the jurisdiction of the board. The initial decision also addressed Booker's allegations of discrimination, and that she was subjected to reprisal for having complained to the inspector general. The administrative judge stated that allegations of prohibited personnel practices under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1)(D) and (b)(9) (1988 &#x0026; Supp. III 1991) are not independent sources of appellate jurisdiction for the board. Because Booker was not entitled to appeal the underlying personnel action, the board was without jurisdiction to hear her additional complaints.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The full board reopened the case under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.117 (1992), and adopted the conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction over both Booker's restoration appeal and her allegations of prohibited personnel practices. It explained that a claim of reprisal for having complained to the inspector general may be pursued before the board in an individual right of action (IRA) appeal under the Whistleblower Protection Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221, (Supp. III 1991) if the complaint to the inspector general constitutes a disclosure under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) (Supp. III 1991). <span class="Italic">See</span> Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub.L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16 (codified in various sections of 5 U.S.C.); <span class="Italic">Ward v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8822546900534857430&q=">981 F.2d 521</a>, 523 (Fed. Cir. 1992). The board held that it need not determine if these complaints were protected disclosures under section 2302(b)(8), however, because Postal Service employees could not appeal alleged whistleblower violations directly to the board under the IRA provisions. Those employees may raise whistleblowing only as a defense in an otherwise appealable action. Because there was no otherwise appealable action in this case, the board held it was without jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts are not in dispute; the only issue in this appeal is whether the board properly interpreted the applicable law and regulations in determining it lacked jurisdiction. Booker sought review of the circumstances of her restoration to duty with the Postal Service. It was agreed that she had partially recovered from a compensable injury, and restoration to duty from a compensable injury is provided for by 5 C.F.R. Part 353 (1988). Appeals based on the right to restoration may be had at the Merit Systems Protection Board under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.401 which provides in part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Except as provided below,</span> an employee or former employee...who is covered by this part may appeal to the MSPB an agency's <span class="Italic">failure to restore</span> or <span class="Italic">improper restoration...</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c)&#x2003;An individual who is <span class="Italic">partially recovered</span> from a compensable injury may appeal to MSPB for a determination of whether the agency is acting arbitrarily and capriciously in <span class="Italic">denying restoration.</span> [Emphasis added] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulation is straightforward. An employee in Booker's position, having been restored to duty after a partial recovery, may not appeal the details or circumstances of her restoration to the board. She may only appeal a denial of restoration for a determination of whether it was arbitrary or capricious. Because her restoration was not denied, but has been accomplished, the board was correct that it lacked jurisdiction to respond to Booker's complaints about the particulars of her restoration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Booker's further allegations that Postal Service employees committed prohibited personnel practices in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1)(D) and (b)(9) by discriminating against her because of her injuries and in <span id="Page_4522"></span>reprisal for her complaints to the inspector general are also beyond the board's jurisdiction. As a Postal Service employee, Booker could not seek corrective action from the board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1221(a) allows an employee to bring an IRA seeking corrective action from the board with respect to any "personnel action" that results from a "prohibited personnel practice" taken in retaliation for whistleblowing. According to section 2302, a "personnel action" may be considered a "prohibited personnel practice" only if it occurs within an "agency" as that word is defined. The definition of "agency" in section 2302(a)(2)(C) does not include the United States Postal Service, which is specifically excluded from the generally applicable definition of "executive agency" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 105 (1988), by virtue of its exclusion from the definition of "independent establishment" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 104 (1988). It is a unique entity. Where Congress intended the Postal Service to be included within the definition of "agency" or to be subject to particular provisions of Title 5, it explicitly so provided. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3371(3), 4103 note, 5514(a)(4)(B), and 5520(c)(4) (1988). Its absence from the section 2302 definition could only have been intentional in light of this congressional practice. <span class="Italic">Cf. United States Department of Energy v. Ohio</span>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12218148035570675756&q=">503 U.S. 607</a>, 112 S. Ct. 1627, 1634, 118 L. Ed.2d 255 (1992) (omission of the United States from the term "person" in certain sections of the Clean Water Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act was significant given the specific inclusion of the United States in other definitions of "person" found elsewhere in the statutes).</p>

For the following reasons, we agree that the appellant did not make a nonfrivolous allegation of improper restoration pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a). We further find that the appellant has not been subjected to an appealable administrative action or order affecting his interests under federal retirement law at this time; however, we notify him that he may raise these claims under federal retirement law to OPM for consideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151The appellant did not make a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency violated his restoration rights as described in (a).</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) provides, among other things, that federal employees who suffer compensable injuries enjoy certain restoration rights. <span class="Italic">Latham v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;For instance, an employee, like the appellant, who is separated because of a compensable injury and whose full recovery takes longer than 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation began, is entitled to priority consideration, agencywide, for restoration to the position he left or an equivalent one provided he applies for reappointment within 30 days of the cessation of compensation. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2). An injured employee in the executive branch, including the U.S. Postal Service, who believes that his reemployment priority rights have been violated, may appeal to the Board under the provisions of the Board's regulations. <span class="Italic">Nevins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 595, &#x00B6; 10 (2008); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(a). The appellant does not appear to have alleged below that the agency violated his reemployment priority rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered the appellant's assertion that the agency, upon his reemployment, failed to properly credit him for sick and annual leave, Social Security benefits, Medicare, TSP contributions, retirement, and life insurance for the 16 years that he was receiving OWCP benefits pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.107, 353.304(a). Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a), an individual who returns to duty following a compensable injury is entitled to service credit for the periods of leave without pay (LWOP) or separation during which he received OWCP compensation. In pertinent part, section 8151(a) states that the entire time during which the employee was receiving compensation under 5 U.S.C. chapter 81 shall be credited to the employee for the purposes of within-grade step increases, retention purposes, and <span class="Italic">other rights and benefits based upon length of service</span>.[3] The issue before us is whether "other rights and benefits based upon length of service" in section 8151(a) includes sick and annual leave, Social Security benefits, Medicare, TSP contributions, retirement, and life insurance. We conclude that the answer is no.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.107, which generally tracks the language of section 8151(a), <span class="Italic">see Gallo v. United States</span>, 529 F.3d 1345, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2008), states that, upon reemployment, an employee absent because of a compensable injury is generally entitled to be treated as though he had never left, and such an individual receives credit for the entire period of the absence for purposes of rights and benefits based upon seniority and length of service, including within-grade increases, career tenure, completion of probation, leave rate accrual, and severance pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's assertion that he was entitled to retirement credit, we have considered precedent from the Board and the Federal Circuit that analyzes 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a). Based on our review of this precedent, we find that FERS retirement credit is not a right or benefit based upon the appellant's length of service. As noted by the administrative judge in the initial decision, our reviewing court, in <span class="Italic">True v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 926 F.2d 1151, 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1991), concluded that neither section 8151(a) nor section 8332(f) permits non-actual service to be counted toward the 5-year actual reemployment requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344(a). In reaching its conclusion, the court analyzed the legislative history of section 8151(a). <span class="Italic">True,</span> 926 F.2d at 1155-56. The court noted that: (1) the original proposed legislation provided that the time an individual spent receiving OWCP benefits also would be credited for the purpose of "annuity computation under the civil service retirement provisions"; (2) the Senate passed the legislation with an amendment that struck out "annuity computation under the civil service retirement provisions"; and (3) the House concurred in the Senate amendments, including the deletion of the provision regarding civil service retirement in section 8151(a). <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1155. Based on this legislative history, the court concluded that Congress expressly considered and rejected the possibility of allowing FECA beneficiaries to count non-actual service toward fulfilling the retirement annuity credit requirements of section 8344(a). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1156.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserted below that <span class="Italic">True</span> was inapplicable because it involved reemployed annuitants. Although it is accurate that Mr. True was a reemployed annuitant, the court subsequently expanded the holding of <span class="Italic">True</span> to cases that did not involve reemployed annuitants. In <span class="Italic">Gallo v. Department of Transportation</span>, 689 F.3d 1294 (Fed. Cir. 2012), the court addressed a situation in which the employee, like the appellant, had fully recovered after more than 1 year and sought retirement credit for the time that she had received OWCP benefits. The court rejected Ms. Gallo's argument that, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.107, she was entitled to retirement credit that she would have received had she not been injured, explaining that it "unequivocally held in <span class="Italic">True</span> that &#x00A7; 8151(a) does not encompass civil service retirement credit, a right based on <span class="Italic">actual employment</span> time, not including time that an employee was receiving OWCP compensation." 689 F.3d at 1300, 1302-03 (citing <span class="Italic">True</span>, 926 F.2d at 1156). Because decisions from the Federal Circuit are controlling authority for the Board, <span class="Italic">Fairall v. Veterans Administration</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 33, 39, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 844 F.2d 775 (Fed. Cir. 1987), we conclude that the appellant's claims for retirement credit do not constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction over restoration matters pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also have considered the appellant's argument that <span class="Italic">Hatch v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 204 (2005), is applicable to this matter. We disagree. <span class="Italic">Hatch</span> addressed the issue of whether a partially-recovered employee who receives OWCP benefits while working part-time should be treated as a full-time employee for the purpose of computing retirement benefits. The Board's decision to credit as full-time service for retirement purposes Mr. Hatch's part-time work schedule is not relevant to our assessment of whether 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a) grants the Board jurisdiction to consider the appellant's assertion that he should receive retirement credit for the entire time that he was out on LWOP and receiving OWCP benefits. <span class="Italic">See Palmer v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 550 F.3d 1380, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (explaining that the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Hatch</span> had "no bearing" on whether the Board has jurisdiction over Mr. Palmer's appeal of improper restoration following partial recovery from a compensable injury).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's assertion on review that the agency should have credited him with sick and annual leave, both the Federal Circuit and the Board have concluded that sick and annual leave are not rights and benefits based on length of service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a). <span class="Italic">See Palmer</span>, 550 F.3d at 1384-85; <span class="Italic">Burtch v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 518, 521, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 949 F.2d 404 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties agreed below that the appellant was entitled to a leave accrual rate based on his more than 16 years of federal employment, which would include the time for which he received OWCP benefits. To the extent that the appellant argues on review that he is entitled to <span class="Italic">leave accrual</span> in this regard, he has not nonfrivolously alleged a basis for Board jurisdiction because the record reflects that he is properly accruing leave at a rate of 8 hours per pay period. <span class="Italic">See also Palmer</span>, 550 F.3d at 1384-85 <span id="Page_4523"></span>("The <span class="Italic">rate</span> at which leave accrues during each pay period is a benefit based on length of service."); <span class="Italic">Burtch</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. at 521 (same).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has relied on various provisions of the ELM and excerpts from OPM's Guide to Processing Personnel Actions to support his assertion that he should have been credited for leave, Social Security benefits, TSP contributions, Medicare, and life insurance. We have considered these references, but none persuade us that these benefits are based on length of service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a). For example, the appellant cited numerous ELM provisions regarding back pay awards; however, the appellant did not receive a back pay award, and, thus, those provisions are inapplicable. Additionally, the appellant cited ELM 512.91 for the proposition that an employee who returns to pay and duty status following a suspension period or an involuntary separation is entitled to have annual leave recredited; however, the appellant was not suspended or involuntarily separated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons, we conclude that the appellant has not nonfrivolously alleged that the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal as a claim of improper restoration pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's assertion that the agency's decision not to award him retirement credit is an administrative action or order affecting his rights and interests under federal retirement law.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered the appellant's alternative theory that the agency's decision not to award him retirement credit for the time that he received OWCP benefits constitutes an administrative action or order affecting an individual's rights or interests under federal retirement law. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3(a)(2). As support for his assertion, the appellant relied on section 582.4 of the ELM and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(f), both of which appear to allow retirement credit for time spent receiving OWCP benefits. (section 582.4 of the ELM). Additionally, the appellant referred to OPM's CSRS and FERS Handbook, which states that a federal employee who is not an annuitant who returns to federal service after a period of separation is deemed to have been in a LWOP status during that part of the separation period in which he received workers' compensation benefits, and the period of deemed LWOP is creditable for years of service counted towards eligibility and computation of benefits, and in the computation of the high-3 salary. <span class="Italic">See</span> OPM CSRS and FERS Handbook, &#x00A7; 102A3.1-1B, available at <a href="http://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/publications-forms/csrsfers-handbook/c102.pdf?nocache=1">http://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/publications-forms/csrsfers-handbook/c102.pdf?nocache=1</a> (last visited Mar. 24, 2015).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ordinarily, an appeal of an administrative action or order affecting an individual's rights or interests under a federal retirement system arises from an OPM decision. <span class="Italic">Mandarino v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 510, &#x00B6; 7 (2012). Here, however, there is no OPM decision regarding the appellant's assertion that he was entitled to retirement credit, and there is no evidence that OPM or Congress delegated to the agency the authority to determine his entitlement to retirement credit as a matter of retirement law. <span class="Italic">Cf. Adams v. Department of Defense</span>, 688 F.3d 1330, 1335-36 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (the appeal of an adverse Voluntary Early Retirement Authority ruling by the agency is within the Board's jurisdiction because Congress delegated such authority to the agency); <span class="Italic">Mandarino</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 510, &#x00B6; 7 (explaining that when an employing agency makes a decision on a request for enhanced retirement coverage under a delegation of authority from OPM, it "stands in OPM's place," and the appeal is from the employing agency's decision).[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;There does not appear to be any meaningful difference between the relevant FERS provision in <span class="Italic">Adams</span>, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e), and the CSRS provision in <span class="Italic">Mandarino</span>, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of an OPM decision, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's request to receive retirement credit for the 16 years that he received OWCP benefits. However, we notify the appellant that he may request OPM to make a determination on his entitlement to retirement credit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal, <span class="Italic">Morales</span> was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Morales v. MSPB</span>, 629 Fed. Appx. 994, 996-97 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As for Mr. Morales' claim to retirement benefits, this court has held that non-actual service, such as time spent receiving OWCP benefits, does not count toward fulfilling retirement annuity credit requirements. <span class="Italic">See True v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 926 F.2d 1151, 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1991) ("Congress considered and rejected the possibility of allowing FECA beneficiaries to count non-actual service toward fulfilling the retirement annuity credit requirements of section 8344(a)."); <span class="Italic">Gallo v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, 689 F.3d 1294, 1302-03 (Fed. Cir. 2012) ("[t]his court unequivocally held in <span class="Italic">True</span> that &#x00A7; 8151(a) does not encompass civil service retirement credit, a right based on actual employment time, not including time that an employee was receiving OWCP compensation under FECA."). Mr. Morales' claim to sick and annual leave similarly fails because sick and annual leave are not rights based upon length of service. <span class="Italic">Palmer v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 550 F.3d 1380, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (failure to credit sick and annual leave "is not an allegation of failure to credit time spent on compensation for purposes of rights and benefits based upon length of service").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for Mr. Morales' claim to Social Security benefits, Thrift Savings Plan contributions, Medicare, and life insurance, the Board correctly concluded that these benefits are beyond the scope of &#x00A7; 8151(a). Social Security, Thrift Savings, and Medicare contributions are based on an employee's salary. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8422 (Thrift Savings); 26 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3101 (Social Security and Medicare). Life insurance contributions, though not directly dependent on salary, are withdrawn from an employee's regular pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8707. Mr. Morales was not earning a regular salary from the Postal Service during the time he received OWCP benefits. OWCP benefits are not considered salary but rather compensation for injury. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8102(a) and 8101(12); <span class="Italic">Roja v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 618, 621 (M.S.P.B. Nov. 24, 1992). The Postal Service was therefore not required to credit Mr. Morales with Social Security, Thrift Savings Plan, Medicare, or life insurance contributions during the time he was receiving OWCP benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Morales' arguments to the contrary are not persuasive. Mr. Morales argues that the Board incorrectly applied 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(f), which he argues entitled him to credit for civil service retirement during his absence from actual service. A similar argument was considered and rejected by this court in <span class="Italic">True. See</span> 926 F.2d at 1156 ("Like section 8151(a), section 8332(f) makes no reference to...civil service retirement annuities...."). It is well settled that &#x00A7; 8151(a) does not encompass civil service retirement credit. <span class="Italic">Gallo</span>, 689 F.3d at 1302-03.</p>
