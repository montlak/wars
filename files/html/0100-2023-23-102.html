<p class="Body-Text">The government may collect state and federal taxes owed at the rate applicable for the year that the back pay is to be paid to the employee. <span class="Italic">Tanaka v.

Dept. of Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 138, 138 (1986) (agency must deduct federal and state income taxes in accordance with revenue laws). Special deduction rules for taxes on back pay awards may apply. <span class="Italic">Marion v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 443, 445 (1998), noted, without citation of the rule applied by the agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency submitted its brief arguing that it properly withheld for Federal income tax a flat 28% of the appellant's back pay award. The agency relies on Internal Revenue Service guidance concerning withholding on supplemental wages, which include back pay awards. Under these rules, if the employee's regular wages are subject to tax withholding, the employer may elect to withhold a flat 28% of the supplemental wages.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has filed a timely response to the agency's submission in which he continues to maintain that the amount of Federal income tax withheld from his back pay award was erroneous because the agency did not use the same method of computation that it uses with his regular paycheck. However, the appellant has not responded to the agency's evidence that a different method of withholding applies to supplemental wages such as back pay and that it permits the agency to withhold a flat 28% of such pay in the case of an employee like the appellant whose regular wages are subject to tax withholding. Thus the appellant has not rebutted the agency's evidence of compliance with respect to his back pay.</p>

DOD</span>, 113 MSPR 629, 636-37 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-23, 2010 MSPB 94 (2010), explained the Board's inability to correct the tax consequences of a back pay award as a component of enforcement authority involving a decision directing <span id="Page_4911"></span>reinstatement (reserving the issue of enforcement of a settlement agreement provision):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for enforcement, the appellant argued that he was entitled to compensation for the additional tax burden he faced because the back pay award shifted income he would have earned in 2007 to 2008. The agency conceded before the administrative judge that the appellant was entitled to compensation for the extra tax burden caused by the "bunching" of his income, but asserted that it could not determine the amount due until the appellant provided it with copies of his 2007 and 2008 tax returns. In her compliance recommendation, the administrative judge ordered the appellant to provide the agency with copies of his 2007 and 2008 tax returns and ordered the agency to pay the appellant's additional tax burden.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its November 23, 2009 submission to the Board, the agency argued for the first time that the administrative judge erred when she ordered it to compensate the appellant for any additional tax burden as a consequence of the back pay award. The appellant responded that the agency had "repeatedly promised to pay [him] the amount necessary to compensate him for [the] additional income tax burden" as a result of having received 2007 income in 2008.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the administrative judge's order, it is well settled that the Board lacks the authority to remedy the tax consequences of a back pay award. <span class="Italic">E.g. Kinney v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 602, &#x00B6; 16 (2006); <span class="Italic">Hopkins v. Department of the Navy,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 11, &#x00B6; 2 (2000); <span class="Italic">Harris v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 53 M.S.P.R. 78, 82 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 988 F.2d 130 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table). Furthermore, nothing in the record suggests that the agency's statements regarding compensating the appellant for the tax consequences of the back pay award are enforceable before the Board. For example, there is no indication that the agency's statements that it would pay the tax consequences were made as part of a settlement agreement entered into the record before the Board or that the compensation is required by an agency rule, regulation, or collective bargaining agreement. We understand the appellant's frustration with the agency's change in position, but the Board lacks the authority to order the agency to offset the additional tax burden caused by the back pay payment. In sum, we agree with the agency that the administrative judge erred in her order regarding the payment of any additional tax burden as a consequence of the back pay award.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Madison v. DOD</span>, 363 Fed. Appx. 26, 28 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP), the employee was restored to duty as a result of a Board appeal and the agency made errors in backpay calculations and payments. The employee requested, and demanded as a component of enforcement proceedings, assurances from the agency that the agency's reports to IRS would be for the corrected, not inflated amounts of pay. Although the court voiced some sympathy for the employee's concerns about tax problems in the future because of the agency's past payroll computation errors, the court's actions were not so empathetic:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the agency's failure to provide Ms. Madison with copies or advance copies of certain tax forms, her concern appears to have been to ensure that the agency's overpayment errors are not replicated in the documentation provided to the IRS. In view of the agency's several erroneous payments to Ms. Madison, her concerns are understandable. However, the Board correctly held that a PFE is not an appropriate avenue for obtaining assurances of correctness of tax reporting by the agency. <span class="Italic">See Kinney,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. at 602, &#x00B6; 16 ("Although the appellant complains that he has been given no assurances from the agency regarding his tax liability based on his back-pay and interest award, we note that neither the settlement agreement nor the Board's authority provides for such assurances."); <span class="Italic">Hopkins v. Department of Navy</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 11, 12 (2000) ("The Board lacks authority to remedy the tax consequences of back pay awards."). Although Ms. Madison complains that the agency did not meet her requests for copies of the IRS filings, the Board's compliance proceedings "are designed to protect an appellant from being deprived of Board-ordered relief rather than referee every real or perceived grievance between the employee and the agency for years to come." <span class="Italic">Carson v. Department of Energ</span>y, 398 F.3d 1369, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (internal quotes omitted). We affirm the Board's denial of Ms. Madison's PFE as it relates to the two issues directed to the tax forms.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wilson v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 156, 157-60 (1988), analyzed cases and statutes and declined to award additional compensation equal to an income tax constructive surcharge paid by an appellant on his back pay recovery following success before the EEOC in a mixed case appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant contends that he is entitled as part of his back pay award to compensation for the increased tax liability he will incur as a result of his removal and an intervening change in the tax laws. The Postal Service regulations under which the Board's award was made do not authorize such compensation. Appellant does not contend otherwise, but instead bases his claim on his having prevailed on a finding of race discrimination and on the "make whole" purpose of the remedies provided by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e <span class="Italic">et seq.,</span> as described by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody,</span> 422 U.S. 405, 418-19, 95 S. Ct. 2362, 2372, 45 L. Ed.2d 280 (1975). However, <span class="Italic">Albemarle</span>, which discusses back pay as part of the equitable relief available under Title VII, makes no mention of damages for incidental or consequential losses which are not part of the employment relationship. Moreover, the courts of appeals have overwhelmingly determined that compensatory damages other than back pay and restoration of lost work benefits are not available under Title VII. While certain types of equitable relief such as back pay and restoration of benefits are "compensatory," the courts have concluded that Title VII does not authorize monetary awards to compensate for "consequential damages" of employment discrimination such as those appellant seeks. <span class="Italic">E.g., Protos v. Volkswagen of America, Inc.</span>, 797 F.2d 129, 137-39 (3rd Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 479 U.S. 972, 107 S. Ct. 474, 93 L. Ed.2d 418 (1986) (diminished unemployment benefits after subsequent layoff which would have occurred in any event); <span class="Italic">Walker v. Ford Motor Co.,</span> 684 F.2d 1355, 1363-64, nn. 12 &#x0026; 16 (11th Cir. 1982) (moving expenses, loss on sale of assets, and ruined credit rating); <span class="Italic">Farmer v. ARA Services, Inc.</span>, 660 F.2d 1096, 1107 (6th Cir. 1981) (emotional distress).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The decision on which the administrative judge chiefly relies, <span class="Italic">Sears v. Atchison, Topeka, &#x0026; Santa Fe Railway, Co.,</span> 749 F.2d 1451 (10th Cir. 1984), <span class="Italic">cert. denied sub nom. United Transportation Union v. Sears,</span> 471 U.S. 1099, 105 S. Ct. 2322, 85 L. Ed.2d 840 (1985), is the only court of appeals decision under Title VII to reach a different conclusion. There the 10th Circuit relied on the protracted nature of the litigation to sustain an award compensating plaintiffs for their additional tax liability resulting from receipt of over seventeen years of back pay in one lump sum. At the same time, however, the court acknowledged that such a "tax component" may not be appropriate in a typical Title VII case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1456. The court did not discuss contrary precedent in the 10th Circuit, <span class="Italic">Pearson v. Western Electric Co.,</span> 542 F.2d 1150, 1151-52 (10th Cir. 1976), where the court ruled that neither compensatory nor punitive damages are authorized by Title VII and denied damages for mental distress and loss of a good credit rating.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whatever the merits of the <span class="Italic">Sears</span> court's reliance on the extraordinary length of the litigation there to depart from the general rule, there is less reason to do so here, given the much shorter period (about five years) for which appellant was awarded back pay. Another consideration supporting the Board's adherence to the general rule that losses outside the employment relationship are not compensable under Title VII is that the relief appellant seeks is not against a private employer, but against the federal government. A remedy against the sovereign requires express consent and is not to be implied. <span class="Italic">Lehman v. Nakshian,</span> 453 U.S. 156, 161, 101 S. Ct. 2698, 2701, 69 L. Ed.2d 548 (1981).[2] Mindful of this rule and the absence of any explicit statutory authorization of consequential damages, the Board finds that it lacks authority under Title VII or any other law to award appellant the additional compensation which he seeks. <span class="Italic">See Carter v. Marshall,</span> 457 F. Supp. 38, 40 (D.D.C. 1978) (noting, in a suit against the federal government, the parties' agreement that Title VII does not authorize compensatory damages). <span class="Italic">Cf. Smith v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 778 F.2d 258, 261-63 (5th Cir. 1985) (finding that compensatory damages are not recoverable against the federal government in an age discrimination suit under 29 USC &#x00A7; 633a in the absence of explicit authorization for their recovery and in light of their unavailability under Title VII, which was the pattern for section 633a).[3] <span class="Italic">Cf. also</span> 61 Comp. Gen. 578, 580 (1982) (neither Back Pay Act nor any other authority provides for payment of compensatory damages on correction of personnel action); <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Department of Transportation</span>, 32 MSPR 488, 495 (1987) (same). Thus we reject the administrative judge's recommendation on this issue and find that agency compliance with the Board's order does not require compensation of appellant for any increase in his tax liability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;As a federal entity, <span class="Italic">see</span> 39 USC &#x00A7; 201, the Postal [S]ervice is protected by sovereign immunity. The question of whether 39 USC &#x00A7; 401(l), by authorizing the Postal Service to sue and be sued in its own name, waives the Postal Service's immunity from awards of <span class="Italic">interest</span> on back pay under Title VII is now before the Supreme Court. <span class="Italic">Loeffler v. Tisch,</span> 806 F.2d 817 (8th Cir. 1986) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), <span class="Italic">cert. granted</span>, __U.S.__, 107 S. Ct. 3227, 97 L. Ed.2d 733 (1987). The question of whether the Postal Service should be treated like a private employer for purposes of awarding interest is, of course, a different issue from the question of whether Title VII authorizes consequential damages against <span class="Italic">any</span> employer, a question answered in the negative by most courts of appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The administrative judge also relied on <span class="Italic">Gelof v. Papineau,</span> 648 F. Supp. 912, 930 (D. Del. 1986), awarding damages against a state employer under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 USC &#x00A7; 621 <span class="Italic">et seq.,</span> to compensate for the additional tax consequences the plaintiff suffered from receiving a lump sum award after repeal of the income tax averaging provisions.
