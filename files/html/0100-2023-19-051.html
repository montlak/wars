<p class="Body-Text">One way--not the only way--of establishing discrimination or reprisal is through what is styled as a "convincing mosaic" evidence. Arbitration review, with a determination of reprisal (an EEOC AJ found discrimination on appellant's prior nonpromotion claims), provided analysis looking to the totality of evidence--a "convincing mosaic"--of reprisal in <span class="Italic">FitzGerald v. DHS</span>, 107 MSPR 666, 674-79 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-28, 2008 MSPB 17 (2008) (Chairman McPhie dissenting) (clarified or overruled in part by <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SAVAGE_TOMMIE_G_AT_0752_11_0634_I_2_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1217635.pdf">122 MSPR 612</a>, 635-36 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 42-43, 2015 MSPB 51 (2015), <span class="Italic">supra</span> and <span class="Italic">post</span>)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For an appellant to prevail on a contention of illegal retaliation for EEO activity, she has the burden of showing that: (1) She engaged in a protected activity; (2) the accused official knew of the protected activity; (3) the adverse action under review could have been retaliation under the circumstances; and (4) there was a genuine nexus between the alleged retaliation and the adverse action.<span class="Italic"> Warren v. Department of the Army,</span> 804 F.2d 654, 656-58 (Fed. Cir. 1986);<span class="Italic"> Dobruck v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 578, &#x00B6; 19 (2006),<span class="Italic"> aff'd,</span> 212 Fed. Appx. 997 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Where there has been a hearing and the record is complete, as is the case here, the Board will not employ a traditional burden-shifting order of analysis; rather, inquiry proceeds directly to the ultimate question of whether, upon weighing all of the evidence, the appellant has met her overall burden of proving illegal retaliation. <span class="Italic">Simien v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 237, &#x00B6; 28 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the arbitrator failed to analyze the retaliation issue in accordance with this legal standard. The appellant points out that the arbitrator did not cite this or any other standard for retaliation in the decision. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 19. She further argues that the arbitrator failed to consider the temporal proximity between her activity and the removal and the fact that both the proposing and deciding officials admitted that they knew about her activity. The appellant's arguments have merit. The arbitrator did not cite any legal standard when he evaluated the evidence, and his analysis did not follow the <span class="Italic">Warren</span> framework. For this reason, we find that the arbitrator has made a legal error that permits the Board to make its own findings. <span class="Italic">See Young v. Department of Justice,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 326, &#x00B6; 3 (2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant engaged in protected activity. The arbitrator found that the deciding official, Bruce Bowen, knew of her EEO activity. The proposing official, Marie Bauer, also testified that she knew of the activity. Because the record is complete, we need not address the third <span class="Italic">Warren</span> criterion, whether the removal action could have been retaliation, and we proceed directly to the fourth criterion, whether the appellant showed that she was removed because of her EEO activity. <span class="Italic">See Simien,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 237, &#x00B6; 28; <span class="Italic">see also Dobruck,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 578, &#x00B6; 20. This consideration requires the Board to weigh the gravity of the charged misconduct against the intensity of the agency's motive to retaliate. <span class="Italic">Warren,</span> 804 F.2d at 658. The Board may consider circumstantial evidence in making such a determination. <span class="Italic">Wildeman v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. 313, 320 (1984).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">A mosaic is a work of visual art composed of a large number of tiny tiles that fit smoothly with each other, a little like a crossword puzzle. A case of discrimination can likewise be made by assembling a number of pieces of evidence none meaningful in itself, consistent with the proposition of statistical theory that a number of observations each of which supports a proposition only weakly can, when taken as a whole, provide strong support if all point in the same direction: 'a number of weak proofs can add up to a strong proof.'</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The EEOC Compliance Manual states as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">There is no requirement that the entity charged with retaliation be the same as the entity whose allegedly discriminatory practices were opposed by the charging party. For example, a violation would be found if a respondent refused to hire the charging party because it was aware that she opposed the previous employer's allegedly discriminatory practices.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">EEOC Compliance Manual, No. 915.003 at 8-9 (May 20, 1998). The arbitrator thus erred when he limited the appellant to introducing evidence of retaliation only where such evidence "could be connected to any of the management officials who played a role in the decision to terminate" the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additional circumstantial evidence includes the fact that the appellant has a long history of EEO activity, most of it involving claims against the component of the agency from which the appellant was removed, the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is also evidence in the record that agency managers resented the appellant's EEO activity....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When all of the foregoing circumstantial evidence is taken together, a pattern of retaliation emerges. Accordingly, we find sufficient evidence in the record to establish a causal link between the appellant's EEO activity and the action to remove her.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, the administrative judge determined that the appellant established that the agency's adverse action was taken in retaliation for her prior Board appeal, her protected EEO activity, and her grievances. The Board is authorized to adjudicate a claim of retaliation for activities protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) when, as here, such a claim is raised as an affirmative defense to an otherwise appealable action. <span class="Italic">See Moss v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 309, &#x00B6; 10, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 230 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (Table). In his detailed, persuasive analysis of the relevant evidence, the administrative judge below found a "convincing mosaic" of retaliation against the appellant. He specifically found "clear evidence of retaliatory motive on the part of Ammari, who was without question the engine driving the agency's efforts to terminate the appellant by other means in the wake of its unsuccessful removal for performance based reasons." We believe there is ample evidence supporting the administrative judge's findings of retaliation for filing a Board appeal and grievances, and find no basis to disturb them. In addition, because the appellant may be entitled to compensatory damages based on her related claim of retaliation for protected EEO activity, the administrative judge properly considered this claim, and we discuss it in more detail below. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9); <span class="Italic">Harris v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 193, &#x00B6; 11 (2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A claim of retaliation for EEO activity is cognizable not only under section 2302(b)(9), which prohibits retaliation for "the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation," but also under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1)(A), i.e., as a violation of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16. <span class="Italic">See Mahaffey v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 347, &#x00B6; 20 n.8 (2007); <span id="Page_3404"></span><span class="Italic">Parnell v. Department of the Army</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 128, 131 (1993). Additionally, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1), where an appellant has been affected by an appealable action, the Board is obliged, notwithstanding any other provision of law, to adjudicate claims of discrimination prohibited under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16. Therefore, we consider the appellant's retaliation claim under Title VII and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) and (9). Because the standards of proof require the same analysis, however, separate consideration of these "claims" is unnecessary. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mahaffey</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 347, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-22.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To prevail on a contention of illegal retaliation for EEO activity in violation of &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), an appellant must show that: (1) she engaged in activity protected under the section; (2) the accused official had knew of the protected activity; (3) the adverse action could have been retaliation under the circumstances; and (4) there was a genuine nexus between the alleged retaliation and the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Kohler v. Department of the Navy</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 510, &#x00B6; 11 (2008). Because the evidentiary record here is complete, the Board need not consider whether the appellant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case; rather, it proceeds to the ultimate question of whether the appellant met her overall burden of proving retaliation. <span class="Italic">Simien v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 237, &#x00B6; 28 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may consider circumstantial evidence in determining whether the appellant has met her burden of showing retaliation. <span class="Italic">Wildeman v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 313, 320 (1984). The Board has stated that, to establish retaliation using circumstantial evidence, an appellant must provide evidence showing a "convincing mosaic" of retaliation against her. <span class="Italic">See Kohler</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 510, &#x00B6; 13; <span class="Italic">FitzGerald v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 666, &#x00B6; 20 (2008). In <span class="Italic">Kohler</span>, the Board further explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">As a general rule, this mosaic has been defined to include three general types of evidence: (1) evidence of suspicious timing, ambiguous oral or written statements, behavior toward or comments directed at other employees in the protected group, and other bits and pieces from which an inference of retaliatory intent might be drawn; (2) evidence that employees similarly situated to the appellant have been better treated; and (3) evidence that the employer's stated reason for its actions is pretextual. Where an employer's motives or state of mind are relevant, the record must be carefully scrutinized for circumstantial evidence that would support an inference of retaliatory animus.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Kohler</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 510, &#x00B6; 13 (citations omitted). Here, the administrative judge found that the preponderant evidence of record establishes that: (1) the appellant engaged in protected activity; (2) the accused officials knew of such activity; (3) the adverse action under review could, under the circumstances, have been retaliation; and (4) a nexus existed between the motive and the subsequent action. As discussed below, the administrative judge's findings of fact and conclusions of law are supported by the record, and we find no basis to disturb them on review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that the appellant engaged in protected EEO activity. Specifically, the administrative judge noted that on November 5, 2007, Ammari issued a proposal to remove the appellant for performance-based reasons, and the agency effected her removal on January 25, 2008. In her Board appeal of that action, the appellant raised an affirmative defense of discrimination, which consisted primarily of allegations that Ammari mimicked an Asian man who had made an anonymous telephone complaint to the TIGTA office, and that he had made comments about another Asian employee that evinced his dislike of Asians. The administrative judge reversed the removal on the grounds that the agency's performance standards were invalid, but found that the appellant did not establish her discrimination claim. As a result of that initial decision, which later became a final Board order, the appellant was reinstated to her position in May 2009. The appellant petitioned the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for review of the Board's final order, and the Commission concurred in the Board's finding of no discrimination. Furthermore, both Ammari and the deciding official, Peacock, testified that they were aware of the foregoing activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is also evident that the appellant was treated in an adverse fashion by the agency after she engaged in protected activity, including protected EEO activity. In the initial decision, the administrative judge set forth a detailed narrative concerning Ammari's involvement in taking, or otherwise effecting, disciplinary action against the appellant following her reinstatement in May 2009 by order of the Board, and culminating in the suspension before the Board in this appeal. This included, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>: (1) issuing the appellant a reprimand in August 2009 for failure to follow instructions due to her failures to maintain all case-related files on SharePoint as directed by her supervisors; and (2) issuing the appellant another reprimand in September 2009 for unauthorized use of her Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) to conduct official business. Further, as discussed above, in October 2009, the agency also proposed to remove the appellant on a charge of conversion of government property in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 641.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In review, the agency contends that the administrative judge erred by readjudicating the merits of the appellant's prior discipline. It contends that, in doing so, the administrative judge ran afoul of the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Bolling v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 9 M.S.P.R. 335, 339-40 (1981). The agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Bolling</span> is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Bolling,</span> the Board held that its review of a prior disciplinary action in the context of a penalty determination is limited to determining whether that action is clearly erroneous, if the employee was informed of the action in writing, the action is a matter of record, and the employee was permitted to dispute the charges before a higher level of authority than the one that imposed the discipline. 9 M.S.P.R. at 339-40. Because <span class="Italic">Bolling</span> does not concern the scope of the Board's review of prior discipline in the context of an affirmative defense of reprisal, it is of little or no relevance here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the administrative judge did not readjudicate the agency's prior discipline of the appellant. Rather, in accordance with the legal framework set forth above, he properly considered the agency's treatment of the appellant after she engaged in protected activity. In order to meet her ultimate burden of proof on retaliation for EEO activity, the appellant must establish not only that she engaged in protected activity and that the accused official was aware of that activity, but also that there is a "genuine nexus" between the alleged retaliatory motive and the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Pyun v. Social Security Administration</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 249, &#x00B6; 11 (2009); <span class="Italic">cf. Warren v. Department of the Army</span>, 804 F.2d 654, 658 (Fed. Cir. 1986). To establish a genuine nexus, the appellant must show that the action was taken because of the protected activity. <span class="Italic">Pyun</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 249, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">Murry v. General Services Administration</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 560, &#x00B6; 6 (2003). This requires the Board to weigh the severity of the appellant's alleged misconduct against the intensity of the agency's motive to retaliate. <span class="Italic">See Warren,</span> 804 F.2d at 658; <span class="Italic">Pyun</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 249, &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the administrative judge appropriately considered the suspicious timing of this treatment--immediately following her reinstatement to duty following her prior Board appeal-in determining whether the appellant had established a "convincing mosaic" of retaliatory intent. <span class="Italic">See Kohler</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 510, &#x00B6; 13. In finding such a mosaic in this case, the administrative judge determined that Ammari's efforts to effect disciplinary action against the appellant following her reinstatement were "relentless and their timing--in immediate response to either the appellant's grievances or to the agency's mitigation of more serious proposed actions--suspicious at best." The administrative judge credited the appellant's contention that, but for her prior Board appeal, EEO activity and grievances, Ammari would not have referred her email response at issue to IAD, or aggressively pursued that referral in the face of IAD's initial decision not to do so itself. Furthermore, as we already stated, the administrative judge found clear evidence of retaliatory motive on the part of Ammari, who he determined was "the engine driving the agency's efforts to terminate the appellant by other means in the wake of its unsuccessful removal for performance-based reasons," noting that Ammari was the proposing official in the earlier action and, upon her reinstatement, was also instrumental in lesser disciplinary actions and two more proposed removals against her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency responds that Ammari had non-retaliatory reasons for his prior discipline of the appellant and that he acted appropriately regarding this discipline. Again, this does not establish that the administrative judge erred in his analysis of the agency's treatment of the appellant upon her reinstatement. As the court recognized in <span class="Italic">Warren,</span> "the mere fact the agency has a good case against the employee does not win the case for the agency if the evidence shows that the motive for invoking the misconduct or inadequate performance as a reason for discharge is predominantly retaliation, making the asserted reasons pretextual and establishing the 'nexus.'" 804 F.2d at 658. Here, the administrative judge determined, as the finder of fact, that the preponderance of the evidence established that Ammari's motive for imposing discipline for the appellant's alleged misconduct and performance issues was reprisal for her protected activity. In doing so, the administrative judge did not credit Ammari's testimony that he was not bothered by the appellant's reinstatement by the Board, finding that his testimony was inconsistent with that of agency witness and proposing official Parodi, as well as the appellant's written statement to her fourth-level supervisor that Ammari loudly referred to the TIGTA counsel who represented the agency in her earlier Board appeal as "idiots." The agency's petition for review provides no basis for disturbing his resulting findings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, in considering motive, the administrative judge appropriately considered the gravity of the misconduct alleged by the agency to justify its treatment of the appellant. Specifically, the administrative judge noted that "one [disciplinary action] directly related to her participation in the Board appeal process, and the other [was] a clearly overreaching reaction to an ultimately unproven offense." <span class="Italic">See Yunus v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 242 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (when examining the strength of the agency's evidence, the Board will look at the evidence the agency had before it when it took the alleged retaliatory action); <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Department of the Interior,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 30 (2011); <span class="Italic">Russell <span id="Page_3405"></span>v. Department of Justice,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. 317, 326 (1997). In this regard, we also note that the deciding official, Peacock, testified that, in selecting the penalty at issue in this appeal, he considered the appellant's allegedly substandard performance, even though the Board had determined in the appellant's prior appeal that the agency did not apply a valid performance standard to the appellant's performance of her duties. In sum, we find no error in administrative judge's conclusion that in light of the fact that the one charge against the appellant was not sustained, and in light of the strong evidence of retaliatory motivation, the agency would not have taken the same action against her in the absence of that motivation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also contends that, even assuming that Ammari had a motive to retaliate against the appellant, he could not have violated section 2302(b), which, by its terms, applies to employees who have "authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action." It further asserts that because "Ammari simply provided some of the information that was the basis of the underlying charge," but did not recommend a personnel action to either the proposing official, Parodi, or the deciding official, Peacock, Ammari's motive to retaliate could not have tainted the agency's decision. In examining retaliatory motive for an agency action, however, the officials "involved" in the action may encompass more than just the proposing or deciding officials, and may include other officials upon whom the proposing or deciding official relied for information. <span class="Italic">See Mangano v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 658, &#x00B6; 30 (2008); <span class="Italic">Redschlag v. Department of the Army,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 589, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 65-66 (2001), <span class="Italic">dismissed</span>, 32 Fed. Appx. 543 (Fed. Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant, in effect, claims that Ammari retaliated against her by immediately referring her response to his email to IAD for investigation, rather than simply raising any concerns that he may have had about it with her. Moreover, Ammari did not merely refer his allegations to IAD once--he did so twice and subsequently solicited assistance from the TIGTA Chief Counsel's office for action. An investigation is not a personnel action <span class="Italic">per se</span>, but the Board will consider evidence of the conduct of an agency investigation when it is so closely related to a personnel action that it could have been pretext for gathering evidence to use to retaliate against an employee. <span class="Italic">Cf. Johnson v. Department of Justice,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 624, &#x00B6; 7 (2007) (involving alleged reprisal for whistleblowing by investigation). To hold otherwise would sanction the use of a purely retaliatory tool, selective investigations. <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 325. A retaliatory investigation claim should be considered in determining the strength of the agency's evidence supporting the agency's action. <span class="Italic">See Mangano,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 658, &#x00B6; 44; <span class="Italic">Russell,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. at 323-28. In making this determination, the Board looks at the investigation's origins and the reason the matter was referred for investigation. <span class="Italic">Mangano,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 658, &#x00B6; 38; <span class="Italic">Russell,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. at 323-25.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Ammari referred the appellant's response to his October 15, 2009 email to IAD for investigation and that email ultimately formed the basis of the charge in the instant suspension action, we conclude that the investigation is so closely related to the suspension that it could have been pretext for gathering evidence to use to retaliate against the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Mangano,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 658, &#x00B6; 44; <span class="Italic">Johnson,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 624, &#x00B6; 7. Thus, the administrative judge properly considered Ammari's referral for investigation in determining whether the appellant had provided evidence showing a "convincing mosaic" of retaliation against her. <span class="Italic">See Kohler,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 510, &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the appellant claimed in her response to the agency's proposal notice that, upon her reinstatement in May 2009, Ammari "began creating a 'disciplinary record' against" her, and that she transferred out of his work group "after years of his harassment and retaliation." The agency's decision letter, however, makes no mention of the appellant's claims. The agency's failure to investigate the appellant's allegations concerning Ammari would also tend to indicate that the stated reason for its actions were a pretext for reprisal. <span class="Italic">Cf. Fulton v. Department of the Army,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 79, &#x00B6; 14 (2003) (to have proceeded with personnel actions without investigating whether the appellant's allegations of disparate treatment were true would tend to indicate that the stated reasons for these personnel actions were a pretext for retaliation for whistleblowing).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency, citing the Supreme Court's recent holding in <span class="Italic">Staub v. Proctor Hospital</span>, 131 S. Ct. 1186 (2011), argues that, even assuming Ammari's referral to IAD could have tainted the deciding official's determination, the appellant nonetheless failed to demonstrate a nexus between Ammari's retaliatory motive and the adverse action. In <span class="Italic">Staub</span>, the Court ruled that "if a supervisor performs an act motivated by antimilitary animus that is intended by the supervisor to cause an adverse employment action, and if that act is a proximate cause of the ultimate employment action, then the employer is liable under [the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA)]." <span class="Italic">Staub</span>, 131 S. Ct. at 1194. It also stated, however, that "[I]f the employer's investigation results in an adverse action for reasons unrelated to the supervisor's original biased action...then the employer will not be liable." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1193. The agency argues that Ammari's input to IAD could not have been the proximate cause of the deciding official's decision because "the purpose of IAD's and [the proposing official's] inquiries was to determine whether...Ammari's allegations had a factual basis [, and t]heir inquiries substantiated the allegations independent of ASAC Ammari's input."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has not determined whether the holding in <span class="Italic">Staub</span> applies to reprisal cases under section 2302(b)(9). Unlike USERRA, an appellant may not establish EEO reprisal by merely showing that her protected activity was a motivating factor<span class="Italic">.</span> Rather, as stated above, an appellant alleging EEO reprisal must instead prove that the action was taken because of the protected activity. <span class="Italic">Pyun</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 249, &#x00B6; 12. If the Board were to apply <span class="Italic">Staub</span> directly to an EEO reprisal case, the appellant would then only need to prove her supervisor's animus was directly related to the adverse action and not that the animus was necessary to bring about the action. <span class="Italic">See Staub,</span> 131 S. Ct. at 1192 ("Proximate cause requires only some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged, and excludes only those links that are too remote, purely contingent, or indirect.") (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is unnecessary for the Board to determine, in the context of this appeal, whether the Court's holding in <span class="Italic">Staub</span> applies to EEO reprisal cases. As discussed above, Ammari was clearly the source of the information that ultimately formed the basis of the charge against the appellant. Moreover, as the decision letter makes clear, in determining to suspend the appellant, Peacock relied heavily on the appellant's past disciplinary record in which Ammari played an ongoing role. Further, even assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that IAD's and the proposing official's inquiries determined that Ammari's allegations had a factual basis, this does not establish that the agency's "investigation result[ed] in an adverse action for reasons unrelated to the supervisor's original biased action." <span class="Italic">Staub,</span> 131 S. Ct. at 1193. Here, the matter was investigated only because of Ammari's referral and repeated inquiries. Absent these actions and Ammari's prior discipline of the appellant, we find that the agency would not have taken action here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When all of the foregoing circumstantial evidence is taken together, a pattern of retaliation emerges. Accordingly, we find sufficient evidence in the record to establish a causal link between the appellant's protected activities and the action to suspend her. In light of the foregoing, we agree with the administrative judge and find that the appellant established her claim of retaliation under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) and (9), and Title VII.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">According to EEOC, as its opinion was summarized in an appeal returning to the Board from the Commission, the "convincing mosaic" is not a required method of proof; it is but one way to establish reprisal, <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Interior</span>, AT-0752-09-0860-E-1 (NP 8/15/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its decision, the EEOC first clarified its view about the role of the "convincing mosaic" in federal sector retaliation cases. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of the Interior</span>, EEOC Petition No. 0320110050 at 11-12 (July 16, 2014). The EEOC explained that the "convincing mosaic" is "a useful way to describe how several facts may add up to sufficient evidence to discredit an employer's explanation and demonstrate a causal connection between the prior protected activity and the challenged adverse action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 12. The EEOC stated that it did not intend to promulgate a new standard whereby circumstantial evidence in a retaliation case must have a mosaic-like character, or to require appellants to meet a more demanding evidentiary standard, and that it also did not intend to state a preference for one evidentiary framework over another, but, rather to indicate that, under certain evidentiary scenarios, the "convincing mosaic" can serve as a useful option for establishing the causal connection in retaliation cases. The EEOC found that the Board's administrative judge erred in insisting that an appellant "must" provide evidence showing a "convincing mosaic" of retaliation in order to prove retaliation using circumstantial evidence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Troupe v. May Department Stores Company</span>, 20 F.3d 734 (7th Cir. 1994), a case involving a claim of pregnancy discrimination, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit provided a useful taxonomy of the "[d]fferent kinds and combinations of evidence" that may support an inference that intentional discrimination or retaliation was a motivating factor in an employment action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 736. One kind is direct evidence, i.e., "evidence that can be interpreted as an acknowledgment of discriminatory intent[.] " <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In addition to direct evidence, the court identified and distinguished three types of circumstantial evidence. The first kind "consists of suspicious timing, ambiguous statements oral or written, behavior toward or comments directed at other employees in the protected group, and other bits and pieces from which an inference of discriminatory intent might be drawn." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Considered together, the court explained, such bits and pieces may compose "a convincing mosaic of discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 737. The second kind of circumstantial evidence is comparator evidence, consisting of "evidence, whether or not rigorously statistical, that employees similarly situated to the plaintiff other than in the characteristic...on which an employer is forbidden to base a difference in treatment received systematically better treatment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 736. The third kind consists of evidence that the agency's stated reason for its action is "unworthy of belief, a mere pretext for discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court stressed that none of the aforementioned types of evidence, i.e., direct, "convincing mosaic," comparator, or pretext, will be needed in every case. "Each type of evidence," the court explained, "is sufficient by itself...to support a judgment for [the employee]; or they can be used together." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
