<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-214"><span class="space">a.</span> Priority Consideration: Necessity for Position to Be Filled by Another Person</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 8151:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Under regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;the department or agency which was the last employer shall, if the injury or disability is overcome within a period of more than one year after the date of commencement of compensation, make all reasonable efforts to place, and accord priority to placing, the employee in his former or equivalent position within such department or agency, or within any other department or agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An OPM regulation, 5 CFR 353.301 (2022), provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Restoration rights</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Fully recovered after 1 year. An employee who separated because of a compensable injury and whose full recovery takes longer than 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation began (or from the time compensable disability recurs if the recurrence begins after the injured employee resumes regular full-time employment with the United States), is entitled to priority consideration, agencywide, for restoration to the position he or she left or an equivalent one provided he or she applies for reappointment within 30 days of the cessation of compensation. Priority consideration is accorded by entering the individual on the agency's reemployment priority list for the competitive service or reemployment list for the excepted service. If the individual cannot be placed in the former commuting area, he or she is entitled to priority consideration for an equivalent position elsewhere in the agency. (See parts 302 and 330 of this chapter for more information on how this may be accomplished for the excepted and competitive services, respectively.) This subpart also applies when an injured employee accepts a lower-graded position in lieu of separation and subsequently fully recovers.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Denial or restoration is appealable to the Board, 5 CFR 353.304 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Appeals to the Merit Systems Protection Board</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;An individual who fully recovers from a compensable injury more than 1 year after compensation begins may appeal to MSPB as provided for in parts 302 and 330 of this chapter for excepted and competitive service employees, respectively.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The burdens of pleading and proof for priority consideration claims cases were summarized, <span class="Italic">Key v. USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 628, 631-32 &#x00B6; 7-9 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.501, an individual who is entitled to priority reemployment consideration (i.e., an individual who takes longer than 1 year to recover from a compensable injury), may appeal to the Board from a violation of his restoration rights resulting from the agency's employment of another person. It is the appellant who bears the burden of proving jurisdiction in an appeal of an alleged denial of restoration rights. <span class="Italic">Welter v. Department of Transportation</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 414, 419 (1997); <span class="Italic">Hicks v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 137, 140 (1995). An appellant who makes a nonfrivolous allegation that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing on the jurisdictional question. <span class="Italic">Black v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 561, 564 (1998). A nonfrivolous allegation is an allegation of fact which, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board has jurisdiction over an appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 564-65.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a nonfrivolous allegation of the Board's jurisdiction over an appeal based on the denial of priority consideration for restoration, an appellant is required to satisfy a two-pronged test, i.e., he must allege that (1) he applied to the agency for restoration rights and (2) the agency's reemployment of another person deprived him of those rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.501; <span class="Italic">Emelio v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction entitling him to a hearing, the administrative judge may consider the agency's documentary submissions; however, to the extent that the agency's evidence constitutes mere factual contradiction of the appellant's otherwise adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, the administrative judge may not weigh evidence and resolve conflicting assertions of the parties, and the agency's evidence may not be dispositive. <span class="Italic">Ferdon v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_4468"></span>The nature of the right to priority consideration of an individual who recovers after a year from the commencement of compensation was further explained, with reference to the employment of another person, <span class="Italic">White v. USPS</span>, 16 MSPR 492, 493-94 (1983):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8151(b)(2) of Title 5 U.S.C. grants certain injured or disabled Federal employees job retention rights. That provision states that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...The department or agency which was the last employer shall, if the injury or disability is overcome within a period of more than one year after the date of commencement of compensation, make all reasonable efforts to place, and accord priority to placing, the employee in his former or equivalent position within such department or agency, or any other department or agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulations also require that an employee who was separated because of compensable injury, whose recovery takes longer than 1 year, be given "priority consideration" for restoration to the position he left, or an equivalent position. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.307.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held in <span class="Italic">Raicovich v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 675 F.2d 417 (1982), that in order to accord a former employee priority consideration under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2), the former employee who was in good standing at the time of injury, and who has not engaged in egregious behavior of the sort enumerated at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.203, must be placed on an appropriate priority employment list, and be reemployed when vacancies arise. <span class="Italic">Raicovich</span> at 425. A veteran entitled to priority consideration, such as appellant, may remain on the agency's priority employment list for two years, whereas a non-veteran remains on the list for one year. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 303.303(c)(2); <span class="Italic">see also Thompson v. United States Postal Service,</span> 5 MSPB 274, 279 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order for an individual to appeal a violation of his restoration rights to the Board, he must present factual information that he was denied restoration rights because of the employment of another person. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.501. In its petition, OPM asserts that the presiding official erred in dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. OPM maintains that the agency hired two persons from outside the agency after appellant's request for restoration and therefore appellant met his burden with respect to jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence of record in this case indicates that the agency hired Mailhandlers during the two years subsequent to appellant's request for restoration. Mr. Holloway Adair, Director for Employee and Labor Relations proffered testimony to this effect and stated that the agency's general manager did not want anyone that had prior on-the-job injuries in his facility. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official stated that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he record does reveal...that other persons were hired...in Mailhandlers positions within a <span class="Italic">two year</span> time frame. Yet, those revelations are silent as to the <span class="Italic">specific dates</span> of employment of those persons by the agency. [t]he mere finding that others were hired within a time frame as broad as two years subsequent to appellants application for restoration does not meet the requisite burden of establishing the Board's jurisdiction by presenting factual information that appellant was denied restoration rights because of the employment of another person. (Emphasis in original.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This was in error. As noted above, OPM's regulations provide that a veteran, entitled to priority consideration, may remain on the agency's employment list for two years. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.303(c)(2). <span class="Italic">See also Thompson</span> at 279. The fact that appellant could not specify the dates on which others were employed within that two year period does not bar his claim. It is sufficient that he presented factual information that he was denied his rights because of the employment of another.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds, therefore, that since appellant had fully recovered from his compensable injury the agency's denial of his request for restoration was improper. Furthermore, we find that appellant established that he was denied restoration rights because of the employment of another person.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The conditional nature of the restoration right under priority consideration (and Board jurisdiction) was implied, <span class="Italic">Whitfield v. USPS</span>, 5 MSPR 239, 241 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e find the initial decision lacking, as urged by OPM in its petition, in that the presiding official's discussion of the Board's jurisdiction contains no finding as to whether the appellant established that he "was denied restoration rights because of the employment of another person," as required by 5 C.F.R. 302.501 and 1201.111(b)(1). We note that the agency witness testified at the hearing that no Special Delivery Messengers had been employed since the appellant requested re-employment by letter dated December 20, 1979, but that Letter Carriers and Clerks had been employed since that time. The record does not disclose, however, whether the latter positions are "equivalent" to that of Special Delivery Messenger or whether the appellant qualified for one of them, as required under 5 U.S.C. 815(b)(2) and 5 C.F.R. 302.201 and 353.307.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But under <span class="Italic">Whitfield,</span> it is unreasonable to require an appellant to provide specific factual information that his restoration rights were violated because of the employment of another person before the Board's appellate jurisdiction may attach. The agency must submit evidence regarding available positions, any restrictive qualification requirements, to show that it has made all reasonable efforts to reemploy the appellant. <span class="Italic">Hogg v. OPM</span>, 29 MSPR 153, 156-57 (1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Emelio v. USPS</span>, 21 MSPR 701, 703-04 (1984), a person who recovers after a year and who is entitled to priority consideration should be restored not later than when the agency seeks to fill vacancies that arise after the restoration request:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations provide that an appellant must present factual information that he or she was denied restoration rights because of the employment of another person in appealing the denial to the Board. 5 C.F.R. Section 302.501. The appellant maintained throughout his appeal that he was entitled to be restored to his former position in March 1977. He submitted a list of persons he contends were hired for positions equivalent to his former position from July 1976 through January 28, 1980. However, the record reflects that the appellant continued receiving disability payments until December 6, 1979, and did not request restoration to his former or equivalent position until October 27, 1980. The agency had to grant the appellant priority consideration only after October 27, 1980, and restore him to his former position or equivalent position as soon thereafter as vacancies arose. <span class="Italic">See Raicovich</span> at 425.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the initial decision issued January 26, 1982, is hereby REVERSED and the agency action is NOT SUSTAINED. The agency is ORDERED to reinstate the appellant to his former or equivalent position with all attendant benefits retroactive to the date after October 27, 1980, on which the agency first had an appropriate vacancy.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pugh v. USPS</span>, 81 MSPR 313, 320-21 &#x00B6; 13 (1999), determined that filling positions by reassignment does not amount to a denial of reemployment rights to the individual who recovers more than a year from compensation eligibility, for there has not been employment of another person:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision, the administrative judge did not address available positions outside the appellant's local commuting area. However, the evidence does not establish that the appellant was denied restoration rights because of the employment of another person in the local commuting area. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.501 (an individual who is entitled to priority consideration under Part 302 may appeal a violation of his restoration rights to the Board by presenting factual information that he or she was denied restoration rights because of the employment of another person). Although the appellant presented evidence to establish that the agency filled custodian positions at the Bellmawr facility after the appellant applied for restoration, the evidence indicates that the agency filled these positions by reassigning employees who were on the agency's rolls. This evidence is insufficient to establish that the agency denied the appellant's restoration rights to these positions because of the employment of another person. <span class="Italic">See Raicovich v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 675 F.2d 417, 418, 424 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (suggesting that an agency violates an employee's restoration rights only when it fills vacancies with "new employees" or "other applicants with no prior USPS association"); <span class="Italic">White v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 16 M.S.P.R. 492, 494 n.* (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 758 F.2d 663 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (Table); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.205(c)(2)(i) (allowing an agency to fill a competitive service vacancy with a current, qualified employee of the agency through reassignment despite the presence of a qualified individual on the agency's reemployment priority list). On remand, the administrative judge shall order the agency to submit evidence regarding PS-02 custodian positions that were available agencywide during the 2 year period in which the appellant was entitled to priority consideration.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A restoration delay caused by the need for the appellant to obtain medical and security clearances was not a denial of a restoration right, even if other employees were hired during that period, since the hiring of those individuals did not cause denial of the appellant's restoration right. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bennington v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 21 MSPR 190, 191-92 (1984) ("Nor did appellant present evidence or information that would have tended to support a finding that the delays were due to another's employment."). Similarly, delay in restoration caused by the need of the agency to conduct medical inquiries was not appealable without an assertion that the delay was caused by employment of another person, <span class="Italic">Tisdale v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 44 MSPR 390, 394-96 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee in the competitive service, such as the appellant, who fully recovers from a compensable injury more than 1 year from the date compensation began is entitled to priority consideration for restoration to the position he or she left, or an equivalent one, under the procedures set forth in 5 C.F.R. Part 330. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.303. This priority right means that the employee is placed on the reemployment priority list that the agency uses to select employees for appropriate vacancies as they arise. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.204, 330.205.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Benningfield v. Department of Transportation,</span> 21 M.S.P.R. 190 (1984), the Board found that it lacked jurisdiction over an appeal that was similar to the present case. In <span class="Italic">Benningfield,</span> the appellant filed an appeal of the agency's failure to restore him to his former position following cessation of compensation, alleging that the agency violated his right to priority <span id="Page_4469"></span>consideration for the position in question. In response to this appeal, the agency asserted that it was in the process of determining whether the employee satisfied the medical and security clearance requirements necessary for restoration, and would offer the employee a position if he satisfactorily completed these evaluations. Six months after the employee filed his restoration application, the agency restored him to his position. The employee, however, pursued his appeal, contending that the six-month delay violated his right to priority consideration. In denying the employee's petition for review of the initial decision that dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, the Board stated that it lacked jurisdiction because the employee did not present factual information indicating that the agency's alleged denial of his rights was due to the employment of another person. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 192. The Board also found that, because the delay in restoring the employee was caused by these necessary evaluations, the hiring of other employees during the time needed for these evaluations would not have constituted a denial of the employee's restoration rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 191-92.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board similarly lacks jurisdiction over the present appeal because the appellant has failed to even allege that the agency's alleged delay in restoring him was due to employment of another person. In both his petition for appeal and his jurisdictional submission, the appellant merely asserts that the thirteen-month delay itself violates his priority rights, and that the agency committed various administrative errors pertaining to his back pay, service computation date and retirement plan in connection with the delay. As such, the appellant's submissions fail to provide a basis for finding jurisdiction over his appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.209, 353.401(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching this conclusion, we note that the agency, rather than the appellant, is obligated to submit evidence regarding whether the appellant was denied restoration rights due to the employment of another person, and an appellant's failure to submit such evidence does not by itself preclude a finding of Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Hogg v. United States Postal Service</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 153 (1985). In the present case, however, the agency has stated in its jurisdictional submission that its delay in restoring the appellant was due to the completion of various medical and background investigations, and not due to the employment of another person. In light of this submission, and the appellant's failure to even allege that the delay in question was due to the employment of another person, we find that the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the record in the present case establishes that the agency's delay in restoring the appellant was due to the completion of necessary medical, background, and drug screening determinations. Approximately 5 months before OWCP terminated the appellant's compensation on January 17, 1988, the appellant's physician reported that the appellant was able to return to duty, and the appellant, therefore, contacted the agency regarding restoration. The agency then attempted to obtain a copy of the appellant's file from OWCP, but the appellant blocked the agency's attempt, claiming that such a disclosure by OWCP would violate the Privacy Act of 1974. In a decision dated February 3, 1988, the Office of the Solicitor of the Department of Labor determined that OWCP could release the requested information to the agency. Thus, due to the appellant's objections, the agency did not have the necessary information to make any determination regarding his restoration request until February, 1988.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After receiving and considering the OWCP file, the agency determined that the medical evidence was insufficient to determine whether the appellant could safely and effectively perform the duties of a Special Agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. On May 17, 1988, it, therefore, exercised its authority under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(a)(1), by ordering the appellant to undergo two fitness for duty examinations scheduled for the middle of June. In reports dated June 27, 1988, both doctors stated that the appellant was fit to return to his Special Agent position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two months after receiving these reports, the agency informed the appellant that it was considering him for reinstatement, but that before it could confirm an entrance-to-duty date, the appellant would have to undergo a drug screening and a full field background investigation. The agency then reinstated the appellant within 1 month after receiving favorable reports on these matters. We, therefore, conclude that the agency did not violate the appellant's restoration rights because its delay in restoring him was due to the completion of necessary investigations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant has no claim that he was denied restoration by reason of the employment of another person if the job sought was converted from civilian to military, a determination beyond the Board's review authority. <span class="Italic">Detherage v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 30 MSPR 411, 414 (1986).</p>
