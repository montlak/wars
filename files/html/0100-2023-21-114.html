<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-113"><span class="space">i.</span> Employee Mentally Incompetent to Make Adverse Election; Fraud</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An annuity providing a survivor benefit to the retiree's spouse is automatically paid unless there is a contrary election by the employee, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC 8339(j) and 5 CFR 831.601 (2022). For divestiture to occur, there must be a competent election. <span class="Italic">Pooler v. OPM</span>, 23 MSPR 51, 52-54 (1982), explained that the automatic preservation of a survivor annuity for a married employee is not defeated by election of a full lifetime annuity if the employee making that choice is mentally incompetent:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant, wife of the deceased civil service annuitant, has petitioned for review of the April 25, 1984, initial decision which affirmed the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM's) denial of her application to amend the decedent's annuity to provide her a survivor benefit. She maintains that the decedent's election of a life annuity (one not providing a survivor benefit) is invalid because the deceased was mentally incompetent when he made the election at the time of his disability retirement in September of 1980. For the reasons set forth below, we hereby GRANT the petition under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM denied appellant's application to amend the decedent's annuity based on its findings that appellant failed to show that misinformation on the retirement application led the decedent to choose the life annuity and that appellant's submissions did not establish the decedent's mental incompetence at retirement. The presiding official, however, found that reliance on misinformation in the retirement form was the sole ground permitting modification of the decedent's annuity to provide a survivor benefit, and that appellant had not demonstrated that the decedent's election was caused by such misinformation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the presiding official's inquiry, solely into whether misinformation from OPM caused the election, was too limited. <span class="Italic">See Roebling v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 22 MSPR 144, 145-46 (1984) (the allegation that the decedent's mental health affected his annuity choice does not address the issue of whether OPM's information caused an undesired annuity election). Further, because an annuity providing a survivor benefit to the retiree's spouse is automatically paid absent the retiree's election to the contrary, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.601, we find that such election is only valid when made by a mentally competent individual;[2] and that although such competency is presumed absent challenge, the spouse can demonstrate that the annuitant lacked the requisite capacity to make a valid election.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Although not specifically provided by statute or regulation as a reason to permit amendment of an annuity, mental health is generally, under appropriate circumstances, a ground for voiding or modifying contracts. <span class="Italic">See</span> 41 <span class="Italic">Am. Jur. 2nd,</span> Incompetent Persons, &#x00A7; 65 at 603. Moreover, amendment of annuity selections is permitted in other contexts. <span class="Italic">See Cheeseman and Zagorny, v. OPM, supra,</span> and cases cited therein (amendment due to OPM misinformation), and <span class="Italic">Landry v. OPM,</span> 10 MSPB 358, 10 M.S.P.R. 414 (1982) (the one year limit to elect a reduced annuity in order to obtain a survivor benefit for a new spouse waived if employee was not aware of the right); <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 831.501(c) (one year time limit to file for a disability retirement annuity waived for mental incompetence). <span class="Italic">Cf. Manzi v. United States,</span> 198 Ct. Cl. 489, 492 (1972) (resignation from employment submitted by incompetent employee void because his illness precluded him from exercising free will or from understanding the transaction).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We are justified in placing this burden of the spouse because the spouse is the one seeking to change the annuity agreement of record to obtain a benefit and because the facts surrounding the annuitant's mental health are likely to be more accessible to the spouse. <span class="Italic">See Cheeseman and Zagorny v. OPM, supra,</span> at 21 M.S.P.R. at 123-24, and cases cited therein.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, although the presiding official made no specific finding regarding the decedent's mental competence at retirement, he adequately developed and considered the underlying facts so that we can resolve the issue. <span class="Italic">See Means v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As the presiding official noted, prior to his retirement in September 1980, and until his death in February of 1982, the decedent had a severe drinking problem. Both appellant and a long-time work acquaintance of the decedent testified that his drinking caused him to exhibit irrational behavior and poor judgment rising to the level of toxic psychosis. As <span id="Page_4243"></span>evidence of the appellant's mental capacity, as early as June of 1980, the agency for which he worked refused his tendered resignation and instead assisted him in filing for disability retirement. His violent conduct and delusions led to his eviction from the family residence in the summer before his retirement. Moreover, the decedent retired only a week after his release from two months of hospitalization where he underwent serious gastrointestinal surgery, losing approximately 60 pounds during the two month period. His physician opined that he was unable to make a reasoned annuity choice given the short time between his release from the hospital and his retirement. Additionally, OPM's submissions, do not reveal any attempts to confirm the election of the life annuity made on his retirement form or any notification to appellant concerning the decedent's choice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, given the preponderant evidence of appellant's mental incapacity from retirement until his death, we conclude that his election of a life annuity cannot stand.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board considers medical evidence offered to demonstrate that the annuitant was incompetent at the time he made, or should have made, an election for a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cromwell v. OPM</span>, 8 MSPR 722 (1981). <span class="Italic">Magelitz v. OPM</span>, 118 MSPR 472, 477-79 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12, 14, 2012 MSPB 99 (2012), summarized Board law on competency to elect a survivor annuity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, OPM argued that the Board should remand the case for a determination of whether the appellant was capable of representing himself below. We find, however, that Ms. Deursch did not successfully challenge the presumption of competency. <span class="Italic">See Stubblefield v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 455, 459 (1994); <span class="Italic">Dombeck v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 43, 46 (1989). The relevant standard for mental incompetence is "an inability to handle one's personal affairs because of either physical or mental disease or injury." <span class="Italic">Rapp v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 483 F.3d 1339, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2007). In cases related to retirement annuity elections, the Board has held that the party seeking to change the annuity agreement of record bears the burden of showing that the annuitant lacked the requisite capacity to make a valid election. <span class="Italic">Stubblefield</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 459; <span class="Italic">Dombeck</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. at 46. In this case, any medical records submitted by Ms. Deursch must be sufficient to call into doubt the appellant's mental competency to prosecute his appeal <span class="Italic">pro se</span>. <span class="Italic">See Frank v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 206, &#x00B6; 12 (2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Deursch's documents do not call into doubt the appellant's mental competency to prosecute his appeal <span class="Italic">pro se</span>. There is no evidence or specific allegation concerning the appellant's inability to manage his personal affairs during the initial appeal proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Dombeck</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. at 46-47; <span class="Italic">cf. Rapp v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 674, &#x00B6; 20 (2008). According to the record, the first diagnosis of the appellant's condition occurred in August 2009, after the appellant began communicating with OPM about providing Ms. Magelitz with a former spouse survivor annuity....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the record reflects that the appellant contacted OPM in a timely manner after learning of the deposit from OPM in February 2009. The record also reflects that, on May 20, 2009, the appellant obtained an addendum to the divorce decree in an attempt to provide Ms. Magelitz with a former spouse survivor annuity. These actions preceded the appellant's diagnosis on August 28, 2009. The record also reflects that the appellant continued to act consistently by appealing to OPM in October 2009, filing a reconsideration request in January 2010, and filing a Board appeal in September 2010. The appellant represented himself during the initial Board appeal proceedings, including during a close-of-record conference with the administrative judge. Thus, according to the record before us, it appears that the appellant ably represented himself during the initial appeal. The documents that the appellant filed with OPM and with the administrative judge during the initial appeal are clear, lucid, and signed by him. In the absence of any evidence tending to demonstrate otherwise, his competency has not been sufficiently challenged so as to disturb the initial decision or warrant remand to the administrative judge. Finally, Ms. Deursch's arguments centered on the appellant's ability to make a valid election in May 2011; she did not challenge his competency during the initial appeal proceedings. Thus, Ms. Deursch did not successfully challenge the presumption of competency, and, in the absence of sufficient doubt regarding the appellant's ability to represent himself below, we decline to reopen the appeal.</p>

OPM</span>, 81 MSPR 107, 110-112 (1999) (noting that as of 1974, the law was that if an employee dies after having retired and if that individual is survived by a spouse to whom he was married at the time of retirement, the spouse was entitled to an annuity unless the employee notified the Civil Service Commission in writing at the time of retirement that he did not desire his spouse to receive the annuity; 5 USC 8341(b) (1962); the annuitant's beliefs about his marital state were immaterial, citing <span class="Italic">Jones v. United States,</span> 680 F.2d 1138 (7th Cir. 1982)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Herringdine v. OPM</span>, AT-0831-17-0179-I-1 (NP 1/24/2023), determined that a reduction of a spousal annuity would not be set aside for either mental incompetence or fraud by the employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's late husband retired from the U.S. Postal Service under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) effective November 2, 2011. On her husband's application for retirement, Standard Form (SF) 2801, he chose a reduced annuity with a partial survivor annuity for the appellant equal to 55 percent of $22 per year. The appellant signed a "Spouse's Consent to Survivor Election" form, SF 2801-2, before a notary public on October 7, 2011, indicating her consent to her husband's election of a partial survivor annuity for her of 55 percent of $22 per year. The appellant's husband passed away on April 21, 2015, and she filed an application for death benefits with OPM. OPM approved the appellant's application and began paying her a survivor annuity benefit in the amount of $5 per month.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 19, 2015, the appellant requested that OPM review its decision regarding the amount of her monthly survivor annuity benefit. She stated that she was "totally shocked" by the amount of her monthly survivor annuity and that she would not have signed the consent form if someone had explained to her that she would only receive $5 per month after her husband's death. She stated that her husband told her that, in the event of his death, she would receive a gross monthly annuity of $2,647, as indicated on a September 9, 2011 annuity estimate printout, or about half of his current monthly annuity benefit. She further stated that her husband must not have understood the effect of his election and that, in the years leading up to his retirement and thereafter, he suffered from a number of medical conditions and a "deteriorated"mental status. In a March 1, 2016 initial decision, OPM found that, given the joint election of the appellant and her husband at the time of his retirement, the rate of $5 per month was correct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The surviving spouse of a CSRS retiree is entitled to a survivor annuity in the amount of 55 percent of the retiree's annuity unless the retiree elected not to provide a survivor annuity or to provide only a partial survivor annuity, and the spouse consented to the election in writing. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8339(j)(1), 8341(b)(1); <span class="Italic">Cerilli v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 404, &#x00B6; 5 (2013); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.614. A retiree may, within 18 months after retirement, choose to elect a survivor annuity for the spouse to whom he was married at retirement if he did not previously do so or to increase the size of such an annuity. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(o)(1); <span class="Italic">Cerilli</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 404, &#x00B6; 5; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.622(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that the appellant's late husband timely elected a partial survivor annuity equal to 55 percent of $22 per year for the appellant and that she signed a SF 2801-2 before a notary public on October 7, 2011, indicating her consent to his election. In addition, the appellant has not challenged, and we discern no basis to disturb, OPM's finding that the appellant's late husband did not seek to amend his survivor annuity election during the 18 months following his retirement, despite being notified of his opportunity to do so. As noted above, however, the appellant argues on review that she is entitled to an increased survivor annuity because she and her late husband did not make a valid joint election of a partial survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that the voluntary signing of a Government form for the purpose of evidencing agreement with the terms of the form is binding, and the Government is entitled to rely on the act of signing absent a showing of fraud, duress, or mental incompetence. <span class="Italic">Braza v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 598 F.3d 1315, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>); <span class="Italic">Collins v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 45 F.3d 1569, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1995). The appellant, as the applicant for a survivor annuity and as the individual seeking to change the annuity agreement of record, has the burden to show her entitlement to the benefit she seeks by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">See Cheeseman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 791 F.2d 138, 140-41 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Dombeck v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 43, 45-46 (1989). A preponderance of the evidence is that degree of relevant evidence that a reasonable person, considering the record as a whole, would accept as sufficient to find that a contested fact is more likely to be true than untrue. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(q).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant has not shown by preponderant evidence that her late husband was mentally incompetent as to render his election invalid</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision, the administrative judge found that the record evidence was insufficient to establish that the appellant's late husband was mentally incompetent at the time of his retirement and survivor annuity election. The appellant challenges this finding on review, arguing that the administrative judge and OPM gave her argument "short shrift." She further argues that the record evidence establishes that her late husband was mentally incompetent at the time of his survivor annuity election and urges the Board to find that his election was not effective. For the reasons that follow, we agree with the administrative judge's determination that the appellant has not met her burden to show that her late husband's survivor annuity election was invalid on the <span id="Page_4244"></span>basis of mental incompetence. However, we modify the initial decision consistent with this section to further address the appellant's argument and the medical evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Annuity elections are only valid if made by mentally competent individuals. <span class="Italic">Dombeck</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. at 45-46. Although such competency is presumed absent challenge, the spouse can demonstrate that the annuitant lacked the requisite capacity to make a valid election. <span class="Italic">Pooler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 51, 53 (1984). The relevant standard for mental incompetence is "an inability to handle one's personal affairs because of either physical or mental disease or injury." <span class="Italic">Rapp v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 483 F.3d 1339, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">Magelitz v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 472, &#x00B6; 11 (2012). The Board requires medical evidence to substantiate a claim of mental incompetence. <span class="Italic">See Thieken v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 192, 194, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 11 F.3d 1074 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although it is clear that the appellant's late husband suffered from a number of serious medical conditions in the years before and after his retirement, the references in the record to his mental health issues--namely, that he suffered from a 2-day period of "progressive changes in mental status with predominant agitation" in 2012 and had mood and anger issues that were controlled with medication--do not establish that he could not handle his personal affairs during the relevant period. <span class="Italic">See Rapp</span>, 483 F.3d at 1341. To the contrary, the August 15, 2012 mental capacity assessment specifically indicates that he could manage benefits in his own best interest. Absent any medical evidence showing that the appellant's late husband was mentally incompetent when he elected a partial survivor annuity in October 2011 or at any time during the following 18 months, the subjective opinions of the appellant and her late husband's former supervisor that he was mentally incompetent are unpersuasive. <span class="Italic">See Thieken</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. at 194. Accordingly, we find no basis to disturb the administrative judge's determination that the appellant's late husband's survivor annuity election may not be set aside on the basis of mental incompetence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant has not shown by preponderant evidence that her consent to her late husband's election is invalid on the basis of fraud in the inducement</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant next argues that, if her late husband was not mentally incompetent, then he obtained her consent to his election to a partial annuity to receive an increased annuity during his lifetime through fraud in the inducement by assuring her that she would receive about half of his monthly annuity benefit in the event of his death. Although the appellant invokes the term "fraud in the inducement" for the first time on review, she asserts that she "clearly raised" this argument below when she alleged, among other things, the following in her Board pleadings: her late husband showed her the paperwork reflecting that she would receive a survivor annuity in the amount of $2,647 per month and told her that she would receive approximately half of his monthly annuity benefit as a survivor annuity; she received incorrect information and was led "to believe that she would be taken care of with his ongoing spousal annuity payments in the event of his death"; she felt she was greatly misled as to her benefits; and she was given "misinformation"about what she would receive in the event of her husband's death. We agree that she sufficiently raised this argument below and so we consider it on review. <span class="Italic">See Banks v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 268, 271 (1980) For the reasons that follow, however, we find that the appellant has not shown that her consent to her late husband's election was invalid on the basis of fraud in the inducement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, the clear statutory language provides that the surviving spouse of a CSRS annuitant is entitled to an annuity equal to 55 percent of his annuity unless, at the time of his retirement, the annuitant elected to provide no survivor annuity or a partial survivor annuity, and the spouse consented to the election in writing. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8339(j)(1), 8341(b)(1); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.614. Thus, the relevant inquiry in determining whether the appellant met her burden of proving her entitlement to an increased survivor annuity benefit is whether she effected a valid waiver of her right to one when she consented in writing to her husband's election of a partial annuity in the amount of 55 percent of $22 per year. <span class="Italic">See Luten v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 667, &#x00B6; 10 (2009). Although a "freely made choice"concerning a survivor annuity is not voidable on the basis of a unilateral mistake, a waiver of annuity benefits may be set aside as invalid if it resulted from fraud. <span class="Italic">See Braza</span>, 598 F.3d at 1320; <span class="Italic">Steele v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 458, 464 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 50 F.3d 21 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Fraud in the inducement" is defined as "occurring when a misrepresentation leads another to enter into a transaction with a false impression of the risks, duties, or obligations involved; an intentional misrepresentation of a material risk or duty reasonably relied on, thereby injuring the other party without vitiating the contract itself." <span class="Italic">Wofford v. Department of Justice</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 7 (2010) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 671 (10th ed. 1999)). To establish misrepresentation, the appellant must show that a reasonable person would have been misled by the misinformation. <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 12 (2009), <span class="Italic">aff'd in part, vacated in part</span>, 591 F.3d 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, even if the appellant's late husband intentionally misled her regarding the effect of his election and her consent thereto, we cannot find that a reasonable person would have been misled by the misinformation as to render her consent invalid on the basis of fraud. The SF 2801-2, which the appellant signed before a notary public on September 16, 2011, and October 7, 2011, is clear on its face and sufficiently informed her of the effect of consenting to her late husband's election to provide her a partial annuity in the amount of 55 percent of $22 per year.[6] <span class="Italic">See Braza</span>, 598 F.3d at 1319-20 (holding that a prior version of SF 2801-2 "provides sufficient notice to alert readers to its consequences upon reasonable review and is explicit enough for the act of signing the form to evidence agreement with the terms of the form"). Although the appellant was shown a printout reflecting that she would receive a surviving spouse gross monthly annuity of $2,647, the printout--labeled "annuity estimate as of pay period 18 of 2011"--clearly indicates it is an estimate. Therefore, we find that the appellant has not shown that her consent to her husband's election was invalid on the basis of fraud in the inducement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Specifically, the SF 2801-2 states in the instructions section that "[i]f you are married and you do not elect a reduced annuity to provide a maximum survivor annuity for your current spouse, complete Part 1." The appellant's late husband filled out Part 1, electing the third option--"[a] partial survivor annuity for my current spouse equal to 55% of $22.00 a year." Part 2 of the form indicates that it is to be completed by the current spouse of the retiring employee and provides as follows: "I freely consent to the survivor annuity election described in Part 1...I also understand that my consent is final (not revocable)." Part 3 was completed by a notary public who certified that the appellant presented identification, signed the form, and acknowledged that her consent was freely given. The general information section of the form further provides that "[t]he law requires that a retiring, married employee must elect to provide a survivor annuity for a current spouse <span class="Italic">unless</span> the current spouse consents to some other election by signing this form."Id. (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant has not established any other basis to find that her consent to her late husband's election of a partial survivor annuity was invalid</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues on review that the SF 2801-2 was confusing and failed to meet the notice and consent requirements of the Spouse Equity Act. Although she alleged below that she did not understand the effect of giving her consent to her late husband's election and that it was not sufficiently explained to her, she did not challenge the language of the form itself. Therefore, we need not consider this argument raised for the first time on review. <span class="Italic">See Cerilli</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 404, &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">Banks</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. at 271. Nonetheless, as discussed above, we find that the SF 2801-2 sufficiently placed the appellant on notice of the consequence of giving her consent to her husband's election of a partial survivor annuity in the amount of 55 percent of $22 per year. <span class="Italic">See Braza</span>, 598 F.3d at 1319-20. Moreover, we find no merit to her argument that the SF 2801-2 falls short of any notice and consent requirements contained in the Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-615 &#x00A7; 2, 98 Stat. 3195. That the appellant signed the SF 2801-2 without reading it or without understanding it, instead relying on her late husband's assurances, "does not release her from the binding effect of the waiver under controlling law"and does not invalidate her waiver of her entitlement to a full survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">See Braza</span>, 598 F.3d at 1321.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further argues that her late husband's severe health issues and the likelihood that his death "would occur relatively quickly" demonstrate "the absolute absurdity of a knowing consent to a survivor annuity of $1.00 per month." Although we sympathize with the appellant's situation, neither the Board, nor OPM, may grant retirement benefits on the basis of equitable considerations when granting such benefits is not otherwise permitted by law. <span class="Italic">See Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. 414, 416 (1990); <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 690, 694 (1996). Therefore, we find no basis to disturb the administrative judge's determination that OPM's reconsideration decision must be affirmed.</p>
