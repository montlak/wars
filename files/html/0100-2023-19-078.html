<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-74"><span class="space">10.</span> Qualified Disabled Employee</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">A "qualified" disabled individual has a physical or mental impairment that significantly limits one or more major life activities of a person who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position in question without endangering his or others' health and safety. <span class="Italic">Nanette v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 92 MSPR 127, 133 &#x00B6; 19 (2002) (citing 29 CFR 1614.203(a)(6)). For the agency to have an accommodative responsibility toward the disabled employee, the employee's disability must be capable of accommodation. If an agency cannot restructure a job so that remaining essential duties can be performed within an employee's (medical) restrictions, the employee is not a qualified disabled employee entitled to reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Alvarado v. USPS</span>, 14 MSPR 583, 586 (1983) (mail handler job required the appellant to lift up to 70 pounds); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Trammell v. VA</span>, 60 MSPR 79, 84 (1993) (severe physical impairment prevented the appellant from safely performing, with or without accommodation, the essential functions of her position); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Thibeault v. USPS</span>, SF-0752-13-0646-I-1 (NP 8/13/2014) ("It is well-established that the Rehabilitation Act imposes no obligation on the agency to create modified work assignments or to create a new position for an employee in order to provide reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Bennett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 271, &#x00B6; 10 (2012); <span class="Italic">Gonzalez-Acosta v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 277, &#x00B6; 11 (2010). The agency was not required to create a part-time small parcel sorter machine operator position to accommodate the appellant's disability. The agency's refusal to create a part-time position for the appellant, the information that the appellant sought through the discovery of the resolutions specialist's efforts to resolve the appellant's EEO complaint, would not have established an improper or wrongful act that caused the appellant to take sick leave. Thus, it would not have been sufficient evidence for the appellant to establish jurisdiction over his constructive suspension claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bean v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11 (2013) (finding that certain employee-initiated absences may be appealable as constructive suspensions where the appellant shows that: (1) he lacked a meaningful choice; and (2) the absence was caused by the agency's improper actions).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant is not a qualified disabled employee if his disability, e.g., mental depression requiring hospitalization, precludes him from performing duties with or without accommodation during the period of his absence. <span class="Italic">Sanders v. EEOC</span>, 38 MSPR 309, 310 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Nunes v. EEOC</span>, 13 MSPR 428, 432 (1982) (if an illness prevents an employee from even reporting to work, the appellant is not a qualified disabled person entitled to reasonable accommodation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Alvara v. DHS</span>, 116 MSPR 627, 630 &#x00B6; 6, 2011 MSPB 75 (2011) (on EEOC review, <span class="Italic">Petitioner v. Secretary DHS</span>, EEOC 0320110053 (July 10, 2014); certified to Special Panel, <span class="Italic">Alvara v. DHS</span>, 121 MSPR 453, 2014 MSPB 63 (Spec. Pan. 2014), Special Panel decision, <span class="Italic">Alvara v. DHS</span>, 121 MSPR 613, 2014 MSPB 77 (Spec. Pan. 2014)), provided a summary definition of a qualified individual with a disability:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A qualified individual with a disability is a person with the skills, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the position he holds and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). The term "essential functions" means the fundamental job duties of the position, not the marginal functions. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n)(1). Evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes, but is not limited to, the employer's judgment as to which functions are essential; written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job; the amount of time spent on the job performing the function; the consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function; the terms of a collective bargaining agreement; the work experience of past incumbents in the job; and/or the current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n)(3)(i)-(vii).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of qualifications, the Board explained in <span class="Italic">Gavette v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 44 MSPR 166, 179-80 (1990), that if an appellant is to be assigned a position allegedly denied to him because of disability discrimination, the appellant must prove that he has the requisite qualifications for the job, including, if at issue, that he was mentally qualified for the job (the qualification having been placed at issue by the appellant's past emotional illness). If an individual cannot pass a qualifying examination, he cannot perform the essential functions of the position and therefore is not a qualified disabled person. <span class="Italic">Carter v. USPS</span>, 23 MSPR 504, 505 (1984) (under EEOC regulations, the employee must meet experience or education requirements (including written tests) or meet criteria for appointment under special appointing authority). The qualified disabled employee is able, despite his disability, to perform the duties of his position. An individual who must have a driver's license to fulfill his job responsibilities, and who loses the license because of an alcohol-related incident, is not a qualified disabled employee who must be accommodated through, for example, assignment of another individual to drive his vehicle. <span class="Italic">Malbouf v. Dept. of Army</span>, 43 MSPR 588, 592 (1990) (but also examining the agency's reassignment efforts). A police officer was removed as a result of psychological problems that precluded the appellant from carrying a firearm. The agency made a good faith effort to reassign the employee but he could not be selected for referrals because of lack of qualifications. The agency kept him on duty status long enough for him to obtain treatment and to submit a disability retirement application. The employee's disability could not be accommodated. He was held properly removed. <span class="Italic">Pickut v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 24 MSPR 433, 435 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Lassiter v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Spence v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> PH-0752-09-0588-I-1 (NP 11/19/2010), concluded that the appellant was not a qualified individual with a disability when his job required that he have, and he lacked, an FAA flight instructor certificate:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As the chief administrative judge found, a qualified individual with a disability is one who satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education and other job-related requirements of the position he holds and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position. Essential function means the fundamental job duties of the position, which may be evidenced by proof that the position exists in order that the function be performed, or that the position requires a high level of skill for which the incumbent was hired. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n)(1), (2)(i) and (iii); <span class="Italic">see also Simpson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 346, &#x00B6; 13 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The chief administrative judge summarized the appellant's position as a Flight Instructor (FI), correctly finding that he was required to possess a Federal Aviation Administration FI Certificate or military equivalent. He also found, based on the evidence, that the essential function of the appellant's position was FI duties, and, since June 2006, the appellant was not qualified to be an FI because he simply did not have the requisite credentials. The appellant has not specifically contested the chief administrative judge's findings. Thus, the chief administrative judge correctly found that, even if the appellant is a disabled individual, he is not a qualified disabled individual. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Tines v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 90, 92 (1992) (a petition for review must contain sufficient specificity to enable the Board to ascertain whether there is a serious evidentiary challenge justifying a complete review of the record); <span class="Italic">Weaver v. Department of the Navy</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 129, 133 (1980) (before the Board will undertake a complete review of the record, the petitioning party must explain why the challenged factual determination is incorrect, and identify the specific evidence in the record which demonstrates the error), <span class="Italic">review denied</span>, 669 F.2d 613 (9th Cir. 1982) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency must provide reasonable accommodation to the known limitations of a qualified individual with a disability unless to do so would create an undue hardship. Reasonable accommodation may entail modification to the individual's current position or reassignment to a vacant position. <span class="Italic">Simpson</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 346, &#x00B6; 13. The chief administrative judge correctly found that the agency was not required to accommodate the appellant in his position as an FI because he could not perform the essential function of that position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Clemens v. Department of the Army</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 362, &#x00B6; 24 (2006) (an agency is not obligated to restructure a position if doing so would entail removing the essential functions of the position).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To be a qualified disabled person, the appellant should demonstrate through medical evidence, if necessary, that her medical problems would subside or be controlled if her accommodation were granted, e.g., if her position were geographically transferred if that is the accommodation requested to avoid the cause of the medical problems. <span class="Italic">Morrow v. FAA</span>, 14 MSPR 354, 357 (1983) (removal of an air traffic controller for AWOL); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Houser v.

Should the employee be offered occasional light duty and variations in work schedules as an accommodation, but still be unable to report to work regularly, he is not a qualified disabled <span id="Page_3462"></span>employee. <span class="Italic">Krainz v.

<p class="Body-Text">Job requirements may be subject to scrutiny when they are placed at issue by a disability discrimination defense. Under <span class="Italic">Lara v. MSHA</span>, 10 MSPR 554, 555 (1982), the employee was properly removed because he did not meet the physical (visual) requirements of the job. The agency was not required to wait until the appellant caused injury to himself or others before removing him if the likelihood of that injury was reasonably foreseeable. The result was, however, reversed. <span class="Italic">Lara v. MSHA</span>, 18 MSPR 182, 184 (1983). The appellant prevailed in his claim before the EEOC. On remand, the Board accepted the EEOC decision that he was the victim of disability discrimination because he was terminated for lack of binocular vision, a requirement either not job-related or lacking reasonable agency accommodation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The ability to work at different locations may or may not be an essential position function of a job, <span class="Italic">Trammell v. VA</span>, 60 MSPR 79, 84-86 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A "handicapped person" who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can safely perform the essential functions of her position or a vacant position to which she could be reassigned is a "qualified handicapped person" entitled to reasonable accommodation by the agency, unless the agency can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on its operations<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR 1613.702(f); <span class="Italic">Sargent v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 387, 393-94 (1992); <span class="Italic">Savage v. Department of the Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 148, 151-52 (1983); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 CFR 1630.2(m).

See Sargent</span>, 55 MSPR at 393-94; <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 36 MSPR at 151-52.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree, however, with the administrative judge's determination that the appellant was a "qualified handicapped person." The administrative judge found in this regard that the four essential functions of the appellant's Peripheral Equipment Operator position were (1) operating the mailhandling equipment, (2) operating Xerox printers, (3) working in the Honeywell printing pool, and (4) performing output review and distribution. Peripheral Equipment Operators were periodically rotated into each of these four duty stations, and the appellant had sought accommodation by seeking to have her job restructured to eliminate the Honeywell rotation. The administrative judge agreed with the appellant that, because she could perform in the three rotations other than the Honeywell rotation, the agency could have reasonably accommodated her by eliminating the Honeywell rotation from her duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, first of all, that the administrative judge erred by equating the four duty stations with "essential functions." A duty station is not necessarily synonymous with an "essential function" of a position in question<span class="Italic">. See Tornatore v. Department of the Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 381, 385 (1988) (an employee need not participate in every job duty rotation to perform all of the essential duties of the position in question); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 CFR 1630.2(n). In determining whether performance in the Honeywell printing pool was an essential function of the appellant's position, relevant evidence would include the number of other employees available to fill in for the appellant, the appellant's position description, and whether all employees in the appellant's position actually rotate among the four duty stations<span class="Italic">. See Tornatore</span>, 36 MSPR at 385; <span class="Italic">see also Overton v. Reilly</span>, 977 F.2d 1190, 1195 (7th Cir. 1992); 29 CFR 1630.2(n). Although it is unclear from the record whether working in the Honeywell printing pool was an essential function of the appellant's position, we find that this matter need not be resolved in this appeal because, even assuming that it was not an essential function and was eliminated from the appellant's job duties, the record shows, as discussed below, that she would still be incapable of safely performing the essential functions of her position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the appellant could perform in the three rotations other than the Honeywell rotation, the administrative judge found that "[t]he uncontested evidence...shows that the appellant did not experience any physical problems while performing the duties within three of the four functional areas." He also found in this regard that the appellant did not develop serious medical problems until she was assigned for 8 months to the Honeywell rotation and that she subsequently performed in the output review and distribution rotation for 3 months prior to her removal. However, the fact that the appellant could perform the duties of the mailhandling equipment rotation and the Xerox printers rotation before developing serious medical problems while assigned to the Honeywell rotation does not show that she could perform these duties after having developed the medical problems.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the record shows that, when the appellant was assigned to the output review and distribution rotation for 3 months before her removal, she merely performed output review functions and did not perform any distribution functions. <span class="Italic">[C]</span> <span class="Italic">f</span>. <span class="Italic">Bauman v. Department of the Navy</span>, 55 MSPR 209, 214 (1992); <span class="Italic">Clark v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 36 MSPR 162, 165 (1988) (the agency was not required to permanently assign the appellant to the light duty assignment he performed immediately prior to his removal where these duties did not constitute a complete and separate position). Thus, the administrative judge erred in evaluating and characterizing the evidence, as our review of the record shows that, in addition to the Honeywell rotation, the appellant was also incapable of performing the fundamental job duties of the three other rotations.</p>
