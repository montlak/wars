<h3 class="h3" id="sec15-14"><span class="space">B.</span> PREVAILING PARTY STATUS</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">The first requirement for a fee award is that the appellant prevail in the Board litigation. Appeals are won in part (mitigated), won in their entirety, settled, and actions are canceled after appeal and before hearing. There may be cases that are won at one stage and lost at another or that include an unsuccessful PFR on some aspect of the case. The question of who prevailed arises in some fee litigation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Prevailing party status is significant because 5 USC 7701(g) allows only those who prevail to obtain fees if other statutory conditions are met. The party applying for fees must be either an employee or applicant (assuming a statutory basis for fee recovery by an applicant for employment). In <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Dept. of Army</span>, 31 MSPR 476, 478 (1986), the Board squarely held that agencies may not obtain fees under the Reform Act fee provisions or as sanctions against frivolous appeals. The issue seems to be closed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kravitz v. OPM</span>, 75 MSPR 44, 47 (1997) (declining to incorporate the authority under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2) to require the appellant to pay the government's counsel fees as a condition to the dismissal of her appeal); <span class="Italic">Derrico v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 41 MSPR 233, 234 (1989) (denying fees for the appellant's allegedly frivolous PFR); <span class="Italic">Wobschall v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 32 MSPR 583, 585-86 (1987) ("To the extent that the agency request can be construed as a request that the Board require the appellant to pay some sum of money to penalize him for filing the instant appeal, we must reach a similar result. Although the Board is a "quasi-judicial agency," it does not have all of the powers of a court. Our authority is limited to that granted to us by law, rule, or regulation....&#8197;The agency has cited to no authority--and we can discern none--which would provide any support for the imposition of a monetary penalty on an employee or an applicant as a sanction for filing a "frivolous" petition for appeal with the Board."); <span class="Italic">Reynolds v. Dept. of Army</span>, 23 MSPR 269, 271 n.* (1984) ("There is no provision in statute or regulation providing for the payment of costs or fees to an agency in an appeal before the Board."); <span class="Italic">Acker v. GSA</span>, 14 MSPR 560, 560 (1983) ("[t]he law [does] not authorize the Board to award attorney fees to agencies."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Santiago v. EEOC</span>, 26 MSPR 633, 639 (1985) (assuming the AJ's authority to impose sanctions included a fee award against the appellant, there was no basis for sanctions).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The applicant-employee must also be a party to the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Santella</span>, 65 MSPR 452, 467 (1994) (individual who complained to Special Counsel and caused the initiation of a disciplinary complaint by OSC against other employees was not a party to the Board proceedings and not entitled to legal fees primarily incurred in the processing of a grievance filed with the employing agency); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">James v. Santelta</span>, <a href="https://openjurist.org/328/f3d/1374/james-v-santella">328 F.3d 1374</a>, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (employee who prevails in an OSC disciplinary case at the Board is a prevailing party who may secure an award of fees if other statutory conditions are met). Although the issue rarely arises, it should be noted that to secure fees one must maintain prevailing party status. If an appellant wins at the level of an initial decision and then takes his case into federal court in a lawsuit under Title VII, and if the district court reviews civil service issues and the appellant then loses what he won before the Board, the appellant also loses his prevailing party status if he applies to the Board for fees based on his initial victory before the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lokos v. EEOC</span>, 70 MSPR 33, 36 (1996).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Prevailing party status is determined upon consideration of the overall result in an appeal, <span class="Italic">Driscoll v. USPS</span>, 116 MSPR 662, 667-68 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9, 2011 MSPB 80 (2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">Koerner v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 150 (1992), the Board held where an appellant obtains relief in the initial decision, but does not succeed in obtaining additional relief on petition for review, she is a prevailing party with respect to the initial decision, but not with respect to her unsuccessful petition. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 152-53 (citing <span class="Italic">Vandemark v. Department of the Navy</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 81, 82 n.3 (1985)). Following <span class="Italic">Koerner</span>, the administrative judge concluded that the appellant was not a prevailing party with respect to her cross-petition for review, which was denied. The administrative judge went on to find that the appellant could nonetheless receive reasonable fees for time devoted to opposing the agency's petition for review, as she did prevail in that endeavor. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Freeman v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 125, 130-31 (1995) (time spent preparing a response to an agency petition for review is compensable, but time spent on an unsuccessful cross-petition for review is not).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to <span class="Italic">Koerner</span> and <span class="Italic">Freeman</span>, however, the Board does not determine prevailing party status on a line-item basis. Title 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) provides that fees may be awarded if, among other things, the appellant is "the prevailing party" in "a case" before the Board. While an appellant may win on one motion or phase of an appeal, and the agency on another, for purposes of the fee-shifting statute "there can be, by definition, only one prevailing party." <span class="Italic">See Shum v. Intel Corp.</span>, 629 F.3d 1360, 1363-67 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (interpreting similar language at Rule 54(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure); <span class="Italic">see also Kravitz v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 44, 47 (1997) (while the Board is not bound by the Federal Rules, it may look to them for guidance). An appellant is, or is not, a prevailing party in the case as a whole, and whether she may be deemed a prevailing party depends on the relief ordered in the Board's final decision. <span class="Italic">See Baldwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 413, &#x00B6; 11 (2010) ("The determination of an award of attorney fees is based upon the final decision of the Board and whether, by the final decision, the appellant is a prevailing party."). Here, the appellant's cross-petition for review, though unsuccessful, was filed in support of a single litigation that culminated in an enforceable final decision against the agency that changed the legal relationship between the parties. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. Department of the Army</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 547, &#x00B6; 7 (2007). Accordingly, we conclude that the appellant qualifies as a prevailing party with respect to the underlying appeal as a whole, including proceedings at both the regional level and before the full Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of Interior,</span> SF-0752-11-0766-A-3 (NP 3/30/2016) (prevailing party status, gained by a Board decision, was lost when the Board decision was vacated, and the result reversed, by the Federal Circuit).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A technical note for a technical discussion: to determine the outcome of a Board case for purposes of analysis of a counsel fee application, the vote tally of the individual Board members is not material, that is, there will not be analysis of the significance of a member's concurring vote that might suggest some disagreement on an issue or issues; the Board's order is determinative. <span class="Italic">Siedle v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 44 MSPR 211, 216 n.3 (1990). Additionally, if the Board vacates the decision that forms the basis for a fee petition, a fee award based on the vacated decision will not be enforced. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Melendez v.

<p class="Body-Text">The essential determinants for prevailing party status are two: that the appellant either prevails or substantially prevails on a significant portion of her claims; and that the relief obtained is significantly due to the initiation of the Board appeal. <span class="Italic">McWilliams v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 51 MSPR 422, 427 (1991) (appellant prevailed by setting aside a portion of an indefinite suspension). An agency's bad faith motivation in an appeal leading to a fee petition is not necessary to establish prevailing party status, although that factor may enter into fee entitlement under the "interest of justice" standard. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Coon v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 180, 186 (1994) ("As a result of the agency's failure to comply with the settlement agreement, the appellant was entitled to file a petition for enforcement; and, inasmuch as he demonstrated the agency's noncompliance with a material term of the parties' contractual agreement, he was the prevailing party in the enforcement proceedings."); <span class="Italic">Foley v. USPS</span>, 59 MSPR <span id="Page_4545"></span>413, 418 (1993) (to be the prevailing party in an enforcement proceeding, the appellant need not demonstrate that the agency's failure to comply with a final Board order (accepting settlement) was intentional or based on bad faith); <span class="Italic">Crutchfield v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 22 MSPR 637, 640 (1984) (appellant had prevailing party status as to a claim of improper constructive suspension, even if the appellant did not prevail as to an appeal from a removal for striking); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Southerland v.

<p class="Body-Text">If an individual is removed for more than one charge and the removal is sustained for fewer than all the charges, the employee has not prevailed so as to warrant a fee award since the employee's status remains the same--removed. The relation between the parties has not changed, <span class="Italic">Rankin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DC-0752-11-0568-A-1 (NP 1/22/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The determination of an award of attorney fees is based upon the final decision of the Board and whether, by the final decision, the appellant is a prevailing party. <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 413, &#x00B6; 11 (2010). The Board has expressly adopted the standard set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court that an appellant is considered to have prevailed in a case and to be entitled to attorney fees only if he obtains an "enforceable order" resulting in a "material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Buckhannon Board &#x0026; Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health &#x0026; Human Resources</span>, 532 U.S. 598, 604 (2001)). A plaintiff "prevails" when actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not find persuasive the appellant's argument that he is entitled to a partial award of attorney fees because he was a partially prevailing party on a key issue in the case, the falsification charge. The appellant claims that the Buckhannon case supports his argument that he is a prevailing party because he was cleared of "stigmatizing" accusations. An appellant is, or is not, a prevailing party in the case as a whole, and whether he may be deemed a prevailing party depends on the relief ordered in the Board's final decision. <span class="Italic">Driscoll</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 9. The administrative judge's initial decision affirming the appellant's removal became the final decision of the Board when neither party petitioned for review. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.113. In the initial decision, the administrative judge affirmed the agency's removal decision despite finding the agency only proved one of the two charges against the appellant. The decision provides no relief to the appellant; it affirms the agency's removal decision. Therefore, we find the appellant was not a prevailing party.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant does not show any material change in the legal relationship between the parties to warrant an attorney fee award. The appellant's argument is that, because the Board found the agency did not prove the second charge, he is entitled to a prorated attorney fee award. An enforceable Board order directly benefitting an appellant is necessary to demonstrate a material change in the parties' legal relationship. <span class="Italic">See Alexander v. Department of the Army</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 350, &#x00B6; 6 (1998) (agency agreement to remove three charges from appellant's personnel record as part of settlement agreement directly benefited the appellant and qualified him as a prevailing party because the agreement was enforceable by the Board). We find that the final judgment of the Board affirming the appellant's removal did not result in such an order. <span class="Italic">See Singer v. Office of Senate Sergeant at Arms</span>, 173 F.3d 837, 841 (Fed. Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">see also Buckhannon</span>, 532 U.S. at 604. Therefore, the appellant is not a prevailing party and not eligible for an attorney fee award.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To prove an entitlement to an attorney fee award, an appellant must show that an attorney fee award is in the interest of justice. <span class="Italic">Baldwin</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 413, &#x00B6; 16. As the appellant correctly notes, this is not an alternate basis for granting attorney fees but is in addition to the requirement that the appellant be the prevailing party....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit addressed who is a prevailing party in <span class="Italic">Sterner v. Dept. of Army</span>, 711 F.2d 1563, 1567-68 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The employee was discharged for five charges of misconduct; two were admitted and three were not proved. The discharge was reversed. In its place a 16-day suspension was substituted. The employee petitioned for fees. The AJ determined that the employee technically prevailed but that he was not substantially innocent and therefore was not entitled to fees under the Reform Act. The court's analysis began with the finding that the two essential issues for fee entitlement are that the petitioner be a prevailing party and that the fee award be warranted in the interest of justice. Reasonableness is considered after entitlement is established. The court accepted, based on analysis of other fee statutes, the Board's analysis in <span class="Italic">Hodnick v. FMCS</span>, 4 MSPR 371, 375, 4 MSPB 431 (1980), that an appellant may be deemed a prevailing party for purposes of a fee award if he has obtained all or a significant part of the relief sought in the appeal. Under <span class="Italic">Sterner</span>, Less than total victory may satisfy the requirement of prevailing; there is no requirement that the party completely prevail on every issue:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In applying this standard, it should be borne in mind that determining who prevails is really no more than a totaling up of who won and who lost. It is a practical matter: for example, if a penalty is imposed against an employee and, as a result of his appeal, it is reduced, then that employee may be deemed to have prevailed. The determination of who prevailed is, after all, only a threshold test of <span class="Italic">eligibility</span>; the more difficult question of <span class="Italic">entitlement</span> is reserved for the second prerequisite, "warranted in the interest of justice." Eligibility is broad but the entitlement standard operates to limit it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given this analysis, petitioner's lack of substantial innocence is not controlling at the first, eligibility, stage. Whether a party prevails is not a question of merit or justice, but a practical test designed to determine as an initial matter who is eligible for attorney's fees. However, the extent of a party's victory is clearly relevant generally to the justice of his cause. Therefore, corollary to our holding with respect to prevailing party, we also hold that the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> nature of the victory obtained by a prevailing employee may be considered by the Board under the aegis of the second, "interest of justice," prerequisite. This consideration is entirely consistent with the Board's guidelines in the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> case in that it concentrates on the magnitude of the injustice done the employee and in that the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> guidelines do not purport to exclude other factors relevant to the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This factor should not be used by the board as a "litmus test." It may carry great weight in a particular case, but it is not automatically dispositive. Furthermore, the reversal of a penalty of removal will in all cases <span class="Italic">not</span> be <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> under this standard. Removal is the most serious penalty available to the agency and the most harmful to the employee, so the avoidance of removal should be considered a sufficient degree of success to overcome use of this factor to deny fees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">minimis</span> formulation was explored in <span class="Italic">Texas State Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist</span>., 489 U.S. 782, 109 S. Ct. 1486 (1989), interpreting 42 USC 1988:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]t a minimum, to be considered a prevailing party within the meaning of Sec. 1988, the plaintiff must be able to point to a resolution of the dispute which changes the legal relationship between itself and the defendant....&#8197;Beyond this absolute limitation, a technical victory may be so insignificant...as to be insufficient to support prevailing party status....&#8197;The touchstone of the prevailing party inquiry must be the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties in a manner which Congress sought to promote in the fee statute. Where such a change has occurred, the degree of the plaintiff's overall success goes to the reasonableness of the award...not to the availability of a fee award <span class="Italic">vel</span> <span class="Italic">non</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To determine whether an appellant prevailed, the action will be viewed as a whole if the appeal involves disciplinary components. <span class="Italic">Mercer v. DHHS</span>, 42 MSPR 115, 120 (1989). But the victory must be on the merits for a party to prevail under the fee statutes. An appellant who wins a remand on a jurisdictional issue, allowing the appellant to continue the litigation before the Board, is not a prevailing party under either the Reform Act or the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) for purposes of a fee award. A motion for fees filed before the ultimate resolution on the merits will be dismissed as premature. <span class="Italic">Cade v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 86-802); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Olsen v. Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau</span>, 735 F.2d 558 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge, relying on <span class="Italic">Irwin v. Small Business Administration</span>, 45 F.3d 417, 418 (Fed. Cir. 1995), found that the appellant was not the prevailing party because he failed to obtain a significant part of the relief sought in appealing to the Board, i.e., the Board only awarded him $12.66 for long-distance telephone calls. We disagree. In <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby,</span> 506 U.S. 103, 113 S. Ct. 566, 121 L. Ed.2d 494 (1992), the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff "prevails" when actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.[1] <span class="Italic">See Farrar</span>, 506 U.S. at 111-12, 113 S. Ct. 566. In <span class="Italic">Ray v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 64 MSPR 100 (1994), the Board, following the guidance provided by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, found that an appellant who obtains an enforceable judgment against the agency, or enforceable relief through a settlement agreement, is the prevailing party. <span class="Italic">See Ray</span>, 64 MSPR at 105. In making this finding, the Board overruled its prior decisions, such as <span class="Italic">Quintanilla v. Department of the Navy,</span> 59 MSPR 547, 549 (1993), which held that an appellant must have substantially prevailed or have prevailed on a significant portion of his claims in order to be a prevailing party. <span class="Italic">See Ray</span>, 64 MSPR at 105.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> was deemed the prevailing party although he won a judgment for only one dollar through litigation <span id="Page_4546"></span>in which he first sought $17 million in compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">See Farrar</span>, 506 U.S. at 114, 113 S. Ct. 566.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Garcia II,</span> which granted the appellant's petition for review of the addendum initial decision, altered the relationship between the parties by entitling him to reimbursement for additional costs and thus directly benefited him. Therefore, we find that the appellant is the prevailing party.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge, having found that the appellant was not the prevailing party, did not address the issue of whether it is in the interest of justice to award attorney fees to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Allen</span>, 2 MSPB 582, 2 MSPR at 428. We will therefore address this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, without providing any legal support for his conclusion, argues that attorney fees and expenses are warranted in the interest of justice as he "has prevailed on a substantial portion of his claim." We disagree. The Supreme Court held in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> that once a plaintiff meets the threshold requirement of being a prevailing party, the extent to which he prevailed is the most critical factor to consider in determining reasonable attorney fees. The Court concluded that a trial court, in fixing fees, is obligated to give primary consideration to the amount of damages awarded as compared to the amount sought, where recovery of monetary damages is the purpose of the litigation. Depending on the circumstances of the case, such a comparison may properly result in the award of low fees or no fees at all as it did in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> in which the Court determined that the plaintiff, although the prevailing party, was not entitled to an award of attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See Farrar,</span> 506 U.S. at 114-16, 113 S. Ct. 566; <span class="Italic">see also Stein v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 65 MSPR 685, 689-90 (1994). Relying on this precedent, the Board has held that it will consider whether a fee award should be reduced because the relief ordered was significantly less than what the appellant sought. <span class="Italic">See Stein</span>, 65 MSPR at 690.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the Board merely made a minor, technical correction to the administrative judge's addendum initial decision to allow for an additional $12.66 in costs for long-distance telephone calls. <span class="Italic">See</span> Farrar, 506 U.S. at 114, 113 S. Ct. 566 ("Although the 'technical' nature of a nominal damages award or any other judgment does not affect the prevailing party inquiry, it does bear on the propriety of fees awarded...."). The appellant has not provided a breakdown of what fees and expenses should be attributed to the litigation of the $12.66 in costs upon which he did prevail and what should be attributed to the issues of the applicable hourly rate and award of interest upon which he did not prevail. We do not believe that it is necessary, however, to remand the case to allow him to apportion his fees between these claims because a review of the record reveals that only a very small portion of his motion for attorney fees addressed the issue of the cost of the long-distance telephone calls, i.e., only one paragraph out of his 50-page motion was devoted to these costs. Given how little of the appellant's motion for attorney fees was devoted to the issue upon which he received such nominal relief, we do not believe that it is in the interest of justice to award him the requested $780.77 in attorney fees or any portion thereof<span class="Italic">. See Farrar</span>, 506 U.S. at 114-16, 113 S. Ct. 566. Accordingly, the appellant's motion for attorney fees is denied.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Denying fees when the appellant received nominal relief in the appeal of a constructive suspension, <span class="Italic">Choi v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SF-0752-14-0449-A-1 (NP 4/14/2015), determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant's retroactive restoration, which lasted only until the date of his removal, was technical and had no real effect on his employment status. As noted, he received no back pay as a result of the agency's unjustified action, and back pay was what he sought inasmuch as the agency's failure to provide it was the sole basis for his petition for enforcement. Any moral satisfaction the appellant may have received based on the administrative judge's finding that the agency denied him due process in connection with the constructive suspension represented only nominal relief and we therefore agree with the administrative judge that it does not support an award of attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See Farrar,</span> 506 U.S. at 114-115; <span class="Italic">see also Jacobsen v. Department of Justice,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 439, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2006), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 500 F.3d 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2007).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Prevailing party status does not avoid an independent analysis of fee entitlement under the several Allen factors, discussed post, <span class="italic">Coffman v. OSC &#x0026; DHS</span>, 2022 MSPB 18, &#x00B6; 15 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC also contends that the ALJ "made no meaningful distinction" between the petitioner's status as a prevailing party and the conclusion that she was substantially innocent; thus, the ALJ's improper conflation of these concepts renders the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factors "superfluous." This is not a novel argument. In <span class="Italic">James</span>, 328 F.3d at 1381-82, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit rejected the Office of Personnel Management's nearly identical argument in this regard. First, the <span class="Italic">James</span> court noted that OSC may bring multiple charges against an employee, and it is possible or probable that "at least some charges will sometimes be sustained when others are not, resulting in only a partial victory for the charged employee" that would not "automatically" result in prevailing party status or a finding that the employee was substantially innocent. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Second, the <span class="Italic">James</span> court noted that there are circumstances when a prevailing party might not be substantially innocent, and it cited <span class="Italic">Sterner v. Department of the Army</span>, 711 F.2d 1563 (Fed. Cir. 1983), in which the employee confessed to two of five charges, and <span class="Italic">Wise v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 780 F.2d 997 (Fed. Cir. 1985), in which the employee "deliberately withheld exculpatory evidence from his employing agency." <span class="Italic">James</span>, 328 F.3d at 1382.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The distinction between prevailing party status based upon partial litigation success and the reduction of a fee for the partial success achieved by a prevailing party was demonstrated in <span class="Italic">Smit v.
