<p class="Body-Text">The Postal Service accounts for more restoration rights claims before the Board than any other agency. It is useful to review the Board's jurisdiction over claims involving that agency and the essential elements of a restoration claim for a partially recovered employee. Postal Service employees may appeal irrespective of veterans preference status, <span class="Italic">McCloud v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 508, 510-11 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction over Postal Service employees who allege <span id="Page_4504"></span>that their restoration rights have been violated under 5 C.F.R. part 353, subpart C regardless of whether they are preference eligible, or a supervisor, manager, confidential employee or engaged in professional work. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.102, 353.103. To be covered, however, the employee must have been "separated or furloughed from an appointment without time limitations, as a result of a compensable injury." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.103(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, even though the agency appears to have characterized a personnel action against the appellant as an "emergency placement," this action may constitute a furlough or a placement on a leave of absence for purposes of Board jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. part 353. A furlough is the placement of an employee into a non-duty, non-pay status for non-disciplinary reasons. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(5). Here, the appellant has alleged that she attempted to return to work after recovering from a compensable injury, and that the agency placed her in a leave without pay (LWOP) status for an indefinite period of time as a result of the compensable injury....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. USPS</span>, 123 MSPR 404, 411 n.6, 2016 MSPB 22 (2016) ("Although only particular groups of Postal Service employees have the right to appeal an adverse action to the Board, the Board may exercise jurisdiction over a Postal Service employee's claim that the agency violated her restoration rights under 5 C.F.R. part 353 regardless of whether the employee is preference eligible, a supervisory or managerial employee, or an employee engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Allen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 73, 76 (1997); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.102-.103.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Chen v. USPS</span>, 97 MSPR 527, 531-37 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-20 (2004), discussing jurisdiction, noted that the determination of whether an individual suffers from a medical condition that is compensable under the Federal Employees Compensation Act is within the exclusive purview of OWCP and that neither the employing agency nor the Board has the authority to make that determination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A Postal Service employee may file a Board appeal challenging an adverse action taken under chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code, only if she is covered by 39 U.S.C.&#x00A7; 1005(a) or 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(8). Thus, to appeal an adverse action under chapter 75, a Postal Service employee (1) must be a preference eligible, a management or supervisory employee, or an employee engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity, and (2) must have completed one year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions. <span class="Italic">Toomey v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 10, 12 (1996). The appellant has not contested the administrative judge's determination that she failed to allege non-frivolously that she was either preference eligible, or a manager, supervisor, or personnelist with adverse action appeal rights to the Board. Thus, the appellant's petition for review establishes no basis to reverse the administrative judge's conclusion that she failed to carry her burden of showing that the Board has jurisdiction over her appeal as a constructive adverse action. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the administrative judge's finding regarding the appellant's lack of standing to file an adverse action appeal with the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Appellant Has Not Made Allegations Sufficient to Establish Board Jurisdiction Over Her Restoration Appeal.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While only particular groups of Postal Service employees have the right to appeal an adverse action to the Board, the Board may exercise jurisdiction over a Postal Service employee's claim that the agency violated her restoration rights under 5 C.F.R. part 353, subpart C, regardless of whether the employee is preference eligible or a supervisory or managerial employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.102-.103; <span class="Italic">Allen v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 73, 76 (1997). Therefore, despite the fact that the appellant failed to allege facts that would establish that she was an employee with adverse action appeal rights to the Board, the Board has jurisdiction over this case if the appellant made a non-frivolous allegation of jurisdiction, that is, if she alleged facts sufficient to establish, if proven, that the agency violated her restoration rights under part 353. <span class="Italic">See Dick v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 290 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (non-frivolous jurisdictional allegations supported by affidavits or other evidence confer Board jurisdiction);<span class="Italic"> Walley v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 279 F.3d 1010, 1019 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (the Board's jurisdiction over a restoration appeal is established by a non-frivolous allegation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant claimed that the agency violated her rights as an individual who had partially recovered from a compensable injury when the agency refused to reinstate her after her physician determined that she "was safe to return to work on 8-07-00 with restraint of right arm." The Office of Personnel Management regulations governing restoration to duty following recovery from a compensable injury define a "partially recovered" employee as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[A]n injured employee [who], though not ready to resume the full range of his or her regular duties, has recovered sufficiently to return to part-time or light duty or to another position with less demanding physical requirements. Ordinarily, it is expected that a partially recovered employee will fully recover eventually.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102. The restoration rights of an individual who partially recovers from a compensable injury are set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Agencies must make every effort to restore in the local commuting area, according to the circumstances in each case, an individual who has partially recovered from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty. At a minimum, this would mean treating these employees substantially the same as other handicapped individuals under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. <span class="Italic">(See</span> 29 U.S.C. 791(b) and 794.) If the individual fully recovers, he or she is entitled to be considered for the position held at the time of injury, or an equivalent one. A partially recovered employee is expected to seek reemployment as soon as he or she is able.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appeal rights of an employee claiming a violation of her restoration rights as a partially recovered individual are defined by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An individual who is partially recovered from a compensable injury may appeal to MSPB for a determination of whether the agency is acting arbitrarily and capriciously in denying restoration. Upon reemployment, a partially recovered employee may also appeal the agency's failure to credit time spent on compensation for purposes of rights and benefits based upon length of service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish Board jurisdiction over a restoration claim as a partially recovered employee, the appellant must allege facts that would show, if proven, that: (1) She was absent from her position due to a compensable injury; (2) she recovered sufficiently to return to duty on a part-time basis, or to return to work in a position with less demanding physical requirements than those previously required of her; (3) the agency denied her request for restoration; and (4) the denial was "arbitrary and capricious." <span class="Italic">See Morman v. Department of Defense,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6; 10 (1999); <span class="Italic">Allen,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. at 77.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the administrative judge essentially determined that the appellant could not show that she was entitled to seek restoration under part 353 at the time in question because, until May 2002, when OWCP and ECAB issued their decisions that the appellant's injuries were compensable, the agency was without authority to determine on its own that the appellant's absence beginning in April 2000 resulted from a compensable injury. ID at 6-7 <span class="Italic">(citing Mobley v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 6 (2000) (a compensable injury is a medical condition accepted by OWCP to be job-related and for which medical or monetary benefits are payable from the Employees' Compensation Fund), and <span class="Italic">Simonton v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 12 (2000) (until OWCP issued a decision to terminate the appellant's compensation benefits, the employing agency was without authority to determine on its own that his medical restrictions were no longer causally related to his employment injury)). The administrative judge then rejected the appellant's argument "that a retroactive grant of compensation benefits is sufficient to vest the Board with jurisdiction over an alleged denial of restoration rights that took place at a point when benefits had been denied."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge properly recognized that the determination of whether an individual suffers from a medical condition that is compensable under the Federal Employees Compensation Act is within the exclusive purview of OWCP (subject to review by ECAB) and that neither the employing agency nor the Board has the authority to make such a determination. <span class="Italic">Simonton,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 11. However, while OWCP had denied the appellant's claims at the time she originally requested restoration in August 2000, OWCP ultimately determined that the appellant suffered a new compensable injury on or before December 4, 1999, and ECAB ultimately determined that the appellant suffered a recurrence of her original compensable injury in December 1999. Although the administrative judge rejected the appellant's argument concerning the Board's jurisdiction to consider a denial of restoration that occurred before a retroactive award of OWCP compensation, the Board has issued several decisions in which it has given retroactive effect to OWCP decisions when considering restoration rights implicated by such decisions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mendenhall v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 M.S.P.R. 430, 437 (1997) (although OWCP did not issue its decisions finding that the appellant suffered compensable injuries on May 14, 1990, and July 14, 1991, until December 1993 and February 1995, respectively, the Board determined that the appellant's right to restoration as a "physically disqualified" individual expired, at the latest, by July 14, 1992); <span class="Italic">Beltran v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 425, 430-31 (1991) (appellant was entitled to priority consideration retroactive to November 6, 1986, based on an OWCP decision issued in February 1990); <span class="Italic">cf. Gavette v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 44 M.S.P.R. 166, 177 (1990) ("OWCP's delay cannot operate to defeat an employee's right to restoration where the employee is not responsible for the delay."). Thus, the fact that the agency denied the appellant's requests for restoration prior to the point at which OWCP and ECAB rendered their decisions in favor of the appellant does not necessarily preclude the Board from exercising jurisdiction over a restoration appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4505"></span>The appellant has met the first three of the four criteria described above as necessary to establish Board jurisdiction over her appeal. She has alleged that: (1) Her absence from her position following her recovery from her thyroid surgery was due to the compensable injuries for which she ultimately received compensation from OWCP; (2) her physician determined as of August 7, 2000, that she had sufficiently recovered from her compensable injuries to return to a light-duty position; and (3) the agency denied or failed to act on her various requests for restoration to duty within her medical restrictions. As indicated above, however, she has not established Board jurisdiction over her appeal unless she has non-frivolously alleged that the agency's denial of her request for restoration was "arbitrary and capricious."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, in connection with this fourth criterion, that the Board indicated in <span class="Italic">Bennett v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6; 5 (2003), that an appellant could establish jurisdiction over a restoration appeal of a partially recovered employee without making a non-frivolous allegation that the denial of his request was arbitrary and capricious. <span class="Italic">See also id.</span> &#x00B6; 3 (listing the criteria for establishing jurisdiction, but not referring to any allegation that the denial was arbitrary and capricious); <span class="Italic">Chism v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 436, &#x00B6; 6 (2000) (same). We previously held, however, in <span class="Italic">Morman,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6; 10 and <span class="Italic">Allen,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. at 77, that such an allegation is necessary to establish jurisdiction. Neither <span class="Italic">Bennett</span> nor <span class="Italic">Chism</span> expressly overruled the <span class="Italic">Morman/Allen</span> holding, and shortly before <span class="Italic">Bennett</span> was issued, the Board issued another decision in which it indicated that an allegation that the denial was arbitrary and capricious was necessary for a finding of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Hall v. Department of the Navy,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 21 (2003) (where the appellant failed to allege facts that would establish that the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying him restoration, the Board found that the appellant failed to establish Board jurisdiction over his claim that the agency violated his restoration rights as a partially recovered employee).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that the <span class="Italic">Morman/Allen/Hall</span> holding correctly recognizes that partially recovered employees, unlike some fully recovered and physically disqualified individuals, are not entitled to appeal a failure to restore, <span class="Italic">per se</span>. Instead, as indicated above, the regulation defining the appeal rights of those employees provides that such an employee "may appeal to MSPB for a <span class="Italic">determination of whether the agency is acting arbitrarily and capriciously</span> in denying restoration." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c) (emphasis added). The<span class="Italic"> Morman/Allen/Hall</span> holding also is consistent with the fact that the Board places the burden on the appellant to prove that the agency's denial of a partially recovered individual's request for restoration was arbitrary and capricious.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)] (the appellant has the burden of proof with respect to issues of jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">cf. Walley,</span> 279 F.3d at 1019 ("[i]f a merits issue is one that is also 'jurisdictional,' the burden of proof on that merits issue remains with the employee even though, as a technical matter, the Board's jurisdiction is established by a non-frivolous allegation."); <span class="Italic">McDonnell v. Department of the Navy,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 380, &#x00B6; 9 (1999) (to make a non-frivolous showing of Board jurisdiction over an appeal on the basis that a partial restoration is so unreasonable as to amount to a denial of restoration, an appellant must present specific, independent evidence corroborating his allegations); <span class="Italic">Scott v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. 245, 248-49 (1993) (same), <span class="Italic">appeal dismissed,</span> 22 F.3d 1106 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). Accordingly, to the extent our decisions in <span class="Italic">Bennett,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 443, and <span class="Italic">Chism,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 436, are inconsistent with our holding here regarding the need for a non-frivolous allegation that the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously, those decisions are hereby overruled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the Board remanded this appeal to the regional office, the administrative judge specifically advised the appellant that, "[t]o show that jurisdiction exists, she must...make non-frivolous allegations establishing that the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying her request to exercise her right of restoration to duty. In her response to this order, the appellant described her lengthy efforts to persuade OWCP that she was entitled to receive compensation retroactively to August 2000; she described her unsuccessful efforts to obtain suitable work from her employing agency; and she asserted that she had satisfied the requirement that she make the non-frivolous allegations described in the show-cause order. We see nothing in that response, however--or elsewhere in the record--that explains why the employing agency's responses to the appellant's requests for restoration should be regarded as arbitrary and capricious. As the administrative judge indicated in his show-cause order, the agency did not even know at the time of the requests at issue here that OWCP would eventually approve the appellant's claim for compensation for the period of time following August 7, 2000. Its allegedly offering only "full duty" work, instead of "light duty" work, therefore would not establish that it acted arbitrarily and capriciously. Moreover, we note that the claims of unfairness that the appellant has raised in her petition for review seem to concern primarily the actions of OWCP, rather than the actions of her employing agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the appellant has failed to make a non-frivolous allegation that her employing agency's failure to restore her was arbitrary and capricious. We therefore AFFIRM the administrative judge's finding that the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another explanation of restoration rights, with emphasis on Postal Service employees, is provided in <span class="Italic">McFarlane v. USPS</span>, 110 MSPR 126, 129-34 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-21, 2008 MSPB 225 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The restoration rights to which compensably injured individuals are entitled are set forth under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a)-(b), which provide:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;In the event the individual resumes employment with the Federal Government, the entire time during which the employee was receiving compensation under this chapter shall be credited to the employee for the purposes of within-grade step increases, retention purposes, and other rights and benefits based on length of service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;Under regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;the department or agency which was the last employer shall immediately and unconditionally accord the employee, if the injury or disability has been overcome within one year after the date of commencement of compensation or from the time compensable disability recurs if the recurrence begins after the injured employee resumes regular full-time employment with the United States, the right to resume his former or an equivalent position, as well as all other attendant rights which the employee would have had, or acquired, in his former position had he not been injured or disabled, including the rights to tenure, promotion, and safeguards in reductions-in-force procedures, and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;the department or agency which was the last employer shall, if the injury or disability is overcome within a period of more than one year after the date of commencement of compensation, make all reasonable efforts to place, and accord priority to placing, the employee in his former or equivalent position within such department or agency, or within any other department or agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Welter v. Department of Transportation,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 414, 419-21 (1997), the Board found that it does not have jurisdiction over a claim of improper restoration under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2) where the employee's recovery took more than 1 year from the date that he first became eligible for OWCP compensation. In <span class="Italic">Gallo v. United States,</span> 529 F.3d 1345, 1348-52 (Fed. Cir. 2008), our reviewing court recently found the application of that analysis to a restoration claim brought pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a) to be inappropriate because the restoration rights set forth under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a) are separate and independent of the rights set forth under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b) and, unlike the restoration rights set forth under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b), the restoration rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a) are not contingent upon the amount of time it takes an employee to recover.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reopen this appeal to further consider our jurisdiction over this case because the AJ relied on <span class="Italic">Welter</span> in finding that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's claim that the agency failed to properly restore him. For the reasons set forth below, we find that <span class="Italic">Gallo</span> has no effect on our analysis of our jurisdictional authority regarding the appellant's claim for violation of his restoration rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may have jurisdiction over a Postal Service employee's claim that the agency violated his restoration rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b), following his full or partial recovery from a compensable injury, regardless of whether the employee would satisfy the definition of "employee" for the purposes of the Board's adverse action jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Wright v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 425, &#x00B6; 7 (2007); <span class="Italic">Rumph v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 243, &#x00B6; 9 (2006); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.102-.103, 353.304. However, the statute itself does not provide a right to appeal; rather, Congress provided that the restoration rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b) would be set forth under the regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and OPM's regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304, provides the scope of the right to appeal an alleged denial of restoration. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's argument and evidence asserting that the agency failed to restore him to his former position because the agency had previously determined to abolish that position before he was restored to duty, as a result of a reorganization plan, fails to assert a basis for jurisdiction over his appeal because his claim exceeds the restoration rights to which he is entitled. An individual's rights to restoration following a compensable injury are set forth at 5 C.F.R. part 353, subpart C. The specific obligation of an agency under that subpart and the extent of the Board's jurisdiction over restoration claims depend upon the extent of the individual's recovery and the amount of time that recovery took.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that the appellant was "fully recovered" more than 1 year after he first became eligible to receive OWCP benefits. OPM's restoration regulation implementing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2) provides, in pertinent part, the following rights for compensably injured employees <span id="Page_4506"></span>who recover more than 1 year after they first became eligible to receive OWCP benefits:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Fully recovered after 1 year.</span> An employee who separated because of a compensable injury and whose full recovery takes longer than 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation began...is entitled to priority consideration, agencywide, for restoration to the position he or she left or an equivalent one provided he or she applies for reappointment within 30 days of the cessation of compensation. Priority consideration is accorded by entering the individual on the agency's reemployment priority list for the competitive service or reemployment list for the excepted service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b). "Fully recovered" means "compensation payments have been terminated on the basis that the employee is able to perform all the duties of the position he or she left or an equivalent one." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102(2). OWCP's determination that an individual is fully recovered is "final and conclusive for all purposes and with respect to all questions of law and fact." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8128(b)(1). Accordingly, it is binding on the Board. <span class="Italic">As'Salaam v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 76, &#x00B6; 15 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Positions in the Postal Service are excepted service positions. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 16. As an employee in the excepted service, the appellant may appeal an alleged denial of restoration rights to the Board under 5 C.F.R. part 302. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(b). Under that part, an individual in the excepted service who is entitled to priority consideration may appeal a violation of his restoration rights to the Board by presenting factual information that he was denied restoration rights because of the employment of another person. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.501. Thus, to establish the Board's jurisdiction under the instant circumstances, the appellant had to raise nonfrivolous allegations that: (1) He was separated because of a compensable injury; (2) he has fully recovered more than 1 year after the date he became eligible for OWCP benefits; (3) he requested restoration within 30 days after the cessation of OWCP compensation; and (4) he believes that the agency violated his reemployment priority rights; i.e., he was denied restoration because of the employment of another person. <span class="Italic">See DeBlock v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 90, &#x00B6; 8 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the AJ correctly found, the appellant was restored to his former position and he has not asserted that he was not placed in his former position because of the employment of another person, or even that his position continued to exist after the position was abolished and another person was placed in his position. Thus, the appellant failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency had violated his reemployment priority rights as required by the fourth jurisdictional criterion. <span class="Italic">See DeBlock,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 90, &#x00B6; 8. Additionally, we see no error in the AJ's finding that the appellant's claims that the agency had failed to restore him to duty in May 2006, November 2006, and January 2007, subsequent to his January 2006 return to duty, also failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation of the Board's restoration jurisdiction, because OWCP had denied the appellant's claim of recurrence and, thus, the appellant did not have a compensable injury that would entitle him to restoration upon full or partial recovery from a compensable injury. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that <span class="Italic">Gallo</span> could appeal the agency's failure to fully provide him with the restoration rights set forth under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a), the court noted that the rights set forth under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a) are separate and independent of the rights set forth under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b), and that the two sections are intended to accomplish two distinct goals. <span class="Italic">Gallo,</span> 529 F.3d at 1348-50. The court then noted that, as reflected in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3(a) of the Board's regulations, the Board has jurisdiction over appeals from agency actions when the appeals are authorized by law, rule, or regulation, including the:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Failure to restore, improper restoration of, or failure to return following a leave of absence an employee or former employee of an agency in the executive branch (including the U.S. Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission) following partial or full recovery from a compensable injury (5 CFR 353.304).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3(a)(12); <span class="Italic">Gallo,</span> 529 F.3d at 1350-52. The court found that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(a) provides the Board with the following restoration rights jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, an injured employee or former employee of an agency in the executive branch (including the U.S. Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission) may appeal to the MSPB an agency's failure to restore, improper restoration, or failure to return an employee following a leave of absence. All appeals must be submitted in accordance with MSPB's regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Gallo,</span> 529 F.3d at 1351. Thus, the court found that the Board has the jurisdiction to review whether an agency has fully provided a restored employee with the independent restoration rights to which he is entitled under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1351-52. Again, those rights are to have the entire time the employee was receiving OWCP compensation credited for the purposes of within-grade step increases, retention purposes, and other rights and benefits based on length of service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained above, however, the appellant does not assert a claim for violation of rights conferred by &#x00A7; 8151(a). Moreover, the appellant's claim for violation of rights conferred by &#x00A7; 8151(b) is governed by one of the two exceptions to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(a). Section 353.304(b) provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An individual who fully recovers from a compensable injury more than 1 year after compensation begins may appeal to MSPB as provided for in parts 302 and 330 of this chapter for excepted and competitive service employees, respectively.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained above, as an excepted service employee who fully recovered more than 1 year after he first became eligible to receive OWCP compensation, the appellant's restoration appeal right is set forth under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.501 (a denial of priority reemployment consideration), and his present restoration claim that the agency improperly restored him exceeds that right. As the Board's reviewing court found in a decision issued subsequent to <span class="Italic">Gallo:</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee who recovers from injury or disability within one year is entitled under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(1) to resume his former position or an equivalent position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(1). An employee who recovers after more than one year is not similarly entitled to full restoration, but under Section 8151(b)(2) is only "guarantee[d] priority consideration in reemployment."</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Jurisdiction over Postal Service employees' restoration claims was again described, <span class="Italic">Fitzsimmons v. USPS</span>, 99 MSPR 1, 4-5 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although only particular groups of Postal Service employees have the right to appeal an adverse action to the Board, the Board may exercise jurisdiction over a Postal Service employee's claim that the agency violated her restoration rights under 5 C.F.R. part 353, subpart C, regardless of whether the employee is preference eligible or a supervisory, managerial, or confidential employee. <span class="Italic">Chen,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 12;<span class="Italic"> see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.102-.103. Therefore, irrespective of whether the Board possesses jurisdiction over the appellant's constructive suspension claim, the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal if the appellant made a non-frivolous allegation of restoration jurisdiction, that is, if she alleged facts sufficient to establish, if proven, that the agency violated her restoration rights under 5 C.F.R. part 353. <span class="Italic">See Chen,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee who is separated or furloughed from an appointment without time limitation as a result of a compensable injury may have restoration rights under Title 5, part 353 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, and may appeal the denial of those rights to the Board. <span class="Italic">Davis v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 270, &#x00B6; 6 (2001); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.103(b), 353.304. The burden of proving Board jurisdiction over such a claim rests with the appellant. <span class="Italic">Davis,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 270, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual who is partially recovered from a compensable injury can establish Board jurisdiction over a restoration appeal by making non-frivolous allegations that: (1) She was absent from her position due to a compensable injury; (2) she is partially recovered from her injury; (3) she requested restoration within certain limitations, and the agency denied that request; and (4) the agency's denial was arbitrary and capricious. <span class="Italic">Chen,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 13;<span class="Italic"> see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c); <span class="Italic">Walley v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 279 F.3d 1010, 1018-20 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">Morman v. Department of Defense,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6; 10 (1999). A compensable injury is a medical condition accepted by the OWCP to be job-related and for which medical or monetary benefits are payable from the Employees Compensation Fund. <span class="Italic">Mobley v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 6 (2000). The requisite absence from work may be established by showing that the appellant was placed in a leave-without-pay (LWOP) status, i.e., furloughed, due to the compensable injury; contrary to the tentative finding of the administrative judge, the appellant need not formally be removed from service for Board jurisdiction to attach. <span class="Italic">See McCloud v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 508, 511-12 (1996); <span class="Italic">Deloach v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 58 M.S.P.R. 574, 578 (1993). Furthermore, upon reemployment, a partially recovered employee may appeal the agency's failure to credit time spent on workers compensation for purposes of rights and benefits based upon length of service. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c); <span class="Italic">see Chen,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 13.</p>
