<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-390"><span class="space">3.</span> Nonselection for Position; Constructive Suitability Determination Under Delegated Authority</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">If the employing agency cancels an appointment because the employee is discovered not to qualify for the appointment, the appellant does not have a suitability appeal, although he may have an adverse action or probationary termination appeal [discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-124.html#sec1-123">Temporary and Term Appointments</a>," and Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-003.html#sec6-4">Appointment</a>"] . 5 CFR 731.203(b) (2022) states that "[a] non-selection, or cancellation of eligibility for a specific position based on an objection to an eligible or pass over of a preference eligible under 5 CFR 332.406, is <span class="Italic">not</span> a suitability action even if it is based on reasons set forth in &#x00A7; 731.202."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Nonselection for a position is not ordinarily a suitability action, <span class="Italic">Wilson v. DOJ</span>, CH-3443-15-0480-I-1 (NP 9/16/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Suitability is directed toward whether the character or conduct of an individual is such that her employment would adversely affect the integrity or the efficiency of the service. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101(a). The criteria for making suitability determinations are listed in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202. One factor in determining if a person is suitable for Federal employment is whether she has made a "[m]aterial, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(b)(3). What is required to establish jurisdiction over a suitability appeal changed effective June 16, 2008, when the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) amended its regulations in part 731. 73 Fed. Reg. 20,149 (2008). In decisions governed by the regulations in effect prior to that date, the Board found that appellants had made nonfrivolous allegations of jurisdiction where denials of applications may have been based on suitability factors, even in the absence of completed background investigations and/or formal suitability determinations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Upshaw v. Consumer Product Safety Commission</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 236, &#x00B6; 7 (2009), <span class="Italic">modified by Scott v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 356 (2011), <span class="Italic">modified</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 467 (2012); <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Department of Justice</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5, 10-14 (2000); <span class="Italic">Dillingham v. Department of Justice</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 538, 541-43 (1997). Under the current regulations, however, only a "suitability action" taken by OPM or by an agency under delegated authority may be appealed to the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501(a). A "suitability action" is defined as a cancellation of eligibility, a removal, a cancellation of reinstatement eligibility, and a debarment. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(a). Neither a "denial of appointment" nor a negative suitability determination is listed as an appealable action, and section 731.103(g) no longer provides that an applicant who is found unsuitable by an agency acting under delegated authority from OPM may appeal an adverse suitability decision to the Board. <span class="Italic">Upshaw</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 236, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8. The current regulations specify that a "non-selection, or cancellation of eligibility for a specific position...is <span class="Italic">not</span> a suitability action even if it is based on reasons set forth in &#x00A7; 731.202." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(b) (emphasis in original); <span class="Italic">see Upshaw</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 236, &#x00B6; 8.</p>

The appellant maintains that the Board has jurisdiction over his discrimination claims in connection with the agency's determination that he was unsuitable for employment<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge properly found, the appellant has failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency took any of the four actions that encompass a suitability action appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Alvarez v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 434, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 8 (2009) (finding that the Board, on its face, appeared to lack jurisdiction over the agency's determination that the appellant was unsuitable for a particular position); <span class="Italic">Kazan v.

Each of the vacancy announcements for which the appellant applied stated that an applicant's "income tax returns will be verified for the past three years to determine if [the applicant] ...filed according to the tax laws." The evidence in the record indicates that the agency found the appellant ineligible for the three Contact Representative positions for which he applied based on the agency's finding that the appellant was not tax compliant in 2008 and the appellant's subsequent failure to provide proof of compliance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no evidence in the record that the agency's determination that the appellant was ineligible applied to any other position other than the three Contact Representative positions at issue. <span class="Italic">See Kazan</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 390, &#x00B6; 7. Further, the agency does not appear to have taken any broader action regarding the appellant's eligibility, such as canceling any other eligibilities on other existing competitive registers. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also Sazegari v.

Indeed, OPM's regulations specify that a nonselection for a specific position is not a "suitability action," even if it is based on the criteria for making suitability determinations set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(b); <span class="Italic">see Kazan</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 390, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">Upshaw v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Walker v. VA</span>, DC-0731-13-0698-I-1 (NP 5/19/2014), summarized the rule that nonselection for a particular job does not establish a basis for a suitability action appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant is appealing the agency's decision not to extend him a final offer of employment with regard to the Police Officer position. As noted by the administrative judge, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203 does not include nonselection for a specific position as a basis for a suitability action. In fact, OPM's revised regulations specify that a nonselection for a position is not a suitability action. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(b); <span class="Italic">see Upshaw</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 236, &#x00B6; 8. Accordingly, the appellant has failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal of the agency's action as a negative suitability action within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. Part 731. <span class="Italic">See Dillingham v. Department of Justice</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 538, 541 (1997) (nonfrivolous allegations of jurisdiction are allegations of fact that, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board has jurisdiction over the matter). The administrative judge, therefore, properly dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction without holding a hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similar analysis was applied in <span class="Italic">Gregory v. MSPB</span>, 469 Fed. Appx. 891, 893-94 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Gregory maintains that his non-selection for employment at the GSA amounted to a suitability action, which would provide a right of appeal before the Board pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501(a). His position is based primarily on the GSA's statement that he no longer met "the suitability requirements" when it declined to complete his appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Suitability determinations examine "suitability" for covered federal employment--specifically, whether "a person's character or conduct...may have an impact on the integrity or efficiency of the service." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101. If an individual is deemed unsuitable for service based on one or more of the factors enumerated in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(b),[1] the acting agency may take a suitability action, which can include removal, debarment, cancellation of eligibility, and/or cancellation of reinstatement eligibility. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(a). Since June 16, 2008, however, "[a] non-selection, or cancellation of eligibility for a specific position...is not a suitability action even if it is based on reasons set forth in &#x00A7; 731.202." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Section 731.202(b) provides an exclusive list of "[s]pecific factors" that can give rise to a suitability action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;Misconduct or negligence in employment; (2) Criminal or dishonest conduct; (3) Material, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment; (4) Refusal to furnish testimony as required by &#x00A7; 5.4 of this chapter; (5) Alcohol abuse, without evidence of substantial rehabilitation, of a nature and duration that suggests that the applicant or appointee would be prevented from performing the duties of the position in question, or would constitute a direct threat to the property or safety of the applicant or appointee or others; (6) Illegal use of narcotics, drugs, or other controlled substances with-out evidence of substantial rehabilitation; (7) Knowing and willful engagement in acts or activities designed to overthrow the U.S. Government by force; and (8) Any statutory or regulatory bar which prevents the lawful employment of the person involved in the position in question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this instance, the GSA's hiring decision cannot be considered an appealable suitability action under the clear terms of &#x00A7; 731.203(b), and its use of the word "suitability" in providing notice to Gregory does not alter the substance of the GSA's actions. As the Board correctly noted, there is no evidence that Gregory was removed or debarred from any position, that his reinstatement eligibility was cancelled, or that his eligibility was cancelled for any position other than the specific position he sought with the GSA. In short, the GSA's decision amounted to nothing more than a non-selection for employment, which is generally not appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Prewitt v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 133 F.3d 885, 886 (Fed. Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ricci v. MSPB</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-1626.Opinion.3-19-2020_1554030.pdf">953 F.3d 753</a>, 755-60 (Fed. Cir. 2020), explained that an agency's decision to rescind a tentative offer of a job, based on suitability grounds, did not establish the basis for Board jurisdiction over a suitability action or a constructive suitability action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In January 2017, Immigration and Customs Enforcement ("ICE"), a division of the Department of Homeland Security ("DHS"), notified Ricci that she had been "tentatively" selected for the position of Criminal Investigator. The agency informed her, however, that she would be required to undergo and satisfactorily complete a background investigation before receiving a final offer of employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ICE subsequently sent Ricci a "Notice of Proposed Action," informing her that her background investigation had revealed "[d]erogatory information...which [was] serious enough to warrant a proposal that [she] be found unsuitable for the [Criminal Investigator] position, and possibly denied examination for, and appointment to, all positions with DHS/ICE for a period of not more than three years." ICE alleged that Ricci had engaged in numerous acts of misconduct when she was employed with the Boston Police Department ("BPD"). In support, it noted that the BPD had sustained multiple charges against Ricci, including "Negligent Duty/Unreasonable Judgment," "Violations of Directives/Orders," "Untruthfulness," "Failure to Report Law Violations," and "Association with Criminals."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Ricci responded to ICE's notice letter, the agency nevertheless rescinded its tentative offer of employment for the Criminal Investigator position. The agency stated that Ricci had been "found unsuitable for the position of Criminal Investigator...because of Misconduct in Employment," asserting that her "conduct indicate[d] a potential for behavior that could adversely impact [her] employment performance, as well as the ability of ICE to fully and effectively carry out its law enforcement mission."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ricci then filed an appeal with the board, alleging that ICE had subjected her to a negative suitability determination. She asserted that ICE's "claim of 'Misconduct in Employment' [was] based upon bad intelligence" and that the agency was "continuing the...discrimination" engaged in by the BPD.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 27, 2018, an administrative judge of the board issued a show-cause order, directing Ricci to file evidence and argument showing that the board had jurisdiction over her appeal. The administrative judge explained that the board generally lacks jurisdiction over an individual's non-selection for a specific position, even if that non-selection is based upon the suitability criteria set out in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202. In response, Ricci asserted that the board should assume jurisdiction over her appeal because "[ICE's] actions effectively constitute[d] a suitability action of debarment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an initial decision dated November 28, 2018, the administrative judge dismissed Ricci's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. She concluded that although the agency's decision to withdraw Ricci's tentative offer of employment for the Criminal Investigator position was based upon suitability criteria, ICE's action was properly viewed as a non-selection for a specific vacant position rather than a debarment from future agency employment. <span class="Italic">See Board Decision</span>, 2018 MSPB LEXIS 4526, at *4-6. According to the administrative judge, although ICE decided not to extend a final offer of employment for the position of Criminal <span id="Page_768"></span>Investigator, it did not take any "broader action" against Ricci, such as "debarring her from future agency employment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board's jurisdiction "is limited to actions designated as appealable to [it] 'under any law, rule, or regulation.'" <span class="Italic">Prewitt v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 133 F.3d 885, 886 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)). By statute, the board has jurisdiction over appeals of certain adverse personnel actions, including: (1) removals; (2) suspensions for more than fourteen days; (3) reductions in grade; (4) reductions in pay; and (5) furloughs of thirty days or less. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(1)-(5). In general, however, the board has no authority to review "[a]n agency's failure to select an applicant for a vacant position." <span class="Italic">Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 886; <span class="Italic">see also Reddick v. FDIC</span>, 809 F.3d 1253, 1256 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("It is well-established that the failure to appoint is not an adverse action."). Accordingly, "claims of unlawful conduct in the selection process ordinarily must be brought before other forums." <span class="Italic">Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 886.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ricci acknowledges that an unsuccessful candidate for a federal civil service position generally has no right to appeal his or her non-selection to the board. She contends, however, that the board had jurisdiction over her appeal pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501(a), an Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") regulation that affords a right to appeal from a "suitability action."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree. OPM, or an agency acting under delegated authority, makes "suitability determinations" based upon the specific factors listed in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(b). <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 731.101(a). In particular, suitability determinations are premised "on the presence or absence of one or more...specific factors (charges)," such as "[m]isconduct or negligence in employment," "[c]riminal or dishonest conduct," or "[m]aterial, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 731.202 (a), (b). Such suitability determinations seek to ascertain whether "a person's character or conduct...may have an impact on the integrity or efficiency of the service." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 731.101(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Importantly, however, OPM regulations make clear that not every "suitability determination" gives rise to an appealable "suitability action." <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 731.501(a) (stating that the board has jurisdiction over a "suitability action"). In this regard, the regulations state that the non-selection for a specific position--even if that non-selection is based on the suitability criteria set out in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(b)--does not constitute a "suitability action" that is appealable to the board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 731.203(b) ("A non-selection, or cancellation of eligibility for a specific position based on an objection to an eligible or pass over of a preference eligible...is <span class="Italic">not</span> a suitability action even if it is based on reasons set forth in [5 C.F.R.] &#x00A7; 731.202"). To the contrary, the right to appeal pursuant to OPM regulations arises only when, as a result of a negative suitability determination, an individual faces removal, cancellation of eligibility, cancellation of reinstatement eligibility, or debarment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 731.203(a); <span class="Italic">see also id.</span> &#x00A7; 731.501(a). Accordingly, although ICE found Ricci "unsuitable for the position of Criminal Investigator...because of Misconduct in Employment," its decision to rescind its tentative offer of employment for that position was not a "suitability action" that could be appealed to the board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;Debarment</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ricci attempts to invoke board jurisdiction by arguing that while ICE did not label its action a "debarment," she was nonetheless subjected to an appealable suitability action because ICE "effectively" debarred her. In support, she notes that ICE's December 2017 Notice of Proposed Action, "warned" her that she could potentially be debarred. She contends, moreover, that the agency's allegations of misconduct against her, although "unfounded" and "untrue," were serious enough to support a debarment action and that ICE's final decision letter, which rescinded her tentative offer of employment for the Criminal Investigator position, failed to "clarify that [she] could still be considered for other DHS employment." In Ricci's view, ICE subjected her to a "<span class="Italic">de facto</span>" debarment because its actions impugned her "character, specifically her honesty and trustworthiness," and since the agency has a "protocol of retaining and sharing background investigation results for five years," she will likely be foreclosed from obtaining a position in federal law enforcement before she "age[s] out" of eligibility for such employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This argument is unavailing. First, although, as noted previously, a debarment is an appealable suitability action, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(a)(4), OPM regulations specify that a "debarment" occurs when, after evaluating the suitability criteria listed in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(b), "an agency finds an applicant or appointee unsuitable" and "for a period of not more than 3 years from the date of the unfavorable suitability determination, den[ies] that person examination for, and appointment to, either all, or specific covered, positions within that agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 731.205(a). Here, although ICE, in its final action letter, informed Ricci that it had decided to rescind its tentative offer of employment for the Criminal Investigator position, it did not state that she had been debarred or was ineligible for other positions within DHS. <span class="Italic">See Board Decision</span>, 2018 MSPB LEXIS 4526, at *5 (explaining that while ICE "made a determination not to extend a final offer of employment with regard to one job," it "did not state or even suggest that it took any broader action regarding [Ricci's] Federal employment eligibility, such as cancelling eligibility for existing competitive registers or debarring her from future agency employment").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, OPM has made clear that its revised suitability regulations afford the board no authority to review a "<span class="Italic">de facto</span>" or "constructive" debarment. <span class="Italic">See</span> Suitability, 73 Fed. Reg. 20149, 20150-53 (OPM Final Rule, Apr. 15, 2018) ("<span class="Italic">Final Rule</span>"). Prior to 2008, the board had on occasion exerted jurisdiction over "constructive" suitability actions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Saleem v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 151, 154-56 (2001); <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 518, 521-24 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Edwards</span>, for example, the board concluded that, under certain circumstances, an agency's decision not to select an applicant for a position based upon suitability criteria could be viewed as a "constructive" suitability action appealable to the board. 87 M.S.P.R. at 523. Effective June 16, 2008, however, OPM issued revised regulations, which were designed to "clarify the scope of authority for the [board] to review actions taken under the [suitability] regulations." <span class="Italic">Final Rule</span>, 73 Fed. Reg. at 20149. In particular, the revised regulations were intended to eliminate confusion regarding the distinction between a "suitability determination" and an appealable "suitability action." <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 20150 ("One (suitability actions) concerns the type of actions taken, such as debarment or removal, once a person is determined to be unsuitable and the other (suitability determinations) concerns the process of initially deciding whether a person is suitable."). OPM specifically rejected <span class="Italic">Edwards'</span> holding that the board can exercise jurisdiction over "constructive" suitability actions, 87 M.S.P.R. at 523, stating that it was premised upon an "incorrect reading of the authority that OPM conferred upon the [b]oard." <span class="Italic">Final Rule</span>, 73 Fed. Reg. at 20152.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM emphasized, moreover, that the board has no jurisdiction over appeals involving the non-selection for a specific position, even if that non-selection is based on "fitness or character." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 20150; <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 20151 ("In other words, non-selection for a position is not an appealable suitability action."). Accordingly, OPM has explicitly rejected Ricci's argument that the board is empowered to adjudicate a "constructive" or "<span class="Italic">de facto</span>" debarment. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 20151 (rejecting the argument that giving an agency discretion to determine whether a particular personnel action should be "label[ed]" a suitability action "elevates form over substance" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <span class="Italic">see also Upshaw v. Consumer Prod. Safety Comm'n</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 236, 239-40 (2009) (explaining that OPM's revised suitability regulations eliminated the concept of a "constructive" suitability action and "specif[ied] that a non-selection for a specific position is not a suitability action even if it is based on reasons set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the results of Ricci's background investigation, coupled with ICE's determination that she was "unsuitable" to serve in the position of Criminal Investigator, will make it difficult for her to obtain other federal law enforcement positions, this is insufficient to trigger board jurisdiction. Regardless of the impact that the non-selection for a specific position may have on an applicant's ability to secure future federal employment, the board, as discussed previously, is only vested with authority to review actions designated as "appealable to [it] under any law, rule, or regulation." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a); <span class="Italic">see Monasteri v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 232 F.3d 1376, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (emphasizing that the board's jurisdiction "is not plenary"). Ricci identifies no law, rule, or regulation affording the board jurisdiction to review ICE's decision to rescind her tentative offer of employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">D.&#x2003;Alleged Rulemaking</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we reject Ricci's argument that the board's "interpretation of 'debarment' as excluding <span class="Italic">de facto</span> debarment" violates the Administrative Procedure Act ("APA") because it "is a substantive rule that should have been promulgated through notice and comment procedures." [<span class="Italic">S</span>]<span class="Italic">ee Preminger v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs</span>, 632 F.3d 1345, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2011) ("An agency's failure to comply with notice-and-comment procedures, when required, is grounds for invalidating a rule." (footnote omitted)). Here, the board did not engage in "rulemaking," but instead applied OPM suitability regulations when adjudicating the case presented to it. <span class="Italic">See Ashford Univ., LLC v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs</span>, No. 2018-1213, 2020 WL 1017621, at *5 (Fed. Cir. Mar. 3, 2020) (concluding that "an agency's Cure Letter [was] part of an adjudication" for purposes of the APA because it was "individualized," "[d]id not apply to any [other] entity," and did not provide "generalized guidance"); <span class="Italic">see also Neustar, Inc. v. FCC</span>, 857 F.3d 886, 893 (D.C. Cir. 2017) ("Rulemaking scenarios generally involve broad applications of more general principles rather than case-specific individual determinations.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Importantly, moreover, most board adjudications, including this one, are specifically excluded from APA coverage. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 554(a)(2) (exempting adjudications involving "the selection or tenure of an employee," other than adjudications involving certain administrative <span id="Page_769"></span>law judges). The Civil Service Reform Act, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (1978) ("CSRA"), "provides a comprehensive personnel system with extensive prescriptions for the protections and remedies available to federal employees." <span class="Italic">Reddick</span>, 809 F.3d at 1255; <span class="Italic">see United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 443 (1988).

The referred-to &#x00A7; 731.202 identifies the "[c]riteria for making suitability determinations," which govern the determination on which a "suitability action" is to be based. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 731.203(c) ("A suitability action may be taken against an applicant or an appointee when OPM or an agency exercising delegated authority under this part finds that the applicant or appointee is unsuitable for the reasons cited in &#x00A7; 731.202, subject to the agency limitations of &#x00A7; 731.103(g).").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is sufficient to affirm the Board's dismissal for want of jurisdiction that this case comes within the express exclusion from what constitutes a "suitability action" stated in &#x00A7; 731.203(b) under our precedent. We do not address whether NIH's action also falls outside the list of "suitability actions" in &#x00A7; 731.203(a), considered separately from &#x00A7; 731.203(b). Mr. Seneca, in his brief to us, has not argued that the Board mistakenly relied on &#x00A7; 731.203(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ricci v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 953 F.3d 753, 757 (Fed. Cir. 2020), we held that a revocation of a tentative offer of employment before the offered appointment took effect was a non-selection for a vacant position that came within &#x00A7; 731.203(b), which we read as excluding a "non-selection...for a specific position" from the scope of "suitability action." That holding reflects the subsection's history as well as language. In 2008, OPM amended its preexisting regulations on suitability actions by, among other things, both removing "denial of appointment" from the list of "suitability actions" in &#x00A7; 731.203(a) and adding what is now &#x00A7; 731.203(b). <span class="Italic">See</span> Suitability, 73 Fed. Reg. 20149, 20150-51 (OPM Final Rule, Apr. 15, 2008) (<span class="Italic">Final Rule</span>); <span class="Italic">compare</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203 (2007), with 73 Fed. Reg. at 20157 (amended regulation, matching current form as relevant here). In proposing the changes, OPM explained that its changes would "remove 'denial of appointment' as a suitability action, as currently defined in &#x00A7; 731.203" and "confirm that a non-selection for a specific position based on reasons set forth in this part is not a suitability action." Suitability, 72 Fed. Reg. 2203, 2203 (OPM Proposed Rule, Jan. 18, 2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board concluded that the exclusion stated in &#x00A7; 731.203(b) applies to this case. The key question for application of that subsection on the motion to dismiss in this case is whether Mr. Seneca, through his evidence and argument, made a nonfrivolous allegation that the scope of NIH's action went beyond "non-selection" of Mr. Seneca for the "specific position" at issue--that some broader action was taken. Mr. Seneca has not shown that the Board erred in answering that question "no."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The rescission occurred before an appointment had taken effect. The NIH action was not something other than a non-selection just because it was made on second rather than first thought or because the initial selection (unlike the one in <span class="Italic">Ricci</span>) was not expressly tentative. And, crucially, Mr. Seneca has identified no plausible basis, in the materials considered by the Board as constituting his allegations, for viewing the NIH action as broader in scope than simply a non-selection for the specific position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It makes no difference whether, as Mr. Seneca suggests, NIH's action stemmed from a determination that he was unsuitable for reasons that could have supported a "suitability action." As noted above, &#x00A7; 731.203(b) says that a non-selection as described is excluded from being a "suitability action" even if it was based on the same criteria that can be used to support a negative suitability determination, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202, to give rise to one of the "suitability actions" listed in &#x00A7; 731.203(a). Relatedly, nor would it make a difference if NIH's action, though limited to a non-selection for a specific position, could be characterized as a "constructive" suitability action. Before 2008, the Board had found jurisdiction over such a "constructive" suitability action, <span class="Italic">see Edwards v. Department of Justice</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 518, 521-24 (2001), but as we have recognized, OPM's 2008 regulatory change rejected such a basis for Board jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">see Final Rule</span>, 73 Fed. Reg. at 20152-53 (characterizing <span class="Italic">Edwards</span> as an "incorrect reading of the authority that OPM conferred" on the Board and "agreeing that the proposed change would overrule <span class="Italic">Edwards</span>"); <span class="Italic">Ricci</span>, 953 F.3d at 759 ("OPM specifically rejected <span class="Italic">Edwards'</span> holding that the board can exercise jurisdiction over 'constructive' suitability actions....").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, under <span class="Italic">Ricci</span>, NIH's action comes within &#x00A7; 731.203(b) and therefore is "<span class="Italic">not</span> a suitability action" reviewable by the Board. For that reason, Mr. Seneca did not make a nonfrivolous allegation that the Board had jurisdiction over his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Seneca asserts that the Board's stay of discovery was a harmful error because it deprived him of his right to fairly present his case for jurisdiction. "Procedural matters relative to discovery and evidentiary issues fall within the sound discretion of the board and its officials." <span class="Italic">Curtin</span>, 846 F.2d at 1378; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.71-.72. For Mr. Seneca to prevail, moreover, any error had to have "caused substantial harm or prejudice to his rights which could have affected the outcome of the case." <span class="Italic">Curtin</span>, 846 F.2d at 1379. We cannot so find here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Seneca does not argue to us that discovery would have turned up evidence that the NIH action was actually of broader scope than non-selection for the specific position. Rather, he argues only that he should have been given discovery to uncover the specifics of the information that motivated the promotion rescission. But Mr. Seneca has not explained how the content of the "information received" by the agency could affect anything but the reasons for NIH's action. And under &#x00A7; 731.203(b), the reasons for the agency action are a quite separate matter from the scope of the action taken: An action limited to a non-selection for a specific position remains unreviewable even if it was taken for reasons that would support a negative suitability determination that could be used to take a broader action qualifying as a reviewable "suitability action." Thus, even if Mr. Seneca had access through discovery to the "information received" by NIH and the information was related to any of the suitability determination criteria set out in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202, the outcome of his appeal to the Board would be the same: dismissal for lack of Board jurisdiction. As a result, we see no error in the administrative judge's stay of discovery in the first place and in any event no basis for finding any error to be harmful.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit supplied its explanation of the distinction between a nonselection and a suitability action, <span class="Italic">Solis v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP No. 2016-1726):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found that Mr. Solis's non-selections for the two CBP positions were not appealable "suitability actions" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203. It instead found that Mr. Solis's non-selection for each position was based on an "objection to an eligible" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.406, which is not appealable to the Board. Mr. Solis contends that his case should be considered a "suitability action" rather than an "objection to an eligible."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, "[t]he Board's jurisdiction is not plenary; rather, it is limited to actions designated as appealable to the Board 'under any law, rule, or regulation.'" <span class="Italic">Prewitt v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 133 F.3d 885, 886 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)). "An agency's failure to select an applicant for a vacant position is generally not appealable to the Board." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. "Thus, claims of unlawful conduct in the selection process ordinarily must be brought before other forums." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Mr. Solis contends that the general rule that the Board lacks jurisdiction over a claim of non-selection does not apply, however, because under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501(a), the Office of Personnel Management has granted jurisdiction to the Board to review cases in which an agency takes a "suitability action" against an applicant. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A "suitability action" is an "[a]ction based on suitability determinations," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3, taken by an authorized agency against an individual, which can include removal, debarment, cancellation of eligibility, or cancellation of reinstatement eligibility, &#x00A7; 731.203. An agency can take a "suitability action" against an individual if it finds that the individual is "unsuitable" for employment based on the "[c]riteria for making suitability determinations," set forth in &#x00A7; 731.202(b), which include "[c]riminal or dishonest conduct." &#x00A7; 731.203(c). A "suitability determination" "relate[s] to an individual's character or conduct that may have an impact on the integrity or efficiency of the service." &#x00A7; 1201.3. When an agency "takes a suitability action against a person, that person may appeal the action to the [Board]." &#x00A7; 731.501(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "suitability action" regulation itself--5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203--draws a clear distinction, however, between a "suitability action" and an "objection to an eligible." Specifically, &#x00A7; 731.203(b) provides that "[a] non-selection, or cancellation of eligibility for a specific position based on an objection to an eligible...under 5 C.F.R. [&#x00A7;] 332.406 is not a suitability action even if it is based on reasons set forth in &#x00A7; 731.202."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulation entitled "Objection to eligibles"--5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.406--provides that "[a]n agency is not required to consider an individual for a position" and may make an "objection" against an individual for that position if that objection "is based on a proper and adequate reason," &#x00A7; 332.406(b). One proper reason for an agency's objection to an eligible is the "[c]riteria for making suitability determinations" under &#x00A7; 731.202(b). &#x00A7; 332.406(b); <span class="Italic">see also</span> &#x00A7; 731.203(b) (explaining that an objection to an eligible may be "based on reasons set forth in &#x00A7; 731.202"). Finally, an agency's "objection to an eligible" is "not appeal[able] to the [Board] ," "irrespective of the reason for the decision." &#x00A7; 332.406(g).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These regulations thus create a somewhat confusing arrangement in which the same "suitability <span class="Italic">determination</span>" criteria can be a sufficient basis for a hiring agency to render either a "suitability action" (which can broadly bar an applicant from applying to any and all positions at the agency) or an "objection to an eligible" (which applies to an applicant for solely the specific, applied-for position). <span class="Italic">Compare</span> &#x00A7; 731.203(a), <span class="Italic">with</span> &#x00A7; 332.406(b). For an applicant who wishes to appeal his non-selection, which of these two actions the hiring agency takes matters because a "suitability action" is appealable to the Board but an "objection to an eligible" is not. Compounding the confusion is the need to appreciate the subtle but important distinction between the similarly worded "suitability determination" and "suitability action." As described above, the regulations provide that the criteria for making a suitability determination can be a basis for rendering a suitability action as well as used for making an objection to an eligible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the potential in the regulations for blurring the distinction between suitability actions and objections to an eligible, Mr. Solis does not challenge the legality of these regulations, nor does he argue that an "objection to an eligible" should be appealable. Mr. Solis instead limits his argument to challenging the Board's factual findings that CBP's non-selection of Mr. Solis for the two positions at issue here were objections to an eligible instead of suitability actions. We thus confine our focus to whether CBP permissibly applied the regulations to his case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The relation between suitability appeals and agency cancelation of appointments was clarified by the current OPM suitability regulations, the result of amendments in 2008 designed to attempt to avoid constructive suitability determination appeals. The amendments were applied in <span class="Italic">Kazan v. DOJ</span>, 112 MSPR 390, 391-93 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-8, 2009 MSPB 191 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 25, 2007, the U.S. Marshals Service tentatively selected the appellant for the GS-1802-07 position of Aviation Enforcement Officer, a position which required an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) background investigation. On October 14, 2008, the agency proposed finding the appellant unsuitable for the position based upon certain conduct revealed by the background investigation, in particular, misconduct or negligence in his prior employment and criminal or dishonest conduct. The appellant was given the opportunity to respond, and he did so, generally disputing the alleged misconduct. On March 17, 2009, the agency issued a decision letter stating that the appellant was "ineligible" for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appealed the agency's determination. He requested a hearing. The administrative judge (AJ) held the appellant's requested hearing, at which the appellant and several other witnesses testified. In her ID, the AJ concluded that the Board had jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501(a) and affirmed the agency's suitability determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We reopen this matter on our own motion because there is a question regarding the Board's jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, an unsuccessful candidate for a federal civil service position has no right to appeal his nonselection. <span class="Italic">Tines v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 56 M.S.P.R. 90, 93 (1992). Nevertheless, pursuant to OPM regulations at 5 C.F.R. Part 731, the Board has jurisdiction over certain matters involving suitability for federal employment. <span class="Italic">See Upshaw v. Consumer Product Safety Commission,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 236, &#x00B6; 7 (2009). Significantly, OPM issued revised suitability regulations which became effective June 16, 2008. 73 Fed. Reg. 20,149 (Apr. 15, 2008) (codified at 5 C.F.R. Part 731). Under the new 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501(a), only a "suitability action" may be appealed to the Board. A "suitability action" is defined as a cancellation of eligibility, a removal, a cancellation of reinstatement eligibility, and a debarment. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(a). In its revised regulations, OPM removed a "denial of appointment" from the list of actions appealable to the Board under the former &#x00A7; 731.203(a). <span class="Italic">See Upshaw,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 236, &#x00B6; 8. In addition, OPM's new regulations specify that a non-selection for a specific position is not a "suitability action," even if it is based on the criteria for making suitability determinations set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(b); <span class="Italic">Upshaw,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 236, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the AJ found Board jurisdiction without analysis or consideration of the revised suitability regulations regarding the denial of appointments. But the agency's action appears to be a matter outside the Board's jurisdiction under OPM's new regulations. The agency's decision letter stated that the appellant was rated "ineligible" for employment, but that determination was specifically limited to the appellant's "May 23, 2007 application" for the specific position of "Aviation Enforcement Officer." In addition, the agency does not appear to have taken any broader action regarding the appellant's eligibility, such as canceling any other eligibilities on other existing competitive registers. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Riggsbee v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 129, &#x00B6; 2 (2009) (referring to OPM's cancellation of eligibilities "on existing competitive registers"); <span class="Italic">Sazegari v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 254, &#x00B6; 2 (2006) (distinguishing between OPM's rating the appellant ineligible for the position of Immigration Inspector and its "cancel[ing] any eligibilities he may have obtained"). As such, the agency's action appears to be a non-selection for a specific position, an action outside the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, an appellant must receive explicit information on what is required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">See Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985). <span id="Page_771"></span>In this case, the AJ never provided the appellant with such explicit information and an opportunity to show Board jurisdiction. As a result, the parties never had the opportunity to submit evidence and argument regarding jurisdiction, and the record is not adequately developed on this threshold issue. We therefore must remand the appeal for further adjudication. On remand, the AJ should provide notice to the parties of the jurisdictional standard and determine whether this is a matter within the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In another appeal by Mr. Kazan, involving a different agency, the Board reaffirmed that denial of an appointment is not a suitability action, <span class="Italic">Kazan v. DHS,</span> DC-0731-09-0792-I-1 (NP 6/21/2011) (also touching on the relation of regulations governing suitability (5 CFR Part 731) and national security (5 CFR Part 732) determinations):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This appeal arose out of the agency's decision to rescind offers of employment to the appellant for the positions of Immigration Enforcement Agent and Seized Property Specialist. The agency stated that its decision was made pursuant to Executive Order 10450 and its implementing regulations at 5 C.F.R. Part 732 (Part 732), that the positions were designated Critical-Sensitive national security positions, and that the appellant had been deemed ineligible based on information obtained during the agency's background investigation. The appellant filed an appeal under 5 C.F.R. Part 731 (Part 731), which governs suitability determinations. The administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of Board jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see no error in the administrative judge's finding that the Part 732 regulations do not require an investigation by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and that the appellant did not show the agency action in his case was based on an OPM investigation. The appellant's repetition of these arguments on review is unavailing. <span class="Italic">See Weaver v. Department of the Navy</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 129, 133-34 (1980), <span class="Italic">review denied</span>, 669 F.2d 613 (9th Cir. 1982) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the documents that the appellant submitted on review regarding an OPM investigation for a prior position are not new and material evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Avansino v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 211, 214 (1980). The appellant has not shown that the documents he now provides regarding the prior OPM investigation were unavailable to him before the record closed on appeal. Moreover, the Board will not grant a petition for review based on new evidence absent a showing that it is of sufficient weight to warrant an outcome different from that of the initial decision.<span class="Italic"> Russo v. Veterans Administration</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 345, 349 (1980). Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the agency's action was based on the prior OPM investigation, the Board has no authority to enforce the notice and response provisions of Part 732, as the administrative judge correctly held.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the administrative judge correctly dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The agency asserted, and the administrative judge held, that the appeal must be dismissed because the agency's action was taken under Part 732. The appellant alleges that the action's purported coverage under 732 does not preclude jurisdiction under Part 731. Under Part 731, an individual may appeal to the Board from a suitability action taken against him by an agency. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501(a). An appealable suitability action is defined as follows: (1) cancellation of eligibility; (2) removal; (3) cancellation of reinstatement eligibility; and (4) debarment. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In issuing revised regulations in 2008, OPM deleted "denial of appointment" from the list of actions appealable to the Board. 73 Fed. Reg. 20,149 (Apr. 15, 2008); <span class="Italic">Upshaw v. Consumer Product Safety Commission,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 236, &#x00B6; 8 (2009). Further, the regulations specify that a "nonselection, or cancellation of eligibility for a specific position based on an objection to an eligible or pass-over of a preference eligible under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.406, is <span class="Italic">not</span> a suitability action even if it is based on reasons set forth in &#x00A7; 731.202." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(b). The appellant argues that, under a correct reading of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(b), a nonselection is not an appealable suitability action only if it is based on an objection to an eligible or pass-over of a preference eligible under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.406. His argument is without merit. The Board has repeatedly held in interpreting the regulation that a nonselection is not a suitability action even if it is based on suitability factors, and therefore it may not be appealed to the Board. <span class="Italic">Alvarez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 434, &#x00B6; 7 n.1 (2009); <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the agency action at issue was a cancellation of eligibility and thus appealable under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(a). We find that the administrative judge afforded the appellant an opportunity to establish jurisdiction under the current version of the revised suitability regulations, including specific notice that a denial of employment or a nonselection was not an appealable suitability action and that the appellant's appeal appeared to fall within this category. We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant did not proffer any facts that, if proven, would show that the agency's action was a cancellation of eligibility, rather than a nonselection for two specific positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, assuming without finding that the Board could consider this appeal under Part 731, we find that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction under Part 731 because he did not proffer facts which, if proven, would show that he was affected by a cancellation of eligibility, a removal, a cancellation of reinstatement eligibility, or a debarment under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(a). <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 325, 329 (1994) (citing <span class="Italic">Dumas v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 789 F.2d 892, 894 (Fed. Cir. 1986)). In the absence of a nonfrivolous allegation, the administrative judge correctly dismissed the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, in the initial decision, the administrative judge also found that the Board does not have the authority to review the merits of an agency's designation of a position as "sensitive" under Part 732, citing <span class="Italic">Crumpler v. Department of Defense</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 636, &#x00B6; 13 (2009), <span class="Italic">vacated</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 94 (2009). In two subsequent cases, the Board found that it does have the authority to review the merits of an agency's decision finding an employee ineligible to occupy a Non-Critical Sensitive position. <span class="Italic">Conyers v. Department of Defense</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 572, &#x00B6; 32 (2010); <span class="Italic">Northover v. Department of Defense</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 451, &#x00B6; 30 (2010). Therefore, to the extent the analysis in the initial decision relied upon <span class="Italic">Crumpler</span>, it is vacated.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kazan v. Dept. of State,</span> CH-0731-11-0738-I-1 (NP 6/19/2012), summarized the decisions concerning nonselections:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his timely filed petition for review, the appellant argues that because the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) retains jurisdiction to make final determinations and take actions in all suitability cases where, like here, there is evidence of a material, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud in examination of appointment, and OPM did not delegate its authority to the agency to take such an action, the agency acted without authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103(g). The appellant further argues that, as a consequence, the agency is estopped from relying on the protection of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(b) and its resulting unlawful suitability determination is therefore a constructive suitability action. The agency responds that it did refer the matter to OPM, which declined to take action, and returned the referral to the agency for appropriate action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held, and the regulations of OPM specifically provide, that such a non-selection does not amount to a suitability determination within the Board's jurisdiction, even if it is based on one of the specific suitability factors set forth in the regulation. <span class="Italic">E.g., Kazan v. Department of Justice</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 390, &#x00B6; 7 (2009); <span class="Italic">Alvarez v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant applied for and was tentatively offered a Customs and Border Protection Agriculture Specialist position in Newark, New Jersey, subject to a mandatory background investigation. On July 28, 2008, the agency proposed to find the appellant unsuitable for the position based upon financial issues that the agency discovered during the background investigation, and to withdraw its tentative offer of employment. The agency subsequently issued a negative suitability determination and withdrew its tentative offer of employment based upon the appellant's financial issues and dishonest conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a Board appeal to challenge the agency's negative suitability action, and alleged harmful error. He specifically asserted that the agency improperly relied upon a dishonest conduct issue in its negative suitability determination that was not previously raised in the proposal notice, thereby "depriving [him] of [his] ability to defend [him] self against this unexplained issue." He requested a hearing and later designated a representative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the appeal was pending, the agency sent the appellant a letter stating that on January 12, 2009, it overturned its negative suitability determination and officially offered the appellant the Agriculture Specialist position, which he accepted. The agency subsequently moved to dismiss the appeal as moot. The administrative judge (AJ) advised the appellant that the appeal appeared to be moot, and provided him with an opportunity to respond to the agency's motion to dismiss. The appellant responded in opposition to the agency's motion, alleging that his appeal was not moot because questions existed regarding his attorney's fees, and because the letter overturning the adverse suitability action referenced his alleged dishonest conduct, leaving the impression that the appellant "beat" the charge, and potentially causing a negative impact on his future employment and background checks.</p>

Under the new 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501(a), only a "suitability action" may be appealed to the Board.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The ID in this appeal found Board jurisdiction without addressing the revisions in OPM's suitability regulations relating to denial of appointment and nonselection. On its face, the agency's decision appears to be a matter now outside the Board's jurisdiction under OPM's new regulations. Although the parties did not raise this issue on appeal or on review, the Board must ensure that it has jurisdiction over the matter on appeal. <span class="Italic">See Metzenbaum v. General Services Administration,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 104, &#x00B6; 15 (2004) ("[T]he Board must satisfy itself that it has authority to adjudicate the matter before it and may raise the issue of its own jurisdiction <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> at any time."); <span class="Italic">Waldrop v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. MSPB</span>, 426 Fed. Appx. 894, 896 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP), noted as to earlier suitability regulations in a challenge to the denial of an appointment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to mid-2008, OPM regulations made the denial of an appointment based on an unsuitability determination appealable to the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.203(a)(2), 731.501(a) (2008). In April 2008, however, OPM issued a rule removing denial of appointment from the list of "suitability actions" that are subject to Board review. Fed. Reg. 20,149, 20,157 (Apr. 15, 2008). That rule went into effect in June 2008, which was a month before DHS notified Mr. Rodriguez of the "derogatory information" that it purportedly discovered in the course of its background investigation. Thus, the June 2008 regulations apply in this case. Under those regulations, Mr. Rodriguez's nonselection for appointment because of DHS's unsuitability determination was not an action that was appealable to the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(a), (b) (2009); <span class="Italic">see</span> 72 Fed. Reg. 2203, 2203 (Jan. 18, 2007) (clarifying the change in regulations).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both DHS and the Board's administrative judge initially erred in assuming that the Board had jurisdiction to hear Mr. Rodriguez's appeal. However, in the decision giving rise to this appeal, the Board properly determined that it lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Rodriguez's appeal of DHS's suitability determination. While DHS employed the suitability criteria listed in the OPM regulations in making its determination, and it termed the action a "suitability finding," the action that it took was not reviewable by the Board under the regulations that were in effect at the time of that action. Because the Board lacks jurisdiction over Mr. Rodriguez's appeal, it has no power to grant the relief Mr. Rodriguez seeks in the form of an order requiring DHS to expunge all references to dishonest conduct from the records of its suitability determination.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an appeal on June 10, 2008, in which he alleged that the agency made a negative suitability determination and removed him from the Senior Executive Service (SES) position of Chief Financial Officer, ES-0505-05. The agency filed a response asserting that it made no determination regarding the appellant's suitability for federal employment, but that instead, the agency withdrew the job offer before the appellant was officially appointed to the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that, in a letter dated May 6, 2008, the agency confirmed its tentative offer and the appellant's acceptance of the Chief Financial Officer position. The agency's letter advised the appellant that he was required to complete an electronic questionnaire for investigations processing and Optional Form 306, Declaration of Federal Employment. On May 20, 2008, prior to the agency's receipt of the appellant's completed forms, the agency received the appellant's Official Personnel File (OPF) from the Library of Congress where the appellant was most recently employed. The OPF contained the appellant's most recent standard form (SF)-50, notification of personnel action, which documented his October 12, 2007 termination during his probationary/trial period from the position of Social Science Analyst in the Library of Congress, and which he had not provided to the agency as required by the vacancy announcement. The agency contacted the appellant on May 21, 2008, and rescinded the offer of employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because there appeared to be a jurisdictional issue, the administrative <span id="Page_773"></span>judge (AJ) ordered the appellant to provide evidence and argument showing that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal as either a negative suitability determination or a removal. After considering the responses from both parties, including the declarations submitted by agency employees, the AJ dismissed the appeal upon finding that the agency withdrew its tentative offer of employment to the appellant after receiving his OPF and learning that he had been terminated from a prior position with the Library of Congress, which the appellant had concealed from the agency by failing to submit his most recent SF-50 as required by the vacancy announcement. The AJ found further that, because the agency's determination to withdraw the offer was based on the appellant's concealment of the fact that he had been terminated from his last position, the agency made a suitability determination involving a material, intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment, a determination that was outside the scope of its delegated authority and beyond the Board's jurisdiction. To the extent the appellant argued that he was removed from the position, the AJ found no evidence showing that the appellant was ever appointed by the authorizing authority or that the appellant had effectively entered on duty, since he had not even submitted the required security forms at the time that the agency rescinded its job offer. Thus, the AJ found that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency "canceled his appointment after it actually occurred."</p>

Nevertheless, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and revised as of January 1, 2008, the Board has jurisdiction over certain matters involving suitability for employment in positions in the competitive service and career appointments to positions in the SES. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.101, 731.501.

The many factors that might be relied upon in rendering a negative suitability determination include falsification, deception or fraud in the examination process, and misconduct or negligence in employment. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(b). Thus, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501(a), "[a]n individual who has been found unsuitable for employment may appeal the determination to the Merit Systems Protection Board."

The Board has previously held that, based on the above regulations, if the evidence shows that the candidate was actually found qualified for the position at issue, and the agency later removed him from consideration based on one of the reasons set forth under OPM's suitability guidelines involving the "character or conduct" of the candidate, then the Board may conclude that the candidate was subjected to an appealable "constructive suitability determination." <span class="Italic">See Saleem v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.601. OPM explained that its new regulations were issued, in part, to correct Board case law which had held that "what matters is the substance of the action, not the form," which OPM determined to be erroneous and beyond the intent of Congress. 73 Fed. Reg. at 20,152. OPM concluded that "when adjudicating an appeal of an agency action, the Board must assess the agency's action under the procedures elected by the agency and may not hold the agency to standards relating to a legal authority that the agency did not invoke." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether the new regulations retroactively apply in this case, we have considered the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Landgraf v. USI Film Products</span>, 511 U.S. 244 (1994)<span class="Italic">. See Rodriguez v. Peake</span>, 511 F.3d 1147, 1152-56 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (applying <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> in deciding whether to retroactively apply an amended regulation); <span class="Italic">Goodyear Tire &#x0026; Rubber Co. v. Department of Energy</span>, 118 F.3d 1531, 1536 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (applying <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, by analogy, to determine whether an agency may lawfully apply a newly-issued rule to disputes that are pending before it); <span class="Italic">Terrell v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 689, 692 (1997) (applying <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> in determining whether to retroactively apply a change in the Board's regulations). In <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 280, the Court held that "[w]hen a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the events in the suit, the court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute's proper reach." When the statute contains no express command, a court must determine whether the statute would have retroactive effect, i.e., whether it would "impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed." <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 280. If the statute would "operate retroactively," the court must apply a presumption that the statute "does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, because OPM's new regulations, if applied to pending cases, would have the effect of destroying Board jurisdiction, for example, over an appellant's pending claim that his denial of appointment is a suitability action, the new regulations impair an appeal right to the Board an appellant possessed at the time of his non-selection. Thus, we find that, under <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> and its progeny, the new suitability regulations would have a retroactive effect if applied to pending cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we are guided by the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital</span>, 488 U.S. 204 (1988). In <span class="Italic">Bowen</span>, the Court held that an agency may not promulgate retroactive regulations unless the power to do so has been conveyed by Congress in express terms. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 208<span class="Italic">; see also Princess Cruises, Inc. v. U.S</span>., 397 F.3d 1358, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing <span class="Italic">Bowen</span>). "Even where some substantial justification for retroactive rulemaking is presented, courts should be reluctant to find such authority absent an express statutory grant." <span class="Italic">Bowen</span>, 488 U.S. at 208.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The right to appeal a suitability action is found in 5 C.F.R. part 731. <span class="Italic">Zufan v</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of Transportation</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 258, &#x00B6; 9 (2002). However, as the Board recognized in <span class="Italic">Zufan</span>, the authority for the regulations at 5 C.F.R. part 731 derives from statutes, specifically 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1302, 3301, and 7701. <span class="Italic">See Zufan</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 258, &#x00B6; 10. In none of these statutes does Congress expressly grant OPM the authority to issue retroactive regulations relating to suitability or any other topic. Accordingly, we find that, because Congress has not granted OPM the authority to issue a retroactive regulation relating to suitability, the new suitability regulations cannot be given retroactive effect, regardless of OPM's intent. Thus, the suitability regulations in effect at the time of the appellant's non-selection will govern in this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an appellant makes a nonfrivolous allegation that the Board has jurisdiction over an appeal, the appellant is entitled to a hearing on the jurisdictional question, <span class="Italic">Yiying Liu v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 178, &#x00B6; 8 (2007); <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 325, 329 (1994). Nonfrivolous allegations of Board jurisdiction are allegations of fact, which if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board has jurisdiction over the matter at issue. <span class="Italic">Ferdon</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 329. To meet the nonfrivolous standard, an appellant need only plead allegations of fact which, if proven, could show jurisdiction, though mere <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> allegations are insufficient to satisfy the nonfrivolous standard. <span class="Italic">Yiying Liu</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 178, &#x00B6; 8. In determining whether the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction entitling him to a hearing, the AJ may consider the agency's documentary submissions; however, to the extent that the agency's evidence constitutes mere factual contradiction of the appellant's otherwise adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, the AJ may not weigh evidence and resolve conflicting assertions of the parties, and the agency's evidence may not be dispositive. <span class="Italic">Yiying Liu</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 178, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Ferdon</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 329.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, because it appeared that the Board may not have jurisdiction over the appeal, the AJ ordered the parties to provide evidence and argument <span id="Page_774"></span>concerning the appellant's claims that the agency made a negative suitability determination and removed him from the SES position of Chief Financial Officer. This order specifically advised the appellant that he had to show that the agency has been delegated the authority by OPM to make suitability determinations, that the determination was within the delegated authority, and that the determination was based on suitability factors listed in 5 C.F.R. part 731.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency responded by submitting evidence showing that on May 20, 2008, it received the appellant's OPF from the Library of Congress, which indicated that it had terminated the appellant during his probationary period. In a declaration, sworn under penalty of perjury, Beth Schwab, Deputy Director, Office of Human Resources Management (EXRM), stated that she contacted the Human Resources Office at the Library of Congress, which confirmed that the authority code cited on the appellant's termination SF-50 was based on "conduct or delinquency after entrance on duty." Ms. Schwab stated further that she advised Donna Simpson, Director, EXRM, and Patsy Semple, Executive Director for the agency, to consider the following facts:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1) the Appellant had a break in federal service over 30 days; (2) the Agency had not received Appellant's completed security forms; (3) the fingerprint chart of the Appellant submitted by the Agency was returned unclassifiable by the FBI and a second set of fingerprints had to be taken and resubmitted; (4) the incorrect SF-50 was submitted by Appellant with his application for employment; and [sic] (5) the Termination SF-50 in the Appellant's OPF made it necessary for the Appellant to favorably complete the background investigation prior to appointment; and (6) upon receipt of forms from the Appellant and submission to OPM, the processing time for the required investigation conducted by OPM would have been 120-days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Schwab stated that, because the agency had a "critical need to fill the high-profile Senior Executive position quickly," Ms. Simpson directed her to notify the appellant that the agency had decided to withdraw its tentative offer of employment. In addition, Ms. Schwab stated that she contacted the appellant at approximately 11:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span> on May 21, 2008, to advise him that the agency was withdrawing the tentative offer of employment, and she also stated that the agency did not receive the appellant's preliminary paperwork necessary to initiate the background investigation until after she had notified him that the job offer was rescinded. Ms. Schwab further stated that the agency "did not complete a background investigation on Appellant, and did not make a determination regarding his suitability for federal government."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Supporting Ms. Schwab's declaration is a second declaration, signed under penalty of perjury, from Ms. Simpson, in which she states that, after the agency received the appellant's OPF from the Library of Congress, she consulted with Ms. Schwab and Ms. Semple to consider the impact the factors set forth by Ms. Schwab would have on the agency's ability to fill the position quickly. Ms. Simpson stated that, based on the projected delay in filling the position, she directed Ms. Schwab to notify the appellant that the agency's tentative offer of employment was withdrawn. Ms. Simpson also stated that the agency did not complete a background investigation on the appellant, that the agency made no determination regarding the appellant's suitability for federal employment, and that the agency did not receive the appellant's preliminary paperwork until after Ms. Schwab had notified him that the offer of employment was rescinded.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ subsequently considered all of the evidence described above and found that the appellant made no nonfrivolous allegations of facts which, if true, would establish Board jurisdiction over this appeal, and issued an initial decision based on the written record. Specifically, the AJ found, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that "the agency withdrew its tentative offer of employment to the appellant after receiving his OPF and learning that he had been terminated from a prior position, a fact that he had concealed from the agency by failing to submit his most recent SF-50 as required by the vacancy announcement." The AJ then found that the appellant "continued to conceal this fact by denying it on OP 306 and stating on the electronic questionnaire that he left the position under favorable circumstances when his 'conditional appointment [was] not converted to permanent status.'" The AJ found further that the agency made a determination to withdraw the position offer "based on the appellant's concealment of the fact that he had been terminated from his last position," and thus, "the agency made a suitability determination involving a material, intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment, a determination that was outside the scope of its delegated authority." Thus, the AJ dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction without a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, taking the appellant's allegations as true, we find that the appellant met the requisite nonfrivolous standard under <span class="Italic">Ferdon</span> when he alleged, the Board may conclude the appellant was subjected to a constructive suitability determination); that the agency made a constructive negative suitability determination, which OPM authorized it to do within its delegated authority, when it rescinded the offer of employment after receiving his OPF from the Library of Congress, which indicated that it had terminated him during his probationary period. Because the appellant's claim that the employment offer was rescinded after the agency received his OPF from the Library of Congress is supported by documentary evidence, including the appellant's declaration signed under penalty of perjury, the Board can infer from the written record that the rescission of the offer of employment possibly could have been a constructive suitability determination. <span class="Italic">See Edwards</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 518, &#x00B6; 9 (if evidence shows a candidate had actually been found qualified for the position and the agency later removed him from consideration based on one of the reasons set forth under OPM's guidelines at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.2025 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202 (among the reasons in OPM's guidelines are misconduct or negligence in employment, and material, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the record supports the appellant's contention that the agency's rescission of the offer of employment could have constituted a constructive suitability determination within the agency's delegated authority, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103 (Jan. 1, 2008), the appellant has stated an adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of jurisdiction and the AJ should not have accepted the agency's evidence as dispositive. Therefore, we find that the AJ erred when, without holding a jurisdictional hearing,[2] she credited the agency's evidence to find that the agency made a suitability determination that was outside of its scope of delegated authority. <span class="Italic">Saleem</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 151, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-11, 13; <span class="Italic">Ferdon</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 329-30. Accordingly, we find it necessary to remand this case for a jurisdictional hearing on the issue of whether the rescission of the agency's offer of employment constituted a constructive suitability determination within the agency's delegated authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note that the AJ's characterization of the agency's argument in this regard is not accurate. Specifically, there is nothing in the record to support the AJ's finding that the agency made a determination to withdraw the position offer "based on the appellant's concealment of the fact that he had been terminated from his last position." Rather, the agency explicitly argued, and provided declarations in support, that this was not the basis for the rescission of the employment offer.</p>
