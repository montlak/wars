<h4 class="h4" id="sec4-29"><span class="space">4.</span> Disapproval of Agreement Imposed by FSIP or Interest Arbitrator</h4>
<p class="noindent">The procedures described concerning disapproval of contracts apply to decisions by the Federal Services Impasses Panel after it helps to fashion what the parties thought would be a final agreement. Section 7114(c) of the Statute authorizes an agency head to review provisions of a collective bargaining agreement, including those imposed on the parties by the Panel, and to disapprove provisions the agency head determines are not in accordance with the Statute and other applicable law, rule, or regulation. Once the Panel decision issues, the agency head has 30 days to review the agreement imposed, unless there are further negotiations. The union's disagreement with the Panel's decision is immaterial. <span class="Italic">DODDES and FEA Stateside</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-116.html">72 FLRA 601</a>, 604 (2021) (Chairman DuBester concurring) (granting exceptions to award of arbitrator who found the Panel's decision lacking in jurisdiction) (recon. den., <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-35.html">73 FLRA 149</a> (2022)). An agency head's decision to disapprove a provision imposed by the Panel is subject to review through a negotiability appeal by the union. If FLRA determines the provision to be negotiable through a ULP proceeding (rather than a negotiability appeal), the agency commits a ULP in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) for failing to cooperate in an Impasses Panel decision. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 22 FLRA 821, 827-28 (1986) (directing retroactive application of contract provision). If the FSIP directs an interest arbitrator, who may be a Panel member, to resolve the bargaining impasse, originally FLRA reviewed the arbitration award through the exceptions rather than the negotiability review procedure. Now, as a result of court decisions, the Panel member's interest arbitration award is subject to review as though it were a contract submitted to the agency head for approval. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-12-099.html#sec4-100">Role of ULP Procedures</a>," explaining the limited circumstances supporting retroactive relief in ULP cases involving negotiability issues, and refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-12-087.html#sec4-87">Role of FSIP</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-12-092.html#sec4-92">Agency and FLRA Review of FSIP Orders</a>"; refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-16-044.html#sec8-45">Failure to Honor FSIP Determination</a>," for negotiability issues arising from FSIP orders.]</p>
<p class="noindent">As to contracts imposed through arbitration conducted by a FSIP Panel member, who essentially writes the parties' contract, <span class="Italic">Int'l Org. of Masters, Mates and Pilots and Panama Canal Comm'n</span>, 36 FLRA 555, 560-62, 564 (1990), commented on the timing of the agency head's disapproval:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Authority previously held that agency heads were not authorized under section 7114(c)...to review provisions imposed by an interest arbitrator. Consistent with those decisions, the Authority did not address whether it was necessary for the parties to "execute" the agreement so as to trigger the statutory time limit applicable to agency head review. For the following reasons, we now conclude that, in this case, the date on which the arbitrator's decision was served on the parties constituted the date on which the agreement was executed, within the meaning of section 7114(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7114(b)(5) of the Statute provides that the obligation to bargain in good faith includes the obligation "to execute on the request of any party to the negotiation a written document embodying the agreed terms, and to take such steps as are necessary to implement such agreement."...&#8197;The execution of the agreement, in turn, triggers a step necessary to implement the agreement: agency head review under section 7114(c). In situations where the parties have reached agreement bilaterally, the purpose of section 7114(b)(5) appears clear. Execution of a written agreement is necessary to ensure that, in fact, there is a "meeting of the minds" on the terms of the agreement. Until such time as the parties have signed a written document embodying their understandings, there is no agreement to review under section 7114(c) or to otherwise implement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case now before us, however, the arbitrator's decision encompassed the parties' entire agreement. That is, the decision included provisions which had been agreed on bilaterally, those on which agreement was reached during mediation with the arbitrator, and those which the arbitrator decided. In fact, the arbitrator noted that "[i]t was agreed by counsel for the [Agency and the Union] that [the arbitrator] would direct the adoption of the full contract."...&#8197;Consistent with the parties' agreement, the arbitrator "directed" the parties "to place in effect the collective bargaining contract, attached...."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the parties themselves took the position that, in view of the nature of the arbitrator's decision, execution of the collective bargaining agreement was not necessary....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, consistent with the parties' statements concerning execution of the agreement, there is no basis in the record before us on which to conclude that the parties agreed that further action was necessary to finalize their agreement. There is no indication, for example, that the parties intended to alter, by agreement, any of the provisions imposed by the arbitrator. In addition, the Agency did not await the arbitrator's response to the clarification requests to begin the review process under section 7114(c) and the Union did not assert that the Agency should await clarification before beginning that process....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In these circumstances, we conclude that a requirement that the parties act so as to "execute" this agreement would constitute a meaningless formality.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, we hold that the date on which the arbitrator's decision imposing the...agreement was served on the parties constitutes the date that the...agreement was "executed" for purposes of review by the Agency head under section 7114(c)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Agency head did not timely disapprove the parties' agreement, there is no negotiability dispute properly before us in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">The situation is different if an interest arbitrator resolves only some of the disputed articles and the parties bargain the remainder, <span class="Italic">NTEU and FDIC, Div. of Bank Supervision, Chicago Region</span>, 39 FLRA 848, 849 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The arbitrator's decision was limited to portions of six articles that had been specifically presented to him....&#8197;Subsequent to the issuance of the arbitrator's decision, the parties had "several discussions and met extensively on at least one occasion to continue substantive negotiations over several articles which remained unresolved after the arbitrator's award."...&#8197;During those discussions, "provisions were in fact modified and agreed to by the parties subsequent to the arbitrator's award." By memorandum dated September 25, 1989, the Agency head disapproved two provisions, one of which was the subject of the arbitrator's award and another that had not been before the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The facts of this case are distinguishable from those in <span class="Italic">International Organizations of Masters, Mates and Pilots and Panama Canal Commission</span>, 36 FLRA 555 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Panama Canal Commission</span>)....&#8197;[W]e dismissed the union's petition for review of negotiability issues because the parties' collective bargaining agreement had become final and binding when it was not disapproved by the agency head within 30 days of the date of an interest arbitrator's decision. In <span class="Italic">Panama Canal Commission</span>, however, the interest arbitrator's decision encompassed the parties' entire agreement. Such is not the case here. Rather, the facts show that the parties engaged in further, substantive negotiations following the issuance of the interest arbitrator's decision and that issuance of that decision did not constitute the date on which the agreement was executed. Thus, in this case, unlike <span class="Italic">Panama Canal Commission</span>, the 30-day time limit for Agency-head review which is set forth in section 7114 (c) of the Statute, was not triggered by the issuance of the interest arbitrator's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">Again addressing when a fragmented interest arbitration award becomes sufficiently final to trigger the agency's obligation to fish or cut bait, FLRA observed in <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 41 FLRA 795, 800-05 (1991), that the date of execution of the contract is the date when no further action is necessary to finalize a complete agreement, not the dates when agreement is reached as to individual articles or provisions of that agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To be timely, a petition for review of a negotiability issue filed pursuant to section 7117 of the Statute must meet specified time limits that run from either a written allegation from an agency that the duty to bargain does not extend to the matter proposed or a written request from an exclusive representative to an agency for such an allegation....&#8197;An agency head's disapproval of a collective bargaining agreement pursuant to section 7114(c) of the Statute constitutes an agency allegation of nonnegotiability for the purposes of filing a petition for review....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Union contends that the Agency head's disapproval was untimely as to many of the provisions at issue. The facts underlying this question are as follows. Pursuant to the direction of the Panel, the parties engaged in interest arbitration to resolve the impasse they had reached in negotiation over a new basic agreement. The arbitrator elected to serve his award in several installments, a few articles at a time, over a period extending from April 29, 1986, to June 9, 1986. On April 29, 1986, the arbitrator prevailed upon the parties to implement on May 1, 1986, all of the provisions that he had awarded up to that point. Over the following weeks, the arbitrator continued to issue awards as to further provisions; the last was served by hand on the parties on June 9, 1986.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On June 25, 1986, the Agency filed exceptions to that portion of the award that was served on April 29, 1986. Those exceptions, which were designated Case No. 0-AR-1176, were dismissed as untimely in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) and Patent Office Professional Association</span> (<span class="Italic">POPA</span>), 24 FLRA 835 (1986). By memorandum dated May 30, 1986, the Agency notified the Union that pursuant to section 7114(c) of the Statute the Agency head had <span id="Page_422"></span>disapproved certain of the provisions contained in that portion of the arbitrator's award. The Union filed the negotiability petition in Case No. 0-NG-1287 in response to the Agency's May 30, 1986, memorandum.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By memorandum dated and served on the Union on June 26, 1986, the Agency notified the Union that certain of the provisions awarded by the arbitrator during the period extending between May 1 and June 9 had been disapproved. The Union filed the negotiability petition in Case No. 0-NG-1296 in response to the Agency's June 26 memorandum.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that the Agency head disapproval that is the subject of Case No. 0-NG-1287 is untimely in whole and that the disapproval that is the subject of Case No. 0-NG-1296 is untimely with respect to all but provisions in articles 12 and 35. In support of this contention, the Union argues that the 30-day time limit for disapproval of a particular provision ran from the date on which that provision was awarded. The Agency, on the other hand, argues that June 9, 1986, the date on which the last installment of the arbitrator's award was issued, should constitute the date of execution for purposes of section 7114(c) agency head review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7114(c) of the Statute, an agreement between any agency and an exclusive representative "shall be subject" to approval by the head of the agency. The agency head is required to act within 30 days from the date that the agreement is executed. If the agency head does not approve or disapprove the agreement within the 30-day period, the agreement takes effect automatically on the thirty-first day....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that it is "the agreement," not a portion thereof, that is subject to agency head approval under section 7114(c). <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Watervliet Arsenal, Watervliet, New York</span>, 34 FLRA 98, 105 (1989) (<span class="Italic">Watervliet Arsenal</span>)....&#8197;Where an agency head timely disapproves an agreement under section 7114(c) of the Statute, the agreement does not take effect and is not binding on the parties. <span class="Italic">Watervliet Arsenal</span>, 34 FLRA at 105. Of course, parties may agree to implement all portions of the local agreement not specifically disapproved by the agency head. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the purposes of the agency head review process, we believe that section 7114(c) contemplates that an agreement generally will be treated as an integrated and complete document rather than as a collection of articles and sections. This principle is consistent with the Authority's precedent that "the agreement, not a portion thereof," is subject to agency head approval under section 7114(c)....&#8197;To hold otherwise would produce chaotic results. That is, if we were to hold that each individual provision was subject separately to the approval process a situation could result where some portions of the same agreement were approved, some were disapproved, and some went into effect automatically based on an agency's failure to act within the 30-day time limit. Additionally, given the nature of negotiations, it could be very difficult to reliably ascertain the execution date of a particular provision. In this regard, we note that give and take is one of the cornerstones of collective bargaining. Thus, it would not be unusual for parties having reached tentative agreement on a particular provision to reconsider that agreement in efforts to come to an agreement on another provision. Moreover, one segment of an agreement may affect the meaning of another segment....&#8197;It is not unreasonable to assume that the definitions could affect the meaning of previously awarded articles.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For these reasons we hold that the date of execution that triggers the time limits for agency head review under section 7114(c)(2) relates to the date on which no further action is necessary to finalize a complete agreement, not the dates on which agreement is reached as to individual pieces of that agreement....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further conclude that the Agency head timely disapproved the agreement in these cases.&#x2003;The Authority has previously stated that section 7114(c) of the Statute contemplates that approval or disapproval will occur only after the agreement has been executed....&#8197;"Execution" for purposes of section 7114(c) review does not occur until negotiations relating to the agreement being executed are completed. Consequently, based on the circumstances of this case, the Agency head's May 30, 1986, disapproval memorandum, which was based on review of a partially completed agreement, was premature. Based on the June 9 execution date, however, the Agency head's disapproval memorandum that was served on June 26, 1986, was timely and served to disapprove the entire agreement....</p>
<p class="noindent">There is a distinction between an exception to an award of an arbitrator who directs the parties to bargain and an agency's negotiability challenge to a proposal that results from those negotiations. The agency's right to challenge the negotiability of the proposal is not waived by the agency's failure to except to the arbitrator's award directing negotiations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 2119 and Dept. of Army, Rock Island Arsenal</span>, 49 FLRA 151, 153 (1994).</p>
