<h4 class="h4" id="sec7-73"><span class="space">7.</span> Progressive Discipline</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board and the courts are not wedded to progressive discipline. Results vary according to the nature of the conduct, the strength of the advocacy, and the adjudicator's sense of fairness. It is difficult to make general statements about the conduct least or most likely to sustain removal without progressive discipline. The Board does not accept as a basic premise that an agency should impose only the least penalty needed to correct misconduct. Removal may not be necessary as a penalty, but the question is only whether removal is within the agency's discretion. <span class="Italic">See Lewis v. Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, 29 MSPR 447, 454 (1985) ("Removal may not have been <span class="Italic">necessary</span> in this case since the agency was free to choose a lesser penalty. However, removal is clearly within the bounds of reasonableness[.] "); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Dennehy v. VA</span>, 27 MSPR 31, 34 (1985) (agency is not required to prove the propriety of a particular penalty by a preponderance of evidence; the agency's burden is to demonstrate that the penalty is within tolerable limits of reasonableness). Removal may be a reasonable penalty for relatively minor misconduct when an employee has a record of prior discipline. <span class="Italic">Alaniz v. USPS</span>, 100 MSPR 105, 112-13 &#x00B6; 16 (2005).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Executive Branch affirmed it was not wedded to progressive discipline in the now-revoked Executive Order 13,839 of May 25, 2018 ("Executive Order Promoting Accountability and Streamlining Removal Procedures Consistent with Merit System Principles"), at <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/01/2018-11939/promoting-accountability-and-streamlining-removal-procedures-consistent-with-merit-system-principles">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/01/2018-11939/promoting-accountability-and-streamlining-removal-procedures-consistent-with-merit-system-principles</a>, issued by President Trump:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sec. 2. Principles for Accountability in the Federal Workforce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Supervisors and deciding officials should not be required to use progressive discipline. The penalty for an instance of misconduct should be tailored to the facts and circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Each employee's work performance and disciplinary history is unique, and disciplinary action should be calibrated to the specific facts and circumstances of each individual employee's situation. Conduct that justifies discipline of one employee at one time does not necessarily justify similar discipline of a different employee at a different time--particularly where the employees are in different work units or chains of supervision--and agencies are not prohibited from removing an employee simply because they did not remove a different employee for comparable conduct. Nonetheless, employees should be treated equitably, so agencies should consider appropriate comparators as they evaluate potential disciplinary actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;Suspension should not be a substitute for removal in circumstances in which removal would be appropriate. Agencies should not require suspension of an employee before proposing to remove that employee, except as may be appropriate under applicable facts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;When taking disciplinary action, agencies should have discretion to take into account an employee's disciplinary record and past work record, including all past misconduct--not only similar past misconduct. Agencies should provide an employee with appropriate notice when taking a disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM followed suit with "Guidance on the Use of Progressive Discipline and Tables of Penalties," accompanied by a memorandum to agency heads from the OPM Director of October 19, 2019, summarizing the Guidance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A number of agencies have established policies that require progressive discipline when determining penalties for employee misconduct. Progressive discipline is the imposition of the least serious disciplinary or adverse action applicable to correct misconduct with penalties imposed at an escalating level of subsequent offenses. Many agencies have also implemented a table of penalties which provides a list of common infractions along with a suggested range of penalties for each infraction. Finally, agencies often receive collective bargaining proposals from labor unions seeking to impose t he use of progressive discipline and tables of penalties and have adopted related provisions in collective bargaining agreements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Agencies should be mindful that neither the use of progressive discipline nor the adoption of a table of penalties is required by statute, case law or U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations. Further, the use of these approaches presents challenges that agencies should consider prior to adoption. In enacting current law, Congress provided managers with maximum flexibility to pursue adverse actions, whether the underlying impetus is a conduct issue, a failure to perform, or any other reasons related to Federal employment, as needed for the efficiency of the service. Moreover, E.O. 13839 itself, as discussed in the annexed memorandum, provides that supervisors and deciding officials should not be required to use progressive discipline and should calibrate penalties to the specific facts of the particular situation. OPM is aware that agencies have argued to arbitrators that it is inconceivable that the conduct at issue could have resulted in any penalty less than removal. Arbitrators have pointed to the existence of tables of penalties for that type of misconduct as a basis for mitigating the penalty. The attachment to this memorandum provides guidance on progressive discipline and tables of penalties for agencies to consider when updating disciplinary policies or engaging in collective bargaining.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">In 2020 OPM placed consideration of progressive discipline on a regulatory footing, 5 CFR 752.202 (2022) (repeated at 5 CFR 752.403, 5 CFR 752.603 (2022)) (and dropped by OPM in 2022):</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;An agency is not required to use progressive discipline under this subpart. The penalty for an instance of misconduct should be tailored to the facts and circumstances. In making a determination regarding the appropriate penalty for an instance of misconduct, an agency shall adhere to the standard of proposing and imposing a penalty that is within the bounds of tolerable reasonableness. Within the agency, a proposed penalty is in the sole and exclusive discretion of a proposing official, and a penalty decision is in the sole and exclusive discretion of the deciding official. Penalty decisions are subject to appellate or other review procedures prescribed in law.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">A provision in a collective bargaining agreement endorsing progressive discipline may not compel it, <span class="Italic">Noble v. USPS</span>, 556 Fed. Appx. 941, 944 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, Mr. Noble relies for his progressive-discipline argument on Article 16 of the applicable collective bargaining agreement, which provides generally that discipline must be corrective rather than punitive. He recognizes, however, that the provision, whatever it requires, applies only to "most" offenses, not all. The collective-bargaining agreement does not preclude the immediate removal of an employee who engages in serious misconduct, as long as the "agency [can] show that the penalty imposed will increase the efficiency of the service and that it is not arbitrary or capricious." <span class="Italic">Graybill v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 782 F.2d 1567, 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">see also Thomas v. Dep't of Def.,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. 546, 553 (1995). The administrative judge found, and the Board affirmed, that Mr. Noble's AWOL status warranted removal. <span class="Italic">Noble v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., No. DC-0752-11-0880-I-1, slip op. at 5 (M.S.P.B. Oct. 25, 2012). Because an employee's AWOL status "seriously impede[s] the function of an agency" by "impos[ing] burdens on other employees and, if tolerated, destroy[ing] the morale of those who meet their obligations," <span class="Italic">Davis v. Veterans Admin</span>., 792 F.2d 1111, 1113 (Fed. Cir. 1986), substantial evidence supports the Board's determination that removal was a reasonable penalty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Bieche v. USPS</span>, 91 Fed. Appx. 149, 152 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP) (a provision of a collective bargaining agreement stating that discipline should be corrective in nature rather than punitive did not, "on its face," require progressive discipline); <span class="Italic">Brehmer v. FAA</span>, 294 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2002) ("The statement in the collective bargaining agreement that 'consideration should be given' to non-disciplinary measures did not require the Administration to eschew discipline in every situation.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Several cases provide a sampling of adjudicators' approaches to differing factual situations. Agency disciplinary regulations, tables of penalties, and collective bargaining contracts should be reviewed to determine when progressive discipline may be required as a matter of agency policy aside from more general suggestions in Board or court cases.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Weiss v. USPS</span>, 700 F.2d 754, 757 n.7 (1st Cir. 1983), involving dismissal of an employee for excessive absence, rejected the challenge that a less severe penalty would correct the misconduct and better serve service efficiency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he presiding official went to great lengths in attempting to transform a basically judgmental decision into a factual one.... The presiding official's approach seems to rest on the assumption that in order to satisfy 5 USC 7513(a) the least severe penalty which is likely to bring about employee behavior modification must be identified as a factual matter and only that penalty imposed, any more severe penalty being overkill and thus unnecessary to "promote the efficiency of the service." This is not a necessary reading of 7513(a), for both the discharge of an unreliable employee (and replacement by a reliable one) as well as correction of said employee's behavior will result in increased efficiency to the service. Moreover, while theoretically it might be desirable that the least severe but effective punishment be identified and imposed, as a matter of practicality such a determination is, within broad limits, at best a matter of prediction or judgment. Therefore, to treat the matter as one of fact to be determined under the preponderance of the evidence standard is to render the MSPB, or its agent, rather than the employing agency, the primary determiner and thus to interfere substantially with the employing agency's ability to manage efficiently its work force....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit does not require an agency to demonstrate that the particular penalty imposed is the least severe penalty necessary to effect the desired result. The agency need only show that the penalty imposed will increase the efficiency of the service and that it is not arbitrary or capricious. <span class="Italic">Graybill v. USPS</span>, 782 F.2d 1567 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Of a penalty challenged as being in violation of agency policies calling for progressive discipline, <span class="Italic">Zazueta v. DOJ</span>, 104 Fed. Appx. 166, 170 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supervisor's Guide to Discipline in the INS provides that penalties for misconduct should be the minimum necessary to correct the behavior and should fit the offense. Removal is described as "the capital punishment of Federal discipline" and "should be used only for very egregious offenses (such as rape of an alien, embezzlement of thousands of dollars from the government or other felony criminal misconduct)." The Supervisor's Guide, however, does not bar the separation of an employee after alternatives have been considered, and Chief Stitt found alternative penalties to be insufficient because they could not repair the breach of trust that had occurred when an officer with drug interdiction responsibilities had been found to have engaged in the very conduct he was charged with combating. This court finds nothing in the record that renders this conclusion arbitrary or unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Court of Claims determined that the law does not require a strict order of progressively harsher penalties to be followed in every case. <span class="Italic">Moten v. USPS</span>, 229 Ct. Cl. 796 (1982). <span class="Italic">McClaskey v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 720 F.2d 583, 588 n.2 (9th Cir. 1983), stated that there is no absolute requirement of progressive discipline. To require that progressive discipline should be applied, it is necessary that there be evidence that it has been adopted by an employer as a matter of choice, custom, or bargaining, not judicial prescription from an empty record. Judge Reinhardt wrote a dissenting opinion, critical of the majority's disavowal of the principle of progressive discipline, long considered a "hallmark of enlightened employee relations." The dissenter said that although there could be circumstances justifying removal for a first offense, the ultimate penalty should not be imposed in the first instance if a lesser punishment would adequately serve the governmental purpose.<span class="Italic"> But see Sekerak v. R.R. Retirement Bd.</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 96-3061) (remanding removal for consideration of a suspension because the Board failed to make findings on whether lesser penalties would be adequate and effective to deter the petitioner or others from engaging in similar conduct in the future).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board follows the example of the Federal Circuit, rather than of Judge Reinhardt. The possibility that a lesser penalty would deter or punish does not serve to mitigate removal, <span class="Italic">Stephens v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 58 MSPR 502, 506-07 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge based her decision to mitigate the penalty partly on her view that the agency failed to demonstrate that it considered whether a lesser penalty would have been effective in deterring similar conduct by the appellant in the future. The deciding official, however, testified that he considered lesser discipline, but that he had lost trust in the appellant's ability to work with female coworkers in an environment where employees routinely work together in cramped, tight spaces and where the agency could not effectively restrict the appellant's assignments so as to avoid such situations. The deciding official also stated his belief that a lesser penalty was not warranted in view of the seriousness of the appellant's behavior, which he characterized as demonstrating "an extreme lack of regard for a person's feelings and for their dignity as a person." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 42, 56-57. The evidence shows that the agency considered the viability of alternative sanctions, but concluded that they would be ineffective in light of the nature of the offense, the need for the appellant to work with female employees in confined spaces, and the agency's obligation to provide a workplace free of intrusive conduct. <span class="Italic">See Campbell v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 37 MSPR 691, 697 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Shaw v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 80 MSPR 98, 118 (1998), rejected an interpretation of agency regulations requiring progressive discipline:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant contends that the agency committed harmful procedural error because it failed to use progressive discipline, as required by the agency's guidelines. This contention lacks merit. Harmful procedural error is defined as error, whether regulatory or statutory, which likely had a harmful effect upon the outcome of the case before the agency. <span class="Italic">See Stephen v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 47 MSPR 672, 681, 685 (1991). Harmful procedural error under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A) cannot be presumed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant bears the burden of proof on the affirmative defense of harmful procedural error. <span class="Italic">See Scott,</span> 69 MSPR at 242.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the appellant's contention, the agency's guidelines on discipline, set forth in Air Force Instruction 36-704, did not require it to impose discipline short of removal. Rather, those guidelines state, at paragraph 14.2.1, that removal may be imposed where, as here, an employee has so breached the employer-employee relationship that <span id="Page_2369"></span>other rehabilitation is not appropriate, and removal is warranted. Thus, the appellant has failed to show error in the agency's application of its disciplinary procedures, and consequently, he has failed to establish his affirmative defense of harmful procedural error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"An agency's use of warnings and counselings rather than formal disciplinary action does not preclude the agency from removing an employee." <span class="Italic">Zampedri v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 35 MSPR 357, 361-62 (1987). If the Board believes that misconduct is serious enough, any adherence to progressive penalties is abandoned. In <span class="Italic">Facas v. USPS</span>, 35 MSPR 426, 431 (1987), the Board concluded that "the absence of prior warning to the appellant that a threat of death to a supervisor would not be tolerated renders his misconduct no less blameworthy where it so clearly represents grounds for removal." In an appeal involving an employee's wasting of time and failure to follow instructions, coupled with a past record for similar offenses, the Board found that progressive discipline did not correct the problem. There being nothing in the record to suggest that a lesser penalty would meet with success, removal was sustained. <span class="Italic">Pitts v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 7 MSPR 208, 209, 7 MSPB 118 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Yet progression in discipline is occasionally required or examined. An employee with a good record and several years of service was involved in substantial misconduct not involving personal gain--improper taping of telephone calls. Lacking evidence of progressive discipline, the Board mitigated the removal to a 14-day suspension. <span class="Italic">Crumbaker v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 7 MSPR 84, 89, 7 MSPB 15 (1981). [Refer to dissimilar offenses later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-14-105.html#sec7-103">Proof, Rebuttal of Past Discipline</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If progression is applied, the question may arise as to what constitutes a prior penalty. In <span class="Italic">Morrisette v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 18 MSPR 503, 504 (1983), the Board determined that the agency could properly consider prior counseling as a basis for the imposition of an enhanced penalty, even though the counseling was not documented and was not subject to review by higher authority. An agency's use of warnings and counseling rather than formal disciplinary action did not preclude the agency from removing an employee if it becomes clear that his performance will not improve. <span class="Italic">Roberson v. VA</span>, 27 MSPR 489, 493 (1985). Earlier warnings and reprimands support a conclusion that additional reprimands or a suspension will be insufficient to deter the employee from repeating his misconduct. <span class="Italic">Henry v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 902 F.2d 949 (Fed. Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Stanek v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 805 F.2d 1572, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ("There is substantial evidence on record that the charges were very serious, that Stanek ignored various warnings and reprimands by his supervisors regarding his unauthorized activities and, therefore, that an additional reprimand or suspension would be insufficient to deter Stanek from repeating his conduct."). Prior warnings or other discipline may show a pattern of conduct, e.g., insubordination or disrespectful conduct, that will outweigh long service. <span class="Italic">Richard v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 43 MSPR 303, 308-09 (1990). The Board may take a liberal view of what constitutes a warning. <span class="Italic">Davis v. USPS</span>, 54 MSPR 374, 378 (1992), concerning an AWOL charge, said of the effect of a prior settlement agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[E]ven if the agency had not warned the appellant that attendance problems specifically could result in disciplinary action, it had informed him in a previous settlement agreement that his failure to satisfactorily meet <span class="Italic">all</span> requirements of his position would be cause for appropriate disciplinary action. An essential element of employment is to be on the job when one is expected to be there.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Howarth v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 1, 5-7 (1997) (agency could consider a long-term suspension resulting from a last chance agreement as the basis for an enhanced penalty; the agency should not have considered as basis for penalty the breach of a last chance agreement not mentioned in proposal; the error was harmless given the severity of sustained misconduct). For there to be progressive discipline, the penalty must be imposed prior to the current offense; otherwise no warning has been provided to the employee. <span class="Italic">See Fowler v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 8, 14 (1997) (a suspension was not prior discipline when the "prior" penalty was imposed after the conduct giving rise to the removal appeal).
