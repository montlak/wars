<h3 class="h3" id="sec12-49"><span class="space">E.</span> REPRISAL</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">When reprisal for filing an EEO complaint is alleged in the course of a Board appeal, the appellant is entitled to a specific finding under the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 USC 2000e-16(c), as well as a finding under the prohibited personnel practice provisions of the Reform Act, 5 USC 2302(b)(9). <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 906 F.2d 689 (Fed. Cir. 1990). If an individual alleges that an adverse action was in reprisal for filing a discrimination complaint, the case involves allegations of both discrimination and a prohibited personnel practice. The AJ must analyze the case and determine if retaliation was a significant factor in the challenged personnel action. <span class="Italic">Prince v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 2 MSPR 596, 598, 3 MSPB 113 (1980) (citing <span class="Italic">In re Frazier</span>, 1 MSPR 163, 186, 1 MSPB 159 (1979)); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Gannon v. USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 41, 46 (1994) (reprisal claim should be analyzed even if the appellant subsequently withdrew the EEO complaints). The Board suggested, but did not definitively hold, that if discrimination or retaliation is established, the burden is on the agency to prove that the individual would have been removed even without the agency's unlawful conduct. <span class="Italic">Acting Special Counsel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 4 MSPR 17, 19, 4 MSPB 111 (1980). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "Burden of Proof"; as to elements of harmful error and procedural due process; refer later in this chapter to "Reprisal Under the ADA," and refer to Chapter 11, "<a href="0100-2023-18-092.html#sec11-93">Agency Decisional Procedures; <span class="Italic">Ex Parte</span> Communications</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The burden is probably stronger than suggested in <span class="Italic">Prince</span>, supra, as a result of the test in <span class="Italic">Gerlach v. FTC</span>, 9 MSPR 268, 274 (1981) (creating a "but for" test met by evidence that protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor) [discussed as to prohibited personnel practices in <a href="0100-2023-20-001.html#sec13-1">Chapter 13</a>].<span class="Italic">Thornhill v. Dept. of Army</span>, 50 MSPR 480, 490 (1991), confirmed that "once an employee who is claiming reprisal establishes that his protected activity constituted a substantial or motivating factor in an adverse action...the burden shifts to the agency to prove that it would have taken the same action even if the protected conduct had not taken place." In <span class="Italic">Thornhill</span>, the Board considered protected the appellant's disclosures in an investigation of issues of prohibited discrimination, but the Board also determined there was reason sufficient for the agency to dismiss the employee after he refused to report to a duty station. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Army</span>, 75 MSPR 115, 123-24 (1997) ("The appellant's burden of proof in a retaliation case is greater than his burden of proof in a <span id="Page_3391"></span>mixed-motive discrimination case, as to prove retaliation he must establish, after careful balancing of the intensity of the motive to retaliate against the gravity of the misconduct, a nexus between the motive and the subsequent action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Adair</span>, 66 MSPR at 165, <span class="Italic">Richard</span>, 66 MSPR at 154; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Tanca</span>, 98 F.3d at 682-84 (the mixed-motives provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 do not apply to retaliation claims)."); <span class="Italic">Trammell v. VA</span>, 60 MSPR 79, 89 (1993) (no nexus between an adverse action and a retaliation allegation; appellant was unable to perform her duties and could not be reasonably accommodated, meaning the agency would have removed her even if she had not filed an EEO complaint); <span class="Italic">Peterson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 54 MSPR 178, 183-84 (1992) (to establish reprisal, an appellant must demonstrate that the accused official knew of a protected disclosure and that the accused official must have been involved in the alleged acts of prohibited discrimination (citing <span class="Italic">Haine v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 41 MSPR 462, 472 (1989))); <span class="Italic">Zara v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 24 MSPR 693, 699 (1984) ("In <span class="Italic">Gerlach v. Federal Trade Commission,</span> 8 MSPB 599 (1981), this Board established a "but for" test for analyzing appeals involving allegations of reprisal by the agency and improper conduct by the employee. The appellant has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the protected conduct was a "substantial" or "motivating" factor. If the employee meets his or her burden, the burden shifts to the agency to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have taken the same action even if the protected conduct had not taken place."). An inference of reprisal is dispelled if the evidence demonstrates that management acted upon what it considered to be binding legal decisions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">New v. VA</span>, 82 MSPR 609, 618 &#x00B6; 17 (1999). The employee may then attempt to meet the agency's rebuttal evidence by showing it is pretextual. Evidence of pretext may include facts concerning the employer's treatment of the employee and the employer's general policy regarding minority employment. <span class="Italic">Washington v. USDA</span>, 10 MSPR 465, 472 (1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pridgen v. OMB</span>, 2022 MSPB 31, &#x00B6; 30 (2022), offered an explanation, somewhat indirect, of what it takes to provide reprisal in an EEO case:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Title VII prohibits an employer from both (i) discriminating against an employee on the basis of sex, and (ii) retaliating against an employee for complaining about prior discrimination or retaliation. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e-2(a)(1), 2000e-3(a). Plaintiffs may prove these violations either through direct and indirect evidence of retaliatory animus, or through the burden-shifting framework of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

We have also referred to these two "avenues of proof" as the "mixed-motive" framework and the "pretext" framework, respectively. <span class="Italic">Hill v. Lockheed Martin Logistics Mgmt., Inc</span>., 354 F.3d 277, 284-85 (4th Cir. 2004) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Historically, we have considered Title VII retaliation claims under the same standard as discrimination claims. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Price</span>, 380 F.3d at 212 (analyzing a retaliation claim under the pretext framework); <span class="Italic">Kubicko v. Ogden Logistics Servs</span>., 181 F.3d 544, 546 (4th Cir. 1999) (analyzing a retaliation claim under the mixed-motive framework). In light of the Supreme Court's recent decision in <span class="Italic">Nassar</span>, however, that no longer holds true. Previously, a retaliation plaintiff only needed to show that his or her "employer was motivated to take the adverse employment action by both permissible and forbidden reasons." <span class="Italic">Hill</span>, 354 F.3d at 284 (citing 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(m)). So long as retaliatory animus was a motivating factor of the adverse employment action, the employee could recover--even if the employer would have taken the same adverse employment action in the absence of such <span class="Italic">animus</span>. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Nassar</span>, however, the Supreme Court held that the lessened causation standard of &#x00A7; 2000e-2(m) does not apply to retaliation claims. 133 S. Ct. at 2533. Unlike discrimination plaintiffs, retaliation plaintiffs are limited to "traditional principles of but-for causation" and must be able to prove that "the unlawful retaliation would not have occurred in the absence of the alleged wrongful action or actions of the employer." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Clearly, <span class="Italic">Nassar</span> significantly altered the causation standard for claims based on direct evidence of retaliatory animus by rejecting the "mixed motive" theory of liability for retaliation claims.[6] <span class="Italic">Cf. Harris v. Powhatan Cnty. Sch. Bd</span>., 543 Fed. Appx. 343, 346 (4th Cir. 2013) (noting that the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Gross v. FBL Fin. Serv. Inc</span>., 557 U.S. 167, 129 S. Ct. 2343, 174 L. Ed.2d 119 (2009), an analogous case upon which the <span class="Italic">Nassar</span> court relied heavily, eliminated mixed-motive liability under the ADEA). However, Foster does not claim to proceed by direct evidence. Rather, she proceeds under the pretext framework, which <span class="Italic">Nassar</span> does not purport to address. We must therefore decide what effect, if any, <span class="Italic">Nassar</span> has on a retaliation plaintiff's burden under the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;"Retaliation plaintiffs may still proceed by direct and indirect evidence, but in our experience it is the rare case in which an employer admits not just to possessing an impermissible motive, but also to acting upon it."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pridgen</span> continued with the explanation of the "but for" test, 2022 MSPB 31, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 44-47 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Separate from its prohibition on disparate treatment disability discrimination, the ADA has an anti-retaliation provision, which prohibits discriminating against any individual "because such individual" has engaged in protected activity. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12203(a); <span class="Italic">Southerland</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 566, &#x00B6; 21. Both requesting a reasonable accommodation and opposing disability discrimination are activities protected by the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">Southerland</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 566, &#x00B6; 21.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar</span>, 570 U.S. 338, 351-53 (2013), the U.S. Supreme Court interpreted similar language from Title VII's anti-retaliation provision applicable to private sector claims. The Court determined that the requirement to prove the employer's actions occurred "because" of the employee's protected activity imposed a "but-for" causation standard. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (interpreting 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-3(a)). The Court rejected using a mixed-motive analysis, explaining that "but-for" causation "requires proof that the unlawful retaliation would not have occurred in the absence of the alleged wrongful action or actions of the employer."[13] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 360-62.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Nassar</span>, the U.S. Supreme Court distinguished between the anti-retaliation provisions of Title VII, which it determined required "but-for" causation, and the disparate treatment discrimination provisions of Title VII, for which it found motivating factor causation to be appropriate. 570 U.S. at 343, 360. We follow the Court's findings on these issues.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">We find <span class="Italic">Nassar</span> provides useful guidance in interpreting the provision at issue here. The language in the ADA's anti-retaliation provision is virtually identical to the language analyzed by the Court in <span class="Italic">Nassar</span>, including the prohibition on discrimination "because" of protected activity. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12203(a); <span class="Italic">see Nassar</span>, 570 U.S. at 353-54, 357 (observing that Congress's decision to enact an anti-retaliation subsection in Title VII separate from the subsection prohibiting disparate treatment discrimination required that courts apply the standard of causation for retaliation claims stated in the anti-retaliation provision, and observing that the ADA has a similar structure). Thus, like Federal circuit courts which have considered this issue, we find that the "but-for" standard is applicable to ADA retaliation claims. <span class="Italic">See T.B. ex rel. Brenneise v. San Diego Unified School District</span>, 806 F.3d 451, 473 (9th Cir. 2015) (finding, in light of <span class="Italic">Nassar</span>, that the "but-for" causation standard applies to ADA retaliation claims); <span class="Italic">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Ford Motor Company</span>, 782 F.3d 753, 767 (6th Cir. 2015) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">Nassar</span> for the requirement that a plaintiff claiming under the ADA retaliation for filing a disability discrimination claim must prove that her protected activity was the "but-for" cause of the adverse employment action); <span class="Italic">Feist v. State of Louisiana, Department of Justice, Office of the Attorney General</span>, 730 F.3d 450, 454 (5th Cir. 2013) (explaining that to avoid summary judgment in a retaliation case under the ADA, a plaintiff must raise a factual conflict regarding whether retaliation was the "but-for" cause of the employer's action); <span class="Italic">Palmquist v. Shinseki</span>, 689 F.3d 66, 68, 72-77 (1st Cir. 2012) (concluding that a claim of retaliation for activity protected under the Rehabilitation Act requires proof of "but-for" causation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Therefore, we overrule the Board's finding in <span class="Italic">Southerland</span>, which was issued days before the U.S. Supreme Court issued <span class="Italic">Nassar</span>, that a lesser standard is appropriate for Rehabilitation Act retaliation claims. <span class="Italic">Southerland</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 566, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-22 (finding that a mixed-motive analysis applies to claims of disparate treatment discrimination under the ADA by relying on an EEOC case applying the mixed-motive standard to an ADA retaliation claim). We also overrule the finding that an agency can avoid liability by proving by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action absent an improper motive, <span class="Italic">id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23-25, as such a construct would be applicable only for a motivating factor analysis. If prior EEO activity is a "but-for" cause of retaliation, by definition, there is no other proper reason for that action. In making its findings in <span class="Italic">Southerland</span>, the Board relied on the EEOC's interpretation of substantive discrimination law. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-21, 24-25. However, in light of <span class="Italic">Nassar,</span> we find that the Supreme Court has effectively overruled the EEOC's interpretation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Conde v. DHS</span>, DC-0752-15-1059-I-1 (NP 11/10/2022), summarized <span class="Italic">Pridgen</span>:</p>

But for the appellant to obtain full <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief on her claim, including reinstatement, back pay, and damages, her protected activity must be a but-for cause of the action or decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board has overlooked an AJ's failure to apply <span class="Italic">Pridgen</span> when there was a conclusion in a reprisal case that EEO activity was not a motivating factor in a removal. <span class="Italic">Shaw v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the agency removed her based on race and sex discrimination and in retaliation for her protected EEO activity, including the April 2009 complaint in which she named D.B. as the discriminating official. During the pendency of this appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in <span class="Italic">University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar</span>, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 2534 (2013), in which it held that a plaintiff claiming prohibited retaliation under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-3(a) must show that the contested personnel action would not have occurred but for the retaliatory motive. The administrative judge did not address <span class="Italic">Nassar</span> in the initial decision, and the Board has not yet issued a precedential decision addressing the possible effect of <span class="Italic">Nassar</span> on our proceedings. Accordingly, we take this opportunity to clarify the standards and procedures governing our adjudication of Title VII claims, including (but not limited to) retaliation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16 prohibits retaliation as well as status-based discrimination.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, Pub. L. No. 92-261, 86 Stat. 111 (1972), extended Title VII to cover Federal employment, adding a new section 717, codified at 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16. The basic anti-discrimination standard for Federal employment is set forth at subsection (a), which broadly provides that personnel actions taken by Federal agencies "shall be made free from any discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a); <span class="Italic">see West v. Gibson</span>, 527 U.S. 212, 214 (1999). The courts, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commission), and the Board have long assumed that section 2000e-16(a) incorporated the existing provision at 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-3(a), which prohibits private sector employers from retaliating against employees or applicants "because" of the exercise of Title VII rights. <span class="Italic">See Hale v. Marsh</span>, 808 F.2d 616, 619 (7th Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Ayon v. Sampson</span>, 547 F.2d 446, 449-50 (9th Cir. 1976); <span class="Italic">Martin v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 590, 594 (1997); <span class="Italic">Algarin v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. B01780106, 1980 WL 351765, at *1 (Mar. 4, 1980). However, the Supreme Court has clarified that 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16 does not in fact incorporate 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-3(a). <span class="Italic">Gomez-Perez v. Potter</span>, 553 U.S. 474, 487-88, 488 n.4 (2008). The Federal sector provision instead "contains a broad prohibition of 'discrimination,' rather than a list of specific prohibited personnel practices." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 487. Hence, EEO retaliation claims in the Federal sector do not implicate the statute at issue in <span class="Italic">Nassar</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court did not have occasion in <span class="Italic">Gomez-Perez</span> to definitively state whether 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16 itself prohibits retaliation in addition to status-based discrimination. However, the Court did consider that question regarding the parallel Federal sector provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), found at 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a). That statute, which the Court found to have been patterned directly after 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a), similarly provides that personnel actions by Federal agencies "shall be made free from any discrimination based on age." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a); <span class="Italic">see Gomez-Perez</span>, 553 U.S. at 487-88. The Court held that the requirement that such actions "be made free" from age discrimination is itself sufficiently broad to prohibit retaliation against an employee who complained of age discrimination. <span class="Italic">Gomez-Perez</span>, 553 U.S. at 491. We conclude the same is true of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">A violation of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16 is established where discrimination or retaliation is a motivating factor in the contested personnel action.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The next question to be considered is whether an appellant alleging a violation of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16 must show that improper consideration was the "but for" cause of the contested personnel action, as would be the case in a private sector retaliation claim under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-3(a), or whether a less stringent causation standard should apply. This question is of particular importance given that most adverse actions against Federal employees are at least ostensibly taken for cause. Not infrequently, this leads to a dual motivation scenario in which the contested action may appear to have been taken for both prohibited reasons and legitimate reasons, such as sustained misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Again, we may draw a useful analogy to the ADEA. In <span class="Italic">Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc</span>., 557 U.S. 167 (2009), the Court considered whether a "but for" causation requirement should apply to claims of age discrimination arising under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 623(a)(1), which prohibits discrimination "because of age" in private sector employment. Examining the text of 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 623(a)(1), the Court reasoned that "the ordinary meaning...of 'because of' age is that age was the 'reason' that the employer decided to act." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 176. Accordingly, the Court held, the prohibition against employment discrimination "because of age" should be read as requiring the plaintiff to demonstrate "but for" causation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, as noted above, Federal sector ADEA claims are governed by a different statute, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a), which does not include the term "because of," but instead broadly provides that personnel actions "shall be made free from any discrimination based on age." In <span class="Italic">Ford v. Mabus</span>, 629 F.3d 198 (D.C. Cir. 2010), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit distinguished <span class="Italic">Gross</span> on those grounds and concluded that a Federal sector employee could prove a violation of 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a) merely by showing that age was a factor in the contested personnel action, even if it were not the "but for" cause. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 205-06. The court further found that, given the statute's sweeping language, it was unnecessary to look for "a particular quantum of influence," such as "substantial" evidence, but rather for "the existence of any influence at all." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 206. This is so, the court reasoned, because "any amount of discrimination tainting a personnel action, even if not substantial, means that the action was not 'free from any discrimination based on age.' 'Any,' after all, means any." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">United States v. Gonzales</span>, 520 U.S. 1, 5 (1997)). Shortly thereafter, in <span class="Italic">Alotta v. Department of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0129903865, 2011 WL 2515244 (June 17, 2011), the EEOC reached the same conclusion on similar grounds, <span class="Italic">albeit in dicta</span>.[7] In <span class="Italic">Wingate v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 118 M.S.P.R. 566 (2012), we endorsed the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Alotta</span>, again concluding that a Federal employee may prove age discrimination by showing that age was "a factor" in the personnel action, even if it was not the "but for" cause. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Despite its finding, the EEOC did not undertake a mixed-motive analysis in <span class="Italic">Alotta</span>, but instead applied the framework of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), which does require an ultimate showing of "but for" causation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The requirement of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16 that personnel actions by agencies "be made free from any discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin" is analogous to the ADEA provision at issue in <span class="Italic">Ford</span>, <span class="Italic">Alotta</span>, and <span class="Italic">Wingate</span>. We therefore conclude that, to establish a violation of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16, an appellant need only demonstrate that a prohibited consideration was a factor in the contested personnel action. Moreover, because a prohibition against retaliation is inherent in the same statute, the same causation standard also applies to Title VII retaliation claims in the Federal sector. Hence, as with status-based discrimination cases, a violation of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16 is established if a prohibited consideration was a motivating factor in the contested personnel action, even if it was not the only reason. <span class="Italic">Accord Petitioner v.

One kind is direct evidence, i.e., "evidence that can be interpreted as an acknowledgment of discriminatory intent[.] " <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In addition to direct evidence, the court identified and distinguished three types of circumstantial evidence. The first kind "consists of suspicious timing, ambiguous statements oral or written, behavior toward or comments directed at other employees in the protected group, and other bits and pieces from which an inference of discriminatory intent might be drawn." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Considered together, the court explained, such bits and pieces may compose "a convincing mosaic of discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 737. The second kind of circumstantial evidence is comparator evidence, consisting of "evidence, whether or not rigorously <span id="Page_3393"></span>statistical, that employees similarly situated to the plaintiff other than in the characteristic...on which an employer is forbidden to base a difference in treatment received systematically better treatment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 736. The third kind consists of evidence that the agency's stated reason for its action is "unworthy of belief, a mere pretext for discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

<p class="Block-Quote1">While 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16 sets forth the substantive standard for Title VII claims in the Federal sector, it does not itself authorize the Board to enforce that standard. Subsection (b) of the statute grants the EEOC the authority to enforce the standard through appropriate remedies, including reinstatement and back pay. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(b). In addition, the statute contains provisions concerning the courts' enforcement authority. Subsection (c) provides that, after an agency or the EEOC takes final action on a complaint, or fails to take action within a certain time, the aggrieved employee may bring a "civil action," with the department head named as the defendant. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(c). Section (d) further provides that such civil actions shall be governed by the provisions of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(f) through (k), "as applicable." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(d). Those incorporated provisions in turn assign jurisdiction to an appropriate district court, <span class="Italic">see</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(f)(3), and provide that the court may, subject to certain restrictions, award remedies including injunctive relief, reinstatement, back pay, and attorney fees, <span class="Italic">see</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g), (k).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By contrast, there is no comparable provision in the statute--or, for that matter, anywhere else in Title VII--granting enforcement authority to the Board.[9] The Board's authority to adjudicate and remedy alleged violations of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16 is instead a matter of civil service law. One source of that authority is 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(B), which provides that in any case where an appellant affected by an action appealable to the Board alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited by 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16, the Board shall "decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action[.] " The statute further specifies that the issues are to be decided "<span class="Italic">in accordance with the Board's appellate procedures</span> under [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701 and 7702]." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added). Hence, while the substantive "issue of discrimination" is defined by the standard set forth by 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a), it is civil service law that defines the procedures by which we decide whether a violation of that statute has taken place.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;Indeed, it was the intent of Congress in passing the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 to transfer to the EEOC the enforcement authority formerly vested in the Board's predecessor agency, the Civil Service Commission. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R.

Green,</span> 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973). However, because the Board has no authority to grant summary judgment, and decides discrimination claims only after the record is complete, the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework has no application to our proceedings in this or any other appeal. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As for remedies, our authority to award reinstatement and back pay derives from 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(B), which provides that the Board will not sustain an agency's decision if the appellant "shows that the decision was based on any prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b) of this title." Section 2302(b)(1) in turn provides, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that an agency employee with "authority to take, direct others to take, recommend,[11] or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to such authority...discriminate for or against any employee or applicant for employment...on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, as prohibited under [42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16]." Accordingly, if an appellant proves that the action on appeal was "based" on a violation of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16, which constitutes a prohibited personnel action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1), the Board will order the agency to cancel the action and return the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a) (granting the Board the authority to adjudicate and take final action on matters within its jurisdiction and to order compliance with its actions).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;Because a proposing official is an agency employee with authority to "recommend" a personnel action, we agree with the appellant that the administrative judge erred in failing to consider whether D.B. had a retaliatory motive.</p>

Accordingly, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(B) mandates reversal of the agency's action only where the Board has determined that a prohibited personnel practice was <span class="Italic">the</span> "motivating factor" or "real reason" for the action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 274. Hence, while the Board will find a violation of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16, and consequently a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1), if the appellant shows that a discriminatory or retaliatory motive was a factor in the contested action, such a finding will not necessarily result in reversal. Rather, the Board will reverse the action on that basis if the prohibited personnel practice was the "but for" cause of the action, i.e., if the agency would not have taken the same action in the absence of the discriminatory or retaliatory motive. <span class="Italic">See Dorsey v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">For cases involving allegations of discrimination and retaliation not covered by the WPA, the Board has adopted the analytical framework of <span class="Italic">Mt.

In <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span>, a case involving a claim of retaliation for protected First Amendment activity, the Court enunciated a two-part test to be applied in determining whether remedial action was justified. 429 U.S. at 287. First, the Court explained, the employee must show that the protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the contested action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> If the employee carries that burden, then the burden shifts to the employer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have taken the same action even if the protected conduct had not taken place. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> test assures that an employee who belongs to a protected group or has engaged in protected activity is not thereby granted immunity from the ordinary consequences of misconduct or poor performance. <span class="Italic">Mt.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[13]&#x2003;The application of the <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> test to discrimination and retaliation claims under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16 is in some respects <span id="Page_3394"></span>analogous to the burden-shifting scheme for status-based Title VII discrimination claims in the private sector. Under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(m), "an unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor in any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice." Upon that showing, the burden then shifts to the employer to demonstrate that it "would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor," in which case the plaintiff will not receive damages or a reinstatement order, but may nonetheless receive a limited remedy including declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and some attorney fees. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). However, the scheme set forth at 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e-2(m) and 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) does not apply to our adjudication of claims under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16. First, because 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16 broadly prohibits discrimination without incorporating specific prohibited practices, such as the ban on retaliation at 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-3(a), <span class="Italic">see Gomez-Perez</span>, 553 U.S. at 487, it does not (and need not) incorporate 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(a) and (m). Moreover, as discussed above, the enforcement provisions incorporated by 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16, including 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B), do not control our proceedings, which are instead governed by the appellate procedures set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701 and 7702.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, when an appellant asserts an affirmative defense of discrimination or retaliation under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16, the Board first will inquire whether the appellant has shown by preponderant evidence that the prohibited consideration was a motivating factor in the contested personnel action. Such a showing is sufficient to establish that the agency violated 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16, thereby committing a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1). In making her initial showing, an appellant may rely on direct evidence or any of the three types of circumstantial evidence described in <span class="Italic">Troupe</span>, either alone or in combination. If the appellant meets her burden, we then will inquire whether the agency has shown by preponderant evidence that the action was not based on the prohibited personnel practice, i.e., that it still would have taken the contested action in the absence of the discriminatory or retaliatory motive. If we find that the agency has made that showing, its violation of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16 will not require reversal of the action. On remand, the administrative judge should consider the appellant's Title VII claims consistent with the above analysis.</p>

To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, an employee must show that: (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) the unfavorable action gives rise to an inference of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Wiley v. Glassman</span>, 511 F.3d 151, 155 (D.C. Cir. 2007). To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of retaliation, a claimant must show that: (1) she engaged in a statutorily protected activity; (2) she suffered a materially adverse action by her employer; and (3) a causal connection existed between the two. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In either case, the burden is not onerous. <span class="Italic">Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 253 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we do not sustain the second charge, the agency has nonetheless articulated a facially nondiscriminatory reason for its action. Accordingly, the inquiry proceeds directly to the ultimate question of whether, upon weighing all the evidence, the appellant has met her burden of proving that the agency intentionally discriminated against her based on disability or retaliated against her based on EEO activity. <span class="Italic">See Doe v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6; 46 (2012); <span class="Italic">Marshall v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 5, &#x00B6; 16 (2008). The evidence to be considered at this stage may include: (1) the elements of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case; (2) any evidence the employee presents to attack the employer's proffered explanations for its actions; and (3) any further evidence of discrimination or retaliation that may be available to the employee, such as independent evidence of discriminatory statements or attitudes on the part of the employer, or any contrary evidence that may be available to the employer, such as a strong track record in equal opportunity employment. <span class="Italic">Aka v. Washington Hospital Center</span>, 156 F.3d 1284, 1289 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). While such evidence may include proof that the employer treated similarly-situated employees differently, an employee may also prevail by introducing evidence (1) that the employer lied about its reason for taking the action; (2) of inconsistency in the employer's explanation; (3) of failure to follow established procedures; (4) of general treatment of disabled employees or those who engage in protected activities; or (5) of incriminating statements by the employer. <span class="Italic">See Brady v. Office of the Sergeant at Arms, U.S. House of Representatives</span>, 520 F.3d 490, 495 (D.C. Cir. 2008). In determining whether the agency's proffered reason for its action is pretextual, the focus of the inquiry is not "the correctness or desirability of [the] reasons offered...[but] rather whether the employer honestly believes in the reasons it offers." <span class="Italic">McCoy v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the appellant's retaliation claim, it is undisputed that the appellant filed multiple EEO complaints, as early as 2007 and as recently as March 2011, in which she named Pike as the alleged discriminating official. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In her March 2011 EEO complaint, she also named Wagner as an alleged discriminating official. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In her declaration, Wagner asserted without dispute that she first became aware of the EEO complaint regarding herself in March 2011. Thus, Wagner did not learn of that EEO activity until after her November 9, 2010 decision to deny the appellant's full-time teleworking agreement. Wagner further averred under penalty of perjury that the appellant's EEO activity was not a consideration in her decision to propose the appellant's removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In his declaration, Pike acknowledged that he became aware of the appellant's EEO activity "long before" Wagner instructed her to physically report to the office. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 100.

<p class="Block-Quote1">To prove retaliation for filing an EEO complaint, the appellant must show the following: (1) She engaged in protected activity; (2) the accused official knew of the protected activity; (3) the adverse employment action under review could, under the circumstances, have been retaliation; and (4) there was a genuine nexus between the alleged retaliation and the adverse employment action. <span class="Italic">E.g., Cirella</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 474, &#x00B6; 22.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges that he was hired as a disabled veteran; the proposing official knew of his disability; when he asked for accommodation, he was told "no"; a few weeks later, "this story was fabricated" to terminate his employment; and an EEO complaint is still pending on this issue. The appellant has submitted no evidence in support of his claim. However, even assuming that he engaged in protected EEO activity of which the proposing official was aware, and that retaliation could have been the motive for the removal action, the appellant has failed to establish the last prong of the test. To establish a genuine nexus between the protected activity and the adverse employment action, the appellant must prove that the action was taken because of the protected activity. <span class="Italic">Murry v. General Services Administration,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 560, &#x00B6; 6 (2003).

Department of the Army,</span> 804 F.2d 654, 658 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Here, the arbitrator found that the agency proved all six charges which were most serious in nature, ranging from lack of accountability to poor judgment to knowing and/or intentional wrongdoing. They all diminished the appellant's ability to exercise judgment and make decisions affecting the health and safety of those he served. Beyond his bare assertion, the appellant has not established that either the proposing official or the deciding official had any motive to retaliate against him due to his prior EEO complaint. Under <span id="Page_3397"></span>these circumstances, we find that the appellant has not established a genuine nexus between the alleged retaliation and his removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Crawford-Graham v. VA</span>, 99 MSPR 389, 398-99 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 25-26 (2005), considered elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> reprisal claim raised during a challenge to an arbitrator's award:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the record shows that the appellant had filed prior EEO complaints with the agency in 1996 and 1999, and, therefore, the first prong of the test is satisfied. However, the record does not show that either the proposing official or the deciding official was aware that she had filed prior EEO complaints. Even assuming that the evidence illustrated an awareness of prior EEO activity and that retaliation could have been the motive for the removal action,<span class="Italic"> see</span> <span class="Italic">Warren,</span> 804 F.2d at 658 (if agency officials have knowledge of or involvement in prior protected activity, and are also involved in the process of removing the employee, then an inference is raised of a retaliatory motive sufficient to meet the third prong of the test), the appellant has failed to establish the last prong of the test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a genuine nexus between the protected activity and the adverse employment action, the appellant must prove that the employment action was taken because of the protected activity. <span class="Italic">Murry v.

Here, the frequency and duration of the telephone calls indicate a significant loss of productive man-hours and, in terms of the cost of each call, a considerable financial loss to the agency. According to the appellant, the retaliatory motive was based on the appellant's prior EEO activity. However, she does not establish that either the proposing or deciding officials had any motive to retaliate against her due to her prior EEO complaints. Therefore, the Board finds that the appellant failed to establish a genuine nexus between the retaliation and her removal.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dixon v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 109 MSPR 314, 322 n.3, 2008 MSPB 153 (2008) (reiterating the reprisal analysis in arbitration cases).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of direct evidence establishing a claim under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1), as is the case here, the Board typically uses the "pretext standard" of analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

<p class="Body-Text">Concerning causal connection, <span class="Italic">McGuire v. DOJ</span>, 48 MSPR 659, 665 (1991), explained:</p>

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Wynne v. Dept. of Army</span>, 46 MSPR 320, 325-26 (1990), the appellant was discharged for striking a supervisor. She claimed that the dismissal was a result of racism and reprisal for her filing of grievances:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In order to establish an allegation of reprisal, an appellant must show that: (1) A protected disclosure was made; (2) the accused official had knowledge of the disclosure; (3) the adverse action under review could, under the circumstances, have been retaliation; and (4) after careful balancing of the intensity of the motive to retaliate against the gravity of the misconduct, a nexus is established between the adverse action and the motive....&#8197;Although the appellant has presented evidence that she engaged in a protected activity, i.e., filing grievances; that an adverse action followed; and that the deciding and proposing officials were aware of the activities, we find that she has not shown that there was genuine nexus between the alleged retaliation and the adverse action--her removal for striking her supervisor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The gravity of the misconduct outweighs any retaliatory motive. Under the agency's guidelines, the proven misconduct that resulted in injury to the supervisor warrants removal. The deciding official testified that the agency has a mandate or mission to maintain an atmosphere of order, and that he believed this atmosphere was being lost in the appellant's work situation. Moreover, the deciding official had attempted to resolve the differences between the appellant and her immediate supervisor, apparently without success. Based on the circumstances presented, we find that the appellant has not established nexus....&#8197;We therefore conclude that the appellant failed to substantiate her allegation of reprisal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another decision allowing proof of misconduct to negate proof of reprisal is <span class="Italic">Allen v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 58 MSPR 568, 571-72 (1993):</p>

Also, the officials at the agency were generally aware of her complaint and that it had proceeded to litigation. Under the circumstances, the adverse action could have been retaliation because of its timing. In the context of the administrative judge's uncontested finding that the appellant intentionally falsified a census report, the Board finds, however, that the appellant did not show a genuine nexus between the alleged retaliation and the adverse action.</p>

He issued a letter of reprimand to the appellant on September 24, 1990; he acted as the deciding official in the 14-day suspension; he signed her performance standards as her second-level supervisor; and he ordered her detailed to another office. All of these actions were the subjects of EEO complaints. Under the circumstances, therefore, the removal action could have been reprisal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, we find that the appellant did not show that the motive to retaliate outweighed the gravity of the misconduct involved. The agency charged the appellant with disrespectful conduct toward her supervisor after she called him an "ex-alcoholic" and told him that she did not argue with "idiots" in the midst of a dispute about a task that he had assigned, and the appellant admitted making the statements. Without question, such abusive language and disrespectful conduct are not conducive to a stable working atmosphere, and thus constitute just cause for removal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Boykin v. United States Postal Service</span>, 51 MSPR 56, 60 (1991). This is particularly so when there is a history of such abusive and disrespectful conduct, as here--the earlier suspension was based on the appellant's stating to the same supervisor in a loud voice, "You do not know what the fuck you are talking about."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Colon v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 190 (1993) (mitigating removal to a long suspension of an employee who asserted post-traumatic stress disorder and who struck a supervisor in response to the provocation of sexual harassment).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit applied a reprisal analysis that focused on management's reason for its action in an enforced leave case, <span class="Italic">Strozier v. USPS</span>, 189 Fed. Appx. 953, 957 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the Board determined that Mr. Strozier failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the Postal Service's actions, placing him on enforced leave and removing him, were taken in reprisal against him for filing discrimination complaints. It was undisputed that Mr. Strozier satisfied three of the four requirements to demonstrate a reprisal claim in accordance with <span class="Italic">Warren v. Department of the Army</span>, 804 F.2d 654, 656-58 (Fed. Cir. 1986)--namely that by filing discrimination complaints, he engaged in a protected activity within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), that he was adversely affected by an agency personnel action that could, under the circumstances, have involved retaliation, and that the agency officials responsible for the adverse action, who proposed and decided the adverse actions, had either actual or constructive knowledge of his protected activity. However, the Board found that Mr. Strozier failed to satisfy the fourth requirement--showing a causal connection between his protected activity and his placement on enforced leave. The Board was correct that Mr. Strozier presented no evidence that his placement on enforced leave and subsequent removal constituted a reprisal for his discrimination complaints other than his unsubstantiated subjective opinion. The Board's finding that the adverse actions were taken because of legitimate business reasons is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Westmoreland v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 49 MSPR 574, 575-77 (1991), found a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> basis for termination of an employee who absented herself from the agency--to prepare for an EEO hearing--after notice of a random drug test:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from the GS-12 position of Aviation Safety Inspector based on charges of absence without leave (AWOL) and refusal to take a drug test. The administrative judge found that the agency proved the charges by the preponderance of the evidence. She found that, although shortly after noon on January 18, 1990, the appellant had signed out to go from her worksite in Orlando to Miami, the location of the ongoing trial in her discrimination case, she had not complied with the agency's leave requirements when she left, because she had not received permission to use annual leave from her immediate supervisor or any other appropriate authority. The administrative judge found further that because the appellant was not formally on leave, and left after she learned that she had been selected for a random drug test, her leaving the worksite also constituted refusal to take the drug test, which carried a mandatory penalty of removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also found that the agency's action was retaliation against the appellant under 5 USC 2302(b)(9). The administrative judge found that there was a genuine nexus between the alleged retaliation for the appellant's filing an Equal Employment Opportunity complaint and the adverse action because the agency charged the appellant with AWOL when she left the facility on January 18th without prior leave approval, but granted her leave for January 19th when the circumstances were really no different. Further, she found that the agency's action immediately upon learning that the appellant had not taken the drug test shows that it seized upon the opportunity to rid itself of an employee whom it considered to be troublesome. The administrative judge also found that the agency did not show that it would have taken the adverse action absent the retaliatory motive because, although the offenses were serious, under the circumstances, they did not warrant the severe penalty of removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, the agency contends that the administrative judge erred in finding that the agency retaliated against the appellant. The agency asserts that it correctly charged the appellant with AWOL on the 18th and granted leave on the 19th because on the 19th the appellant was in court, while on the 18th no trial activity was taking place. The agency also contends that the administrative judge did not properly weigh the evidence that the agency imposed the same penalty in all other instances of refusal to take a random drug test and went out of its way to assure that the appellant was treated fairly by assigning an impartial deciding official.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under <span class="Italic">Warren v. Department of the Army</span>, 804 F.2d 654, 656-58 (Fed. Cir. 1986), in order for an appellant to prevail on a contention of illegal retaliation, he has the burden of showing that: (1) He engaged in protected activity; (2) the accused official knew of the activity; (3) the adverse action under review could have been retaliation under the circumstances; and (4) there was a genuine nexus between the alleged retaliation and the adverse action. The appellant clearly established that she engaged in protected activity, filing a discrimination charge against the agency. Also, the officials at the agency were generally aware of her complaint and that it had proceeded to litigation. Under the circumstances, the adverse action could have been retaliation because of its timing. In the context of the administrative judge's uncontested finding that the appellant deliberately left the facility, without a grant of leave, to avoid complying with a proper requirement of her position, the Board finds, however, that the appellant did not show a genuine nexus between the alleged retaliation and the adverse action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the administrative judge's finding, the circumstances with respect to the appellant on January 18th and January 19th were not the same. On the 18th, the appellant reported for duty. In that status, she was responsible for complying with the agency's standards and requirements. The appellant was aware that she had not completed all of the acts necessary to effect an appropriate exit from the workplace on annual leave when she learned that she had been randomly chosen <span id="Page_3399"></span>for drug testing. Further, she was aware of the importance of the drug testing program and of the consequences of refusal to take the test. It was incumbent on her therefore as a reasonable person to assure that appropriate authority, who knew that she had reported for duty, also knew that she was leaving before the test could be administered to her. Indeed, the appellant's actions deprived the agency of an opportunity to temporarily withhold any grant of annual leave it may have, under other circumstances, given her on January 18th<span class="Italic">. See McPartland v. Department of Transportation</span>, 14 MSPR 506, 509 (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 795 F.2d 1017 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the Board is not persuaded that the agency's quick action upon learning that the appellant had not taken the drug test is probative of retaliatory motive. If an employee subject to testing was not available, information had to be furnished to explain the reasons for the absence. The agency reasonably would have acted quickly to ascertain why the appellant, who was present for work that day, did not take the test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, regardless of whether nexus exists, the agency established by the preponderance of the evidence that it would have taken the adverse action absent the appellant's protected activity<span class="Italic">. See Berube v. General Services Administration</span>, 820 F.2d 396, 399 (Fed. Cir. 1987). The agency meted out the same penalty to all employees who refused to take a drug test and who were not on preapproved leave. The mitigating circumstance of the appellant's need to get to Miami, to the extent that it arguably is a factor in an instance where the agency had a prescribed penalty, is outweighed by the fact that the exact moment of the appellant's departure was not urgent. As the appellant admitted, she could have waited the hour it would have taken for her to have completed the drug test and had ample time on annual leave to drive to Miami and meet with her attorney to make preparations for her following day's testimony. Finally, because of the involvement of the facility manager in the testing procedure, a different official was selected as the deciding official. The agency therefore assured that the decision on the appellant's adverse action would be rendered by an impartial deciding official.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even if misconduct is not proved, the taint of reprisal may be dispelled by serious analysis of the disciplinary charges and analysis of conflicting evidence by an unbiased agency official, <span class="Italic">Otterstedt v. USPS</span>, 96 MSPR 688, 696-98 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-27 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the appellant to establish a claim of retaliation for filing prior EEO complaints, she must show that: (1) She engaged in EEO activity; (2) the accused official knew of such activity; (3) the adverse action under review could, under the circumstances, have been retaliation; and (4) there was a genuine nexus between the alleged retaliation and the adverse employment action. <span class="Italic">See Warren v. Department of the Army</span>, 804 F.2d 654, 656-58 (Fed. Cir. 1986). In determining whether the appellant has established a nexus between the alleged retaliation and the adverse action, the Board must weigh the intensity of the motive to retaliate against the gravity of the misconduct. <span class="Italic">Jefferson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 607 &#x00B6; 5 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that the appellant met the first three requirements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of retaliation for prior EEO activities. The agency's only challenge with respect to the AJ's finding of retaliation pertains to the nexus requirement. Adopting the appellant's closing argument and relying on the testimony of the agency's deciding official, Manager of Post Office Operations Lito Sajonas, the AJ provided the following rationale for her conclusion that the appellant had proven by preponderant evidence her claim of retaliation for her prior EEO activities:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Sajonas' testimony that he did not consider that prior to working for Postmaster Nurisio[3] the appellant had worked for many years without any discipline because he believed that her prior postmasters were intimidated by her tendency to file EEO complaints constitutes direct evidence of reprisal discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]his statement reveals Sajonas' own bias which is not based on any evidence other than his own conjecture....&#8197;[H]is admitted belief in this regard is improperly retaliatory and an impermissible reaction to the appellant's prior use of the EEO process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">[3] Nurisio testified that he became Postmaster in November 2000.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ concluded further that, because the agency failed to prove both specifications underlying its charge, the demotion action was pretextual, and the appellant proved that the agency's motive to retaliate was the dominant reason for her demotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that the Board did not sustain the charges against the appellant does not, <span class="Italic">per se</span>, indicate that any motive to retaliate outweighed the gravity of the charged misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Jefferson</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 607 &#x00B6; 9 (citing <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Department of Justice</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 287, 298 (1995)). The proper prospective is the gravity of the misconduct as it appeared to the deciding official at the time he took the adverse action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sajonas considered the nature and seriousness of the appellant's charged misconduct. The first specification of the agency's charge involving the appellant's alleged failure to follow instructions asserted that the appellant had, on several occasions, used penalty envelopes and special service certified mail to send personal correspondence to Nurisio, despite repeated instructions not to do so. Before Sajonas was, among other things, evidence that the appellant failed on two occasions to follow Nurisio's express verbal order of August 23, 2001, "not to send [him] any more items via certified mail." Sajonas noted that, as a supervisor, the appellant was "charged with greater responsibility than a craft employee." He also found that the repeated nature of her misconduct demonstrated a "blatant disregard for authority[.] " He testified that a supervisor at the agency's Oakland Station had engaged in similar misconduct involving the use of penalty envelopes for personal mail, was issued a letter of warning like the appellant, and was returned to a clerk craft position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second specification underlying the agency's charge involved the appellant's alleged unprofessional conduct with respect to several comments she purportedly made to a postal customer about a mail carrier in response to the customer's complaints about that mail carrier. The specification also alleged that the appellant further informed the customer that, if she were not satisfied with Nurisio's assistance with the matter complained of, she should contact her Congressman. It is undisputed that the appellant told the customer that she had been the mail carrier's supervisor and had previously received several similar complaints about the carrier's "horrible attitude." Sajonas noted that the appellant's lack of professionalism served to "totally undermine the integrity and mission of the [agency]."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sajonas considered further the appellant's prior disciplinary record including three letters of warning, dated April 19, July 3, and October 18, 2001, for Unsatisfactory Work Performance/Failure to Follow Instructions. He testified that he considered the appellant's 23 years of Federal service and acknowledged that the appellant had not been disciplined prior to working with Nurisio. Sajonas opined that the appellant had not been disciplined before because other supervisors were "intimidated" by the appellant's tendency to file EEO complaints.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on our review of the record, we find that, although the agency did not prove its charge by preponderant evidence, the evidence of the seriousness of the appellant's alleged misconduct before Sajonas at the time he decided to demote the appellant was sufficient to outweigh a motive to retaliate against her. <span class="Italic">See Jefferson</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 607 &#x00B6; 9 (the appellant failed to show that the deciding official had any motive to retaliate against him for an EEO complaint charging his supervisor with discrimination);<span class="Italic"> Wilson</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 298 (although the agency's motive to retaliate against the appellant was intense, "the decision to charge the appellant with misconduct [was] a close call"). Thus, the AJ erred in concluding that the appellant proved by preponderant evidence her claim of retaliation for her prior EEO activities, and we reverse that portion of the ID.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Caros v. DHS</span>, PH-0752-12-0402-I-2 (NP 2/25/2014), considered the viewpoint of the deciding official:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The administrative judge found that the appellant submitted no evidence that the proposing official had a motive to retaliate against the appellant based on his protected EEO activity. Accordingly, the appellant has failed to show that the agency officials most closely involved in his removal had a strong motive to retaliate against him. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Redschlag v. Department of the Army</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 589, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 67-68 (2001) (finding that the appellant failed to show that the agency officials most closely involved in his removal had a strong motive to retaliate against him due to his grievances and EEO activity where the appellant failed to provide evidence of a retaliatory motive and where the agency officials were not disciplined as a result of the appellant's EEO complaints).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, while we have not sustained the agency's charges, the proper perspective when weighing the gravity of the misconduct against the motive to retaliate is to view the gravity of the misconduct as it appeared to the deciding official at the time he took the removal action. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6; 69. The appellant did not establish that, at the time he made his decision to remove the appellant, the deciding official had no reasonable basis for sustaining the charges and specifications cited in the notice of proposed removal. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Moreover, the deciding official's application of the factors under <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 308 (1981), makes clear that the sustained misconduct caused the agency to lose trust in the appellant's ability to safeguard the health and safety of others and maintain the public image and effectiveness of the agency. The deciding official further considered the fact that the appellant's position as a Customs and Border Patrol Officer required him to be held to a higher standard than other federal employees in nonlaw enforcement positions. For these reasons, we conclude that the appellant's misconduct appeared serious in the deciding official's view when he took the removal action. <span class="Italic">See Smith</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 59, &#x00B6; 64 (finding that the appellant's misconduct appeared serious to the deciding official where, among other things, the deciding official's application of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors made clear he had <span id="Page_3400"></span>lost trust in the appellant's abilities to perform the duties of his position). Viewed from this perspective, we find that the apparent gravity of the purported misconduct, which included failing to call 911 emergency services in a timely manner when an elderly passenger became ill and making false statements regarding this incident, was the reason for the actions of the agency officials involved in the appellant's removal, and not retaliation. <span class="Italic">See Redschlag</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 589, &#x00B6; 69; <span class="Italic">see also Wilson v. Department of Justice</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 287, 298 (1995) (although the agency's motive to retaliate against the appellant was intense, the Board found that this was outweighed by the seriousness of the misconduct)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Stenmark v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 59 MSPR 462, 472-73 (1993), presents the termination of an employee by an agency that, to avoid more EEO charges, was more cautious in its treatment of her during a training program and dispelled an inference of reprisal by seeking to assist the employee successfully complete training:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish retaliation for filing a discrimination complaint under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), an appellant must show that: (1) She made a protected disclosure; (2) the accused official knew of the disclosure; (3) the adverse action under review could, under the circumstances, have been retaliation; and (4) after careful balancing of the intensity of the motive to retaliate against the gravity of the misconduct, a nexus is established between the adverse action and the motive. <span class="Italic">Warren v. Department of the Army</span>, 804 F.2d 654, 656-58 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Westmoreland v. Department of Transportation</span>, 49 MSPR 574, 576 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant has met the first two criteria for showing retaliation. She has established that she made a protected disclosure by filing a sex discrimination complaint and that the proposing and deciding officials knew of the disclosure. <span class="Italic">See</span> Warren, 804 F.2d at 656-58; Westmoreland, 49 MSPR at 576.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, however, has not shown that the agency's action could have been retaliation. The appellant presented testimony at the hearing that: Ralph Williams, the Acting Manager of the Providence Tower at the time of her reassignment there, informed other employees that she had previously filed an EEO complaint and that they should be careful in their dealings with her and document "everything"; the agency scrutinized her work more closely than it scrutinized other employees, documenting even "picayune" errors; and certain training instructors and employees at the Providence Tower created a tense, hostile working environment around her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Washington, who was the deciding official and also one of the concurring proposing officials in the removal action, testified that he was on detail from the Providence Tower when the appellant arrived there. He stated that he first learned that she had filed a sex discrimination complaint when she disclosed it to him in her attempt to obtain her within-grade salary increase, which he assisted her in obtaining. He testified that the agency's regulations provide for "termination of training" based on failure of the 70 percent evaluation. He stated that he assigned a committee to assist the appellant in her performance and that the appellant objected to this effort and requested to be supervised by an instructor of her choice, which he allowed. He testified that he ordered the instructor to provide weekly reports of his training with her in order to ensure that her areas of difficulty could be addressed. He also testified that, on the day of her last evaluation, he afforded her the option of postponing her evaluation session because of poor weather conditions but that she nevertheless decided to take it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A review of all of the testimony indicates that the sole reason that Providence Tower officials strictly followed FAA training procedures was not to retaliate against the appellant but to protect itself in the event that she again failed training and/or decided to file another sex discrimination complaint. As noted above, Washington assisted her in obtaining her within-grade increase and even afforded her the opportunity to postpone her last evaluation because of foggy weather, but she declined.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, even if the appellant had shown that the removal action could have been retaliation, we find, after balancing the intensity of any agency motive to retaliate against her for alleged unacceptable performance, that she has failed to establish a nexus between the agency's action and any retaliatory motive. Therefore, we find that the appellant has failed to establish her affirmative defense of retaliation. <span class="Italic">See</span> Warren, 804 F.2d at 656-58; Westmoreland, 49 MSPR at 576.</p>

Moreover, as noted by the administrative judge none of the agency officials named in the appellant's 2010 EEO complaint served as the proposing official in this matter. The administrative judge found that the appellant submitted no evidence that the proposing official had a motive to retaliate against the appellant based on his protected EEO activity. Accordingly, the appellant has failed to show that the agency officials most closely involved in his removal had a strong motive to retaliate against him," citing <span class="Italic">Redschlag</span>); <span class="Italic">Redschlag v.

<p class="Body-Text">The appellant may present evidence of reprisal by tracing the events that show alleged animosity of the decisionmakers toward him. An AJ should have taken evidence concerning events up to two years prior to removal to permit the appellant to establish a claim of reprisal for protected activities. <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, 26 MSPR 164, 167 (1985) (following remand, 29 MSPR 447, 450-52 (1985)). The burden, however, remains with the appellant to demonstrate reprisal through whatever evidence he provides, <span class="Italic">Marsh v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 47, 51 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It appears from the record that the appellant did engage in EEO activity, that the deciding official was aware of such activity, and that the removal action could, under the circumstances, have been retaliation. <span class="Italic">See Ally</span>, 58 MSPR at 686; <span class="Italic">Cooney v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 34 MSPR 183, 185 (1987). Nevertheless, we find that the appellant failed to establish that the motive to retaliate outweighed the gravity of the misconduct involved. <span class="Italic">See Allen</span>, 58 MSPR at 571-72; <span class="Italic">Wynne v. Department of the Army</span>, 46 MSPR 320, 326 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 940 F.2d 677 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, who was represented below, presented no evidence regarding the intensity of the deciding official's motive to retaliate, and did not even question the deciding official regarding the appellant's EEO activity. In fact, the deciding official testified on direct examination that: He gave the appellant several opportunities to explain his conduct; he met with the appellant one-on-one because he sensed that the appellant felt uncomfortable meeting with other people; he previously had promoted the appellant and recommended him for other agency programs; and he requested that the appellant appear at a settlement conference because he thought that it was "not fair" to proceed with only the appellant's representative in attendance. The deciding official also offered the appellant a last chance settlement agreement, which the appellant declined to accept.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, falsification of documents involves serious misconduct that affects an employee's reliability, veracity, trustworthiness, and ethical conduct, and thus directly impacts on the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Department of Treasury</span>, 61 MSPR 484, 490 (1994). The Board has consistently found that severe penalties in such cases are warranted and promote the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> We therefore conclude that the appellant has failed to prove his allegation of retaliation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A past finding of discrimination does not demonstrate current reprisal if sufficient time has passed and intervening events do not show discriminatory animus. In <span class="Italic">Carter v. SBA</span>, 61 MSPR 656, 667-69 (1994), the proposing official, Mr. Phillips, was a member of a selection committee that, ten years prior to the performance-based action appealed, recommended against appellant's selection for her position, a determination found discriminatory by EEOC. The passage of time, and intervening nondiscriminatory actions of Phillips, who became appellant's supervisor and the proposing official in the action, eradicated the taint of reprisal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An influential agency official's connection to an imminent adverse action need not be overt or 'direct' to be meaningful or significant....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...With regard to the fourth part, nexus, we note that the administrative judge did not rest upon the mere fact that the charges were not sustained, as the agency asserts; he also relied, in part, upon Phillips's own testimony, stating as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Phillips did not make the [1982] selection at issue in [the appellant's EEO] complaint, but was involved with the committee making recommendations for the position. He candidly admitted at the hearing that he did not think then that [the appellant] was one of the best qualified to be a district director, that he later disagreed with the findings of discrimination in the complaint, and that nothing had happened since 1982 to change his opinion that she did not have what it takes to be a good district director.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the above, we find that the administrative judge essentially rested his finding of retaliation upon Phillips's belief that his original assessment of the appellant's qualifications had been correct while the EEOC's finding of discrimination had been erroneous, and that nothing had happened in the intervening 10 years to persuade him that the appellant had what it takes to be a good District Director. We find, however, that Phillips's continued belief in his opinion over that of the EEOC's contrary opinion is an insufficient basis from which to infer a retaliatory motive. Moreover, in light of the long period of time between the filing and resolution of the EEO complaint and the removal action at issue, particularly considering the fact that Phillips rated the appellant "Fully Successful" for 2 years in a row before placing her on a PIP in 1992, <span id="Page_3401"></span>we find that the appellant has failed to support the fourth part of the <span class="Italic">Warren</span> test<span class="Italic">. See Haine v. Department of the Navy</span>, 41 MSPR 462, 472-73 (1989); <span class="Italic">see also Gerlach v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 9 MSPR 268, 274 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Recent findings of discrimination did not establish reprisal when the agency officials involved in the prior findings are presented with adequate cause for removing the appellant, as in <span class="Italic">Simien v. USPS</span>, 99 MSPR 237, 250-54 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 30-40 (2005), based on an AWOL charge:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A finding by an EEOC judge that a supervisor had discriminated against one of his employees could, of course, embarrass a supervisor and diminish his reputation in the agency. Furthermore, the removal at issue in the discrimination complaint was proposed by the same supervisor who proposed the removal at issue in this appeal, and Mr. Swartz, who issued the decision to effect the instant removal, was the official who concurred in the earlier removal proposal. We note, however, that there is no indication in the record that either of those officials was disciplined, admonished, or even the subject of any criticism by agency management as a result of the appellant's discrimination complaint, the EEOC decision on it, or the alleged inadequacy of the agency's efforts to comply with the decision. <span class="Italic">Cf. Redschlag v. Department of the Army</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 589 &#x00B6; 88 (2001) (the fact that agency officials were actually disciplined for their roles in the misconduct the employee had reported enhanced the officials' retaliatory motive), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 32 Fed. Appx. 543 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Moreover, for the reasons stated below, the record in this case--including the EEOC decision itself--indicates that other agency officials were unlikely to regard those officials' actions with respect to the removal at issue in the complaint as improper.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The removal that was the subject of the discrimination complaint was based on allegations that, when a postal patron confronted the appellant about his late delivery of the mail, the appellant had yelled and screamed at her, called her ugly, and made threatening statements to her. Although the appellant denied these allegations during the agency's investigation, the proposal notice describes corroborating statements by witnesses to the incident, and the appellant failed to make any response to that notice. After he was removed, the appellant filed a complaint in which he alleged that he was sexually harassed. The person alleged to have harassed him was not an agency official, however, but the postal patron whom he was charged with threatening. Moreover, although the EEOC judge found that the agency became liable for the alleged harassment "not later than" the day after the incident, when it placed the appellant in a nonduty status pending its investigation of the incident, he also indicated in his decision that the agency had "offered to leave [the appellant] on the job if he simply changed to another route." While the appellant evidently argued before the EEOC that he should have had his route modified so that another carrier delivered the mail to the address where the incident had occurred, and that the appellant should have been permitted to continue to serve the rest of the route, we do not believe that the failure to adopt this approach would likely be regarded by agency officials as evidence that the appellant's supervisor or the other official to whom retaliatory animus has been attributed had acted improperly in the matter. In fact, neither the EEOC decision nor anything else in the record indicates that either of those officials was responsible for the failure to modify the appellant's route; there is no indication that any other agency official shared the EEOC judge's apparent belief that the modification should have been made; and there is no indication that anyone in the agency considered the offer the agency made (i.e., the offer to allow the appellant to change to another route) to be inadequate or otherwise inappropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we note that the appellant seems to have acknowledged before the EEOC judge that he used the term "ugly" in referring to the patron during his confrontation with her (statement by the EEOC judge that the appellant told the patron "that she had 'an ugly personality,' or words to that effect"); the offense with which the appellant was charged was a serious one; nothing in the record indicates that any agency management official regarded the allegations of misconduct as unsubstantiated; and nothing indicates that any agency management official believed removal would not be warranted by such misconduct. Under these circumstances and the other circumstances described above, we do not believe that the appellant's discrimination complaint, or the EEOC decision on it, establishes that the appellant's supervisor or the agency deciding official in this case had a significant motive to retaliate against the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also see no persuasive evidence that either official exhibited any retaliatory animus toward the appellant. While the appellant asserted briefly in his testimony that his supervisor told him he did not want the appellant at the Main Post Office, and while the supervisor does not appear to have specifically denied making this statement, we do not regard such a statement as necessarily indicative of retaliatory animus. More important, the circumstances under which the appellant initially was assigned to the Uptown Station indicate that the supervisor would have had other, legitimate reasons for wanting the appellant to work at that location instead of at the Main Post Office. The appellant in effect acknowledged in his testimony that his route at the Main Post Office had been abolished following his removal.... In light of this change, the appellant's assignment to a different duty station seems both reasonable and logical. Furthermore, when the appellant objected to his assignment to the Uptown Station, the agency promptly assigned the appellant to his former duty station and provided him with an additional 10 days to report to work.... These actions do not appear to reflect retaliatory animus. Instead, they seem to reflect a reasonable response to changed circumstances (i.e., the fact that the appellant's route no longer existed), followed by accommodation of the appellant's wish to return to his former duty station despite those changed circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that the appellant's general assertions that he was somehow the victim of reprisal are unsupported by the testimony of any other witness. As the administrative judge indicated, when the appellant's own witness--the union steward who had represented the appellant on matters related to this case--was asked whether the appellant's supervisor was fair, he testified that the supervisor just wanted people to do their work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we note that the supervisor had ample reason to propose the removal at issue in this appeal and that Mr. Swartz had ample reason to decide to effect that action. <span class="Italic">See Redschlag</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 589 &#x00B6; 64 (to prove a claim of reprisal, an appellant must establish a nexus between the motive and the subsequent action, and the nexus determination is made "after careful balancing of the intensity of the motive to retaliate against the gravity of the misconduct"). By the time the removal was proposed, the appellant had been AWOL almost without interruption for well over 2 months. <span class="Italic">See Crutchfield v. Department of the Navy</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 444, 448 (1997) (unauthorized absence, by its very nature, disrupts the efficiency of the service); <span class="Italic">Jefferies v. Department of the Navy</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 255, 262-63 (1998) (removal is a reasonable penalty for excessive unauthorized absence even when the employee has lengthy service and a clean prior disciplinary record). Moreover, the appellant's absence covered most of the month of December--a month that, as indicated above, is the busiest time of the year for the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have noted previously that the administrative judge relied in part on the appellant's claim--a claim the administrative judge found unrebutted--that the agency had not fully complied with the EEOC judge's decision. In connection with this matter, the appellant indicated that he believed the agency should have assigned him to a regular route, rather than to the duties of an unassigned regular carrier; that it should have provided him with a new uniform before requiring the appellant to deliver mail; that it should have provided him with additional, more formal training regarding matters such as the procedures carriers were expected to follow and computers and other equipment they were expected to use; and that it should have ensured that he was licensed to drive postal vehicles. He also indicated that he did not believe he should have been expected to report for work until the agency had taken these actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not determine whether the agency complied fully with the EEOC judge's order. An employee does not have the unfettered right to disregard an order merely because there is substantial reason to believe that the order is not proper; he must first comply with the order and then register his complaint or grievance, except in certain limited circumstances in which obedience would place the employee in a clearly dangerous situation or in which complying with the order would cause him irreparable harm. <span class="Italic">Cooke v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 401, 407&#8209;08, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 73 F.3d 380 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). The appellant has not alleged, and the record does not indicate, that the agency's alleged noncompliance with the order exposed him to any danger. Moreover, although the appellant indicated in his testimony that he believed the agency's alleged failure to train him reflected management's hope that he would make mistakes, any discipline resulting from those mistakes could have been challenged through a grievance, appeal, or other appropriate procedure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that, even if the agency did not comply fully with the EEOC judge's order, the record does not indicate that any failure with respect to that matter was based on retaliatory animus. Both the appellant's immediate supervisor and Mr. Swartz testified that the aspect of the appellant's December restoration to the Main Post Office to which he seemed to object most strenuously--i.e., the agency's failure to assign him to a regular route--was based on advice from agency labor-relations officials, who had concluded that carrier routes did not need to be opened up for rebidding as a result of the EEOC decision. We see nothing in the record that contradicts this testimony. Furthermore, the appellant acknowledged that he had worked before his first removal on at least some of the equipment on which he believed he should have received training; he has not contradicted the agency's testimony that he was told he could ask his coworkers for guidance regarding the use of the equipment if he had questions or problems regarding that matter; he has not contradicted its testimony that he could deliver the mail without <span id="Page_3402"></span>a uniform until he received his uniform allowance; he has not rebutted its testimony that carriers were permitted to drive postal vehicles with only a valid, state-issued operator's license, and no additional permit; and he has admitted that he possessed such a license at the time of his reinstatement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the agency's alleged noncompliance with the EEOC judge's order could be--and in fact, is--the subject of a petition for enforcement filed with the EEOC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances described above, the existence of a dispute regarding the extent to which the agency had complied with the EEOC order does not diminish the seriousness of the appellant's misconduct, and it does not provide a proper basis on which to find that the gravity of the misconduct was outweighed by any retaliatory motive.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Leveritt v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 5 MSPR 168, 172, 5 MSPB 224 (1981), determined that to obtain protection against reprisal, official channels must be used; a reprisal charge was not sustained based on actions taken after an employee distributed a letter containing disparaging statements outside of EEO channels. But reprisal may occur if supervisors act against an employee who either announces his intention to file a complaint or pursues informal counseling with an EEO counselor. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Zimmerman</span>, 36 MSPR 274, 290-91 (1988) (citing <span class="Italic">Berube v. GSA</span>, 30 MSPR 581, 596-99 (1986), and <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Brown</span>, 28 MSPR 133, 138-40 (1985)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Vasconcelos v. Meese</span>, 907 F.2d 111 (9th Cir. 1990) (leaving open the question of the degree of protection for false statements made in the course of EEO proceedings, and finding no protection for false statements during an agency investigation that did not constitute an EEO investigation). [Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-224.html#sec8-223">Criticism, False Statement about Coworker, Subordinate, Supervisor</a>," concerning discipline against employees who make false statements in the course of otherwise protected activities.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant's reprisal claim is not to be discounted only because the agency has a valid reason for its action of withholding a step increase. Instead, the more complex analysis is required that assesses the agency's motivation, <span class="Italic">Smith v. USDA</span>, 64 MSPR 46, 63 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge went on to hold that the appellant had failed to establish the fourth and final element of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal for the exercise of statutory complaint rights, namely, that there was a genuine nexus between the withholding of the appellant's within-grade increase and the appellant's protected activity<span class="Italic">. See Viens-Koretko</span>, 53 MSPR at 163. We VACATE this holding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that there was no nexus based solely on his earlier findings that the agency did not treat the appellant unfairly with respect to his goals, the quality of his assignments, and the equipment that it made available to him. He should have analyzed the nexus issue by assessing the intensity of any retaliatory motive on the part of agency officials, and also by determining whether the strength of the evidence before the agency officials in support of their decision to withhold the within-grade increase outweighed any retaliatory motive. <span class="Italic">Cf. Haine v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 41 MSPR 462, 472 (1989); <span class="Italic">Gomez v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 36 MSPR 56, 61 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Madison v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 32 MSPR 465, 475-79 (1987), provides an example of a finding of reprisal that discounted the legitimacy of the agency action taken against the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence on this issue that does appear in the record, and which has not been specifically denied or rebutted by the agency, can be summarized as follows. The appellant's first EEO complaint to the agency was based on an allegation of sex discrimination in 1982. Between that time and the incident resulting in an apology from Mr. Green in 1983, she filed other EEO complaints alleging agency reprisal for her having filed the first complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For more than two years before the incident with Mr. Green, the appellant had been excused from TDY requiring air travel or exposure to fresh paint and insecticide fumes, without medical documentation. Approximately three weeks following that incident, the agency ordered her to perform TDY that required air travel. Upon request, the appellant provided medical documentation of her ailment from her private allergist, but the agency, which had given her no guidance as to what sort of information would be required, rejected it and ordered her to report for a fitness-for-duty examination, which was conducted by an Air Force Occupational Health physician named Dr. Zilvetti. Following that examination, the appellant was apparently not required to perform the ordered TDY and the matter was dropped (Appellant's petition for review).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts that during a long period of extensive renovation of its buildings, the agency never notified her when painting and spraying were to be done in areas where she would be affected, although others in DLIELC had received such notification. On one occasion, spraying was begun in her office as she sat at her desk. Although she suffered a serious reaction to that spraying, her supervisor did not inform building custodians or the Environmental Health office of the appellant's susceptibility to such work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In July of 1985, Col. Jung ordered her to report to a specific building where painting was being done, despite his having been apprised, orally and in medical documentation, of her condition. Following this incident, she notified Environmental Health who, in turn, officially notified Col. Jung's superiors of his action and requested that the appellant not be further exposed to such conditions. This notification, the appellant contends, caused Col. Jung and his supervisor, Mr. Green, additional embarrassment and provided additional motivation for reprisal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant asserts that on September 19, 1985, Col. Jung handed her a letter requesting her to undergo another fitness-for-duty examination, consisting of allergy skin tests. Because she had been moved out of her work area (in a building that was undergoing extensive remodeling and painting), Col. Jung doubted her ability to meet her performance standards. The appellant offered the agency new medical documentation from her private allergist to indicate that the skin tests were not necessary, but Col. Jung declined to submit it to the agency allergy clinic for such a determination. The appellant therefore submitted to an examination by the agency allergy clinic, where an agency physician who was to do the skin tests determined that her private medical documentation was completely sufficient to establish her ailment. The appellant argues that Jung's persistent disregard of her private medical documentation violated the spirit of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 339.302(b), which requires the agency to provide an employee with an opportunity to submit such documentation, and to review and consider it, before ordering a fitness-for-duty examination by an agency physician.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the administrative judge's improper limitation of the presentation of testimony on the issue of reprisal at the hearing, we find that there is sufficient circumstantial evidence of record, discussed above, from which to infer a retaliatory motive. <span class="Italic">See Monczewski v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 11 MSPB 17, 12 MSPR 362, 365 (1982), and <span class="Italic">Bodinus v. Department of Treasury,</span> 7 MSPB 385, 7 MSPR 536, 540 (1981). The appellant's allegations of reprisal have gone unrebutted, except for a one-sentence general denial in the agency's Response to Material Issues Raised by Appellant. Because the results of the battery of mandated medical examinations, described above, were never used by the agency to make a fitness-for-duty determination, we find that the appellant's supervisors evinced a pattern of inappropriate action, utilizing procedures designed to govern such determinations to no apparent legitimate end. We find that this pattern, in conjunction with Mr. Green's blatantly improper threat of removal if the appellant filed another EEO complaint, described above, constitutes preponderant evidence that the appellant's protected conduct of filing EEO complaints was a substantial or motivating factor in her removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Gerlach v. Federal Trade Commission,</span> 8 MSPB 599, 9 MSPR 268 (1981), we adopted the test for assessing allegations of reprisal in so-called "dual motivation" cases set forth by the Supreme Court in the case of <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy City School District Board</span> <span class="Italic">of Education v. Doyle,</span> 429 U.S. 274, 97 S. Ct. 568, 50 L. Ed.2d 471 (1977). Under that test, once an employee who is claiming reprisal establishes that his protected activity constituted a substantial or motivating factor in an adverse action taken against him by the agency, the burden shifts to the employer to prove that it would have taken the same action even if the protected conduct had not taken place. <span class="Italic">Gerlach,</span> 9 MSPR at 275.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, having concluded that the appellant met her burden of showing retaliation to be a motivating factor in her removal, we must now determine whether the agency has established that it would have removed her absent the retaliatory motive. Toward this end, the most significant consideration is our prior finding that the agency has not sustained its charges against the appellant by preponderant evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find, however, that even if the charges had been sustained by the evidence, the agency's selected penalty of removal would have been excessive. In its Response to Material Issues Raised by the Appellant, the agency claims that the appellant's alleged misconduct at the DEB meeting jeopardized harmonious relations with the DLIELC's client countries. In the proposal notice, the agency also asserted that the alleged misconduct "adversely affected the DLIELC mission," and "can have far-reaching effects at diplomatic levels, and it is felt that this position is far too sensitive to allow Ms. Madison to continue in this important position."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These assertions are contradicted not only by the testimony of Mr. Hunter, who said that the appellant gets along very well with the foreign students with whom she deals, but also by the fact that the agency permitted the appellant to continue performing the full range of her duties, including sitting on Language Evaluation Boards, up until the effective date of her removal, more than two months after the alleged misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the proposal notice, the agency also asserts that the appellant's alleged misconduct resulted in "a required apology from the DLIELC Commandant's office to the senior students from Tunisia and Morocco." The maker of that apology, Deputy Commandant Lt. Col. Melhe, was called by the agency as a witness for the express purpose of testifying that his apology had been ordered by his superiors. However, his testimony <span id="Page_3403"></span>revealed that, in fact, he made the apology independently, based on his own belief that it was necessary. While the administrative judge at the hearing expressed distinct displeasure with the agency representative for having misled him on this point, he did not mention that fact at all in his initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also emphasizes in its Response to Material Issues Raised by Appellant that the appellant was charged with three offenses: "making false malicious statements; refusal to comply with proper instructions and insolence; and rude and offensive language which [<span class="Italic">sic</span>] adversely affected morale." It asserts that each of these carries the penalty of removal for the first offense.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Militating against these contentions are the fact that the DEB meeting in question was the appellant's first such experience, the fact that the purported purpose of the meeting was to freely debate and determine disciplinary action against a foreign student for serious misconduct, and the fact that the appellant had no previous disciplinary record whatsoever in her ten years of highly rated service with the agency. Therefore, and in view of the tenuous and inconsistent evidence presented by the agency, we find that the agency's rationale for its choice of penalty constitutes improper compounding of charges and gross overreaching. This disparity between penalty and proof is further evidence of retaliatory motive. <span class="Italic">See McClellan v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 19 MSPR 237 (1984) and <span class="Italic">Monczewski v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 11 MSPB 17, 12 MSPR 362, 367 (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we find that the agency has not demonstrated that it would have removed the appellant absent its retaliatory motive, and that the removal was instituted in retaliation for the appellant's engaging in protected activities. Consequently, we also find that the administrative judge erred in not so finding.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Coons v. Sec'y of Treasury</span>, 383 F.3d 879, 887 (9th Cir. 2004) (reprisal was not shown when a demotion occurred a year after the employee's request for accommodation; evidence supported the basis for the demotion); <span class="Italic">Sherman v. Runyon</span>, 235 F.3d 406, 410 (8th Cir. 2000) ("[Timing on its own is usually not sufficient to show that an employer's nondiscriminatory reason for discharge is merely pretext. Instead, the timing of the discharge is usually evaluated in light of other evidence, or lack of other evidence, in the record."); <span class="Italic">Jefferson v. USPS</span>, 81 MSPR 607, 609-12 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-10 (1999) (misconduct charges were not sustained and removal was reversed; the AJ's finding of reprisal was set aside, however, because the deciding official had before him at the reply stage evidence sufficient to support discipline and there was no independent evidence of the motivation of the deciding official to act in reprisal against the appellant); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 50 MSPR 412, 423 (1991) (inference of reprisal was possible through the close proximity of the removal and the involvement of the appellant in EEO proceedings; there was no genuine nexus because the evidence showed that the supervisor "had numerous problems with the appellant's performance long before she filed her discrimination complaint and long before he imposed the 60-day PIP and proposed the removal action"); <span class="Italic">Quirindongo v. USPS</span>, 19 MSPR 31, 34 (1984) (discounting appellant's argument that there was "common knowledge" of a prior lawsuit and EEO complaint).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Timing was analyzed in a private sector case of reprisal in <span class="Italic">Clark County School Dist. v. Breeden</span>, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 1510-11 (2001), suggesting that the temporal connection between protected activity and an alleged prohibited personnel action should be close to support an inference of reprisal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Besides claiming that she was punished for complaining to petitioner's personnel about the alleged sexual harassment, respondent also claimed that she was punished for filing charges against petitioner with the Nevada Equal Rights Commission and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and for filing the present suit. Respondent filed her lawsuit on April 1, 1997; on April 10, 1997, respondent's supervisor, Assistant Superintendent Rice, "mentioned to Allin Chandler, Executive Director of plaintiffs union, that she was contemplating transferring plaintiff to the position of Director of Professional Development Education,"...and this transfer was "carried through" in May. In order to show, as her defense against summary judgment required, the existence of a causal connection between her protected activities and the transfer, respondent "relie[d] wholly on the temporal proximity of the filing of her complaint on April 1, 1997 and Rice's statement to plaintiff s union representative on April 10, 1997 that she was considering transferring plaintiff to the [new] position." The District Court, however, found that respondent did not serve petitioner with the summons and complaint until April 11, 1997, one day after Rice had made the statement, and Rice filed an affidavit stating that she did not become aware of the lawsuit until after April 11, a claim that respondent did not challenge. Hence, the court concluded, respondent "ha[d] not shown that any causal connection exists between her protected activities and the adverse employment decision."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court of Appeals reversed, relying on two facts: The EEOC had issued a right-to-sue letter to respondent three months before Rice announced she was contemplating the transfer, and the actual transfer occurred one month after Rice learned of respondent's suit. 2000 WL 991821, at *3. The latter fact is immaterial in light of the fact that petitioner concededly was contemplating the transfer before it learned of the suit. Employers need not suspend previously planned transfers upon discovering that a Title VII suit has been filed, and their proceeding along lines previously contemplated, though not yet definitively determined, is no evidence whatever of causality.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the right-to-sue letter: Respondent did not rely on that letter in the District Court and did not mention it in her opening brief on appeal. Her demonstration of causality all along had rested upon the connection between the transfer and the filing of her lawsuit as to which connection the letter was irrelevant. When, however, petitioner's answering brief in the Court of Appeals demonstrated conclusively the lack of causation between the filing of respondent's lawsuit and Rice's decision, respondent mentioned the letter for the first time in her reply brief, Reply Brief in No. 99-15522(CA9) pp. 910. The Ninth Circuit's opinion did not adopt respondent's utterly implausible suggestion that the EEOC's issuance of a right-to-sue letter--an action in which the employee takes no part-is a protected activity of the employee, <span class="Italic">see</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-3(a). Rather, the opinion suggests that the letter provided petitioner with its first notice of respondent's charge before the EEOC, and hence allowed the inference that the transfer proposal made three months later was petitioner's reaction to the charge. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2000 WL 991821, at *3. This will not do.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, there is no indication that Rice even knew about the right-to-sue letter when she proposed transferring respondent. And second, if one presumes she knew about it, one must also presume that she (or her predecessor) knew <span class="Italic">almost two</span> <span class="Italic">years earlier</span> about the protected action (filing of the EEOC complaint) that the letter supposedly disclosed. (The complaint had been filed on August 23, 1995, and both Title VII and its implementing regulations require that an employer be given notice within 10 days of filing, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(b), (e)(1); 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1601-14 (2000).) The cases that accept mere temporal proximity between an employer's knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment action as sufficient evidence of causality to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case uniformly hold that the temporal proximity must be "very close," <span class="Italic">O'Neal v. Ferguson Constr. Co.,</span> 237 F.3d 1248, 1253 (C.A.10 2001). <span class="Italic">See e.g., Rich</span>mond <span class="Italic">v. ONEOK, Inc.,</span> 120 F.3d 205, 209 (C.A.10 1997) (3-month period insufficient); <span class="Italic">Hughes v. Derwinski</span> 967 F.2d 1168, 1174-1175 (C.A.7 1992) (4-month period insufficient). Action taken (as here) 20 months later suggests, by itself, no causality at all.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, neither the grounds that respondent presented to the District Court, nor the ground she added on appeal, nor even the ground the Court of Appeals developed on its own, sufficed to establish a dispute substantial enough to withstand the motion for summary judgment. The District Court's granting of that motion was correct. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...While it is true that the appellant did file EEO claims against almost every manager in the decision-making chain and various investigators on the IG staff, there is no additional evidence of retaliation in the record. To prevail on her retaliation defense, the appellant would have had to prove that the entire IG investigation into her criminal and ethical misdeeds was a setup, that the agency's reliance on the IG's "poisoned report" to remove her was erroneous, and that her post-crime detail and later placement on administrative leave amounted to retaliation<span class="Italic">.
