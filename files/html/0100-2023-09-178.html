<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-175"><span class="space">7.</span> Personnel Action Resulting From Settlement Not Constituting Last Chance Agreement</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">As to the effect of settlements and their waiver and release clauses, on subsequent Board appeals, under <span class="Italic">Landers v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 117 MSPR 109, 111 &#x00B6; 5, 2011 MSPB 99 (2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will consider a settlement agreement reached outside of a Board proceeding to determine its effect on an action before the Board and any waiver of Board appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Swidecki v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6; 7, <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 182 Fed. Appx. 992 (Fed. Cir. 2006); <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 81, 84 (1998). The appellant may challenge the validity of the settlement agreement if he believes that the agreement was unlawful, involuntary, or resulted from fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">Swidecki</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6; 13. He may also challenge the enforceability of any waiver of Board appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a settlement provides for the employee's resignation with a waiver of an appeal, a subsequent appeal will be dismissed unless the settlement agreement is the product of fraud or duress. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hightower v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 39 MSPR 538, 542 (1989); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">King v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 60, 65 (1991) (Board examines for invalidity an unfiled settlement affecting Board jurisdiction). [Other grounds for setting aside a settlement are discussed in Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-035.html#sec16-36">Setting Aside A Settlement</a>," and refer in Chapter 16 to "Settlement Reached in Another Tribunal."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sullivan v. VA</span>, 79 MSPR 81, 84-87 (1998), addressed both the effect of unfiled settlement agreements resulting in actions generally considered voluntary (e.g., resignation or retirement) and the nature and strength of assertions needed to overcome those agreements to reach a Board hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Board does not have the authority to enforce a settlement agreement not entered into the record for enforcement purposes, it has the authority to consider the validity of such an agreement, including one, as here, entered into proceedings not before the Board, so as to determine its effect on a personnel action before the Board. <span class="Italic">See Wade v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 61 MSPR 580, 582-83 (1994); <span class="Italic">Laity v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 61 MSPR 256, 261 (1994)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An involuntary resignation is tantamount to a removal and is subject to the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Short v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 66 MSPR 214, 218 (1995). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, the appellant's December 31, 1996 resignation was a term of a November 12, 1996 pre-appeal EEO settlement agreement. The Board has the authority to consider the validity of a pre-appeal settlement agreement, by which the appellant agreed to resign, so as to determine its effect on a personnel action before the Board. <span class="Italic">See Short,</span> 66 MSPR at 218. A hearing is required with respect to jurisdictional questions only if the employee makes a non-frivolous allegation that, if proved, would establish Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Staats v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 99 F.3d 1120, 1125 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant claimed that his resignation was the result of duress because of the agency's action during the 120-day period leading to his resignation. Specifically, he alleged that in July 1996 he received a RIF notice and was forced to accept a Clerk/Typing position that he was unqualified for because of his visual impairment. He further claimed that after working in the Clerk/Typist position for 6 weeks, he received a second RIF notice rescinding the previous job offer based on his physical inability to perform the job and informing him that he would be separated on November 13, 1996. In addition, the appellant submitted <span id="Page_1158"></span>documents showing that he was in fact issued two RIF notices. It is well settled that the fact that an employee is confronted with the unpleasant choice of resigning or facing removal does not affect the voluntariness of the ultimate choice to resign. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schultz v. United States Navy,</span> 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Absent a showing that the agency knew or believed that the termination could not be substantiated, or that an arguable basis for discharge did not exist, the fact that a decision to separate the appellant was issued does not render his subsequent resignation involuntary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1136. Here, while the appellant claimed that the agency was manipulating the RIF process to get rid of him, he did not present sufficient evidence supporting such assertions for the Board to conclude that a jurisdictional hearing is necessary. <span class="Italic">See Briscoe v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 55 F.3d 1571, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (although an appellant need not prove his entire case before he is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing, the Board may request sufficient evidence to determine if there is any support for what otherwise might be no more than bald allegations).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also claimed that his resignation was the result of duress in that he was suffering from work-related health problems and was given a 30-day medical leave. Where an appellant has alleged duress and emotional distress as a ground for involuntariness, the Board considers whether the appellant was represented below, whether he has demonstrated that he was mentally impaired at the time, and whether he has otherwise shown that he was unable to understand fully the nature of the action in question or to assist his representative in the appeal. <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 50 MSPR 676, 678 (1991). The appellant was represented by an attorney during the negotiating and the signing of the settlement agreement. He submitted documentation that shows he was diagnosed with "fatigue, depression, back strain and neck strain related to having to use a monitor 8 hours a day despite severe visual loss, work related stress, headache, and genetic macular degeneration with the patient being legally blind." The appellant, however, never alleged that he was unable to fully understand the nature of the settlement agreement or to assist his counsel. Accordingly, he has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that the settlement and his resignation were involuntary because of his physical and mental conditions. <span class="Italic">Cf. Short,</span> 66 MSPR at 219-220 (employee who submitted an affidavit from a licensed social worker stating, <span class="Italic">inter alia,</span> that he was incapable of making a rational decision at the time of the signing of the agreement and claimed that the agreement was procured under time pressure made a nonfrivolous allegation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also claimed that he was subjected to hostile behavior by agency management concerning his RIF and EEO concerns. To be entitled to a jurisdictional hearing on these issues, the appellant must make a nonfrivolous allegation that his working conditions were made so intolerable by the alleged reprisal and retaliation as to render his resignation involuntary by reason of coercion. <span class="Italic">See Burke v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 53 MSPR 434, 438 (1992). The only specific incident that the appellant claimed occurred was a meeting with the Director on July 11, 1996, wherein the Director allegedly chastised, threatened, and harassed him. Even if such a meeting occurred, it alone would not be enough to show that working conditions were so difficult that a reasonable person in his position would have felt compelled to resign<span class="Italic">. See Collins v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 55 MSPR 185, 190 (1992) (employee failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that her resignation was involuntary when she failed to allege sufficient specific facts which, if true, would show that she had no alternative to resignation), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds, Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 60 MSPR 325 (1994). Moreover, the meeting occurred 4 months before the appellant signed the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant claimed that the agency misled him about the benefits he would receive from the settlement agreement. The appellant claimed that "[t]he facility attorney, serving as proxy in this agreement, assured me that GS-11 status would apply to my remaining tenure and application for disability retirement." In order to show that his resignation was involuntary the appellant had to show not only that the agency representative's statement was misleading, but also that he reasonably relied on the statement to his detriment. <span class="Italic">Malan v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 55 MSPR 283, 291 (1992). Pursuant to the November 12, 1996 settlement agreement, the agency agreed to pay the appellant a sum equal to the difference between his grade and pay (GS-10, Step 5) and the pay of a GS-11, Step 10 from August 31, 1993, until November 8, 1996, "<span class="Italic">without a corresponding personnel action</span>." The agency also agreed to "[p]rovide a positive written employment reference mutually agreeable, based solely upon the performance as Public Affairs Specialist, GS-11/10, after the signing of this settlement agreement." Thus, the settlement agreement does not require the agency to promote him to a GS-11, Step 10 position. In light of the fact that the appellant was represented by counsel when he signed the agreement, we find that the appellant's assertions are not sufficient to constitute a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency's alleged misrepresentations both misled him and that he reasonably relied upon them at the time he executed the settlement agreement and submitted his resignation. We therefore conclude, upon evaluating all of the appellant's assertions under the totality of the circumstance test, that his assent to the agreement and his resignation pursuant to it were voluntary. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Heining v. General Services Administration,</span> 68 MSPR 513, 520 (1995), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Scharf v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 710 F.2d 1572, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons set forth above, we find that the appellant has not made a nonfrivolous allegation of involuntariness that would entitle him to a jurisdictional hearing on this issue. <span class="Italic">See Ferdon v. U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Postal Service,</span> 60 MSPR 325, 329 (1994). Since the appellant voluntarily agreed to resign from his position, his appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Absent jurisdiction, we have no authority to adjudicate his claim of disability discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Merriweather v. Department of Transportation</span>, 64 MSPR 365, 375 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 56 F.3d 83 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A waiver of a Board appeal right was construed from a resignation agreement reached following initiation of a Board appeal, <span class="Italic">Price v. USPS,</span> DE-0752-09-0346-I-2 (NP 11/12/2010) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Price v. USPS</span>, 431 Fed. Appx. 918 (Fed. Cir. 2011)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 2, 2009, the appellant, a preference-eligible custodial laborer, was removed from the Postal Service. The appellant filed an initial appeal with the Merit Systems Protection Board, but, at the appellant's request, the administrative judge dismissed his appeal without prejudice subject to the resolution of pending criminal charges. The appellant later entered into a "pre-arbitration" settlement agreement with the agency in which he agreed to resign. The parties agreed that the settlement constituted the "full and final settlement of all issues" related to the appellant's grievance. On March 19, 2010, the administrative judge issued an initial decision finding, among other things, that "the parties want[ed]the agreement entered into the record so that the Board will retain jurisdiction to enforce its terms."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that when an employee chooses to file and settle a grievance, that course of action is presumptively voluntary and, as such, may divest the Board of jurisdiction over the underlying matter. <span class="Italic">Hanna v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 8 (2006); <span class="Italic">see Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 502, &#x00B6; 15 (2008), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 315 F. App'x 274 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Thus, the Board will review the terms of a settlement agreement and the surrounding circumstances to determine if it retains jurisdiction over an appeal that was settled in another procedural avenue. <span class="Italic">Hanna</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">see Johnson</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 502, &#x00B6; 15. A presumption exists that if in settling a grievance, an employee broadly and generally waives his appeal rights without specifically addressing his Board appeal rights, the grievance settlement should be interpreted as waiving the employee's Board appeal rights since a grievance and a Board appeal are merely different procedural avenues to vindicate the same substantive rights under title 5. <span class="Italic">Laity v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 256, 261-62 (1994); <span class="Italic">see Hanna</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 502, &#x00B6; 15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has provided no evidence to rebut the presumption that his appeal rights to the Board have been waived. The settlement agreement in this case provided that the appellant agreed to resign from the agency, that his Official Personnel File would reflect a "voluntary resignation," and that the agreement was a "full and final settlement of all issues" related to the appellant's grievance. Under these circumstances, we must conclude that his appeal rights have been waived.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mariano v. VA</span>, 70 Fed. Appx. 552 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP) (appellant could agree to waive an appeal if an adjudicator other than MSPB, e.g., EEOC, found a whistleblowing allegation to be insubstantial);<span class="Italic"> cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3023) ("Petitioner waived his right to contest the fairness of the terms of the settlement agreement when he entered an agreement specifically waiving the right of appeal other than to contest breach.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Siman v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 80 MSPR 306, 310 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (1998), considered a challenge to a "retirement agreement" waiving Board appeal rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the Retirement Agreement, the appellant retired effective September 21, 1997. To establish the Board's jurisdiction over the alleged involuntary retirement under these circumstances, the appellant must first show that his waiver of Board appeal rights in the agreement was unenforceable<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Lopez v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 71 MSPR 461, 464 (1996). In addition, he must show that his retirement was involuntary, i.e., that it was obtained through duress, coercion, or misrepresentation by the agency. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Talley v. Department of the Army,</span> 50 MSPR 261, 263 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To show that his waiver of appeal rights is unenforceable, the appellant must show that: He complied with the agreement, but the agency breached it; he did not voluntarily enter into the agreement; or the agreement was a result of fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">See Link v. Department of Treasury,</span> 51 F.3d 1577, 1582-83 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 78 MSPR 594, 597 (1998); <span class="Italic">Lopez</span>, 71 MSPR at 464. <span id="Page_1159"></span>Because the appellant retired pursuant to the terms of his Retirement Agreement with the agency, the second jurisdictional issue--whether his retirement was involuntary--is inextricably intertwined with the first jurisdictional issue involving the validity and enforceability of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An earlier case, <span class="Italic">Hirtle v. VA</span>, 38 MSPR 640, 646-47 (1988), declined jurisdiction over an appeal from a resignation resulting from a settlement that was challenged because the agency was alleged to have breached the settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge...erred in failing to construe the appellant's allegation that she was still on the rolls of the agency as an allegation that her separation by resignation, effected by the agency on September 9, 1987, as a result of the settlement agreement, was involuntary. We construe the appellant's submission as a petition for appeal of the second resignation. The appellant asserts that any separation effected by the agency as a result of the agreement should not have been effected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not, however, shown a proper basis for granting a hearing or for finding Board jurisdiction over the alleged involuntary resignation of September 9, 1987. In order to establish that the resignation was involuntary as a result of coercion, the appellant would have to show that one side involuntarily accepted the terms of the other, that circumstances permitted no other alternative, and that the circumstances were the result of coercive acts of the opposite party. <span class="Italic">See e.g., Nies v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 32 MSPR 510, 512 (1987). In order to show that the resignation was involuntary as a result of misrepresentation, the appellant would have to show that the agency made misleading statements upon which she reasonably relied to her detriment. <span class="Italic">See Scharf v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 710 F.2d 1572, 1574-75 (Fed. Cir. 1983). She has neither alleged nor shown that this resignation was effected as a result of coercion or misrepresentation, nor has she raised any nonfrivolous allegation that the settlement agreement was involuntarily entered into as a result of coercion or misrepresentation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rather, the appellant alleged that, because the agreement was breached, her resignation should not have been effected. Because the Board has no jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement, we have no jurisdiction over this allegation. The agreement itself is evidence of record, and, by its terms, it effectuated the appellant's resignation. As detailed above, the Board has no jurisdiction to look behind the face of the agreement; thus, there is no basis for any further consideration of the appellant's second appeal. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">McCall v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 839 F.2d 664 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (employee held to waive appeal rights to the Board where he entered into a "last chance" settlement agreement providing that the agency would withdraw its disciplinary action, but it reserved the right to reinstitute it, if the appellant breached the terms of the agreement; and the appellant neither alleged nor showed bad faith on the part of the agency in reinstating the removal action against him in accordance with the express terms of the agreement).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Horton v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP No. 02-3291), determined that an IRA appeal regarding a termination was barred when the appellant signed an EEO settlement substituting a resignation for personal reasons for the termination. The settlement included the provision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Complainant's signature on this agreement constitutes full and complete settlement of the above captioned EEO complaint....&#8197;In addition, the complainant agrees to waiver his rights to pursue administrative or judicial action in forum concerning the matters raised in this complaint, which include any matters that occurred prior to the execution of this settlement agreement, and that they will not be made the subject of future litigation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although an EEO settlement may block a Board appeal through its waiver or release provisions, the agreement is not substantively enforceable by the Board if it was not entered into the Board's record for purposes of enforcement during the adjudication of an action appealed to the Board and within the Board's jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">McGrath v. Dept. of Navy</span>, DC-0752-12-0859-I-1 (NP 9/30/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial decision, the administrative judge found that the parties had chosen to resolve the appeal in front of the EEOC and he dismissed the appeal on that basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has filed a timely petition for review essentially arguing that the Board should reinstate her initial appeal due to the agency's breach of the settlement agreement. Although the Board can consider a settlement agreement reached outside of a Board proceeding to determine its effect on the Board appeal and any waiver of appeal rights, it cannot enforce such an agreement. <span class="Italic">Lee v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 551, &#x00B6; 4 &#x0026; n.2 (2009), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 367 F. App'x 137 (Fed. Cir. 2010). The appellant's request that we find that the agency has breached the terms of the settlement agreement and reinstate her appeal is tantamount to a request for enforcement of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Lopez v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 461, 463 (1996). However, the Board does not have the authority to act on the appellant's request because the agreement was not entered into the record for enforcement purposes. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, as paragraph 8 of the settlement agreement explicitly states, "[i]t is the intent of the parties that...the EEOC will retain jurisdiction for enforcement purposes." Thus, there is no basis for the Board to enforce the agreement....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">Cf. Andersen v. DOD</span>, DC-1221-19-0058-W-1 (NP 11/17/2022) (the Board would not decide an issue of breach because the agreement called for compliance issues be resolved through EEO processes).
