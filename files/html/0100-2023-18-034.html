<p class="Body-Text">The prohibition against double jeopardy applies to criminal charges, not to administrative disciplinary cases. <span class="Italic">Stevenson v. United States</span>, 155 Ct. Cl. 592, 597 (1962) ("'Double jeopardy' applies to criminal charges and these [insubordination] were in no sense charges of a criminal nature. In any event, it is not unusual in cases where a procedural error is committed, for the agency to begin again and take final valid action."); <span class="Italic">Urogy v. Dept. of Army</span>, 53 MSPR 342, 347 (1992) ("The concept of double jeopardy does not apply to administrative actions. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Dejoy v. DHHS</span>, 2 MSPR 577, 580, 3 MSPB 96 (1980)."); <span class="Italic">Cabral v. DHHS</span>, 7 MSPR 372, 373 (1981) ("The prohibition against double jeopardy applies to criminal charges only."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Smith</span>, 116 MSPR 520, 523-24 &#x00B6; 9, 2011 MSPB 69 (2011) (Hatch Act complaint dismissed for lack of specificity: "It is well-settled that double jeopardy does not apply to administrative proceedings, and 'an agency can renew an adverse action based on charges brought in an earlier proceeding where the adverse action in that proceeding was invalidated on procedural grounds.' <span class="Italic">Steele v. General <span id="Page_3156"></span>Services Administration</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 368, 372 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Tezak v. Department of the Army</span>, 835 F.2d 871 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table); <span class="Italic">Shamblen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 620, 624 (1990).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of a double jeopardy argument, the Federal Circuit noted, <span class="Italic">Tawadrous v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 477 Fed. Appx. 735, 738-39 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Tawadrous's third argument concerns a June 2010 action by Treasury to remove him on the same charges that are at issue here. Mr. Tawadrous appealed that removal to the MSPB. About a month later, Treasury rescinded the removal and reinstated Mr. Tawadrous with back pay. The MSPB action was later declared moot. Months passed. In November 17, 2010, Treasury removed Mr. Tawadrous again, on the same charges as in the removal of the previous June. It was the November 2010 action that resulted in the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Tawadrous contends that it is unlawful for him to face two removal actions on the same charges. Like the Board, we disagree. This case does not invoke any unlawful "double jeopardy." <span class="Italic">Stevenson v. United States</span>, 155 Ct. Cl. 592, 597 (1961) ("'Double jeopardy' applies to criminal charges and these were in no sense charges of a criminal nature. In any event, it is not unusual in cases where a procedural error is committed, for the agency to begin again and take final valid action."). In <span class="Italic">Stevenson</span>, as here, the employee was removed from her position on a specific charge. The removal was subsequently undone; in <span class="Italic">Stevenson</span>, it was by order of the Civil Service Commission based on a procedural defect, while here it was by Treasury's voluntary action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 594. We therefore hold that, as in <span class="Italic">Stevenson</span>, there was no Fifth Amendment double jeopardy problem in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Though acknowledging that federal employment cases do not present a double jeopardy issue <span class="Italic">per se</span>, the Board has for a number of years held that, "[w]here an agency has imposed disciplinary or adverse action because of an employee's misconduct, it is barred from subsequently taking another adverse action for the same reason." <span class="Italic">Adamek v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 13 M.S.P.R. 224, 226 (1982). The roots of this doctrine predate the creation of this court. <span class="Italic">See McGhee v. Johnson</span>, 420 F.2d 445, 448 (10th Cir. 1969) (finding no <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> problem for federal employee whose previous attempted removal was reversed on procedural grounds); <span class="Italic">Jenkins v.

While the appellant's failure to clear the investigation was due in part to the same conduct that led to his prior discipline, the requirement that he clear a background investigation was not at issue in the first action. Moreover, we find no support for the appellant's contention that the agency conducted the background investigation in order to do an end run around the prohibition against double punishment.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from the WG-8 position of Pipe Fitter effective September 3, 2010, for misconduct. The appellant appealed the agency's action and, during proceedings, the parties entered into a last chance settlement agreement that provided in relevant part that the agency would hold the removal action in abeyance for 24 months, issue a 60-day suspension for the sustained charges, and subject the appellant to random urine and/or breath analyzer testing for alcohol. The agreement provided further that, if testing revealed that the appellant was under the influence of alcohol during the 24 months following the date of the agreement, the removal action would be effected based on the sustained charges and the appellant waived his right to appeal the removal action to the Board.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has petitioned for review. The agency has responded in opposition to the petition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the settlement agreement is invalid because it allows for a 60-day suspension and a removal based on the same misconduct. Outside of the context of a settlement agreement, the Board has long held that an agency cannot impose a disciplinary or adverse action more than once for the same misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Gartner v. Department of the Army</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6; 5 (2007); <span class="Italic">Anderson v.

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 13 M.S.P.R. 224, 226 (1982). The Board has analogized the rule to the prohibition against double punishment for the same crime in the criminal context, i.e., the prohibition against double jeopardy. The Board has stated that, although the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy applies only to defendants in criminal cases, and not to petitioners in administrative proceedings before the Board, an agency cannot impose a disciplinary or adverse action more than once for the same misconduct. <span class="Italic">Wigen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 381, 383 (1993). It appears, however, that the Board has not addressed whether the prohibition against imposing discipline more than once for the same misconduct may be waived in the context of a last chance settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is settled that an employee can waive significant statutory rights in a settlement agreement, including the right to appeal the adverse action that is at issue in the agreement. <span class="Italic">Ferby v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 451 (1985), was the first case in which the full Board addressed the question of whether the statutory right to appeal may be waived. The employees in <span class="Italic">Ferby</span> had executed "last chance" settlement agreements waiving their right to appeal the adverse actions and the Board enforced the agreements. The Board first noted that both the right to a hearing before the Board and the right to counsel in a criminal proceeding were susceptible to waiver if the waiver was the informed, intentional abandonment of a known right, free of any coercion or duress. <span class="Italic">Ferby</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. at 455. The Board then held that appellants could also knowingly and intentionally waive their right to appeal to the Board in a last chance settlement agreement if the terms of the waiver appear comprehensive, freely made, and fair, and there is no evidence that the execution of the agreement was in any way the result of duress or bad faith negotiation on the agency's part. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 456.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, in <span class="Italic">McCall v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 665, 668-69 (Fed. Cir. 1988), our reviewing court found that the Board properly may enforce an employee's waiver of his right to appeal a disciplinary action in a last chance settlement agreement. In <span class="Italic">McCall</span>, 839 F.2d at 666-67, the court relied on the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Town of Newton v. Rumery</span>, 480 U.S. 386 (1987). The issue in <span class="Italic">Rumery</span> was whether a court properly may enforce an agreement in which a criminal defendant releases his right to file a 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1983 action, i.e., an action alleging that town officers violated a defendant's constitutional rights by arresting him, defaming him, and imprisoning him falsely, in return for a prosecutor's dismissal of pending criminal charges. <span class="Italic">Rumery</span>, 380 U.S. at 386. The agreement at issue in <span class="Italic">Rumery</span> purported to waive a substantive right to sue conferred by a federal statute. The Court stated that the most important underlying question was whether the policies underlying that statute may in some circumstances render a waiver of the rights that it conferred unenforceable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 386, 392. The Court resolved this question by reference to the traditional common law principle that "a promise is unenforceable if the interest in its enforcement is outweighed in the circumstances by a public policy harmed by enforcement of the agreement." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 392. After weighing, among other things, whether the waiver was inherently coercive because of unequal bargaining positions, the Court held that the mere possibility of intimidation cannot justify invalidating all such agreements, noting that parties are often forced to make difficult choices which effectively waive statutory or even constitutional rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 393-94. An important consideration for the Court was that one entering into an agreement waiving an important right may be judging that the certain benefits of escaping a harsh alternative exceed other speculative benefits. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that last chance settlement agreements that waive both the right to appeal and the right not to be disciplined twice for the same offense are susceptible to the same analysis as the waiver of Board appeal rights discussed in <span class="Italic">Ferby</span> and <span class="Italic">McCall</span>, and the considerations of the Court in <span class="Italic">Rumery</span>. The appellant may be judging that the certain benefit of escaping removal and accepting a lesser penalty exceeds the speculative benefit that he might prevail in the removal appeal. Further, the incorporation of some discipline into the last chance settlement agreement makes it more likely that the agency will consider entering into the agreement because the employee will not escape all punishment for the charged offense. Thus, such settlement agreements advance the Board's policy that, in Board actions, as in civil actions, public policy favors settlement agreements, which serve to avoid unnecessary litigation and to encourage fair and speedy resolution of issues. <span class="Italic">Futrell-Rawls v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 322, &#x00B6; 8 (2010); <span class="Italic">Lee v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 236, &#x00B6; 3 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we find valid a last chance settlement agreement in which the appellant agreed to the following: discipline for the charged misconduct prior to being reinstated; removal for the same misconduct based on breach of the agreement; and waiver of his Board appeal rights if he is removed based on breach of the agreement. The Board can enforce such an agreement if it is lawful on its face, was freely entered into by the parties, and the subject matter of the appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Stewart v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 104, 107 (1997). Additionally, the waivers within the agreement must be clear, unequivocal, and decisive, comprehensive, freely made, fair, and the execution of the agreement must not be the result of duress or bad faith on the part of the agency. <span class="Italic">Lawrence v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 325, &#x00B6; 6, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 318 Fed. Appx. 895 (Fed. Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">Lockridge v.

We find that the administrative judge properly found that the last chance settlement agreement entered into by the parties to this appeal met these criteria, and we therefore reject the appellant's argument that the administrative judge improperly accepted an invalid agreement into the record for enforcement by the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's reviewing court affirmed, <span class="Italic">Cooper v. VA</span>, 515 Fed. Appx. 897, 900-01 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Cooper also argues, as he did before the Board, that the LCA is invalid because it improperly subjected him to two disciplinary actions for the same misconduct. But including a suspension as a term of an LCA is not a novel practice, <span class="Italic">see e.g., Jarman v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 144 F.3d 794, 795 (Fed. Cir. 1998), and the Board did not abuse its discretion or misstate the law by ruling that Mr. Cooper voluntarily waived his rights not to be subject to both a suspension and removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In fact, the 60-day suspension in this case was not actually a separate disciplinary event. The LCA contemplated only one adverse action: removal. It held the removal in abeyance and, in effect, limited the removal to a 60-day suspension for as long as Mr. Cooper abided by its terms. But if the DVA ultimately removed Mr. Cooper for violating the LCA, it would effect the original, and only, adverse action against him. <span id="Page_3158"></span>The Board in this case analogized the restriction against disciplining an employee twice to the constitutional bar against double jeopardy in the criminal context. We can extend that analogy by comparing Mr. Cooper's situation to that of a criminal offender on probation. A portion of the offender's sentence is suspended, pending his successful completion of certain requirements. Reinstating a probation violator's full sentence does not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy. <span class="Italic">United States v. DiFrancesco</span>, 449 U.S. 117, 137 (1980) ("[T]here is no double jeopardy protection against revocation of probation."). In this case, Mr. Cooper's removal under the LCA would not constitute a second adverse action. Therefore, the LCA did not violate Mr. Cooper's substantive right against repeated discipline, even if he had not waived it.</p>

The removal proposal embraced some periods of leave infractions that led to prior discipline. The Board solved the "double jeopardy" problem by essentially subtracting out from the leave-related charges those that were the subject of prior discipline, evaluating what was left, and sustaining the discharge:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was a GS-4 Medical Support Assistant with the agency's General Surgery Ward at the Winn Army Community Hospital in Fort Stewart, Georgia. Between December 15, 2004 and June 7, 2005, the agency counseled and disciplined the appellant for several leave-related violations, including her failure to timely report to duty and to follow leave requesting procedures, and her excessive use of unscheduled sick leave and leave without pay (LWOP). Following additional absences, the agency removed the appellant based on a charge of excessive absence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy applies only to defendants in criminal cases and not to petitioners in administrative proceedings before the Board, the Board has held that an agency cannot impose disciplinary or adverse action more than once for the same misconduct. <span class="Italic">Wigen v.

Upon reviewing the agency's proposed removal notice, we find that the agency erred by imposing discipline more than once for the same misconduct. The notice specifically stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">You are rarely at work. From January 9 to July 23 2005, you were gone as much as you were here. Of the potential 1080 hours of regular work hours, you were gone at least 515 of those hours. Since July 19, 2005, you have not been to work at all. When you are not here it places an extreme burden on the rest of our General Surgery/Urology staff whom must then do your job as well as their own job. We are very busy clinic seeing over 600 patients a month on average. When you do not show up for work, it results in delays in patient check-in, patient care, and appointment scheduling. Because your absences are unscheduled or of indefinite duration, it makes it impossible for us to hire someone to temporary fill your position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1 (grammar and punctuation as in original). The proposal notice specifically refers to the time frame from January 9 to July 23, and provides that, during this time frame, the appellant was absent at least 515 of 1080 regular work hours.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the agency submitted documentation below to demonstrate that the appellant had been officially disciplined on two occasions during this time period for leave-related issues. On March 17, the appellant received a letter of reprimand for, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, failing to follow leave procedures for her absence from January 12 to January 21, by failing to submit medical documentation to support her absence. On June 7, the agency suspended the appellant for five days for her failure to follow leave procedures for her absence on March 29, and her tardiness on April 6, and April 7, for which she was charged with absence without leave (AWOL). Because the notice of proposed removal does not exclude leave-related misconduct for which the appellant has already been disciplined, it is unclear whether the agency was attempting to impose a second round of discipline, at least in part, for the same misconduct. <span class="Italic">Wigen</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. at 383. Thus, we will not consider the appellant's absences from January 12-21, March 29, or April 6 and 7.</p>

Because these charges were dismissed by the court, he argues that the agency has already punished him for the attempted theft, and the agency's use of the same underlying charge as grounds for removal constitutes double jeopardy. The administrative judge properly found that the doctrine of double jeopardy is not applicable in this context. The Board has held that, while the principle of double jeopardy applies in criminal actions, it does not apply in administrative actions such as this one. <span class="Italic">See Rewald v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 34 MSPR 13, 16 (1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Nor is an agency precluded from taking protective measures prior to an adverse action, <span class="Italic">Villareal v. Bureau of Prisons</span>, 901 F.3d 1361, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2018), even if the employee suffers some economic loss:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Villareal's claim that he was subjected to double punishment--first, by his reassignment to the phone monitor position, where he lost overtime opportunities, and second, by his removal from the Bureau--lacks merit. Agencies often take steps, including reassignment, to solve problems created by employees. <span class="Italic">Jinks v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 627, 633 (2007). Reassignment in response to an alleged offense is consistent with the Master Agreement between the Bureau and Villareal's union. Moreover, while a reduction in pay is punitive, reassignment without a reduction in grade or pay is not. <span class="Italic">Jinks</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. at 633. Villareal does not allege that he was demoted or that his basic pay rate was reduced, only that he was denied the opportunity for overtime. However, premium pay, such as overtime, is not considered part of an employee's "pay" for purposes of disciplinary actions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(4). <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 807 F.2d 1577, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If successive disciplinary actions have different bases, although they may be related, they are not barred by the analogue to double jeopardy, <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, explained in <span class="Italic">Holst v. VA</span>, 298 Fed. Appx. 974, 976-77 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP), involving an incident that led to an attempt to remove the employee as unfit to carry a firearm that was needed for his job and then a demotion for misconduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the principal of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> did not preclude the agency from demoting Mr. Holst. "Under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, a judgment on the merits in a prior suit bars a second suit involving the same parties or their privies based on the same cause of action. '' <span class="Italic">Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore,</span> 439 U.S. 322, 327 n.5 (1979).

Jiffy Lube Int'l,</span> Inc., 474 F.3d 1298, 1304-05 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Accordingly, the demotion action is not barred unless it arose out of the same nucleus of operative facts as the previous removal appeal. It did not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial removal action was based on a determination that Mr. Holst was mentally unfit to carry a firearm. The Board considered factual allegations that were limited to the psychiatric reports and testimony related to Mr. Holst's mental stability and did not include the misconduct or insubordination during the meeting. The factual allegations in the current demotion action--i.e., allegations regarding Mr. Holst's insubordination--are therefore distinct from the factual allegations of the previous removal action--i.e., allegations regarding Mr. Holst's mental fitness. The agency was not prohibited from bringing the demotion action which is based on distinct factual allegations.</p>

Cir. 2013), <span class="Italic">post</span>), determined there was no impediment to suspension of a law enforcement officer for a problem that then led to a demotion based on a federal prosecutor's determination that the appellant could not testify in criminal proceedings because of credibility issues arising out of the problem leading to the initial discipline:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor has the appellant shown that the administrative judge erred in finding that he was not subjected to double punishment. The administrative judge correctly found that the appellant was suspended for 14 days in 2008 based on specific acts of misconduct but demoted based on the USAO's 2010 determination that he was unable to testify in criminal proceedings. The cases cited by the appellant in support of his claim of double punishment are all instances where the agency imposed a second disciplinary action, at least in part, on the same misconduct that formed the basis for an earlier disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Gartner v. Department of the Army</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 463 (2007) (leave-related infractions covered some of the same dates); <span class="Italic">Westbrook v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 149 (1997) (two charges and their underlying facts were the basis for two separate actions). Here, however, the basis for this demotion, the OASU's determination, had not occurred in 2008 and so could not have supported the earlier action. Thus, we discern no error in the administrative judge's finding that the appellant was not subjected to double punishment. <span class="Italic">See Harrison v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 26 M.S.P.R. 37, 39 (1985) (removal not barred by prior suspension that was effected on different basis).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Affirming the Board, <span class="Italic">Nguyen v. DHS</span>, 737 F.3d. 711, 713-19 (Fed. Cir. 2013), stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 24, 2008, the Agency sustained charges three through five. The deciding official found the first two charges were not "proven to [her] satisfaction." Rather than removing Mr. Nguyen, the deciding official chose to mitigate the proposed penalty to a fourteen-day suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">About two years later, in early 2010, the Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney ("AUSA") and the Deputy Chief AUSA asked Mr. Nguyen to complete a <span id="Page_3159"></span>form disclosing possible impeachment information. One question asked: "Have you been disciplined in the past?" Mr. Nguyen answered "yes," and provided a copy of the 2008 Notice of Proposed Removal, the fourteen-day suspension, and the OPR's investigation report. After examining this information, the Chief and Deputy Chief AUSAs told Mr. Nguyen that the impeachment concerns it raised prevented Mr. Nguyen from swearing out complaints or testifying.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 11, 2010, Mr. Nguyen sent an email to his supervising deportation officer at the Agency, explaining that he could no longer file complaints or appear before a grand jury. The next month, on July 16, 2010, the Chief AUSA sent a letter to the Agency, confirming that Mr. Nguyen could no longer "testify or declare under oath in our criminal prosecutions." The USAO Letter stated that Mr. Nguyen's responsibilities as a Deportation Officer required him to be "free of any findings or investigations" that impaired his credibility. It stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It has come to our attention that Officer Trong Nguyen was the subject of a 2007 investigation by the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Office of Professional Responsibility in which four allegations against him were substantiated, including a charge that Officer Nguyen had displayed a "lack of candor in a police investigation." That adverse finding unfortunately impairs Officer Nguyen's credibility as a witness. Accordingly, and notwithstanding our considerable regard and affection for Officer Nguyen, we must regretfully inform you that we cannot allow him to testify or declare under oath in our criminal prosecutions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following receipt of the USAO Letter, the Agency suspended Mr. Nguyen's authorization to carry a firearm on October 7, 2010. The Agency cited the USAO Letter and explained: "You will be provided with work that is administrative in nature which does not require that you be armed or may lead to you having to testify or swear under oath."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 8, 2010, the Agency issued a Notice of Proposed Removal for "Inability to Perform Full Range of Duties." The charge was based upon <span class="Italic">Giglio</span>, 405 U.S. at 150, in which the Supreme Court required prosecutors to disclose when a testifying officer may lack credibility. The Notice of Proposed Removal alleged that the USAO had found Mr. Nguyen was <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> impaired, thus preventing the USAO from using him as a witness in any criminal proceeding. The Agency said it could not "require or order the Department of Justice to use [Mr. Nguyen] as a witness."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official sustained the charge, but mitigated the proposed penalty of removal to a demotion to Detention and Removal Assistant. He rejected Mr. Nguyen's argument that the charge constituted impermissible double punishment for the same misconduct, stating he was neither "revisiting" the prior misconduct nor "using it as an aggravating factor." "The basis for this action is the [USAO Letter] issued by the Department of Justice and its impact upon [Mr. Nguyen's] ability to perform the full range of duties as a law enforcement officer."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Administrative Judge ("AJ") sustained the Agency's action, finding the Agency had proved that Mr. Nguyen was unable to perform the full range of his duties as a Deportation Officer. In particular, the AJ found that the USAO would not permit Mr. Nguyen to testify as a witness or make declarations under oath in federal criminal prosecutions, based on the USAO's <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> determination. Not only was Mr. Nguyen barred from testifying, but he was "no longer qualified to carry and/or discharge an agency firearm." Other coworkers thus had to take over these duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties' dispute in this case centers on the effect of the USAO's determination that Mr. Nguyen was <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> impaired and thus could not testify in criminal prosecutions. Mr. Nguyen argues the Agency was barred from taking adverse action in response to the USAO's <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> determination, because that determination was based on Mr. Nguyen's earlier misconduct. The Agency, in turn, argues that it had no authority to challenge the USAO's <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> determination, which was a separate and adequate basis for the Agency's adverse action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Giglio</span>, the Supreme Court held that criminal defendants have a due process right to be informed of evidence affecting a government witness's credibility. <span class="Italic">Giglio</span>, 405 U.S. at 154. It required that prosecutors establish procedures to ensure that such exculpatory evidence is identified and disclosed to the defendant.[3] <span class="Italic">Id.; see also Brady v. Maryland</span>, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963) (holding that suppression of material exculpatory evidence justifies a new trial "irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution"). Suppression of such impeachment evidence requires a new trial if it could "in any reasonable likelihood" have affected the jury's judgment. <span class="Italic">Giglio</span>, 405 U.S. at 154 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Ninth Circuit has applied <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> to hold that prosecutors must examine personnel files of a law enforcement witness they intend to call at trial for evidence affecting the witness's credibility. <span class="Italic">United States v. Henthorn</span>, 931 F.2d 29, 30-31 (9th Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">accord Milke v. Ryan</span>, 711 F.3d 998, 1003&#8722;07 (9th Cir. 2013).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Giglio</span>, the Supreme Court reversed a conviction and remanded for a new trial when the prosecutor did not disclose to the defendant that a government witness had been promised he would not be prosecuted if he cooperated with the government. 405 U.S. at 153&#8722;54.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The USAO is responsible for ensuring compliance with <span class="Italic">Giglio</span>, and is not required to rely on a law enforcement witness that it deems is <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> impaired. <span class="Italic">See Giglio</span>, 405 U.S. at 154 (stating that improper nondisclosure "is the responsibility of the prosecutor"); <span class="Italic">see also Kahn v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 528 F.3d 1336, 1340 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (characterizing <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> determinations as the prosecutor's responsibility). In this case, the USAO established procedures pursuant to <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> and <span class="Italic">Henthorn</span> requiring that Deportation Officers such as Mr. Nguyen must "be free of any findings or investigations that impair their credibility." The USAO found Mr. Nguyen was <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> impaired based on his admission during the OPR investigation that he made false statements to the police.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Agency lacked authority to force the USAO to allow Mr. Nguyen to testify or to otherwise challenge the USAO's <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> determination. <span class="Italic">See Doe v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 198, 205 (2003) (holding the Department of Homeland Security lacks authority over United States Attorney's Offices); <span class="Italic">cf. City of Arlington v. Fed. Commc'ns Comm'n</span>, 133 S. Ct. 1863, 1869 (2013) ("Both [agencies'] power to act and how they are to act is authoritatively prescribed by Congress."). The Agency thus had no obligation to pass judgment on the underlying merits of the USAO's finding. Rather, it was entitled to take action based on the undisputed effects of that finding--that Mr. Nguyen could no longer testify as a witness during prosecutions or make declarations under oath. The Board found this prohibition made Mr. Nguyen unable to perform the full range of his duties, and thus sustained the Agency's demotion. This finding is supported by substantial evidence. The Agency's position description for a Deportation Officer states that the officer, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "prepares documentation for Warrants of Arrest, Warrants of Deportation, Breaches of Bond, Demands of Surrender, Notices of Excludable Alien, etc.," and "[t]estifies on behalf of the [A]gency before Grand Juries." The USAO's <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> determination prevents Mr. Nguyen from performing these duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Nguyen argues the USAO's <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> determination "did not constitute a separate and distinct act of misconduct" and thus could not justify the Agency's adverse action. However, an adverse action need not be based on misconduct, but may be imposed "for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a). The Board did not err in holding the USAO's <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> determination made Mr. Nguyen unable to perform the duties of a Deportation Officer, and that demoting him to another position would "promote the efficiency of the service." <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Nguyen argues that, even if the Agency's decision is otherwise supported, it impermissibly subjected him to double punishment for the same misconduct. The Board has repeatedly held "an agency cannot impose disciplinary or adverse action more than once for the same misconduct." <span class="Italic">Gartner v. Dep't of Army</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 463, 466 (2007) (citing <span class="Italic">Wigen v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 58 M.S.P.R. 381, 383 (1993); <span class="Italic">Eichner v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 83 M.S.P.R. 202, &#x00B6; 17 (1999)). Mr. Nguyen does not argue that this court has ever held "double punishment" is impermissible. Rather, he says the Board has established a rule against double punishment, and argues that "'[a]n agency is obligated to follow precedent, and if it chooses to change, it must explain why.'" Pet'r's Br. 11 (quoting <span class="Italic">M.M. &#x0026; P. Mar. Advancement, Training, Educ. &#x0026; Safety Program v. Dep't of Commerce</span>, 729 F.2d 748, 754-55 (Fed. Cir. 1984)). Even if we were to assume Mr. Nguyen's premise that we should set aside Board decisions that are inconsistent with prior Board authority, the Board's decision in this case is consistent with its precedent prohibiting double punishment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found the 2011 demotion was based on the USAO's <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> determination, whereas the 2008 suspension was based on Mr. Nguyen's earlier misconduct in connection with the Sears refrigerator. This finding is supported by substantial evidence. In the 2011 action, the Agency charged only that the USAO had made an adverse <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> determination, and would not use Mr. Nguyen as a government witness in any criminal prosecution. For this reason, the Agency alleged Mr. Nguyen would be unable to "perform the full range of duties" of a Deportation Officer. It did not mention Mr. Nguyen's earlier misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to Mr. Nguyen, the Agency had already considered the possibility of <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> impairment in the 2008 action, so the USAO's later adverse <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> determination was not a justifiable basis to distinguish the 2011 adverse action. He argues: "In essence, the Agency chose to discipline [Mr. Nguyen] in 2011 after it re-examined its previous penalty determination for Petitioner's misconduct in light of the U.S. Attorney office's July 16, 2010 letter." However, as discussed above, the USAO, not the Agency, made the <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> determination forming the basis for the 2011 demotion. The Agency thus did not "reexamine" its earlier finding, but rather responded to the new development that Mr. Nguyen could no longer testify in criminal prosecutions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This situation is distinguishable from the cases Mr. Nguyen cites, where <span id="Page_3160"></span>an agency expressly based two separate disciplinary actions on the same misconduct. For instance, the Board found double punishment impermissible in <span class="Italic">Gartner</span>, where the agency removed Ms. Gartner for excessive absence based in part on absences for which she had already been disciplined. <span class="Italic">Gartner</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. at 466-67. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Westbrook v. Department of Air Force</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 149, 155 (1997), the agency imposed two separate suspensions--one for seven days and another for twenty-three days--to discipline Mr. Westbrook for the same act of misusing his government-owned vehicle.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is distinguishable. "[n]o <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> impairment issue was raised by the USAO" in the 2008 action, whereas the 2011 action was based on the USAO's finding that Mr. Nguyen was <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> impaired. In sustaining the charges, the Agency did not impliedly rely on the underlying misconduct. Mr. Nguyen argues that "the very fact that the misconduct was viewed in a new way or was labeled as a different offense does not relieve the Agency of the prohibition against disciplining an employee twice for the same misconduct." He relies on the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Adamek v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 13 M.S.P.R. 224, 225-26 (1982), where the agency removed Mr. Adamek for "failure to meet the essential requirements of his position," and charged in the notice two incidents of unauthorized absence for which Mr. Adamek had been previously disciplined. In contrast, the Agency in this case demoted Mr. Nguyen because he could no longer testify or swear out complaints, not because of the earlier misconduct. The second adverse action was not based on the same misconduct as the earlier 2008 action, and is not inconsistent with the Board's cases prohibiting double punishment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Mr. Nguyen argues the Agency violated his right to due process by denying him a meaningful opportunity to respond to the charges brought against him. A federal employee contesting an adverse action has the right to notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Erickson</span>, 522 U.S. 262, 266 (1998) (citing <span class="Italic">Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 542 (1985)). Mr. Nguyen argues he "had no opportunity to contest the determination of the U.S. Attorney's office," and that the Agency therefore "deprived him of his fundamental right to due process of law by failing to provide him a meaningful opportunity to oppose his demotion." He says the Agency should have provided an "opportunity to confront the official to whom the Agency ceded responsibility," namely, the Chief AUSA who was responsible for the USAO letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Agency provided Mr. Nguyen with the opportunity to contest his demotion. It notified him of the proposed removal and gave him thirty days to reply to the deciding official. Mr. Nguyen obtained counsel and responded orally to the deciding official, who mitigated the proposed removal to a demotion.[6] The Agency was not authorized to alter or challenge the USAO's <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> determination, and thus was not required to hear testimony by the Chief AUSA regarding the basis for that decision. The only question for the Agency was whether the USAO's <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> determination made Mr. Nguyen unable to fulfill the requirements of his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The Agency also heard Mr. Nguyen's arguments challenging the USAO's <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> determination. In particular, Mr. Nguyen's counsel argued "that the U.S. Attorney...is proceeding on false--on false information. I don't think you can impeach a person for allegations that were brought against him that were found not to be substantiated."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This situation is analogous to cases where a third-party agency revokes a credential or qualification necessary to perform the employee's position. In such cases, the Board takes the independent agency's action at face value, and reviews the employing agency's response to that action. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Shoffner v. Department of the Interior</span>, 9 M.S.P.R. 265, 267 (1981), the agency removed Mr. Shoffner for failing to remain qualified for his position as a Hydrologic Technician due to a one-year revocation of his driver's license. The Board did not consider whether or not the revocation was correct, but rather reasoned that removal was appropriate because Mr. Shoffner "could no longer operate a government motor vehicle because the possession of a valid state motor vehicle operator's license was a prerequisite to the operation of the government vehicle." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This made Mr. Shoffner unable to perform his duties as a Hydrologic Technician, "which required driving a vehicle alone approximately 1,000 miles per month." <span class="Italic">Id.; see also Penland v. Dep't of Interior</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 474, 476 (2010) (affirming the agency's removal of a pilot who failed to maintain his pilot authorization).[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;This case differs from situations where the agency itself decides to revoke a necessary credential. In those cases, the Board typically reviews the underlying decision to, e.g., revoke medical certification or procurement authority. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., McGillivray v. Fed. Emerg. Mgmt. Agency</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 398 (1993) (agency revoked procurement authority); <span class="Italic">Siegert v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 684 (1988) (agency revoked clinical privileges); <span class="Italic">Cosby v. Fed. Aviation Admin</span>., 30 M.S.P.R. 16 (1986) (agency revoked medical certification); <span class="Italic">but see Kaplan v. Conyers</span>, No. 2011-3207, 2013 WL 4417583, (Fed. Cir. Aug. 20, 2013) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (Board lacks jurisdiction to review agency's finding that an employee is ineligible to occupy noncritical sensitive position).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Nguyen argues that this case is not analogous to a licensing situation, because his position does not require a license. Additionally, unlike the public standards for obtaining a driver's license, Mr. Nguyen argues the USAO's n <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> determination "is devoid of any objective standard and stands essentially without sufficient articulation or explanation." However, Mr. Nguyen's position as a Deportation Officer expressly requires testifying and swearing out complaints, and the USAO's <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> determination prevents him from performing these duties. As in third-party licensing situations, the Agency lacks authority to contest the USAO's decision. The Board did not err in holding the Agency did not violate Mr. Nguyen's due process rights.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">In a somewhat cryptic opinion <span class="Italic">Anderson v. USPS</span>, 24 MSPR 488, 491 (1984), suggested that an agency should not, based on the same conduct, suspend an individual during the notice period of an adverse and initiate adverse action against the employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In our view, and as indicated in <span class="Italic">Cuellar</span>, 5 USC 7513 does not envision a suspension action during the notice period of a removal action. The "crime exception" of 7513(b)(1) adequately provides for those situations in which an employee must be separated from the agency premises quickly by permitting a shortened notice period in any adverse action where "there is reasonable cause to believe the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed." Since an agency may institute a removal action on shortened notice where it has such "reasonable cause to believe," the emergency suspension is extraneous. The Board concludes that an agency may not effect both a suspension during the notice period preceding a removal action and a removal action where an agency has "reasonable cause to believe." Such action is not envisioned in 7513, and once disciplinary or adverse action is imposed because of an employee's misconduct an agency is barred from subsequently taking another adverse action for the same reason.... We re-emphasize, however, that an agency may shorten the notice period of the ultimate adverse action itself under the "crime exception" of 7513(b)(1), and place the employee in a nonduty status with pay for up to ten days while processing that action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 752.404(d)(1); <span class="Italic">Martel v. Department of Transportation</span>, 15 MSPR 141, 146-47 n.3 (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 735 F.2d 504 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the agency placed appellant on emergency suspension during the notice period of the removal action and subsequently effected his removal for the same act of misconduct for which he was suspended. In view of our discussion, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, such action is not permitted under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 and our decisions in <span class="Italic">Cuellar</span> and <span class="Italic">Adamek.</span> Therefore, the suspension action may not be sustained because it is "not in accordance with law." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c) (2)(C); <span class="Italic">Cuellar,</span> 8 MSPB at 287.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An "emergency" suspension after a misconduct inquiry is complete, followed by removal based on the same facts as the suspension, resulted in reversal of the removal as double discipline for a single offense, <span class="Italic">Liberty v. USPS</span>, AT-0752-12-0214-I-1 (NP 9/26/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3161"></span>As the administrative judge found, the Board has long held that an agency may not discipline an employee more than once for the same misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Westbrook v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 149, 155 (1997); <span class="Italic">Adamek v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 13 M.S.P.R. 224, 226 (1982). A "suspension," which is an adverse action under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, is defined as "the placing of an employee, for disciplinary reasons, in a temporary status without duties and pay." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7501(2). There is no dispute that the agency placed the appellant in a temporary status without duties and pay for 14 days before proposing his removal and effecting his reduction in grade. The issues, therefore, are whether that placement in a temporary status was based on the same misconduct as the subsequent reduction in grade and was "for disciplinary reasons."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency indicated that its placement of the appellant in a nonduty, nonpay status was due to his "alleged Improper Conduct--Entering False Clock Rings in TACS." Similarly, the proposed removal, which the deciding official effected as a reduction in grade, was based on a charge of "Improper Conduct" supported by four specifications that charge the appellant with inputting incorrect overtime and clock rings. Rauchle, who both placed the appellant in a nonduty, nonpay status and proposed his removal, testified that he relied upon the same sources--the OIG report and the appellant's responses during an investigative interview--in taking both actions. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's placement in a nonduty, nonpay status and his reduction in grade were for the same alleged misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the agency's first action constituted a suspension because it was "for disciplinary reasons." In <span class="Italic">Thomas v. General Services Administration</span>, 756 F.2d 86, 88 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the court noted that Congress, in enacting the definition of "suspension" in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, indicated that it intended to enact the definition previously adopted by the Civil Service Commission in its policy issuances. The Civil Service Commission had defined "suspension" as "an action placing an employee in a temporary non-duty and non-pay status for disciplinary reasons <span class="Italic">or for other reasons pending inquiry</span>." <span class="Italic">Id.; see Martin v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 12 M.S.P.R. 12, 17 (1982), <span class="Italic">aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds sub nom. Brown v. Department of Justice</span>, 715 F.2d 662 (D.C. Cir. 1983), and <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Otherson v. Department of Justice</span>, 728 F.2d 1513 (D.C. Cir. 1984), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds by Barresi v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 656, 663 n.5 (1994). The court noted that a suspension can fall within the normal meaning of "discipline," i.e., punishment intended as a sanction for improper conduct. <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, 756 F.2d at 88. The court also held that a suspension may be "disciplinary" in the broader sense of maintaining the orderly working of government against "possible disruption by the suspended employee" and noted that an accepted meaning of the noun "discipline" reflects a concept of maintaining order. <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, 756 F.2d at 89. As set forth below, we find that the agency's placement of the appellant in a nonduty, nonpay status was "disciplinary" as punishment intended for improper conduct. Thus, his reduction in grade was a prohibited double punishment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserted that its action placing the appellant in a nonduty, nonpay status was "due to" improper conduct, specifically, entering false clock rings in TACS. <span class="Italic">Cf. Thomas</span>, 756 F.2d at 88 ("If the agency suspended petitioner simply because of his objective conduct--without regard to the possible source of that conduct in some psychiatric condition--the suspension plainly had a disciplinary base."). The agency did not, by contrast, specify that the action was "due to" any belief on its part that the appellant would commit similar clock ring falsification in the future. Moreover, the agency did not clearly notify the appellant that additional discipline based on the same or different misconduct would be forthcoming after he served the 14-day suspension. Instead, the agency informed him that the suspension was appealable to a specified agency official, thereby suggesting that the action was, in fact, punishment. As set forth above, before the agency imposed the 14-day suspension, its year-long investigation of the appellant's alleged misconduct had been conducted, an investigative report had been completed, and an interview of the appellant had taken place. There was, therefore, no further information that the agency needed to receive before punishing the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the ELM section upon which the agency relied suggests that the authority for such suspensions must be based on improper conduct and any disruption that has already occurred. That section provides, in relevant part,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[a]n employee may be placed in an off-duty nonpay status immediately but remains on the rolls when he or she (a) exhibits characteristics of impairment due to alcohol, drugs or other intoxicant, (b) fails to observe safety rules, (c) fails to obey a direct order, (d) provides reason to be deemed potentially injurious to self or others, or (e) disrupts day-to-day postal operations in any other way.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, despite the ELM's reference to an "emergency" suspension, the authority upon which the agency relied only permitted the suspension when misconduct had already occurred and did not focus on a possibility of future misconduct or disruption. Based on all of the above factors, we find that the suspension in this case is more akin to a disciplinary punishment than to an action taken to maintain the orderly working of the agency against possible disruption.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is therefore distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Bradley</span> and <span class="Italic">Harrison v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 37 (1985). In <span class="Italic">Bradley</span>, the agency placed the appellant on emergency nonduty, nonpay status for 12 days pursuant to Article 16.7 of the National Agreement between the agency and the national Postal Mail Handlers Union, which provided that "[a]n employee may be immediately placed on an off duty status (without pay) by the Employer, but remains on the rolls where...the employee may be injurious to self or others." 96 M.S.P.R. 539, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 13. The agency informed the appellant that he would remain in an off-duty status except for the time necessary to complete and conduct an investigative interview. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 2. The agency subsequently suspended the appellant for 14 days for unacceptable conduct in connection with the same incident underlying the emergency suspension, including cursing a supervisor, refusing to obey the supervisor, daring the supervisor to hit him, and telling the supervisor to go ahead and call the police. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4, 15. The Board found that the reasons for the two actions were not the same and that there was, therefore, no jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13, 17. In so finding, the Board noted that the agency relied upon Article 16.7, which</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">was invoked to protect [the appellant], his co-workers, his supervisors, and the agency's interests. The agency's action [the original suspension] was not a disciplinary action itself, but was consistent with an emergency suspension taken pending an investigation and a further decision as to whether or not discipline would be issued for the incident.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 14 (record citation omitted). Because the original 12-day suspension under Article 16.7 and the subsequent 14-day suspension had "different bases," the Board held that there was no double punishment and no jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15, 17. Here, by contrast, the agency's investigation and investigative interview had already taken place before it suspended the appellant for 14 days, and the agency relied upon an ELM provision that, unlike Article 16.7, did not establish that such action was clearly designed to prevent future disruption.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Harrison</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. at 38-39, the agency suspended the appellant for a period not to exceed 14 days because of the nature of the allegations against him, namely, submitting false information in order to receive unemployment benefits that he was not entitled to receive. The agency then removed the appellant based on charges of submitting false information in order to receive unemployment benefits that he was not entitled to receive. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 38. The Board held that the suspension notice letter clearly stated that a further decision on whether the appellant would be disciplined for those misdeeds would be forthcoming in the near future and that the agency, therefore, did not consider the suspension to be in lieu of the contemplated disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 39. The Board concluded that the appellant was not actually punished twice for the same offense because the suspension had a different basis than the removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Unlike <span class="Italic">Harrison</span>, the agency in this case did not clearly state at the time of the suspension that a further decision on whether the appellant would be disciplined would be forthcoming. Rather, as set forth above, the agency based the 14-day suspension upon misconduct that had occurred and had been investigated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, under the particular facts of this case, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency's decision to reduce the appellant in grade improperly imposed additional discipline based on misconduct for which he had already been suspended. Therefore, the reduction in grade cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">See Westbrook</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. at 155; <span class="Italic">Adamek</span>, 13 M.S.P.R. at 226.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson v. USPS</span>, 24 MSPR 488 (1984) (emergency suspension and removal on an assault charge; "once disciplinary or adverse action is imposed because of an employee's misconduct an agency is barred from subsequently taking another adverse action for the same reason," relying on <span class="Italic">Adamek v. USPS</span>, 13 MSPR 224, 226 (1982)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The difficulties of parsing the effect of an indefinite suspension during the notice period on a removal for the same conduct that resulted in the suspension were addressed in <span class="Italic">Dawson v. USDA</span>, 121 MSPR 495, 499-500 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7, 2014 MSPB 67 (2014) (Member Robbins concurring), where the appellant was investigated for fraud; then proposed for indefinite suspension; then pled guilty; then was indefinitely suspended; then, a month or so after the indefinite suspension began, was issued as a removal proposal; and, a month later, was removed. Reversing the AJ, who concluded it was improper for the agency to impose an emergency or indefinite suspension that coincides with a notice period for a removal action, the Board declared:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...It is true that, at times, the Board has held that, where an agency imposes a disciplinary or an adverse action because of an employee's misconduct, the agency is barred from subsequently taking another adverse action for the same reason. However, the precedent relied upon <span id="Page_3162"></span>by the administrative judge in the initial decision has not been universally applied by the Board or even by our reviewing court. <span class="Italic">See Graybill v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 782 F.2d 1567, 1573 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (the court held that the agency's imposition of both a suspension and a removal penalty for the appellant's arrest on charges of sexual misconduct involving a minor and his subsequent guilty plea did not constitute an abuse of discretion); <span class="Italic">Camaj v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 95 (2012) (the agency indefinitely suspended the appellant based on criminal charges and then removed him on charges of conduct unbecoming a law enforcement officer and misuse of an official government database); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 398, 402 (1995) (the appellant was to be indefinitely suspended through the end of the criminal proceedings and "through any proposal period for any additional action" to be taken against the appellant). Relying on the case law cited immediately above, we find that the administrative judge's reason for reversing the indefinite suspension was erroneous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, we find that the appellant is not entitled to back pay for the more than 3 weeks of the indefinite suspension period (November 24--December 18, 2012), that transpired before the agency issued the notice of proposed removal because no overlap occurred with the two disciplinary actions during those 3 weeks.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reference to the AJ's decision in <span class="Italic">Dawson v. USDA</span>, AT-0752-13-0217-I-1 (Initial Decision of March 6, 2013), provides his reasoning:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's indefinite suspension can also be reversed on another basis. A long line of Board cases holds that the statutory provisions governing adverse actions do not envision suspending an employee during the notice period of an adverse action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fiori v. United States Postal Service</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 278, 282 (2006); <span class="Italic">Cox-Vaughn v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 246, 254 (2005); <span class="Italic">Clark v. United States Postal Service</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 634, 639 (1992); <span class="Italic">Anderson v. United States Postal Service</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 488, 490-91 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 776 F.2d 1060 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table); <span class="Italic">Cuellar v. United States Postal Service</span>, 8 M.S.P.R. 624, 630 (1981). Under this line of cases, the Board has repeatedly reversed indefinite suspensions that coincided with the notice period of an adverse action based on the same conduct, reasoning that such indefinite suspensions are not in accordance with law and, therefore, cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Cox-Vaughn</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. at 255; <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 639-40; <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. at 491.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the appellant's indefinite suspension coincided with the notice period of his proposed removal for the same misconduct. Thus, the indefinite suspension was not in accordance with law. Consequently, the appellant's indefinite suspension must be reversed. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701 (c)(2)(C); <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. at 639; <span class="Italic">Stephen</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. at 683-84.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">From the discussion in the decisions of the Board and the AJ in <span class="Italic">Dawson</span>, what can be concluded? The Board did not overrule the cases cited by the AJ and it did not go to any effort to distinguish them. But the Board's decision at least offers a result.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an unusual situation, an agency violated the prohibition against double jeopardy or double penalties for the same offense when it imposed consecutive indefinite suspensions for the same underlying, allegedly criminal, conduct in <span class="Italic">Frederick v. DHS</span>, 122 MSPR 401, 405-12 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-16, 2015 MSPB 11 (2015). The first indefinite suspension was imposed and relied upon an internal investigation. As a result of an intervening Board decision, the agency issued a second proposed indefinite suspension based on what the agency cited as a reasonable belief that the appellant committed a crime supporting a sentence of imprisonment. The agency then issued a decision based on the charge and specification in the earlier indefinite suspension. Of passing interest, although not noted by the Board, is the nature of an indefinite suspension: a measure to protect the government rather than to punish the appellant, bringing into possible question whether a prohibition against duplicate punishment ought to apply to indefinite suspensions. That consideration notwithstanding, <span class="Italic">Federick</span> explained the principles of prohibited double punishment, as it reversed the second indefinite suspension of Mr. Frederick:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is a well-established principle of civil service law that an agency may not discipline an employee twice for the same misconduct. <span class="Italic">Westbrook v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 149, 155 (1997) (citing <span class="Italic">Adamek</span>, 13 M.S.P.R. at 226). Under this principle, an agency cannot rely upon employee misconduct that formed the basis of a prior disciplinary or adverse action when imposing a subsequent disciplinary or adverse action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gartner v. Department of the Army</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6 (2007) (declining to consider absences cited in support of a proposed removal that were the basis of a prior letter of reprimand); <span class="Italic">Westbrook</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. at 155 (reversing a 23-day suspension because it relied on the same two charges and underlying facts that were the sole basis for a prior 7-day suspension); <span class="Italic">Adamek</span>, 13 M.S.P.R. at 226 (where an agency has imposed a disciplinary or adverse action because of an employee's misconduct, it is barred from subsequently taking another adverse action for the same reason).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his remand initial decision, the administrative judge found that the agency's indefinite suspension actions were based upon different reasons and covered different periods of time and thus did not violate the prohibition against double punishment. Upon reviewing the agency's letters of decision imposing the two indefinite suspensions, however, we find that the facts contained within the specifications supporting the agency's decisions are the same, and we conclude that the agency was therefore precluded from imposing the second indefinite suspension. Additionally, we are not convinced by the rationale offered by the administrative judge that the bar against double punishment was not violated in this case because the indefinite suspensions covered separate periods of time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon comparing the agency's letters of decision, we find that the only difference between the agency's indefinite suspension actions is the stated reasons for imposing each action, which is to say that the charges the agency relied upon in its letters of decision are different. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> I-2, IAF, Tab 10 at 21-24 (first indefinite suspension based on the pending agency investigation), <span class="Italic">with</span> I-1, IAF, Tab 5, Subtab 4a (second indefinite suspension based upon a reasonable belief of the appellant's commission of a crime). A comparison of the charges an agency brings against an employee, however, is not determinative of whether the appellant has been subjected to double punishment for the same misconduct. Rather, to ascertain whether an employee has been disciplined twice for the same misconduct, the Board must look to the factual specifications supporting the charges levied against an employee, i.e., the underlying "cause" relied upon by the agency for taking the disciplinary or adverse action.[4] <span class="Italic">See Gonzalez,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6; 10 ("cause" under section 7513(a) generally connotes some specific act or omission on the employee's part that warrants disciplinary action); <span class="Italic">Westbrook,</span> 77 M.S.P.R. at 155 (explaining that an agency may not discipline an employee twice for the same misconduct). An agency cannot avoid the prohibition against double punishment by relying on different charges in effecting separate disciplinary or adverse actions if the charges are based on the same underlying factual specification.[5] <span class="Italic">See Gartner,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 6 (excessive absences and failure to follow leave procedures).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Such factual predicates could be contained in a specification, in narrative format, or a combination thereof. <span class="Italic">See Alvarado v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 389, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;This situation differs from one in which an agency relies on the same specification in support of two or more separate charges in a single proposed disciplinary or adverse action. In that case, the employee is only subjected to a single disciplinary or adverse action, and the Board's prohibition against double punishment is not triggered. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Shifflett v. Department of Justice</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 289, &#x00B6; 5 (2005) (finding that, while an agency may take a single instance of misconduct and prepare charges containing several specifications, the Board will merge charges if they are based on the same conduct and proof of one charge automatically constitutes proof of the other charge). This is analogous to double jeopardy in criminal cases, which prohibits multiple prosecutions for the same offense but does not prohibit prosecutors from filing multiple charges against defendants for the same course of purportedly criminal conduct. <span class="Italic">See Blockburger v. United States</span>, 284 U.S. 299, 300-03 (1932) (the Supreme Court found that "the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one is whether each provision requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The following cases confirm this principle. In <span class="Italic">Gartner</span>, the Board declined to consider certain dates in a notice of proposed removal which had already served as the factual basis for a prior disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">See Gartner</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6; 6. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Westbrook</span>, the Board found that an agency could not suspend an employee a second time after it had previously suspended him for 7 days based upon the same factual specifications. <span class="Italic">See Westbrook</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. at 155. Conversely, in <span class="Italic">Williams v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 54, 58 (1987), the Board explained that related charges must "depend on different facts," such as when the agency's charges of absence without leave and falsification were based upon different acts of misconduct--the failure to provide documentation for absences versus statements made in response to a proposed suspension--the imposition of separate disciplinary actions did not amount to double punishment. Finally, in <span class="Italic">Nguyen v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 737 F.3d 711, 717 (Fed. Cir. 2013), our reviewing court affirmed the Board's determination that the agency did not subject the employee to double punishment when it demoted him based upon the Department of Justice's determination that he was <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> impaired even though his employing agency had previously disciplined him for the underlying misconduct leading to the <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> determination. Relying on this line of Board authority, the court held that the agency did not subject the employee to double punishment because the first adverse action was based on the employee's substantive misconduct and the second adverse action was based on the separate, independent conclusion that the employee was <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> impaired. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (holding that the <span id="Page_3163"></span>agency did not impliedly discipline the appellant a second time for the same reason cited in its prior disciplinary action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we find that a comparison of the charges the agency relied upon in its letters of decision does not resolve whether the appellant was subjected to double punishment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, B-2, PFR File, Tab 3 at 9 (the agency's argument that the indefinite suspension actions were imposed for different reasons).[7] Instead, we find that because the factual specifications relied upon by the agency in support of both adverse actions are substantially similar--the issuance of a warrant for the appellant's arrest in February 2010 for intentionally intercepting a wire, oral, or electronic communication of supervisor P.C. on or about July 7, 2009--the agency effected two adverse actions for the same reason and therefore subjected the appellant to double punishment.[8] <span class="Italic">See Westbrook</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. at 155; <span class="Italic">Adamek</span>, 13 M.S.P.R. at 226.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;In opposition to the appellant's petition for review, the agency relies on <span class="Italic">Wigen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 381, 384 (1993). Similar to the decisions discussed above, however, in <span class="Italic">Wigen</span>, the Board found that the agency did not violate the bar against double punishment when it brought two charges stemming from two acts of misconduct. <span class="Italic">Wigen</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. at 385 (explaining that the employee was first disciplined for his unscheduled absence and separately disciplined for falsifying medical documentation in connection with his unscheduled absence for which he was previously disciplined). Differing from <span class="Italic">Wigen</span>, however, the agency in this case relied upon essentially the same specification in support of both indefinite suspensions; <span class="Italic">Wigen</span> thus does not support sustaining the second indefinite suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Any affect <span class="Italic">Gonzalez</span> might have on the validity of the agency's first indefinite suspension does not alter our finding that the agency took two adverse actions against the appellant based on the same factual specification. Because the appellant did not file a timely appeal challenging the merits of the agency's first indefinite suspension action, the merits of that action are not properly before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching our conclusion, we acknowledge that the agency cited both its pending internal investigation and the issuance of the warrant for the appellant's arrest in the specification supporting its first notice of proposed indefinite suspension and that it also expressly disclaimed any reliance on the reasonable cause provision of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1) in reaching its decision regarding that suspension. In his letter of decision imposing the first indefinite suspension, however, the deciding official only cited to the issuance of the warrant for the appellant's arrest, and, in his letter of decision imposing the second indefinite suspension, the deciding official similarly cited the fact that the appellant had been criminally charged with a felony for covertly taping a conversation with P.C. The Board will review only the reasoning relied upon by the agency in support of its decision to impose an adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Rodriguez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 188, &#x00B6; 9 (2011). We find that, once the agency cited and relied upon the issuance of the warrant for the appellant's arrest in its first decision to impose an indefinite suspension, it was precluded from citing and relying upon this same factual specification a second time even though the charge relied upon by the agency in the second indefinite suspension differed from the charge supporting the first indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">See Gartner</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6; <span class="Italic">Westbrook</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. at 155; <span class="Italic">Adamek</span>, 13 M.S.P.R. at 226.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that the appellant's indefinite suspensions covered different periods of time does not change our conclusion that the agency subjected the appellant to double punishment. In reaching his decision below, the administrative judge relied on the fact that the periods of time the appellant was placed on indefinite suspension ran consecutively and did not overlap. <span class="Italic">See</span> RID at 4 ("The 1st Indefinite Suspension lasted from June 10, 2010 until March 26, 2011, when it ended. The 2nd Indefinite Suspension then covered the period from March 26, 2011 to the present."). Whether the appellant's indefinite suspension periods overlapped, however, is not relevant to whether the agency subjected the appellant to multiple disciplinary or adverse actions based upon the same factual specification. Regardless of when, or for how long, the appellant was penalized, both of the disciplinary actions imposed by the agency were based upon essentially the same factual specification, i.e., the issuance of the warrant for the appellant's arrest, and the agency was precluded from taking a second adverse action based on the same factual specification cited in support of its first indefinite suspension.[9] <span class="Italic">See Gartner</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6; 5; <span class="Italic">Westbrook</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. at 155; <span class="Italic">Adamek</span>, 13 M.S.P.R. at 226.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;Our analysis would be no different if the agency, for example, suspended the appellant for 7 days in June of 2010, and then suspended him for 14 days in March of 2011 based on the same factual specification. Similar to the instant case, the fact that the appellant would have been suspended for different periods of time that did not overlap would not have avoided the prohibition against double punishment. Our conclusion in this case would be different, however, if the agency cited different periods of time addressing different employee misconduct in its factual specifications supporting each of its adverse actions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bowen v. Department of the Navy</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 607, &#x00B6; 13 (2009) (finding that a letter of reprimand for misconduct committed on March 6, 2008, was distinguishable from a removal proposal based on insubordinate conduct on different dates in February and March of 2008), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 402 F. App'x 521 (Fed. Cir. 2010). The agency, however, did not rely on differing factual specifications in imposing the indefinite suspensions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In rendering our decision, we emphasize that an agency is not precluded from indefinitely suspending an employee based upon reasonable cause to believe he has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment could be imposed and thereafter proposing to remove him based upon either his subsequent criminal conviction or his underlying misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Campbell v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 691, 694-95 (1986) (explaining that based upon the resolution of the criminal proceedings, the agency must either promptly return the employee to duty or proceed expeditiously to take further administrative action), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 833 F.2d 1024 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table). Our cases addressing such situations emphasize that the cause for an employee's indefinite suspension is the reasonable belief that the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment is possible and that the cause for removing him from federal service thereafter is either proof of his subsequent criminal conviction or proof that he engaged in the substantive misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Dalton v. Department of Justice</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 429, 435-36 (1995) (the eventual resolution of the criminal charge is irrelevant to whether the indefinite suspension was properly imposed); <span class="Italic">see also Rittgers v. Department of the Army</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 182, &#x00B6; 12 (2011) (an indefinite suspension based on the crime exception does not generally involve a determination on the merits of the alleged misconduct or any criminal charge); <span class="Italic">Rawls v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 98, &#x00B6; 13 (2004) (citing <span class="Italic">Engdahl v. Department of the Navy</span>, 900 F.2d 1572, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1990) ("the [agency] acted within reasonable time periods in considering, proposing, and finalizing his removal" after the appellant pled guilty)), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 179 F. App'x 693 (Fed. Cir. 2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, our decision in this matter does not undermine the longstanding practice of an agency citing to an employee's past discipline as an aggravating factor in determining the reasonableness of a penalty under <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280 (1981). <span class="Italic">See Adamek</span>, 13 M.S.P.R. at 226 n.* (an agency is not barred from using the same action in determining the severity of the penalty to be imposed in a subsequently-initiated adverse action based on a different incident of misconduct). Additionally, nothing in our decision should be read as preventing an agency from cancelling a prior adverse action and reissuing the adverse action in "an entirely new and constitutionally correct" proceeding. <span class="Italic">Seeler v. Department of the Interior</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 10 (2012) (quoting <span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274, 1279 (Fed. Cir. 2011)). Under these circumstances, the bar against double punishment is not violated because the agency has rescinded its prior adverse action, made the employee whole, and commenced an "entirely new" constitutionally correct proceeding, thus negating the first disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the agency relied upon the same factual predicate in support of both decisions to indefinitely suspend the appellant. Because the agency had already indefinitely suspended the appellant on June 10, 2010, based upon the issuance of a warrant for his arrest, we find that the bar against double punishment precluded the agency from imposing a second indefinite suspension based upon this same factual specification. The appellant's second indefinite suspension action is therefore NOT SUSTAINED.</p>
