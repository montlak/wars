<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-154"><span class="space">5.</span> Delay in Refiling After DWOP</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appellant does not file an appeal on time, it may be dismissed as untimely if no good cause is provided for the delay. If the appellant timely files the appeal but does not refile the appeal on time after entry of a DWOP, the refiled appeal could be subject to dismissal as untimely if no good cause is provided for the delay, although the somewhat uncertain trend in the law is to excuse very brief refilings delays after DWOPs when it is clear that the appellant intended to pursue the case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The analysis applied by the Board to a belated refiling of a DWOP'd appeal was provided in <span class="Italic">Nelson v. USPS</span>, 113 MSPR 644, 647-49 &#x00B6; 8, 2010 MSPB 96 (2010) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Nelson v. MSPB</span>, 414 Fed. Appx. 292 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP)), involving a DWOP pending adjudication of concurrent criminal proceedings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has repeatedly held that its dismissal without prejudice practice should not become a trap to deny an appellant the opportunity to have his case decided on the merits. <span class="Italic">See Jaramillo v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 244, &#x00B6; 6 (2007); <span class="Italic">Hodges v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 212, &#x00B6; 11 (2006); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 302, &#x00B6; 10 (2001); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 417, &#x00B6; 8 (2000). Accordingly, it has identified specific standards applicable to determining whether good cause exists for excusing an untimely refiled appeal of a matter previously dismissed without prejudice pending the resolution of criminal proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Gaddy v. Department of the Navy,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 485, &#x00B6; 13 (2005). These include the following: the appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status; the timeliness of the initial appeal; the appellant's demonstrated intent throughout the proceedings to refile the appeal; the length of the delay in refiling; confusion surrounding and arbitrariness of the refiling deadline; the number of prior dismissals without prejudice; the agency's failure to object to the dismissal without prejudice; and the lack of prejudice to the agency in allowing the refiled appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Further, in <span class="Italic">Jaramillo,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 244, the Board noted its policy to stay its proceedings when criminal proceedings involving the same matter are pending. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 7. Although the administrative judge did not apply the appropriate analysis to the refiled appeal in this case, the error did not affect the outcome, and, therefore, is not grounds for overturning the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Zachariasiewicz v. MSPB</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210208107">835 Fed. Appx. 608</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP), restated criteria governing reinstatement of appeals after a lapsed DWOP:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">..."If a party does not submit an appeal within the time set by statute, regulation, or order of a judge, it will be dismissed as untimely filed unless a good reason for the delay is shown." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(c). The appellant must show that he exercised diligence and ordinary prudence for his filing delay to be excusable. <span class="Italic">Kerr</span>, 908 F.3d at 1311. The Board considers several factors in determining whether good cause warrants waiving a refiling deadline: (1) the appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status; (2) the timeliness of the initial appeal; (3) the appellant's intent throughout the proceedings to file an appeal; (4) the length of delay in refiling; (5) confusion surrounding the refiling deadline; (6) the number of dismissals without prejudice; (7) the agency's failure to object to the dismissal without prejudice; (8) the lack of prejudice to the agency in allowing the refiled appeal; (9) excusable neglect, negligence, unavoidable casualty, and circumstances beyond the appellant's control. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board expressly considered all of these factors and ultimately concluded that Mr. Zachariasiewicz did not show good cause for his eleven-month delay in refiling. Specifically, the Board considered the fact that Mr. Zachariasiewicz was represented by counsel, his initial appeal was untimely, he was aware of the deadline to refile, he had previous appeals based on the same claims dismissed within the same year without prejudice, and the DEA objected to dismissal without prejudice. The Board also reasonably determined that allowing the refiled appeal would result in substantial prejudice to the agency because the agency was prepared to proceed in December 2018. Moreover, the Board found that although Mr. Zachariasiewicz expressed his intent to refile, he missed the deadline for refiling by eleven months. We discern no abuse of discretion in the Board's determination that there was no good cause for waiving the refiling deadline based on its weighing of these factors.

Dept. of Interior</span>, DC-0752-11-0988-I-2 (NP 6/28/2013), the Board attempted to avoid distinctions between <span class="Italic">pro se</span> and represented appellants who fail to meet refiling deadlines and instead examined primarily the length of the delay and any attendant confusion or other mitigating circumstances relating to the DWOP order:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge dismissed without prejudice this appeal of a removal action that the agency based on an alleged violation of a last-chance settlement agreement (LCA). The initial decision indicated that a separate Board appeal of the appellant's demotion pursuant to the terms of the LCA was pending before the Board and that one of the issues in that separate appeal involved the validity of the LCA. The administrative judge held that, if the Board were to agree with the appellant in the separate appeal that the LCA was invalid and unenforceable, such a finding could invalidate the agency's removal action pursuant to the LCA. Thus, the administrative judge found it appropriate to dismiss the appeal without prejudice pending the Board's final decision in the separate appeal. The initial decision notified the appellant that he must refile his removal appeal "within 30 calendar days from the date that the Board issues its final decision on the appellant's PFR of the August 23, 2011 initial decision in MSPB Docket No. DC-0752-10-0802-B-1." The initial decision became final when neither party filed a petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 19, 2012, the Board issued a nonprecedential Final Order finding that the appellant did not establish that the LCA was invalid. <span class="Italic">Snowden v. Department of the Interior</span>, MSPB Docket No. DC-0752-10-0802-B-1, Final Order (Apr. 19, 2012). On May 24, 2012, the appellant, through his attorney representative, refiled his appeal of his removal. The agency moved to dismiss the refiled appeal as untimely filed. The administrative judge ordered the appellant to show that his appeal was timely refiled or that good cause existed for the delay. In response, the appellant asserted that, among other things, his initial appeal was timely filed, the appeal had only been dismissed without prejudice once, the delay was short, the 30-day deadline for refiling should have been a 60-day deadline for refiling to afford him the opportunity to appeal the separate Board decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and the agency did not show that it would be prejudiced by the 3-day delay. The agency responded by asserting that the refiling instructions in the initial decision were clear and that the appellant's counsel, an experienced attorney, did not provide any explanation for the 3-day filing delay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the written record, the administrative judge dismissed the refiled appeal as untimely filed with no showing of good cause for the delay. The administrative judge first found that the appellant refiled his appeal 3 days late. She further noted that the Board's dismissal without prejudice practice should not become a trap to deny an appellant the opportunity to have his case decided on the merits. Nevertheless, the administrative judge found that, under the specific standards set forth by the Board for determining whether good cause exists for an untimely refiling of an appeal dismissed without prejudice, the appellant did not show good cause for the delay. The administrative judge held that, although the appellant timely filed his initial appeal, the case was dismissed without prejudice only one time, the refiling delay was short, and the agency did not show any prejudice as a result of the delay, the appellant and his experienced counsel did not provide an explanation for the delay. The administrative judge found that the appellant was represented by the same counsel both when the appeal was dismissed without prejudice and when he refiled the appeal and did not allege confusion regarding the refiling delay or other circumstances beyond his control that affected his ability to comply with the deadline. The administrative judge held that the refiling deadline was not arbitrary and was never intended to delay adjudication pending a court appeal and that the agency strenuously objected to the dismissal without prejudice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts on review that several of the above factors weigh in his favor, including the timeliness of the initial appeal, the fact that the appeal was dismissed without prejudice only once, the very short length of the delay, the arbitrariness of the refiling deadline, and the absence of prejudice to the agency from the refiling delay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that its dismissal without prejudice policy "should not become a trap that would deny the unwary <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant of the opportunity to have her case decided on the merits." <span class="Italic">Brown v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 417, &#x00B6; 8 (2000). The Board has identified the following factors as supporting a finding of good cause for waiving the refiling deadline: The appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status; timely filing of the initial appeal; intent throughout the proceedings to file an appeal; minimal delay in refiling, and any confusion; the small number of dismissals without prejudice; an arbitrary refiling deadline; the agency's failure to object to the dismissal without prejudice; and the lack of prejudice to the agency in allowing the refiled appeal. <span class="Italic">Gaddy v. Department of the Navy</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 485, &#x00B6; 13 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 417, &#x00B6; 8, the Board held that, "[i]n a case such as this where a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant's refiled appeal is untimely by only a few days, there is some indication of confusion by the appellant, and the decision dismissing the original appeal without prejudice set a relatively arbitrary refiling deadline and included an alternative refiling deadline, the Board will find good cause for the untimeliness." The Board noted that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) was not opposed to the dismissal without prejudice and had not indicated or shown that it would be prejudiced by waiver of the time limit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 8. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, the Board found good cause for the delay in refiling the appeal when the above criteria were met.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are four cases, however, in which the Board has applied <span class="Italic">Brown</span> in waiving the refiling time limit even though, as in this case, the appellant was represented and not acting <span class="Italic">pro se</span>. In <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 302, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-10 (2001), the Board applied <span class="Italic">Brown</span> and found good cause for an 8-day refiling delay, even though the appellant was represented by counsel. The Board held that, "[a]lthough the appellant in this case was not proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span> when her appeal was refiled, the delay in refiling, as in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> and <span class="Italic">Moore</span>, was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 9. The Board found that "the most significant factor favoring waiver in this case is our finding in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> that our dismissal without prejudice practice should not become a trap to deny an appellant the opportunity to have her case decided on the merits." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board noted that, as in <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, the deadline for refiling was "apparently relatively arbitrary," OPM did not object to the dismissal without prejudice, and OPM did not assert that it would be prejudiced by waiving the filing time limit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>, &#x00B6; 10. The delay in refiling in <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> resulted from the attorney incorrectly identifying the refiling date as April 11, instead of April 1. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Shenwick v. Department of State</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11 (2001), the Board relied on <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> in finding that, because the purpose of the dismissal without prejudice subject to refiling of the appellant's individual right of action (IRA) appeal was to allow that appeal to be adjudicated along with any appeal of the agency's removal action, the fact that the appellant refiled the IRA appeal on the same date she filed the removal appeal, albeit 16 days late, militated in her favor. The Board waived the refiling deadline, despite the fact that the appellant was represented by counsel and the refiling deadline was not arbitrary, given the above circumstance and the fact that the initial IRA appeal was timely filed, the appellant never expressed an intention to abandon that appeal, and the agency did not assert that it would be prejudiced by a waiver of the refiling deadline. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 10-11. The Board reached this conclusion despite holding that the Board did not "absolve the appellant's counsel of the obligation to carefully read the language in Board orders and decisions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Shields v. Department of the Navy</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 347, &#x00B6; 3 (2002), the Board waived the refiling deadline when the appellant had timely filed his initial appeal, refiled an appeal of his indefinite suspension only 4 days late, the delay resulted from confusion in the office of the appellant's attorney when the attorney was absent, the appeal had been dismissed without prejudice only once, and the date for refiling was inefficient, given that there were two different deadlines for the indefinite suspension appeal and a subsequent removal, and the reason for dismissing the indefinite suspension appeal without prejudice was to allow it to be adjudicated with the removal appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5, 9, 12. The Board, citing <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> and <span class="Italic">Shenwick</span>, held that it had found good cause for longer delays in refiling appeals, even when, as in <span class="Italic">Shields</span>, the appellants were represented by counsel; therefore, the Board waived the refiling deadline. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8, 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, in <span class="Italic">Jaramillo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 244, &#x00B6; <span id="Page_1112"></span>5 (2007), the Board found that a waiver of the refiling deadline was warranted even though the delay was 29 days and an error by the appellant's representative in calculating the deadline did not establish good cause for the delay. The Board, citing <span class="Italic">Hodges v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 212 (2006), <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, and <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, held that the refiling deadline was "apparently arbitrary"; the agency did not object to the most recent dismissal without prejudice; the agency did not assert that it would be prejudiced by waiving the filing time limit; the Board had waived the refiling deadline in <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, when the appellant's representative made a similar error; and the 29-day delay was "not excessive," considering the appeal was refiled only 5 days after the resolution of the criminal proceedings that required dismissal without prejudice. <span class="Italic">Jaramillo</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 244, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that there is no material distinction between the facts in this case and the facts in the above cases in which the Board waived the refiling deadline for appellants represented by counsel. Although the attorney in this case has not specifically identified a reason for the delay, it appears to have involved a similar type of error in calculating or keeping track of the refiling deadline that did not prevent the Board from waiving the refiling deadline in the above cases. As in <span class="Italic">Jackson, Shenwick, Shields</span>, and <span class="Italic">Jaramillo</span>, the appellant timely filed his initial appeal, he never expressed an intention to abandon his appeal, the agency did not show prejudice by a waiver of the refiling deadline, and the appeal had been dismissed without prejudice only once. Moreover, the 3-day delay in this case is significantly shorter than some of the delays in the above cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the arbitrariness of the refiling deadline, although administrative judges have broad discretion to dismiss an appeal without prejudice to refiling, they must set a reasonable refiling deadline. <span class="Italic">Hodges</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 212, &#x00B6; 13. Reasonable refiling deadlines avoid open-ended periods for resolving appeals and should, instead, set a date certain by which the appellant must refile the appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (finding unreasonable a refiling deadline of "no later than thirty calendar days following her receipt of a final determination on her appeal [against DVA] by the Board's Western Regional Office or, if appealed further, from the Board in Washington, D.C. or the [U.S.] Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit"). Here, although the administrative judge did not abuse her discretion by dismissing this appeal without prejudice, the refiling deadline of "within 30 calendar days from the date that the Board issues its final decision on the appellant's PFR of the August 23, 2011 initial decision in MSPB Docket No. DC-0752-10-0802-B-1" is not reasonable because it does not set a "date certain" for when the appellant must refile his appeal. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Such an open-ended deadline may have caused the 3-day delay. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> An additional problem with the refiling instructions is that they gave the appellant 30 fewer days to refile this appeal than he had to seek judicial review of the Board decision that denied his petition for review in the other appeal, thereby depriving him of the full 60-day period to consider whether to seek judicial review in the other appeal. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6; 13 n.1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we find that the appellant requested below that his appeal be "stayed" pending the resolution of the separate appeal that would address the validity of the LCA. The agency asserted in response that the administrative judge should deny the appellant's request for a stay because "[t]here is no authority for granting a stay" and the appellant did not show that he would be irreparably harmed if a stay was not granted or that he was likely to succeed on the merits of his petition for review. There is no indication, however, that the agency objected to the alternative procedural option adopted by the administrative judge of dismissing the appeal without prejudice to refiling. In fact, the agency did not challenge the dismissal of the appeal without prejudice by filing a petition for review of that initial decision. Thus, contrary to the administrative judge's determination, the agency did not "strenuously" object to dismissal of the appeal without prejudice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, although we do not absolve the appellant and his attorney of their obligation to carefully read and comply with the language in Board orders and decisions, we find it in the interest of justice to waive the refiling deadline and remand the appeal for adjudication of the appellant's removal. <span class="Italic">See Jaramillo</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 244, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under an earlier decision, <span class="Italic">Sweazey v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1992 NP No. 92-3384), an untimely refiled appeal will be dismissed if the deadline should have been clear to the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ based his decision to grant Sweazey leave to "refile her appeal within 20 calendar days from the date of the OWCP's hearing decision" upon the stipulations agreed to by the parties in their joint motion to dismiss without prejudice. Sweazey, as a co-movant to the joint motion, directly participated in the selection of the refiling deadline for her appeal. She, through her counsel, had ample opportunity to clarify and make known her position if it indeed was contrary to that reflected by the unambiguous language of the joint motion and the ensuing decision by the AJ granting the motion. We agree with the Board that both the joint motion and the AJ's decision unequivocally provide that the 20-day period for refiling ran from the date of the OWCP decision and not from the day Sweazey received the decision. We thus conclude that the Board's determination that Sweazey's refiling was untimely was not arbitrary....</p>

Department of Justice,</span> 74 MSPR 294, 298 (1997); <span class="Italic">Lipscomb v. Department of Defense,</span> 69 MSPR 484, 487-88 (1996). <span class="Italic">Cf. Moorman v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 MSPR 60, 63 (1995) (good cause not established where the appeal was untimely filed because of events that could have been anticipated), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 79 F.3d 1167 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, while the administrative judge found that the appellant's attempt to personally deliver the refiled appeal was not the best course of action, given the availability of filing by facsimile, the good cause standard does not require an appellant to choose the best or the most reasonable course of action. <span class="Italic">See Omar v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, MSPB Docket No. DC-0845-94-0213-I-1, slip op. at 5-6 (Nov. 29, 1995). Finally, to the extent there is any doubt about whether good cause exists, <span id="Page_1113"></span>we will resolve it in the appellant's favor. <span class="Italic">See Rousselle v. Department of the Army,</span> 69 MSPR 531, 534, 536 (1996).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jaramillo v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 106 MSPR 244, 246-47 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8, 2007 MSPB 165 (2007), excused a refiling 29 days late when the appellant clearly was interested in pursuing a case that was DWOP'd several times pending criminal proceedings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, as the appellant notes, we have repeatedly held that our dismissal without prejudice practice should not become a trap to deny an appellant the opportunity to have his case decided on the merits. <span class="Italic">See Hodges v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 212, &#x00B6; 11 (2006); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 302, &#x00B6; 10 (2001); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 417, &#x00B6; 8 (2000). We have also found that an appellant should not be denied the opportunity to have his appeal heard on the merits where, as here, his intention to refile a Board appeal has been clear throughout the proceedings and the appeal was initially timely filed. <span class="Italic">See Hodges</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 212, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">Shenwick v. Department of State</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 9 (2001); <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 302, &#x00B6; 10. Moreover, the refiling deadline at issue was apparently arbitrary, the agency did not object to the most recent dismissal without prejudice, and the agency has not asserted that it would be prejudiced by waiving the filing time limit. <span class="Italic">See Jackson</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 302, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 417, &#x00B6; 8. We have also waived a refiling deadline where the delay was caused by a similar error on the part of the appellant's representative. <span class="Italic">See Jackson</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 302, &#x00B6; 3 (appellant's attorney incorrectly recorded refiling deadline as April 11, instead of April 1, and refiled the appeal as soon as possible after discovering her mistake).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the delay of 29 days is not excessive, considering that the appeal was refiled only 5 days after the resolution of the criminal proceedings that required dismissal without prejudice. <span class="Italic">Cf. Shenwick</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 10 (where appellant's individual right of action appeal was dismissed without prejudice so it could be adjudicated along with any removal appeal, fact that appellant refiled on the same date she filed her removal appeal "militates in her favor"; 16-day delay excused as <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>); <span class="Italic">see also Hodges</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 212, &#x00B6; 14 (finding 23-day refiling delay "not particularly lengthy"). Indeed, had the appeal been refiled by the September 1, 2006 deadline it would have been necessary to dismiss without prejudice for a fourth time, or at least suspend the appeal, as it is the Board's policy to stay its proceedings when criminal proceedings involving the same matter are pending. <span class="Italic">See Staples v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 36, 38, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 70 F.3d 129 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of these considerations, although we do not absolve the appellant of the obligation to carefully read and comply with the language in Board orders and decisions, we find that it is in the interest of justice to waive the refiling deadline for the appellant's appeal. <span class="Italic">See Hodges</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 212, &#x00B6; 17; <span class="Italic">Shenwick</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mechelli v. USPS</span>, 80 MSPR 283, 285-87 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-9 (1998), applied several tests to a belated refiling, with particular reference to mental illness as a factor excusing delay:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The time limit for refiling the appeal in this case...was October 1, 1996. The appellant, however, refiled it on October 14, 1997. It was therefore untimely by more than one year. The Board's time limits may be waived only upon a showing of good cause for the delay in filing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.12, 1201.22(c). Thus, the appellant had the burden of showing that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">See Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 4 MSPB 262, 4 MSPR 180, 184 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant restates his contention that he thought that his former attorney was attending to this matter. As the administrative judge correctly noted, however, the appellant was responsible for the action or inaction of his chosen representative. <span class="Italic">See Choyce v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Defense,</span> 71 MSPR 295, 298 (1996) (alleged ineffective representation by former attorney did not establish good cause for untimely filing); <span class="Italic">Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service,</span> 7 MSPB 493, 7 MSPR 667, 670 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further alleges that he became confused about the date for refiling his Board appeal because he was simultaneously filing an appeal from OPM's decision on his disability retirement application. The original initial decision in this matter, however, specifically set October 1, 1996, as the date for mandatory refiling. The appellant's failure to understand and follow the direct and explicit filing instructions in the initial decision did not constitute good cause for the untimely filing. <span class="Italic">See Sanford v. Department of Defense</span>, 61 MSPR 207, 209 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also alleges that he is a lay person, and is unfamiliar with the Board's regulations. This allegation does not provide a basis for review. An appellant's inexperience with legal matters, and his unfamiliarity with the Board's procedures, does not constitute good cause for an untimely filing that would warrant waiver of the Board's time limits. <span class="Italic">See Swift v. Office of</span> <span class="Italic">Personnel Management,</span> 68 MSPR 411, 413 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant again alleges that his untimely filing was due to illness. The Board will find good cause for waiver of its filing time limits where a party demonstrates that he suffered from an illness that affected his ability to file on time. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lacy v. Department of the Navy,</span> 78 MSPR 434, 437 (1998). To establish that an untimely filing was the result of an illness, a party must: (1) Identify the time period during which he suffered from the illness; (2) submit evidence showing that he suffered from the alleged illness during that time period; and (3) explain how the illness prevented him from timely filing his appeal or a request for an extension of time. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Further, when an appellant alleges that the reason for a filing delay is physical or mental illness, he must receive explicit information regarding the legal standard for establishing good cause on that basis, and he must be afforded an opportunity to show that he met that standard. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 438.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, although the appellant specifically alleged his untimely refiling was due to mental illness, the administrative judge did not place him on notice of the showing that an appellant must make if he alleges untimeliness due to illness. Similarly, the agency's motion to dismiss the appeal as untimely filed did not set forth the appellant's burden of proof in such a case. We find that, because the appellant was never specifically informed of the three criteria he was required to meet to establish good cause for waiver of the Board's time limits on the basis of physical or mental illness, he was denied a fair opportunity to address the timeliness issue. Accordingly, we find that the appeal must be remanded to provide the appellant with proper notice and a meaningful opportunity to file evidence and argument on the timeliness issue. Inasmuch as the Board has rejected the appellant's reliance on his former representative, on remand, the appellant should specifically address the duration of any period of delay caused by his illness as distinguished from that caused by the inaction of his then counsel.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After remand, Mr. Mechelli still failed to convince the Board that his appeal should be considered timely refiled. The Federal Circuit affirmed the dismissal. <span class="Italic">Mechelli v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 00-3037).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hodges v. OPM</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/HODGES_JULIA_L_CH_844E_03_0668_I_2_OPINION_AND_ORDER_249603.pdf">101 MSPR 212</a>, 216-18 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-17, 2006 MSPB 34 (2006), presents another example of a multifactor analysis applied to an untimely effort to refile a case when the DWOP order from the AJ was not as clear as it should have been, but when there was no evidence that the lack of clarity caused the delayed filing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, a significant factor favoring a waiver of a refiling deadline is that our "dismissal without prejudice practice should not become a trap to deny an appellant the opportunity to have her case decided on the merits." <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 302, &#x00B6; 10 (2001) (citing <span class="Italic">Brown v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 417, &#x00B6; 8 (2000)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, an appellant should not be denied the opportunity to have her appeal heard on the merits where her intention to refile a Board appeal has been clear throughout the proceedings and the appeal was initially timely filed. <span class="Italic">See Shenwick</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 302, &#x00B6; 10. Here, it has been clear throughout the proceedings that the appellant intended to refile her appeal against OPM if her appeal against DVA was not successful and she timely filed her initial appeal. S<span class="Italic">ee Shenwick</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10; <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 302, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, although AJs have broad discretion to dismiss an appeal without prejudice to refiling, they must set a reasonable refiling deadline. <span class="Italic">Shenwick</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 6. Reasonable refiling deadlines "avoid open-ended periods for resolving appeals and should, instead, set a date certain by which the appellant must refile the appeal." <span class="Italic">Schulte v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 141, &#x00B6; 6 (2005); <span class="Italic">see Davis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 75, &#x00B6; 7 (2002). Here, although the AJ did not abuse his discretion by dismissing the appellant's initial appeal against OPM without prejudice, the refiling deadline of "no later than thirty calendar days following her receipt of a final determination on her appeal [against DVA] by the Board's Western Regional Office or, if appealed further, from the Board in Washington, D.C. or the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit" is not reasonable because it does not set a "date certain" for when the appellant must refile her appeal. <span class="Italic">See Schulte</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 141, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 75, &#x00B6; 7;<span class="Italic"> Shenwick</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 6;<span class="Italic"> Bowens v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 390, 393 (1993). Further, this open-ended deadline may have confused the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant. <span class="Italic">See Brown,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 417, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">cf. Walls v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 29 F.3d 1578, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1994) ("[w]hile a date is inherently unambiguous, a time period specified in 'days' may not be").[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;An additional problem with the refiling instructions is that they gave the appellant 30 fewer days to refile this appeal than she had to seek judicial review of the Board decision that denied her PFR in the other appeal, thereby depriving her of the full 60-day period to consider whether to seek judicial review in the other appeal. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hammond v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 263 (1996) (ordinarily an AJ should not require refiling of an appeal that is dismissed without prejudice fewer than 35 days from the date of the dismissal, so that the parties have the full 35-day period to decide whether to seek review of the dismissal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1114"></span>Fourth, the dismissal without prejudice appears to have served the interests of the appellant, OPM, and the Board, and served "judicial economy" by allowing the appellant to pursue an alleged involuntary retirement appeal against DVA that may have rendered this appeal moot. <span class="Italic">See Brown</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 417, &#x00B6; 8. Under these circumstances, we find that although the appellant's twenty-three day delay in refiling was not particularly <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, it is not particularly lengthy. <span class="Italic">See Shenwick</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 10 (sixteen-day delay in the appellant's refiling of an individual right of action appeal of certain actions was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> where the purpose of dismissal without prejudice was to allow the appeal to be adjudicated along with any appeal of the agency's removal action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fifth, the appellant has proceeded <span class="Italic">pro se</span> throughout her appeal and our reviewing court has held that it does "not expect a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> litigant to be made to jump through a confusing array of procedural hoops." <span class="Italic">Walls</span>, 29 F.3d at 1583 (quoting<span class="Italic"> Mendoza v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 966 F.2d 650, 653 (Fed. Cir. 1992)). Further, whether or not an appellant is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span> is an important consideration in determining whether to waive a refiling deadline. <span class="Italic">Shenwick</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 417, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Foreman v. National Archives &#x0026; Records Administration</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 303, &#x00B6; 8 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sixth, and finally, OPM did not oppose the dismissal without prejudice to refiling or the appellant's untimely refiled appeal. <span class="Italic">See Shenwick</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 10;<span class="Italic"> Brown</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 417, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of these considerations, although we do not absolve the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant of the obligation to carefully read and comply with the language in Board orders and decisions, we find that it is in the interest of justice to waive the refiling deadline for the appellant's appeal. <span class="Italic">See Shenwick</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gaddy v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 100 MSPR 485 (2005) (excusing a refiling late by a few days when the appellant was <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, the agency suffered no prejudice, there appeared to be some confusion as to how the refiling date might be calculated for an incarcerated appellant, and the appellant was clearly interested in pursuing his appeal); <span class="Italic">Slate v. USPS</span>, 92 MSPR 85, 87-88 &#x00B6; 6 (2002) (excusing a brief refiling delay by a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant whose wife had health problems, some evidence of confusion on the appellant's part); <span class="Italic">Shields v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 91 MSPR 347, 350 &#x00B6; 10 (2002) (excusing a four-day delay in refiling appeals because of the AJ's inefficient timing of refiling deadlines; the appellant never displayed an interest in abandoning the appellate process); <span class="Italic">Shenwick v. Dept. of State</span>, 90 MSPR 192, 196-97 &#x00B6; 10 (2001) (a 16-day delay in refiling was an excusable <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> delay; although the appellant was represented by counsel, the intent to pursue the case was clear throughout the proceedings and the appeal was initially timely filed; the agency did not claim prejudice resulting from delay); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Censke v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 98 MSPR 349, 351-52 &#x00B6; 7 (2005) (allowing an arguably late refiling after a DWOP when the delay, if any, was very brief and when the refiling may have been timely, depending upon interpretation of confusing circumstances regarding the posting of the refiling). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Young v. VA</span>, SF-0752-06-0633-I-3 (NP 6/22/2012) (lengthy refiling delay when the appellant did not keep the Board informed of a change of address: "the appellant's incarceration does not establish good cause for her late filing in the absence of an explanation as to how the incarceration prevented her from prosecuting her appeal.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pento v. USPS,</span> NY-0752-09-0125-I-2 (NP 5/25/2011), declined to excuse belated refiling by a represented appellant from whom, after the AJ apparently inquired whether the appeal was to be refiled, received no prompt response:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If a party fails to file an appeal by the date set in an administrative judge's order, the appeal will be dismissed as untimely unless the appellant presents a good reason for the delay. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(c). The Board has also held that our dismissal without prejudice practice is not intended to become a trap to deny an appellant the opportunity to have his case decided on the merits. <span class="Italic">Jaramillo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 244, &#x00B6; 6 (2007). As such, in determining whether good cause exists to excuse an untimely refiled appeal, the Board considers factors somewhat different from those in other timeliness cases: (1) The appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status; (2) the timeliness of the initial appeal; (3) the appellant's demonstrated intent throughout the proceedings to refile the appeal; (4) the length of the delay in refiling; (5) any confusion surrounding, or arbitrariness of, the refiling deadline; (6) the number of prior dismissals without prejudice; (7) the agency's failure to object to the dismissal without prejudice; and (8) the lack of prejudice to the agency in allowing the refiled appeal. <span class="Italic">See Gaddy v. Department of the Navy</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 485, &#x00B6; 13 (2005); <span class="Italic">see also Nelson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 644, &#x00B6; 8 (2010), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, No. 2010-3152 (Fed. Cir. January 13, 2011). We note at the outset that the administrative judge did not provide the appellant with notice of the proper good cause standard for refiled appeals and did not apply the proper analysis in her initial decision. These errors did not affect the outcome, however, and they are not a basis for reversal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nelson</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 644, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Certain factors do weigh in the appellant's favor, notably that his initial appeal was timely, there was only one dismissal without prejudice, the agency did not object to the dismissal, and the agency has not suggested that it would suffer any prejudice. But the other factors weigh decisively against him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Significantly, the appellant cannot show that he had demonstrated an intent to refile the appeal throughout the proceeding. While the appellant's counsel represented that the parties had engaged in discovery and/or settlement discussions throughout the relevant period, which arguably suggests an interest in pursuing the appeal, these matters are outweighed by the other circumstances. Notably, the appellant disregarded the refiling date and ignored the subsequent notice of September 15, 2009, both of which strongly suggest a lack of intent to pursue the case. Failing to respond to the September 15, 2009 notice is particularly damaging to the appellant's position. In that notice, the administrative judge expressly stated that she presumed the appellant was no longer pursuing the case because he failed to refile the appeal, and his failure to respond to the administrative judge's statement is simply incompatible with an intent to pursue the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the appellant had counsel, and the same attorney represented him throughout these proceedings. In addition, the delay in refiling the appeal was very substantial (245 days). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nelson</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 644, &#x00B6; 9 (a 4-month delay is significant); <span class="Italic">see generally Wright v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 124, &#x00B6; 8 (2010) (even for an appellant proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, an 11-day delay is not minimal). Moreover, there was no plausible basis for confusion regarding the dismissal order, as the administrative judge clearly presented the range of dates for refiling and underlined them for emphasis. The order also made it clear that proceeding with the appeal was not automatic--the appellant could elect (or not elect) to refile the appeal. Nor can the refiling date be deemed arbitrary--it was set at approximately a month prior to the rescheduled merits hearing, and the parties had suggested the (approximate) date for the hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lastly, the appellant's counsel's explanation for the delay is implausible on its face. He presents no reason for why he believed that he could simply disregard the refiling date in the administrative judge's order. Further, even if he believed refiling was pointless if discovery had not been completed, the proper course was to file a motion requesting an extension of time. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nelson</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 644, &#x00B6; 9. Counsel was obviously aware of this process, as he filed a request for (and received) an extension of time to file the appellant's petition for review. Counsel also does not even attempt to explain his failure to respond to the September 15, 2009 notice. Furthermore, even if one accepted counsel's explanation in its entirety, the appellant's failure to refile the appeal for approximately a month after speaking directly with the administrative judge in March 2010 would also result in his refiled appeal being deemed untimely. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">generally</span> <span class="Italic">Nelson</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 644, &#x00B6; 9 (even viewing the circumstances in the light most favorable to the appellant, he still delayed a month and a half before refiling his appeal).</p>
