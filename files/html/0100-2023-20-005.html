<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-6"><span class="space">1.</span> Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">On November 27, 2012, President Obama signed the 2012 WPEA. According to a White House press release:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. 743, the "Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012,"...amends whistleblower protections for Federal employees by: clarifying the scope of protected disclosures; tightening requirements for non-disclosure agreements; expanding the penalties imposed for violating whistleblower protections; and establishing a Whistleblower Protection Ombudsmen in certain agencies.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">House Report 112-508 (May 30, 2012), from the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, includes a description of the principal provisions of the law (omitted here is the portion of the House Report's description of provisions of the bill that did not make it into the statute):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Section 101. Clarification of disclosures covered</span>: Expands the scope of whistleblower protections to apply to any lawful disclosure of any violation of any law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Section 102. Disclosure defined</span>: A "disclosure" is defined as a "formal or informal communication or transmission, but does not include a communication concerning policy decisions that lawfully exercise discretionary authority, unless the employee or applicant providing the disclosure reasonably believes that the disclosure evidences any violation of any law, rule, or regulation, and occurs during the conscientious carrying out of official duties; or gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety." This definition covers communications beyond the initial disclosure, but does not apply to policy decisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Section 103. Rebuttable presumption</span>: Reiterates that whistleblowers can disclose information to Congress without fear of reprisal. In addition, states that any presumption relating to the performance of a duty by an employee whose conduct is the subject of a "protected" disclosure as defined under "this Section" may be rebutted by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Section 104. Personnel actions and prohibited personnel practices</span>: Includes as a prohibited personnel practice the implementation or enforcement of any agency nondisclosure policy, form, or agreement that does not contain a specific statement clarifying that its provisions are consistent with and cannot supersede requirements that preserve the right of Federal employees to make disclosures of illegality, waste, fraud, abuse, or public health or safety threats. Also codifies the governing law for demonstrating that retaliatory investigations are prohibited personnel practices and permits corrective action awarded to whistleblowers to include damages, fees, and costs incurred due to an agency investigation of the employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Section 105. Exclusion of agencies by the President</span>: Clarifies the President's flexibility to determine what agencies should be exempted from whistleblower protections. Explicit exceptions include the FBI, CIA, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, NSA, the Office of Director of National Intelligence, and the National Reconnaissance Office. This Section does not change the President's existing authority to exempt any Executive agency or unit thereof whose principal function is the conduct of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities, provided such determination is made prior to the personnel action involved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Section 106. Disciplinary action</span>: Increases the Special Counsel's ability to obtain disciplinary action from the MSPB against employees who commit a prohibited personnel practice or knowingly and willfully fail to comply with an order from the MSPB. Now the Board may combine disciplinary action to include employment and civil penalties. Clarifies burdens of proof so the MSPB may impose disciplinary action if it is determined that the exposure of waste, fraud, mismanagement or abuse was a significant motivating factor underlying the prohibited personnel practice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Section 107. Remedies</span>: Grants the MSPB authority to require payment of reasonable attorney fees by the relevant agency. Current law states the "agency involved" should make that payment, which had been interpreted to mean the Office of Special Counsel if it did not prevail in a disciplinary action. Expands the list of corrective actions available to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Section 108. Judicial review</span>: Under current law, a whistleblower may appeal the MSPB decision to the United States Appeals Court for the Federal Circuit. Because of the Federal Circuit has often times misinterpreted Congressional intent when it comes to whistleblowers, so-called "pure" whistleblower appeals--that is, appeals only dealing with whistleblower claims--will now be heard in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Grants the OPM authority to bring cases of substantial impact on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Section 109. Prohibited personnel practices affecting the Transportation Security Administration</span>: Extends whistleblower and other anti-discrimination protections to employees (and applicants for employment) of the Transportation Security Administration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Section 110. Disclosure of censorship related to research, analysis, or technical information</span>: Extends whistleblower protections to any current or prospective Federal employee for disclosures that such employee reasonably believes are evidence of censorship related to research, analysis, or technical information.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The WPEA became effective on December 27, 2012, 30 days after enactment, with the exception of Section 109, effective immediately, involving TSA coverage. It does not diminish preexisting rights or protections.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Moving from the House Report, from the perspective of practitioners, as identified by one practitioner--the author--salient features of the 2012 legislation (being elucidated through litigation) were:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Covered Disclosures to Wrongdoers</span>: Under decisions of the Federal Circuit, no protected disclosure occurred if an individual told a wrongdoer that he or she violated a law or regulation or committed waste or mismanagement. The result was that no actionable whistleblower reprisal occurred if an employee told a supervisor she was violating a statute, the supervisor politely thanked her for the information and immediately informed the employee that she was fired for her trouble. The WPEA changes that result by including as a covered disclosure a communication to a wrongdoer. Section 101(b)(2)(C) of the WPEA, amending 5 USC 2302 by adding (f)(i)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Broader Class of Disclosure</span>: Matters Included within 5 USC 2302(b)(9): WPEA broadens IRA jurisdiction under 5 USC 1214 and 1221 to include protection not only against reprisal for the usual forms of disclosures covered by 5 USC 2302(b)(8), but also against reprisal for some matters covered by 5 USC 2302(b)(9). The revisions to Section 1214 as they relate to Section 2302(b)(9) include: testifying for or assisting individuals in their appeals, complaints, or grievances, cooperating with or disclosing information to an IG or OSC, or refusing to obey an order that would require an individual to violate a law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Broader Class of Disclosures</span>: Matters Arguably Within the Ordinary Scope of Employment: The 2012 statute changed existing Federal Circuit law by providing protection to disclosures made in the normal course of employment if there is a disclosure of a violation of law, rule, regulation, gross mismanagement, waste, fraud, or abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety. Section 101, amending 5 USC 2302(b)(2)(C) by adding (f)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Broader Class of Disclosures</span>: "Any" Means "Any": 5 USC 2302(b)(8)A)(I) is amended to include "any" rather than "a" violation of law, rule, or regulation, with the apparent effect of eliminating application of a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> test to an otherwise covered disclosure. Section 2302(b)(8)(B)(I) is similarly amended as to a like disclosure to OSC or OIG. Section 101(a) of the WPEA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Broader Class of Disclosures</span>: Policy Disputes: Disclosures concerning policy decisions are protected if the disclosures reveal matters encompassed by 5 USC 2302(b)(8). Section 102 of WPEA, amending 2302(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Limitation of Defenses to Disclosures</span>: The 2012 legislation precludes exclusion of disclosures on the bases that the information was previously disclosed, the disclosure was not in writing, or the disclosure was made while the employee was off duty. Section 101(b)(2)(C) of WPEA, amending 5 USC 2302 by adding (f)(1)(B), (D), and (E).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Order of Proof</span>: The Board allowed its AJs to invert the order of proof in a whistleblower case by assuming that whistleblowing occurred, in order to quickly resolve the case with the agency's clear and convincing evidence that the appellant would have suffered the action appealed without regard to whistleblowing. The AJ could short-circuit the whistleblowing analysis, including the intensity of the agency's motive to retaliate and rid themselves of, or otherwise discipline, the whistleblower, by jumping straight to the agency's defense. The Board was moving away from the practice of inversion of proof, at the urging of the Federal Circuit, immediately prior to the enactment of WPEA. The 2012 statute precludes inversion of proof and requires the opportunity for full evidentiary development: appellant puts on her case followed by the agency's defense and rebuttal by the appellant. Section 114(b) of the WPEA, amending 5 USC 1221(e)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">No More Presumptions Concerning Timing of Disclosures and Reprisals</span>: Board law was that, without direct evidence of reprisal, disclosures in IRA cases occurring much more than a year prior to the complained of personnel action would not serve to establish nonfrivolous allegations of whistleblowing reprisal. WPEA changes that by barring an arbitrary time constraint linking the disclosure and appealed action. That does not mean that a disclosure ten years prior to a personnel action will establish a strong case, but it does mean that the evidence will need to be examined and weighed. Section 101(b)(2)(C), amending 5 USC 2302 by adding (f)(1)(F).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">No Presumptions Favoring Agency Officials</span>: The statute precludes any strong presumption that agency officials act in good faith when their actions are challenged as retaliatory, but the statute did not do more than recognize relatively recent developments in Board law. Section 103 of WPEA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Expanded Economic Recovery</span>: WPEA redefines consequential damages to include compensatory damages--presumably for the emotional and physical effects of whistleblowing reprisal. Section 107(b) of WPEA, amending 5 USC 1214(g)(2) and 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii). The 2012 amendments to do not incorporate Title VII caps on compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Gag Orders and Research Activities</span>: WPEA limits the ability of agencies to use nondisclosure agreements in agency investigations as a means of muzzling employees from making whistleblower disclosures. And the statute established protections against agency censorship of defined research activities. Sections 115 and 110 of the WPEA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">New Judicial Review Options</span>: WPEA provides that, for a period of two years, parties may take their whistleblowing cases from the MSPB to circuit appellate courts or to the Federal Circuit. Section 108(a) by amending 7703(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Facilitation of OSC Disciplinary Cases</span>. OSC's burden of proof is now modified. The law was that disciplinary cases were established by proving that reprisal was a significant or important factor in the complained action(s) or inaction, not that it was a contributing or tangential factor. The 2012 amendments state that the Board may impose discipline if protected activity was a significant motivating factor. This is true even if other factors also motivated the decision to take, fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take a personnel action, unless that employee demonstrates, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he or she would have taken, failed to take, or threatened to take or fail to take the same personnel action, in the absence of such protected activity. Through amendment of 5 USC 1204(m), OSC is no longer potentially liable to an appellant for her counsel fees if it loses a disciplinary case taken to the Board; instead, if counsel fees are paid, they are paid by the employing agency. Section 107(a) of WPEA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Retaliatory Investigations</span>. A Board order for corrective action may include fees, costs, or damages reasonably incurred due to an agency investigation of the employee that was commenced, expanded, or extended in retaliation for the disclosure or protected activity that formed the basis of the corrective action. Section 104 of WPEA, amending 5 USC 1214 and 1221(g).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Other Provisions</span>: There are other provisions of WPEA that enhance whistleblower protection for TSA employees (Section 109 of WPEA, establishing the new 5 USC 2304), permit OSC to file <span class="Italic">amicus</span> briefs in court (Section 113of WPEA, amending 1212), require OIG offices to designate <span id="Page_3584"></span>whistleblower protection ombudsmen (Section 117 of WPEA), and call for public reporting and review of whistleblower cases by the MSPB and GAO (Section 116 of WPEA).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">What the WPEA did not do</span>: The 2012 amendments did not extend protection to security clearance suspensions or revocations. It did not appear to make major modifications in the preexisting exclusion of intelligence agencies. It did not provide for jury trials. Reference should be made, however, to Presidential Policy Directive/PPD-19, <span class="Italic">Protecting Whistleblowers with Access to Classified Information</span> (October 10, 2012).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The House and Senate reports preceding the statute do not provide especially complete descriptions of the changes by the WPEA to the Reform Act, the Whistleblower Protection Act, and to interpretative case law from the MSPB and Federal Circuit. The best way to decipher the impact of the 2012 legislation is to apply the language of the 2012 amendments to the preexisting statutes.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Several features of the WPEA were summarized in <span class="Italic">Demery v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-2282.Opinion.4-9-2020_1566792.pdf">809 Fed. Appx. 892</a>, 896 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPEA clarified the definition of a disclosure under the WPA. Under the WPEA, a disclosure will not be excluded from protection for any of these following reasons--simply because it was made to a wrongdoer, was made for personal motives, revealed information that was already known, was not made in writing, was made while off-duty, or was not made within a certain amount of time after the events described in the disclosure. <span class="Italic">See</span> Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012, Pub.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Legislative history of the WPEA, WPA, and CSRA is discussed in <span class="Italic">Carlson, Chris, A Supreme Debacle: the Federal Circuit's Opportunity to Retain Exclusive Jurisdiction of Federal Whistleblower Appeals,</span> 24 <span class="small">FED.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 established statutory protections to encourage federal employees to disclose government illegality, waste, fraud, and abuse; and also established the Merit Systems Protection Board as an independent agency to adjudicate these claims. Pub. L. No. 95-454, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 101, 202, 92 Stat. 1111, 1113-14, 1121-31. Congress later passed the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16. The WPA proscribes retaliation against a federal employee who discloses what the employee reasonably believes evidences a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">From its inception in 1982 until recently, the Federal Circuit exercised exclusive jurisdiction over petitions for review of MSPB adjudications that involved only federal-employee whistleblower claims. <span class="Italic">King v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 570 Fed. Appx. 863, 864 (11th Cir. 2014) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Concerned that the Federal Circuit and the MSPB had interpreted the WPA's definition of protected disclosures too narrowly, Congress amended the statute in 1994. <span class="Italic">See</span> Act of Oct. 29, 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-424, 108 Stat. 4361; S. Rep. No. 103-358, at 8-10 (1994) (criticizing the Federal Circuit's "construction of the legislative history" and declaring that "the Board and the courts should not erect barriers to disclosures which will limit the necessary flow of information from employees who have knowledge of government wrongdoing"). In 2012, Congress again significantly amended the WPA through the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act (WPEA) to address similar concerns. This time, to encourage diverse appellate review--which leads to circuit splits (facilitating Supreme Court review), S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 11 (2012)--Congress also expanded judicial review to all circuits, with this provision of the law scheduled to "sunset" five years later, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1)(B); <span class="Italic">see also</span> All Circuit Review Extension Act, Pub.
