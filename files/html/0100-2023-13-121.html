<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-120"><span class="space">b.</span> Indefinite Prolongation of Suspension</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If an indefinite suspension is based on a criminal proceeding, it should be brought to an end if the criminal case is resolved in the appellant's favor--or at least the agency must quickly decide on further action and pursue that action with expedition. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-13-126.html#sec6-125">Action Following Termination of Criminal Proceeding</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Matters become murky with indefinite suspensions based on security clearance suspension or revocation proceedings. Is there a limit to how long the agency may keep the employee suspended while the underlying clearance is under inquiry? The Board's reluctance to interfere with agency clearance determinations led to a decision that, unfortunately nonprecedential, shows the division within the Board over its authority to prevent abuse of the indefinite suspension process when agencies allow the suspension to turn into a <span class="Italic">de facto</span> termination without due process by failing to resolve the clearance issue in a reasonable time. <span class="Italic">Wickert v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/nonprecedential/WICKERT_KEITH_E_NY_0752_11_0343_I_1_FINAL_ORDER_WITH_DISSENTING_OPINION_829358.pdf">NY-0752-11-0343-I-1</a> (NP 6/5/2013), provides the opinions in the Board's debate--first from the majority, controlling opinion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has filed a petition for review in which he reiterates his arguments that the delay in receiving a decision from the agency is so long that it abuses the temporary nature of an indefinite suspension. The appellant argues that, because the review process is in the exclusive control of the agency, it could continue the process without end and never issue a final decision. In response, the agency asserts that it has met the conditions for a valid indefinite suspension, and the appellant has not identified any contrary case law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not challenged, either below or on review, the validity of his placement on an indefinite suspension, including the merits of whether the indefinite suspension was proper when taken and whether he was afforded minimal due process. Thus, the administrative judge did not consider these issues below, and we have not considered them on review. Rather, the appellant has only challenged the length of his indefinite suspension while he waits for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Security Appeals Board (Appeals Board) to issue a final decision on his appeal of the revocation of his security clearance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be valid, an indefinite suspension must have an ascertainable end, that is, a determinable condition subsequent that will bring the suspension to a conclusion. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Army</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 350, &#x00B6; 11 (2009); <span class="Italic">Drain v. Department of Justice</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 562, &#x00B6; 8 (2008). An indefinite suspension, however, may extend through the completion of both a pending investigation and any subsequent administrative action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, the appellant was suspended effective January 19, 2011, after the revocation of his security clearance. The parties stipulated below that the decision letter notified the appellant that the indefinite suspension would remain in effect "pending the resolution on the status of [his] Top Secret Clearance."Thus, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant was on clear notice that the indefinite suspension would remain in effect until he exhausted all of his administrative appeals of the agency's determination to revoke his security clearance or until his security clearance is restored.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the Board has the authority to determine when an agency has taken too long to meet the condition subsequent when the agency itself has sole control over the matter. The appellant asserts that case law finding that an agency must initiate administrative actions within a reasonable period of time after completion of the pending investigation should apply in this situation, and he contends that the Board should cancel his suspension retroactive to February 6, 2011. <span class="Italic">See Engdahl v. Department of the Navy</span>, 900 F.2d 1572, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Arrieta v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 372 (2008). The appellant also relies on <span class="Italic">Romero v. Department of Defense</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 284, &#x00B6; 11 (2007), where the Board ordered an indefinite suspension canceled because the agency failed to justify its delay in taking an action after the final determination was made to deny the appellant's access to classified information, for the premise that the Board should similarly cancel his indefinite suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we find that the appellant's reliance on <span class="Italic">Romero</span>, <span class="Italic">Arrieta</span>, and similar cases is misplaced. For example, in <span class="Italic">Romero</span> and <span class="Italic">Arietta</span>, the Board found that the issue was whether the agency continued the indefinite suspension while it unreasonably delayed in pursuing an action after the completion of the investigation or resolution of pending criminal charges. Thus, the Board's cases have focused on the need to move expeditiously to end the indefinite suspension when the condition subsequent has occurred. <span class="Italic">See Jones</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 350, &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">Drain</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 562, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Arietta</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 372, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Romero</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 284, &#x00B6; 11. Here, the terminating event--the resolution of the appellant's security clearance appeal pending before the DHS Appeals Board--has not occurred, and, thus, because the agency does not have a final determination regarding the revocation of the appellant's security clearance, the agency has not delayed in either removing the appellant or terminating his indefinite suspension[3].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The dissent appears to create an exception to the rule that only requires an agency to act expeditiously when a condition subsequent has been met. By implicitly rejecting the agency's explanation of the reasons why the administrative review process is not completed (i.e., heavy workload and insufficient staffing), we believe the dissent has ignored the facts of this case and swallowed the rule restricting the Board's authority in security clearance cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has held that, in an appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 based on the denial or revocation of a security clearance, the Board does not have the authority to review the substance of the underlying security clearance determination. <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 530-31 (1988). The Court specifically stated that the Board is limited to determining whether the employee received the procedural protections the employee is entitled to receive, in this case the appellant did not contest that he received minimal due process and that the indefinite suspension was valid upon its inception. The Court stated further that "[n]othing in the Act, however, directs or empowers the Board to go further." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, while the only course of appeal available to the appellant on the merits of a revocation or suspension of a security clearance is through the agency's internal appeal process which includes two separate bodies, the Security Appeals Panels of both the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and DHS, the appellant has arguably extended his indefinite suspension by pursuing his claim to the DHS Appeals Board after TSA's Chief Security Officer affirmed the agency's Office of Personnel Security's decision to revoke his security clearance. Though we recognize the appellant's frustration with the delay in receiving a final decision from the DHS Appeals Board, the Board has no authority over the DHS Appeals Board and its merits review process of security clearance suspensions and revocations. Thus, because it is undisputed that the appellant's indefinite suspension was valid upon its inception, and because the condition subsequent has not yet occurred, the indefinite suspension is still valid. Accordingly, the administrative judge correctly dismissed this appeal as premature.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">And the dissent, from Vice Chair Wagner:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The majority affirms the initial decision in this case, which sustained the agency's action indefinitely suspending the appellant based on the revocation of his security clearance. In so doing, the majority finds that, because the indefinite suspension was valid upon its inception and the condition subsequent set forth in the notice proposing the indefinite suspension has not yet occurred, the indefinite suspension is still valid. For the reasons set forth below, I would find that the circumstances in this appeal call into question whether the agency's continuation of the indefinite suspension action still meets the statutory requirement that it be "temporary." Therefore, I would remand the appeal for the submission of additional evidence and argument on that issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a Board appeal on September 14, 2011, challenging the continuation of his indefinite suspension beyond February 6, 2011, based on the revocation of his security clearance. The appellant is employed in the position of Federal Air Marshall (FAM) with Transportation Security Administration (TSA). It is undisputed that, as a condition of employment, a FAM is required to obtain and to maintain a top secret security clearance. On May 16, 2003, the agency had granted the appellant a top secret security clearance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 26, 2009, however, the agency's Office of Personnel Security (PERSEC) notified the appellant and his supervisors that the top secret security clearance had been revoked. The notice advised the appellant that this was not a final determination and that he had a right to respond in writing or orally. The appellant was deployed for military service outside of the United States from October 2009 through October 3, 2010. When he returned to work on October 12, 2010, the agency placed him on administrative leave because his security clearance had been revoked.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 23, 2010, the appellant appealed PERSEC's decision to revoke the security clearance to TSA's Chief Security Officer (CSO). While the appellant was pursuing his appeal of PERSEC's decision, the agency issued a December 8, 2010 notice of proposed suspension for an indefinite period. The notice informed the appellant of his right to respond to the proposal. The agency then issued a decision placing the appellant on an indefinite suspension, effective January 19, 2011, and finding that the charge and specification were sustained and warranted his indefinite suspension pending the resolution of the status of his security clearance. The appellant filed his Board appeal on September 14, 2011. On October 14, 2011, the CSO issued a Notice of Review Determination affirming PERSEC's initial decision to revoke the appellant's security clearance. On October 27, 2011, the appellant appealed the CSO's decision to the Department of Homeland Security's Security Appeals Board (DHS Appeals Board).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge in this case explained in his initial decision that the appellant did not challenge the initial imposition of the indefinite suspension or whether the indefinite suspension was valid when imposed, but instead challenged the continuation of the indefinite suspension beyond February 6, 2011, because the agency had taken almost 1 year to issue its decision on his appeal of the revocation. IAF, Tab 17, Initial Decision (ID) at 5-6; <span class="Italic">see</span> IAF, Tab 14 at 6 (the appellant's stipulation that he did not appeal his placement on an indefinite suspension to the Board, but instead filed the instant appeal claiming that his indefinite suspension had lasted for an unreasonable amount of time). Based on the written record, after the appellant withdrew his request for a hearing, the administrative judge found that the agency properly provided an ascertainable ending event for the indefinite suspension, and he accepted the agency's reason for the CSO's delay, i.e., a heavy work load with insufficient staffing. The administrative judge found that, because the ending event had not yet occurred, the indefinite suspension may continue. Thus, he upheld the action and dismissed the appeal as premature.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant reiterates on review his argument that the delay in receiving a security clearance decision from the agency is so long that it abuses the temporary nature of an indefinite suspension. The appellant argues that, because the review process is within the exclusive control of the agency, it could continue the process without end and never issue a final decision. The agency asserts that it has met the conditions for a valid indefinite suspension and that the appellant has not identified any contrary case law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not challenged the validity of his placement on an indefinite suspension, including the merits of whether the indefinite suspension was proper when taken and whether the agency afforded him minimal due process. Thus, the administrative judge did not consider these issues below, and I would not consider them on review. Rather, the appellant has only challenged the length of his indefinite suspension while he waits for the DHS Appeals Board to issue a final decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its first major decision addressing the circumstances under which an indefinite suspension is initially valid, the circumstances under which an initially valid indefinite suspension becomes invalid, the manner in which an employee can obtain termination of an indefinite suspension if warranted, and related sub-issues, the Board noted that the term "suspension" is defined at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7501(2) as meaning the "placing of an employee, for disciplinary reasons, in a temporary status without duties and pay." <span class="Italic">Martin v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 12 M.S.P.R. 12, 16-17 (1982), <span class="Italic">aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds sub nom. Brown v. Department of Justice</span>, 715 F.2d 662 (D.C. Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">and aff'd sub nom. Otherson v. Department of Justice</span>, 728 F.2d 1513 (D.C. Cir. 1984), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds by Barresi v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 656, 663 n.5 (1994). The most essential criterion of an action, if it is to meet the statutory definition of "suspension," is that it be "temporary." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 17. The Board therefore held that, while the exact duration of an indefinite suspension may not be ascertainable, such an action must have a condition subsequent, such as the completion of a trial or investigation, which "will terminate the suspension." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board emphasized that an indefinite suspension "imposed with no ascertainable end in sight is not sustainable as a suspension, because of [a] failure to meet the criterion of temporariness." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, the Board held that "an indefinite suspension may be found to have been reasonable when imposed, although facts later developed may cause the Board to find that an agency acted unreasonably in failing or refusing to vacate the action," and that a Board order "sustaining the action would explicitly or implicitly mandate that the agency move expeditiously, and that the suspension terminate upon the occurrence of the condition subsequent." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 20; <span class="Italic">see Hernandez v. Department of Justice</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 669, 672 (1987) ("An agency is required...to act expeditiously in bringing the suspension to an end and to terminate the suspension upon the occurrence of that action's 'condition subsequent.'"). These holdings by the Board in <span class="Italic">Martin</span> were established within the context of indefinite suspensions taken by the agency pending the resolution of possible criminal misconduct by the appellants. <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 12 M.S.P.R. at 17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Navy</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 680, 689, <span class="Italic">aff'd as modified on recons</span>., 51 M.S.P.R. 607 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 978 F.2d 1223 (Fed. Cir. 1992), the Board noted that, while it had not previously adjudicated any appeals of indefinite suspensions taken pending the completion of a security clearance investigation, it had determined that "an agency may effect or continue an indefinite suspension based on possible criminal misconduct for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed, even though no criminal proceedings are ongoing, pending the agency's completion of its investigation of the alleged criminal misconduct." The Board therefore found no reason why an agency could not take an indefinite suspension action against an employee based on the suspension of his security access, pending the agency's investigation of his security clearance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board in <span class="Italic">Jones</span> and the cases cited therein did not, however, acknowledge a fundamental difference between the situations in <span class="Italic">Martin</span> and <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, namely, that the condition subsequent in <span class="Italic">Martin</span> was dependent upon action to be taken by a non-party, such as a U.S. Attorney or a court, over which the agency did not have control, while the condition subsequent in <span class="Italic">Jones</span> depended upon action to be taken by the adverse party in the case, i.e., the agency. The Board recognized such a distinction in <span class="Italic">Jarvis v. Department of Justice</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 104, 109 (1990), when it held that the agency was not responsible for failing to terminate an indefinite suspension after the prosecuting authority unnecessarily delayed its criminal prosecution of the appellant because the agency, as the employer, did not have any control over the progress of criminal litigation, including delays caused by prosecution tactics.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the agency itself is responsible for both effecting the indefinite suspension and bringing about the condition subsequent that would end the indefinite suspension, relying solely upon the existence of a condition subsequent to conclude that the continuation of the indefinite suspension is proper may not, in all cases, be sufficient. The Board should not turn a blind eye when, despite the existence of a condition subsequent, there are other reasons that call into question the "temporariness" of the indefinite suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may not take an unlimited amount of time to determine what action to take once the condition subsequent has occurred. <span class="Italic">See Arrieta v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 372, &#x00B6; 8 (2008). As set forth above, the Board suggested in <span class="Italic">Martin</span> and <span class="Italic">Hernandez</span> that an agency must move expeditiously even before the condition subsequent occurs. Moreover, the condition subsequent must be one that "will bring the action to an end." <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 12 M.S.P.R. at 20. Thus, I would find that an agency that is responsible for both effecting an indefinite suspension and bringing about the condition subsequent that would end the indefinite suspension may not take an unlimited amount of time to bring about the condition subsequent that would end the indefinite suspension. Permitting such an unlimited amount of time would be inconsistent with the statutory requirement that the suspension be "temporary."[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Drain v. Department of Justice</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 562, &#x00B6; 9 (2008), does not require a different result. There, the Board disagreed with the administrative judge's determination that the passage of 1 year, by itself, rendered an otherwise properly-effected indefinite suspension improper, finding no independent support for that conclusion. As in <span class="Italic">Drain</span>, I would decline to adopt in this case an inflexible time limit for finding that an indefinite suspension is no longer temporary. Moreover, the condition subsequent in <span class="Italic">Drain</span>, the disposition of criminal charges, was not within the agency's control, as is the condition subsequent in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency indefinitely suspended the appellant on January 19, 2011. The appellant appealed the decision to revoke his security clearance to the DHS Appeals Board on October 27, 2011. Since the agency submitted its February 14, 2012 response to the petition for review, there has been no indication from either party that the appellant's appeal of the revocation of his security clearance has been resolved by the DHS Appeals Board, nor has there been any explanation for the length of time that has passed since the matter came before the DHS Appeals Board. Under these circumstances, I would find that sufficient doubt exists as to whether the indefinite suspension is, in fact, still temporary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2165"></span>Accordingly, I would grant the petition for review, vacate the initial decision, and remand the appeal for the submission of additional evidence and argument. I would require the agency to prove by preponderant evidence that the indefinite suspension imposed in this case is still temporary. I would further order the administrative judge to reverse the indefinite suspension, effective upon the date on which the administrative judge found that the indefinite suspension ceased to be temporary, if the agency failed to meet this burden.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ryan v. DHS</span>, PH-0752-13-5283-I-1 (NP 8/18/2014), determined that due process was not violated when the basis for an indefinite suspension was a suspension of a security clearance and no new notice or reply opportunity was provided after the factual basis for the clearance suspension, and ultimately revocation, changed during the continuation of the suspension. That conclusion was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Ryan v. DHS</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/14-3181.Opinion.7-9-2015.1.PDF">793 F.3d 1368</a>, 1373-1374 (Fed. Cir. 2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Ryan argues that after she was acquitted, the MSPB improperly declined to exercise jurisdiction to review the indefinite suspension. ("The appeal following Ryan's acquittal...was within the [MSPB's] jurisdiction.") (capitalization modified). "Once the condition subsequent has occurred, the agency must terminate the [indefinite] suspension within a reasonable amount of time." <span class="Italic">Rhodes v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 487 F.3d 1377, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2007). In <span class="Italic">Rhodes</span>, the petitioner was indefinitely suspended following indictment on criminal charges, and was later acquitted. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1379. No security clearance was at issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By contrast, in this case the condition subsequent was not the acquittal of criminal charges, but the "final determination...by the FEMA [OCSO] with respect to [Ms. Ryan's] future eligibility for access to classified information." The letter informing Ms. Ryan that her security clearance was revoked is dated July 26, 2013. Therefore, at the time of the AJ's decision that led to the MSPB's decision in <span class="Italic">Ryan II</span>--July 15, 2013--a final determination with respect to her access to classified information had not occurred. Moreover, the eventual condition subsequent in this case--which took the form of clearance revocation--meant that at no point following her clearance suspension did Ms. Ryan hold the necessary qualifications for her position. The MSPB correctly held it is without authority to order the agency to return an uncleared employee to a position that requires a security clearance. <span class="Italic">See Skees v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 864 F.2d 1576, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1989) ("If the Board cannot review the employee's loss of security clearance, it is even further beyond question that it cannot review the Navy's judgment that the position itself requires the clearance.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent Ms. Ryan is arguing the MSPB should consider whether the determination with respect to her security clearance, as opposed to her indefinite suspension, was unduly delayed, the Supreme Court has stated "no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 528. The Court explained that "[f]or reasons...too obvious to call for enlarged discussion, the protection of classified information must be committed to the broad discretion of the agency responsible." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 529 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Gargiulo v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.</span>, 727 F.3d 1181, 1185 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (Plaintiff has "no due process rights with respect to the procedures used to determine whether to suspend or revoke his security clearance."). An agency's broad discretion in evaluating eligibility for a security clearance suggests the agency similarly has broad discretion to determine how much time is required to evaluate whether the revocation of a suspended clearance is appropriate.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In any event, Ms. Ryan has not established the time between the suspension and revocation of her security clearance was clearly excessive or unreasonable. Ms. Ryan's access to classified information was suspended on March 28, 2012 and she was acquitted of criminal charges on February 19, 2013. Her security clearance was revoked approximately five months later, on July 26, 2013. This court has previously observed that security clearance investigations "often take up to a year." <span class="Italic">Griffin</span>, 864 F.2d at 1581; <span class="Italic">see also Gargiulo</span>, 727 F.3d at 1182-83 (approximately sixteen-month period between suspension of clearance and revocation of clearance).</p>

Appx. 585</a>, 590 n.6 (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP), rejected a challenge to an indefinite suspension that, at seven months, was alleged to be unreasonably long:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Lucena also argues that "the length of [his] suspension was beyond the bounds of reasonableness and contrary to the [DEA's] procedures and policies." However, Mr. Lucena relies on a mischaracterization of the record to support his argument that the length of his suspension was unreasonable. <span class="Italic">Compare id</span>. (asserting that the DCI testified that "he could not recall any other employee being suspended for the same length of time as [Mr. Lucena]" (citing P.A. 61-65)), <span class="Italic">with</span> P.A. 61-62 (Q: "Now you testified earlier there is no rule regarding length of time.... What was the average...?" A: "I'm not prepared to provide an answer to that question.... [I]t's critical to point out the fact that each one of these matters is separate and unique unto itself. And as a result, the length of time for which the indefinite suspension is in effect will be driven by the underlying matters which require investigation[.]").
