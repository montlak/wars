<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-221"><span class="space">4.</span> Announcement or Warning of Action to Be Taken</h4>
<p class="noindent">The obligation of management to provide the union with an opportunity to be present to safeguard the interests of unit employees at a formal meeting concerning grievances, personnel policies or practices, or other employment conditions extends to meetings, not just discussions, even if the meetings only announce changes in policies and no discussion is elicited from employees present at the meeting. In this manner the union will be assured the opportunity to hear, along with unit employees, about matters of interest to unit employees and be in a position to take appropriate action to safeguard their interests. Section 7114(a)(2)(A) rights should not be negated by a management determination to refuse to entertain questions or to engage in a dialogue at the meeting. <span class="Italic">DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Texas Adjutant Gen. Dept., 149th TAC Fighter Group, Kelly AFB and AFGE, Texas Air Nat'l Guard Council of Locals</span>, 15 FLRA 529, 532 (1984) (concerning formal meeting called to announce change in workweek, planned staffing changes); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Bastrop and AFGE Local 3828</span>, 51 FLRA 1339, 1343 (1996) (if formal meeting occurs, right to union notification attaches even though no dialogue occurs at meeting). A meeting called to announce some changes in working conditions, initiated by management and conducted by the head official in the branch office, with unit employees required to attend, was formal. The failure to advise the union of the meeting and to give it an opportunity to be present was a violation of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">Office of Program Operations, SSA, San Francisco Region and AFGE, Council of Social Security Dist. Office Locals</span>, 15 FLRA 70, 73 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent">An example of a formal discussion involving announcement of a reorganization, having possible future adverse impact on employees, with the opportunity for questions during the meeting (although none were asked), is <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Kirtland AFB and AFGE Local 2263,</span> 64 FLRA 166, 167, 174-75 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The head of Directorate 12 (Commander) notified all MSD employees of a meeting scheduled for April 16. All MSD employees were required to attend and several employees were required to cancel their regular day off in order to attend the meeting. The Union was not notified of the meeting.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The meeting was held in the Commander's conference room, which is outside the MSD work area. The highest-ranking officials of the sub-divisions of MSD were also in attendance. The Commander announced that there would be a reorganization and realignment of MSD that would take effect on April 19. He informed employees that: (1) MSD would expand from two divisions to four; (2) each division would have new leadership; (3) similar functions would be co-located in the same division; and (4) employees would have to be moved to centralize them with their new divisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Commander asked for questions and when there were none, he turned the meeting over to another management official. At this point, various management officials discussed the reorganization. The meeting lasted about an hour, with the Commander's announcement and comments taking about 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To find that a union has a right to representation under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, it must be shown that the following elements exist: (1) there must be a discussion; (2) which is formal; (3) between one or more representatives of the agency and one or more unit employees or their representatives; (4) concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practice or other general condition of employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Army, New Cumberland Army Depot, New Cumberland, Pa.,</span> 38 FLRA 671, 676 (1990) (citing <span class="Italic">Veterans Admin., Wash, D.C. and VA Med. Ctr., Brockton Div., Brockton, Mass.,</span> 37 FLRA 747, 753 (1990); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Bureau of Prisons,</span> <span class="Italic">FCI</span> (<span class="Italic">Ray Brook, N.Y.</span>), 29 FLRA 584, 588-89 (1987)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent contends that the meeting was not a formal discussion because it did not involve any personnel policy or practice or other general condition of employment.&#x2003;According to the Respondent, the purpose of the meeting was merely to provide information concerning the reorganization and change in lines of supervision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has emphasized that the intent behind &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) is to afford an exclusive representative the opportunity to be present at discussions addressing matters of interest to unit employees in order to take "appropriate action" to safeguard their interests. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Def, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Tex.

As such, &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) was designed to address situations precisely such as this one where there is a high potential for changes to employees' conditions of employment. In this respect, contrary to the Respondent's contentions, reorganizations and changes in lines of supervision may result in changes in the conditions of employment of unit employees. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Health and Human Servs., SSA, Baltimore, Md.,</span> 41 FLRA 1309 (1991) (<span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore</span>) (reorganizing work of claims representatives). Moreover, such "effects may surface not only through actual past effects but also through likely future effects." <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA,</span> 446 F.3d 162, 165 (D.C. Cir. 2006).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Respondent characterizes the disputed meeting as one meant only to "provide information" about the reorganization, it is clear that reasonably foreseeable effects of a reorganization are reassignments, relocations, and changes in assigned duties. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., SSA, Baltimore,</span> 41 FLRA at 1318; <span class="Italic">Dep't of Transp, FAA,</span> 19 FLRA 472, 476 (1985). Moreover, the Respondent concedes that, at the April meeting, it mentioned the possibility of relocating employees to new offices. Thus, the meeting implicates the Union's rights to safeguard the interests of unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent also contends that, at the time of the hearing, only two employees had been relocated. However, in resolving the complaint, the issue is whether the meeting involved a personnel policy or practice or other general condition of employment. In this regard, it was reasonably foreseeable at the April meeting that employees might be relocated. Indeed, the Respondent acknowledged that possibility. Similarly, the potential also existed for a change in duties for some employees; indeed, the Judge found that such changes actually occurred as a result of the reorganization. That given duties are within an employee's position description does not prevent the assignment of those duties from constituting a change in conditions of employment, if the employee had not been performing those duties before a change. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Justice, INS, United States Border Patrol, San Diego Sector, San Diego, Cal.,</span> 35 FLRA 1039, 1040 (1990) (<span class="Italic">San Diego Sector</span>); <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore,</span> 41 FLRA at 1310-14. <span class="Italic">Cf. United States Dep't of Homeland Sec, Border and Transp. Sec. Directorate, United States Customs and Border Prot., Border Patrol, Tucson Sector, Tucson, Ariz.,</span> 60 FLRA 169, 175 (2004) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring) (<span class="Italic">Tucson Sector</span>) (distinguishing <span class="Italic">San Diego Sector</span> on the grounds there is no change in duties being performed).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the subject matter of the April meeting involved personnel policies or practices or other general conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See SSA, Baltimore,</span> 41 FLRA at 1317 (a matter concerns conditions of employment of unit employees if it pertains to unit employees and is directly connected to the work situation or employment relationship of those employees). Moreover, the Judge found that such changes occurred. Accordingly, we find that the Judge properly found that the meeting constituted a formal discussion and deny the Respondent's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">The question in <span class="Italic">DHUD and AFGE</span>, 15 FLRA 438, 439 (1984), was whether a meeting called to inform employees of a RIF, providing an opportunity to <span id="page_1482"></span>ask questions, constituted a formal meeting. FLRA concluded it was formal. The meeting was conducted by two second-level supervisors of the unit employees and two other managers were present. Prepared materials concerning the RIF were passed out, and attendance was mandatory. The subject of the meeting, a RIF, concerned personnel policy, practices, or general conditions of employment. The failure of the agency to provide the union with an opportunity to be present constituted a violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (8), but there was no unlawful bypass of the union. There was no evidence that the employer attempted to deal directly with the employees concerning their conditions of employment. Under the test in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Field Operations</span>, 10 FLRA 115 (1982), that a discussion concerns a grievance, any personnel policy or practices, or other general conditions of employment is not the sole determining factor of whether a union shall be given the opportunity to be represented. The discussion also must be formal. An unscheduled meeting--with several subordinates, called at the initiative of a first-line supervisor, lasting no more than 10 minutes, having no formal agenda, and convened to announce a unilateral change in personnel practices involving sick leave call-in procedures--was not a formal meeting. <span class="Italic">DLA, Defense Depot Tracy and Laborers Int'l Union, Local 1276</span>, 14 FLRA 475, 477 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Elkton and AFGE Local 607</span>, 63 FLRA 280, 280-83 (2009), determined there was no violation when the union was given the opportunity to be present at a meeting between an employee and the warden when the warden informed the employee that he had decided to terminate him, but the union was not permitted to participate in later meetings between the employee and facility staff relative to administrative matters relating to the termination. There was no formal meeting after the termination notice because there was nothing further to discuss about the employee's working conditions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent provided the employee with a notice of proposed removal.&#x2003;The employee notified the Respondent that the Charging Party would represent him in the proposed termination proceedings. The employee and his Charging Party representative subsequently attended a meeting with the Respondent's Warden, at which they gave an oral response to the notice of proposed removal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Warden announced his decision in the case during a meeting in his office a few days later.&#x2003;Present at the meeting were the Warden, the Associate Warden, the Employee Services Specialist, the employee, and the Charging Party representative. The Warden read the final notice of termination aloud up to the section addressing the employee's appeal rights. After the notice was read, the employee and his representative asked a question about overtime pay. The Warden stated that the issue of overtime could be addressed during the employee's out-processing and that the meeting was over. The Charging Party representative requested to remain with the employee for his out-processing, but the Warden dismissed him and the Associate Warden escorted him out of the office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, the employee and the Employee Services Specialist left the Warden's office and were met by the Respondent's Psychologist. The Psychologist asked if the employee wanted to use the services of the Employee Assistance Program (EAP). The employee declined.<span class="Italic"> </span>Thereafter, all three moved to a conference room to wait for the employee's meeting with the Employee Services Manager. The Judge found that the purpose of the meeting with the Employee Services Manager was to "complete the administrative actions needed [for the employee's] out-process."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The GC filed a complaint alleging that the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute by refusing to allow a representative of the Charging Party to attend the meeting conducted by the Respondent's Employee Services Manager following the employee's termination. At the hearing, the Judge granted the GC's motion to amend the complaint to add the employee's interactions with the Psychologist and the Employee Services Specialist.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge found that the Charging Party's "right to represent a bargaining unit employee in an adverse action" did not include "post decision administrative actions undertaken to effectuate the final decision[.]" The Judge based his decision on his analysis of <span class="Italic">438th Air Base Group (MAC), McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey,</span> 28 FLRA 1112 (1987) <span class="Italic">(McGuire) </span>and its holding that unions have a right under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) of the Statute to "participate[&#8197;] [in] the delivery of an adverse action decision[.]" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 11, 7-13. The Judge determined that there was no valid reason to extend <span class="Italic">McGuire</span> to cover "administrative actions resulting from a final decision [i]n an adverse action."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge also found that <span class="Italic">McGuire </span>could be distinguished from the instant case because the Charging Party representative was present at the time the final disciplinary decision was rendered and because the meeting ended thereafter. According to the Judge, after the notice was read by the Warden, "there was nothing left to discuss or negotiate and no further action to be taken on behalf of the employee." In this regard, the Judge found that the administrative matters addressed in the employee's meeting with the Employee Services Manager "flowed from the adverse action, [but] were not part of the disciplinary process for which the employee was represented." Because the Judge found that the complaint made "no allegation regarding any interaction the employee had with other individuals after he and his [Charging Party] representative left the Warden's personal office and before he entered [the Employee Services Manager's] office by himself[,]" he did not specifically address the employee's interactions with the Employee Services Specialist or the Psychologist.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the Judge recommended that the complaint be dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Judge Did Not Err in His Factual and Legal Findings Regarding the Termination Meeting</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well-established in Authority precedent that "[a]gencies unlawfully bypass an exclusive representative when they communicate directly with bargaining unit employees concerning grievances, disciplinary actions and other matters relating to the collective bargaining relationship." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Bastrop, Tex., </span>51 FLRA 1339, 1346 (1996) (quoting<span class="Italic"> Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Soc. Sec. Admin., Balt., Md.</span> &#x0026; <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin., Region X, Seattle, Wash., </span>39 FLRA 298, 311 (1991) <span class="Italic">(SSA, Region X)).</span> Such conduct constitutes direct dealing with an employee, and is violative of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute, because it interferes with the union's rights under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) of the Statute to act for and represent all employees in the bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Such conduct also constitutes an independent violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) of the Statute because it demeans the union and inherently interferes with the rights of employees to designate and rely on the union for representation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1346-47. The Authority has held that meetings between employees and agency representatives covering administrative matters in an instructional manner do not bypass the union. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Soc. Sec. Admin.,</span> 16 FLRA 232, 243 (1984) <span class="Italic">(HHS)</span> (no bypass during employee orientation in absence of evidence that the agency attempted to "deal or negotiate directly with employees, or urged employees to put pressure on the [u]nion to take a certain course of action, or threatened or promised benefits to employees"); <span class="Italic">Def. Logistics Agency, Def. Depot Tracy, Tracy, Cal., </span>14 FLRA 475, 478 (1984)<span class="Italic"> (DLA)</span> (no bypass where meeting was held solely to announce new sick-leave procedure because there was no attempt to "negotiate or to otherwise deal directly with employees concerning the change").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Judge found, and there is no dispute, that the Charging Party representative was present when the employee's final discipline was issued by the Warden. The GC's claim that this meeting, and the administrative events that followed, constituted a "single transaction concerning [the employee's] termination[,]" is unsupported by any precedent or argument. In this regard, we note that the GC has not explained why these interactions, which involved different Respondent officials, different purposes, and movement to different locations, should be considered the same disciplinary meeting. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Guard Bureau, Alexandria, Va.,</span> 459 FLRA 506, 520 (1992) (denying exception unsupported by "case law or any other explanation").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the record supports the Judge's finding that the employee's subsequent meeting with the Employee Services Manager constituted "administrative matters" that had "no influence or impact upon the final [disciplinary] decision already made and tendered[.]" In this regard, the employee described the meeting as "administrative" and the Employee Services Manager stated that the same out-process procedure is followed whether an employee's departure is voluntary or involuntary. Further, both the employee and the Employee Services Manager testified that the topics addressed at the meeting included the employee's retirement contributions, insurance, military service, leave, and final paycheck, and that neither the employee's termination nor his appeal rights were discussed. Accordingly, the preponderance of the evidence supports the Judge's factual finding that the out-processing meeting was solely administrative and had no "influence or impact upon the final decision already made." Based on these facts, the Judge's conclusion that there was no unlawful bypass is consistent with Authority precedent. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., HHS, </span>16 FLRA at 243 (no bypass where agency representative informed employees of administrative matters, including retirement and insurance, in orientation session).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of the claim that the Judge erred in his factual and legal findings, the GC maintains that the meeting with the Employee Services Manager (and others), subsequent to the meeting wherein the Warden read the notice, involved his termination and not "unimportant purely administrative matters." However, on review of the record, we find that this claim is not supported by a preponderance of the evidence. In this regard, the GC's assertion that the Psychologist's offer of EAP assistance "concerned" the employee's termination is unsupported by any factual evidence or legal argument.<span class="Italic"> </span>Likewise, the GC's claim that the employee's request for "evidence that had been used against him[,]" referring to the threat assessment prepared by the Psychologist, concerned his termination is unsupported. We note that there is no basis in the record to conclude that the threat assessment played any role in the termination of the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1483"></span>The GC also maintains that the employee's meeting with the Employee Services Manager concerned the termination because it involved "appeal rights and arbitration issues. However, the testimony of the employee does not support this claim. In this regard, the employee stated that, although the Employee Services Manager gave him a packet of information that included information about Merit Systems Protection Board appeal rights, she did not discuss them with him. Similarly, according to the employee's testimony, the only time the issue of arbitration arose was when he stated that he would be appealing his termination using arbitration and the Employee Services Manager recommended keeping his retirement funds in place until the matter was resolved.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The foregoing supports a conclusion that the meeting with the Employee Services Manager, following the meeting with the Warden, covered only administrative matters in an instructional manner. As a result, we conclude that the Agency did not unlawfully bypass the Charging Party. <span class="Italic">See HHS, </span>16 FLRA at 243; <span class="Italic">DLA</span>, 14 FLRA at 478.</p>
