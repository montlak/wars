<h5 class="h5" id="sec4-124"><span class="space">d.</span> Whistleblowing Prohibited Personnel Practice Complaint or Appeal</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The application of collateral estoppel in appeals involving whistleblowing reprisal is complicated. An employee may assert that reprisal has infected a variety of consecutive personnel actions within the scope of an Individual Right of Action. [Refer to <a href="0100-2023-20-001.html#sec13-1">Chapter 13</a> for Individual Right of Action appeals and whistleblower defenses to adverse actions.] The law is structured so that a particular personnel action may be the subject of a whistleblowing complaint to the Office of Special Counsel and then subject to an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board. Once the appeal is at the MSPB, the appellant may <span class="Italic">seek</span> to amend the whistleblower case to add another personnel action or the failure to take a personnel action, or the threat to take or not take a personnel action. Unless the new matter is separately appealable to the Board, if the matter that is the subject of the amendment has not been first raised with the Office of Special Counsel, the amendment will be rejected and the appellant is left to reinitiate the IRA process as to the new claim with OSC, subject to a later appeal on that matter to MSPB. If the initial MSPB appeal proceeds to a merits determination, and a subsequent MSPB appeal is initiated, the agency may, if it received a favorable result in the first appeal, argue that the Board's determination on reprisal collaterally estops the appellant from litigating reprisal in the second appeal. Or the first appeal may not have reached a merits determination and instead been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, for example, because the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation of whistleblower reprisal. In the subsequent appeal on a different personnel action raised as an IRA, the agency may <span class="Italic">seek</span> to invoke collateral estoppel as a result of the jurisdictional determination of the first appeal. Then there is the question of whether collateral estoppel applies to bar an appellant from pursuing a merits determination in an IRA case if the Office of Special Counsel pursued and did not prevail on a related corrective action case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Special Counsel does not bring many corrective action cases, but if it does bring a case an adverse result would not bar an appellant's separate case (assuming the appellant was not intervenor in the OSC case). Collateral estoppel will not be applied if public policy will be compromised, as would occur through the application of collateral estoppel against an appellant with the effect of compromising the purpose and policy behind the appellant's right to a hearing before the Board. The appellant is not a party to an OSC case; further, the responsibilities of OSC to the appellant are not the same as those of an employee's advocate. Under <span class="Italic">Frazier v. MSPB</span>, 672 F.2d 150, 162 (D.C. Cir. 1982), OSC is not viewed as the employee's representative, but rather the protector of merit system principles (a status that may have changed following the 1989 Whistleblower Amendments [discussed in <a href="0100-2023-20-001.html#sec13-1">Chapter 13</a>, "Prohibited Personnel Practices"] ). Application of collateral estoppel would force appellants to intervene in OSC cases, a result that might hamper OSC's prosecution abilities. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 14 MSPR 333, 337-38 (1983) (denial of an OSC stay extension does not determine any appeal by the employee once the agency's adverse action is undertaken).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency is a party to the earlier proceeding and had a full and fair opportunity to litigate its case, it is collaterally estopped from relitigating issues decided against it in the prior proceeding, <span class="Italic">Mortensen v. Dept. of Army</span>, 27 MSPR 433, 435-37 (1985), with the result that if the agency lost the issue of reprisal when OSC brought a case, the agency would be collaterally estopped from relitigating the underlying reprisal issue during a separate appeal brought by the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case originated when the agency proposed appellant's removal based upon charges of insubordination, unsatisfactory performance, and misuse of employee protective procedures resulting in a disruption of general services. The proposed action, however, was stayed pending the Office of Special Counsel's pursuit of appellant's allegations of reprisal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Department of the Army,</span> 16 M.S.P.R. 178 (1983), the Board found that although retaliation played a significant role in appellant's proposed removal, the agency demonstrated legitimate managerial reasons for the action. Since dual motivation was shown, the Board applied the rule established in <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy City School District v. Doyle,</span> 429 U.S. 274 (1977), to determine whether the agency would have taken the action anyway. In making this determination, the Board found that the agency proved several of the specifications of insubordination and unsatisfactory performance, and concluded that the proposed removal was not the product of a prohibited personnel practice. The agency then effected appellant's removal based upon the charges and specifications sustained in the Special Counsel proceeding. Appellant appealed the action to the Board's Denver Regional Office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official found that the doctrine of collateral estoppel precluded relitigation of the charges sustained in the previous Special Counsel proceeding and appellant's affirmative defense of reprisal. The presiding official concluded, based upon additional evidence submitted by the parties, that appellant's removal promoted the efficiency of the service and was within the bounds of reasonableness. The presiding official, therefore, sustained the agency action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, appellant contends that the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply in this case because the legal analysis employed in the prior proceeding has since been overruled. In this regard, appellant contends that the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit rejected the <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> dual motivation approach in the case of <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Department of the Navy,</span> 720 F.2d 1266 (Fed. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, the judgment on the merits in one suit precludes the relitigation of the same issues in a second suit, regardless of whether the first and second suits were based on the same cause of action. As the Board recognized in <span class="Italic">Chisholm v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 3 MSPB 273, 3 M.S.P.R. 171 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 656 F.2d 42 (3d Cir. 1981), it may apply collateral estoppel to any issue previously adjudicated assuming the following prerequisites for the doctrine exist: the issue in the second suit must be identical to that invoked in the prior action; the issue must have been actually litigated in the prior action; and the determination in the prior action must have been necessary to the resulting judgment. <span class="Italic">See Chisholm, supra.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the charges at issue and appellant's allegation of reprisal are identical to the issues presented in the previous Special Counsel proceeding and were actually litigated in that action. Further, the determinations on those issues in that proceeding were necessary to the resulting judgment. The prerequisites for applying collateral estoppel are therefore satisfied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the prerequisites for collateral estoppel exist, however, the Board may refrain from applying the doctrine if injustice would result or considerations of public policy would be compromised. <span class="Italic">See Payer v. Department of the Army,</span> 19 M.S.P.R. 534, 538 (1984). Applying collateral estoppel against appellant in the present removal proceeding due to the previous Special Counsel adjudication would compromise the purpose and policy behind an appellant's right to a hearing before the Board. Congress provided this right in order to provide employees with the opportunity to rebut agency charges personally and to guarantee a full and fair consideration of their case. <span class="Italic">See Callahan v. Department of the Navy,</span> 748 F.2d 1556 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Further, the Board has held that an appellant's right to a hearing constitutes more than a mere opportunity to testify but includes the opportunity to observe proceedings and provide guidance to her representative. <span class="Italic">See Starkey v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 3 MSPB 377, 3 M.S.P.R. 289 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These opportunities, however, were not provided to appellant in the previous Special Counsel proceeding. Appellant was not a party to the proceeding and the Special Counsel duties are not equivalent to those of <span id="Page_1561"></span>an employee's advocate since there is a significant distinction between the purpose of a Special Counsel corrective action and a Chapter 77 appeal. <span class="Italic">Frazier v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 672 F.2d 150, 162 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Appellant, therefore, was not afforded the opportunity to personally rebut the charges or provide guidance to her representative. Further, affording collateral estoppel effect to Special Counsel corrective actions would force appellants to intervene in those actions in order to assure that their interests are satisfactorily represented. Such intervention, however, may hamper the Special Counsel's pursuit of the case. Under these circumstances, we will not apply collateral estoppel to bar appellant's statutorily provided right to a hearing on the issues in question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency, however, was a party to the prior proceeding and had a full and fair opportunity to litigate its case. It is therefore collaterally estopped from relitigating issues which were decided against it in the prior proceeding. <span class="Italic">See Montana v. United States,</span> 440 U.S. 147 (1979); <span class="Italic">Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore,</span> 439 U.S. 322 (1979). In so finding, we recognize that applying the doctrine against the agency promotes the policies of judicial economy and avoidance of inconsistent findings, and gives conclusive effect to our prior determinations.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">II. The Doctrine of <span class="Italic">Res Judicata</span> Bars Mr. Rose's Appeal</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Rose contends that the MSPB did not properly apply the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. Specifically, he argues that neither the AJ nor the MSPB reached the merits of the whistleblower claim, deciding instead that they did not have jurisdiction over that claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB appropriately determined that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> barred Mr. Rose's whistleblower claim based on its decision in <span class="Italic">Rose II</span>. As to the first <span class="Italic">Carson</span> factor, the MSPB has jurisdiction over Mr. Rose's original appeals challenging "a suspension of more than [fourteen] days" or "a removal." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512; <span class="Italic">see id.</span> &#x00A7; 7513(d). As to the second <span class="Italic">Carson</span> factor, the MSPB issued a final decision on the merits regarding Mr. Rose's prior appeals before giving preclusive effect to those decisions in the instant IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">See Rose II</span>, 2015 WL 4736787, at &#x00B6; 1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the third <span class="Italic">Carson</span> factor, even though Mr. Rose attempts to distinguish his current whistleblowing claim, this appeal involves the same parties and the same operative facts as <span class="Italic">Rose II</span>. In <span class="Italic">Rose II</span>, Mr. Rose challenged the DOD's actions that led to his suspension and removal. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1-2. The same operative facts were discussed in his prior appeal. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00B6; 2 (reviewing Mr. Rose's supervisor's false statements and Mr. Rose's subsequent barment). As such, Mr. Rose could have raised a whistleblower claim based on his suspension or removal in <span class="Italic">Rose II</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.2(b) (2017) (providing jurisdiction to the MSPB over certain appeals relating to whistleblowing and other protected activities). Although Mr. Rose attempted to raise a whistleblower claim before the MSPB in <span class="Italic">Rose II</span>, the MSPB refused to consider it "because he did not identify such a claim for adjudication below or in his prior petition for review." <span class="Italic">Rose II</span>, 2015 WL 4736787, at &#x00B6; 13.

<p class="Body-Text">Because IRA cases have so many jurisdictional components, many IRA cases are dismissed before they get to a hearing and merits determination based on one or another of the jurisdictional problems that are raised in the litigation including, among others: exhaustion of OSC processes; whether a disclosure was made to an appropriate person or entity; whether the disclosure was of a matter falling within the scope of 5 USC 2302(b)(8); whether the disclosure was known to the person or persons responsible for the challenged personnel action. If the IRA case is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, then it is important to keep in mind the distinction between <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> and collateral estoppel, explained in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 92 MSPR 370, 375-76 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-14 (2002) (a USERRA case):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant attempts to renew his USERRA claim that he initially raised in his appeal below.

Department of Justice,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 354, &#x00B6; 6 (2001). We also find that the appellant's renewed USERRA claim is not barred by the doctrines of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> or collateral estoppel. "under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata,</span> a valid, final judgment on the merits of an action bars a second action involving the same parties or their privies based on the same cause of action." <span class="Italic">Peartree v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. 332, 337 (1995). <span class="Italic">Res judicata</span> precludes parties from relitigating issues that were, or could have been, raised in the prior action, and is applicable if: (1) the prior judgment was rendered by a forum with competent jurisdiction; (2) the prior judgment was a final judgment on the merits; and (3) the same cause of action and the same parties or their privies were involved in both cases. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata,</span> however, does not apply to bar a prior claim that has been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Peartree,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. at 338.

Further, the initial decision did not include a final judgement on the merits of the appellant's USERRA claim, as required for applying <span class="Italic">res judicata.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The doctrine of collateral estoppel, however, may preclude a second action in the same forum that dismissed a prior appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Peartree,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. at 338. Collateral estoppel is appropriate when the following conditions are met: (1) an issue is identical to that involved in the prior action; (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior action; (3) the determination on the issue in the prior action was necessary to the resulting judgment; and (4) the party precluded was fully represented in the prior action. <span class="Italic">Kroeger v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, we find that the appellant's USERRA claim was not "actually litigated" in the prior action, and that the administrative judge's mention of the USERRA claim was not necessary to the resulting judgment, as required for applying collateral estoppel. While the appellant first raised the USERRA issue in his petition for appeal, he did not submit any further evidence or argument on it for determination. Further, it does not appear that the administrative judge determined the issue because she only discussed the procedural history of the issue and then dismissed the resignation and retirement claims for lack of jurisdiction.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> is inapplicable here because the appellant's prior Board appeals did not involve the personnel action appealed here--his nonselection for promotion in April 1992.

In dismissing this appeal as <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, the administrative judge relied on <span class="Italic">Byrd v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 56 MSPR 629, 632 (1993). In <span class="Italic">Byrd</span>, however, the prior Board decision to which the Board gave <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> effect involved the same personnel action--the appellant's termination from employment during her probationary period. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 630-31.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, instead, that the doctrine of collateral estoppel is applicable here.[1] The Board's authority to employ the doctrine of collateral estoppel, also called issue preclusion, is well-recognized<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Thomas v. General Services Administration</span>, 794 F.2d 661, 664 (Fed. Cir. 1986).

Department of the Army</span>, 34 MSPR 476, 480 (1987). The Board may apply this doctrine if: (1) the issue previously adjudicated is identical to that now presented; (2) that issue was actually litigated in the prior case; (3) the previous determination of that issue was necessary to the resulting judgment; and (4) the party precluded by the doctrine was fully represented in the prior case. <span class="Italic">See Kroeger v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> precludes relitigation of all issues that were or could have been raised in the prior proceeding, while the doctrine of collateral estoppel only precludes relitigation of issues that were actually litigated and decided in the prior proceeding. <span class="Italic">See Chisholm v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 656 F.2d 42, 47-48 (3rd Cir. 1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the issue previously adjudicated is identical to the issue involved here. The ten alleged disclosures the appellant raised in this appeal were previously raised in his removal appeal. The appellant argues on petition for review that the administrative judge erred by failing to address in her initial decision his eleventh disclosure, "that management had made statements evidencing discrimination on the basis of sex and age against a coworker." The record indicates that the appellant did mention, both in this appeal and in his prior removal appeal, his participation in the coworker's pursuit of an equal employment opportunity complaint based on sex and age. However, the appellant did not include this matter in his list of ten alleged disclosures, and confirmed below that in "the instant appeal...[he was] relying only on the ten disclosures" specified in his petition for appeal. We therefore find that the administrative judge did not err in limiting her consideration to the ten alleged disclosures specifically raised by the appellant. Thus, the issue in the present appeal of whether the ten alleged disclosures constitute protected whistleblowing activity under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) is identical to that adjudicated in the appellant's removal appeal. <span class="Italic">See Fisher,</span> 59 MSPR at 173-74.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, this issue was actually litigated in the prior appeal. The "actual litigation" criterion requires that the issue must have been contested by the parties and resolved by the adjudicator. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mother's Restaurant, Inc. v. Mama's Pizza, Inc.</span>, 723 F.2d 1566, 1570 (Fed. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Raymond</span>, 34 MSPR at 480. Our review of the removal appeal file reveals that the parties contested this issue and that the Board resolved it by concluding that none of the alleged disclosures constituted protected whistleblowing activity under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See Fisher,</span> 59 MSPR at 173-74.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, the previous determination of this issue was necessary to the resulting judgment. The appellant argues on petition for review that this issue was merely part of his affirmative defense in his removal appeal and was therefore irrelevant to the ultimate disposition of that appeal. This argument is without merit. Had the appellant prevailed on his affirmative defense of whistleblower reprisal in the removal appeal, his removal would not have been sustained. Moreover, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has stated that the purpose of this third requirement is "to prevent the incidental or collateral determination of a nonessential issue from precluding reconsideration of that issue in later litigation" and "does not mean that the finding must be so crucial that, without it, the judgment could not stand." <span class="Italic">Mother's Restaurant, Inc.</span>, 723 F.2d at 1571.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant was "fully represented" in his removal appeal. This fourth requirement looks to whether the party to be issue-precluded has had a "full and fair chance to litigate" the issue in question. <span class="Italic">Mother's Restaurant, Inc.</span>, 723 F.2d at 1569-70 n.4. This requirement addresses situations where, e.g., the party to be issue-precluded was not a party in the prior case or there were more than two opposing parties in the prior case, so that it is not immediately apparent whether the party's interests with respect to the issue to be precluded were fully represented in that prior case. <span class="Italic">See Mother's Restaurant Inc.</span>, 723 F.2d at 1572; <span class="Italic">Mortensen v. Department of the Army</span>, 27 MSPR 433, 437 (1985). Thus, contrary to the appellant's <span id="Page_1563"></span>contention below, this requirement does not pertain to whether he was represented by an attorney in the removal appeal, and the fact that he was <span class="Italic">pro se</span> there does not prevent our application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel to the issues adjudicated in that appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends on petition for review that the Board should not preclude him from relitigating the whistleblower reprisal issue adjudicated in the prior removal appeal, because the administrative judge in that prior appeal was biased. The Board has previously determined in the removal appeal that the appellant had failed to establish bias on the part of that administrative judge. <span class="Italic">Fisher,</span> 59 MSPR at 172-73. The appellant's allegation of bias in the present appeal, that certain of the administrative judge's adjudicatory errors concerning the appellant's defenses establish his bias, is different from his allegation of bias in the removal appeal, which concerned the administrative judge's refusal to reschedule the hearing. A claim of bias must be raised as soon as practicable after the party has reasonable cause to believe that the basis for that claim exists, however. <span class="Italic">See Cotton v. Department of Justice</span>, 53 MSPR 397, 403-04, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 985 F.2d 584 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). Because there is no showing that the appellant could not have raised this current allegation of bias in the course of his prior removal appeal, we find that it is not timely raised. Moreover, we find, in any event, that the allegation of bias is patently without merit and is no less frivolous than the allegation of bias raised in the removal appeal....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues on petition for review that the dismissal of this appeal is "premature" because he had filed a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, challenging the Board's final decision in his removal appeal with respect to the whistleblower reprisal issue. That an appeal is pending from the Board's final decision does not preclude the application of the collateral estoppel doctrine to that final decision, unless the appeal removes the entire case to the appellate court and constitutes <span class="Italic">de novo</span> proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Cataulin v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 41 MSPR 681, 683 (1989). Because there is no evidence that the appeal before the district court constitutes <span class="Italic">de novo</span> proceedings, the appeal does not prevent our application of the collateral estoppel doctrine. <span class="Italic">See id....</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if all of the requirements for the application of the collateral estoppel doctrine are met, the Board may refrain from applying the doctrine if injustice would result or other public policy considerations would be compromised. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 35 MSPR 581, 585 (1987). Under the circumstances of this appeal, we find no basis to refrain from applying the doctrine to prevent the appellant's relitigation of the previously adjudicated issue of whether the ten disclosures raised in this appeal constitute protected whistleblowing activity under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Because this issue forms part of the jurisdictional requisites for an IRA appeal, <span class="Italic">see Geyer v. Department of Justice,</span> 63 MSPR 13, 16 (1994), and because this issue has been previously adjudicated against the appellant in the removal appeal, we find that he has failed to establish the Board's jurisdiction over this IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">See Horton v. Department of Transportation</span>, 61 MSPR 421, 422-23 (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Again applying collateral estoppel in the jurisdictional context of an IRA appeal, <span class="Italic">Luecht v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 87 MSPR 297, 305-06 &#x00B6; 16 (2000), determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant...asserts that his demotion in 1998 to the GS-6 Contact Representative position was the result of retaliation for whistleblowing. He previously filed an appeal with the Board alleging that he involuntarily accepted the demotion, and raised a whistleblowing claim in that appeal. The administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the appellant voluntarily accepted the GS-6 position.... The Board denied the appellant's petition for review for failure to meet the review criteria, and the initial decision became the Board's final decision. <span class="Italic">Luecht v. Department of the Navy,</span> 86 MSPR 41 (2000) (Table). Thus, the appellant is collaterally estopped from asserting in this action that the demotion is a personnel action under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(111), an action under chapter 75 of Title V or other disciplinary or corrective action<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Kroeger v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 865 F.2d 235, 239 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, is appropriate when (1) an issue is identical to that involved in the prior action, (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior action, (3) the determination on the issue in the prior action was necessary to the resulting judgment, and (4) the party precluded was fully represented in the prior action).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Schneider v. DHS</span>, 98 MSPR 377, 386 n.4 (2005), resolved, without much decisional clarity, that collateral estoppel did not preclude agency litigation involving a 2003 suspension of a prior whistleblowing reprisal determination because the finding of a protected disclosure was a "matter of mixed fact and law and stipulations relating to such matters are not binding":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1999, the appellant filed an IRA/adverse action appeal of the agency's actions suspending her for 30 days and placing her in absence without leave (AWOL) status, which appeal was docketed as <span class="Italic">Schneider v. Department of Justice</span>, AT-1221-00-0263-W-2. The administrative judge found that the appellant established that the agency took these actions in retaliation for the appellant's whistleblowing activity (disclosing, e.g., that agency officials accepted bribes from aliens to grant immigration benefits and were derelict in their duty to prevent marriage fraud), to which the parties had stipulated. He ordered corrective action. The Board denied the agency's petition for review of the initial decision, which thus became the final decision in the case. <span class="Italic">Schneider v. Department of Justice</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 228 (2002) (Table). Despite the finding in <span class="Italic">Schneider v. Department of Justice</span>, AT-1221-00-0263-W-2, that the disclosures, iterated to form the basis of the appellant's affirmative defense of whistleblowing retaliation in this appeal, were protected, we decline to apply the principle of collateral estoppel to find that these disclosures were protected here. The question of whether a disclosure is protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) is a matter of mixed fact and law and stipulations relating to such matters are not binding. <span class="Italic">See Wojcicki v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 628, 634 (1996).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jensen v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wojcicki v.

Both cases appeared to involve assertions of protected disclosures. The arbitrator apparently did not find whistleblower reprisal, although the Board did. There is no discussion in <span class="Italic">Wojcicki</span> of issue preclusion through <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> or collateral estoppel, other than the statement at 637 n.4: "The appellant's election to grieve his nonselection, allegedly in reprisal for whistleblowing activities, under the collective bargaining agreement did not divest the Board of jurisdiction under the Whistleblower Protection Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Augustine v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, is appropriate when: (1) The issue is identical to that involved in the prior action; (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior action; (3) the determination on the issue in the prior action was necessary to the resulting judgment; and (4) the party against whom issue preclusion is sought had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior action, either as a party to the earlier action or as one whose interests were otherwise fully represented in that action. <span class="Italic">McNeil v. Department of Defense,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 146, &#x00B6; 15 (2005). Here, the application of collateral estoppel fails at the first prong of this test. Although the appellant has raised the identical alleged protected disclosure to Senator McCain's staff in both appeals, the issue in the earlier action was whether, <span class="Italic">after a hearing</span>, the appellant proved by preponderant evidence that the disclosure was protected. The issue in this appeal is whether, <span class="Italic">on the written record</span>, the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that his disclosure was protected. One may make a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction and ultimately be unable to prove the allegation. In an IRA appeal, however, a nonfrivolous allegation that a disclosure is protected is sufficient to satisfy the threshold issue of jurisdiction, provided that the other jurisdictional criteria are met. In order to establish jurisdiction over an IRA appeal, an appellant is not required to prove that he made protected disclosures, merely to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the disclosures were protected. <span class="Italic">See Grubb,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">Rusin,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 298, &#x00B6; 10-11.

One issue was whether the result in an earlier appeal, presenting a corrective action request denied in an initial decision on the merits and involving a particular disclosure characterized as gross mismanagement, precluded raising the same disclosure, characterized as a violation of law, rule, or regulation, in the <span id="Page_1564"></span>subsequent removal appeal that was dismissed for lack of IRA jurisdiction. The Board concluded, again distinguishing a merits determination from the existence of a nonfrivolous allegation in a subsequent case, that the issue could be raised and that it was not barred in a jurisdictional determination through collateral estoppel:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant does not dispute that he raised this disclosure in his prior appeal, and that the administrative judge there found that it was not protected. He argues, however, that the prior inquiry was limited to whether the disclosure evidenced gross mismanagement or gross waste of funds, while he argues here that the disclosure also evidences fraud and a violation of law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, is appropriate when: (1) An issue is identical to that involved in the prior action; (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior action; (3) the determination on the issue in the prior action was necessary to the resulting judgment; and (4) the party against whom issue preclusion is sought had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior action, either as a party to the earlier action or as one whose interests were otherwise fully represented in that action. <span class="Italic">McNeil v. Department of Defense,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 146, &#x00B6; 15 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that these requirements are not satisfied here. Although the appellant has raised the identical alleged protected disclosure in both appeals, the issue in the earlier action was whether, after a hearing, the appellant proved by preponderant evidence that the disclosure was protected. The issue in this appeal, however, is whether, on the written record, the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that his disclosure was protected. An appellant may make a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction and ultimately be unable to prove that allegation. In an IRA appeal, however, a nonfrivolous allegation that a disclosure is protected is sufficient to satisfy the threshold issue of jurisdiction, provided that the other jurisdictional criteria are met, regardless of whether the appellant can ultimately prove that the disclosure is protected. <span class="Italic">See Boechler v. Department of the Interior,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 619, &#x00B6; 17 (2008). Thus, the administrative judge's finding in the earlier appeal, that the appellant did not prove on the merits that his disclosure was protected, does not preclude a finding here that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that his disclosure was protected for purposes of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Boechler</span>, <span class="Italic">Wadhwa,</span> and<span class="Italic"> Parikh</span> were overruled by <span class="Italic">Hau v.

Cir. 2017), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge in the appellant's prior USERRA appeal found jurisdiction under the liberal jurisdictional standard for that statutory scheme, but denied the appellant's request for corrective action, finding in pertinent part that the appellant failed to prove that he was subjected to a hostile work environment. The issue of whether the agency subjected the appellant to a hostile work environment based on his military service was actually litigated in his prior USERRA appeal, and the administrative judge's findings on that issue were necessary to the resulting judgment. The appellant thus is barred by collateral estoppel from arguing that the agency subjected him to a hostile work environment based on his military service, which is the sole basis of his constructive discharge claim in this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because jurisdiction was found in the appellant's initial USERRA appeal, this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Noble</span>. Nevertheless, we conclude that, in light of our finding that collateral estoppel bars relitigation of the hostile work environment claim, and the fact that the appellant has not alleged any acts of harassment that differ from those he relied on in his prior appeal, the appellant cannot in this matter articulate a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency denied him retention in employment based on his military service. <span class="Italic">See Mintzmeyer v. Department of the Interior</span>, 84 F.3d 419, 424 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Accordingly, dismissal for lack of jurisdiction in this matter is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that the Board has held previously that, although an appellant raised identical issues in two separate appeals, an earlier decision that the appellant did not prevail on the merits did not preclude a finding that he made a nonfrivolous allegation establishing jurisdiction in a subsequent appeal. <span class="Italic">Boechler v.

To find jurisdiction and allow this matter to proceed to the merits phase of the case when the appellant is barred by collateral estoppel from presenting any of his merits arguments during such proceedings would defy logic.[*] Furthermore, to do so would cause unnecessary costs to the parties, make the Board complicit in the vexation of multiple lawsuits, waste the Board's resources, and potentially could lead to inconsistent decisions--all evils the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and the Board have declared should be avoided. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., id.; MGA, Inc. v.

The appellant already had received a hearing when his hostile work environment claim was heard in connection with his case designated as MSPB Docket No. SF-4324-13-0300-I-1. However, were a merits hearing held in this matter, the appellant would be precluded from presenting evidence and argument concerning his allegation of a hostile work environment, which is the entire basis of his claim in this case.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hau</span> was affirmed in the consolidated appeals (including that of Mr. Hau), <span class="Italic">Bryant v. MSPB</span>, 878 F.3d 1320, 1327-29 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Petitioners primarily rely on <span class="Italic">Dow Chemical Co. v. Nova Chemicals Corp. (Canada)</span>, 803 F.3d 620, 629 (Fed. Cir. 2015), for the proposition that the change-of-law exception to collateral estoppel should apply to their current appeals. In <span class="Italic">Dow</span>, we noted that the change-of-law exception to collateral estoppel is applicable when (1) the governing law is changed; (2) the prior decision applied the old law; and (3) the change in law compels a different result in the current case. 803 F.3d at 629-30.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Dow</span> does not support the outcome sought by Petitioners. As noted by the Board and the DHS, the substantive USERRA law did not change. Even if we look to the change in the Board's precedent on its jurisdiction, the Board applied the new law to their current USERRA appeals, and Petitioners are <span class="Italic">see</span>king to apply the old law instead. Moreover, the change in law did not make a difference to Petitioners because under the Board's precedent either before or after the change, Petitioners would have been ultimately precluded from relitigating the identical issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case does not present a situation in which pursuing a certain course of action was unavailable or otherwise futile under the then-controlling precedent. <span class="Italic">See Blonder-Tongue Labs., Inc. v. Univ. of Ill. Found</span>., 402 U.S. 313, 350 (1971). Although the Board overruled its own precedent and changed its law on jurisdiction in <span class="Italic">Hau II</span>, which may have been unexpected, that change does not justify Petitioners' abandoning their claims in <span class="Italic">Bryant I</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span>king review of the first AJ's decision was available under the then-existing Board's precedent. Petitioners did not abandon review of their USERRA appeals in <span class="Italic">Bryant I</span> out of any futility of such pursuit under the old law, but out of their apparent belief that their best course of action was to file separate USERRA appeals including the constructive discharge claims. Simply put, the change-of-law exception does not save Petitioners from their deliberate choice of action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, Petitioners' appeal to general equity considerations also fails. Although we have noted that the USERRA statutes are "interpreted broadly in favor of individuals returning from military service," <span class="Italic">Crowford v. Dep't of Army</span>, 718 F.3d 1361, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2013), such interpretive canon favoring military members is not relevant here. First, determining the Board's jurisdiction in the instant case does not involve any statutory interpretation. What Petitioners are actually arguing is that they should be given a chance to bring their second USERRA appeals to the full Board, in view of the apparent leniency afforded to military members under the overall USERRA scheme, in further view of the first AJ's footnote in <span class="Italic">Bryant I</span> and the change of the Board's precedent regarding the effect of collateral estoppel on its jurisdiction. However, as conceded during oral argument, Petitioners do not contend that the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Hau II</span> overruling its precedent to address preclusion at the jurisdictional stage was incorrect. Rather, Petitioners are urging us to find an exception to the Board's admittedly correct law on jurisdiction and collateral estoppel due to the peculiar circumstances of their appeals. We decline to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In general, courts do not liberally invoke exceptions to collateral estoppel based on the particular circumstances of a case. <span class="Italic">See</span> 18 Charles Alan Wright &#x0026; Arthur R.

If anything, Petitioners' filing of the second, identical USERRA appeals, with a bare recitation of "constructive discharge" entirely predicated on the previously heard and decided hostile work environment issue, demonstrates that they acted <span id="Page_1565"></span>deliberately and were not unsuspecting parties unjustly precluded from being heard. In view of the admittedly identical nature of Petitioners' successive appeals and their voluntary abandonment of their first appeals, we do not find that an exception should apply here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that Petitioners' second USERRA appeals are barred by collateral estoppel and agree with the Board that an appellant cannot make a nonfrivolous allegation of a USERRA violation if its contentions are wholly precluded. Indeed, this case illustrates the flaw in the Board's now-overruled precedent. As noted by the Board, even if Petitioners had been granted a hearing in the second, identical USERRA appeals, because they did not make any additional allegations beyond those in <span class="Italic">Bryant I</span>, Petitioners would not have been able to present any content at the hearing. <span class="Italic">See Hau II</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. at 627 n.*. Such a hearing would have been a waste of resources, contrary to the policies underlying the doctrine of collateral estoppel. <span class="Italic">See Montana v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore conclude that the Board correctly dismissed Petitioners' appeals for lack of jurisdiction because Petitioners' constructive discharge claims under USERRA are precluded by collateral estoppel. We have considered the remaining arguments and find them unpersuasive.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Detrich was removed from his position at the Department of the Navy in 2004 based on eight charges of misconduct. One of these charges was as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Failure to follow instructions/inappropriate conduct--On 21 May 2004 you sent an email message...to Mr. Jeffrey Wataoka, Director of Human Resources Service Center (HRSC), Department of Navy, Pacific. ...In the email you made allegations of abusive treatment by Management.

I have also cautioned you by e-mail regarding the inappropriate remarks and accusations you continue to make outside your chain-of-command....</p>

The WPA does not permit an agency to discipline an employee for disclosing protected information merely because that information has been reported outside the chain of command.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In September 2010, Detrich filed an IRA appeal with the Board, <span class="Italic">seek</span>ing a remedy for his 2004 removal under the WPA. Detrich alleged that he was improperly removed from his position for reporting agency abuses by email to individuals other than his immediate supervisor. The administrative judge directed Detrich to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed on grounds of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. Detrich argued that the error in date caused him to not understand the charge, and that because the misidentified email was not identified until Detrich was being examined in the earlier hearing, he did not have the opportunity to elicit testimony concerning this email, which hindered his ability to make a WPA claim. The administrative judge dismissed the appeal as barred by <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, finding that Detrich could not challenge the same removal action under a new legal theory. <span class="Italic">Detrich v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">"Under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> (or claim preclusion), '[a] final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.'" <span class="Italic">Ammex, Inc. v.

As long as the prior decision was rendered by a court with competent jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">see Gillig v. Nike, Inc.</span>, 602 F.3d 1354, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2010), <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> applies when "(1) the parties are identical or in privity; (2) the first suit proceeded to a final judgment on the merits; and (3) the second claim is based on the same set of transactional facts as the first." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore</span>, 439 U.S. 322, 326 n.5 (1979)); <span class="Italic">see Phillips/May</span>, 524 F.3d at 1268.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is uncontested that the earlier judgment against Detrich involved identical parties and was in a court with competent jurisdiction. The earlier case was also a final judgment "on the merits" because it was based on the parties' substantive arguments at the time, rather than dismissed on jurisdictional or other procedural grounds.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only issue, then, is whether Detrich's WPA claim is based on the same set of transactional facts as the prior case. Detrich argues that because of the typographic error in the inappropriate-use-of-email charge, his present claim is based on a different set of facts: "the set of facts that only became available to the appellant after the error in the charge was revealed." Newly discovered facts relating to a previously litigated claim may on rare occasions form the basis for a new claim, such as in the case of negligent misrepresentation by the other party. <span class="Italic">See Restatement (Second) of Judgments</span> &#x00A7; 26 cmt. j (1982). Here, however, the error was discovered during the prior case, and the error was found to be harmless. <span class="Italic">See Detrich</span>, 251 F. App'x at 680 n.1. Although Detrich argues that this error was not harmless because it prevented him from questioning witnesses about the email, this issue cannot be relitigated now. Detrich's WPA claim is thus "based on the same, or nearly the same factual allegations" as the prior case--namely, the email he sent on May 31, 2004--which is sufficient to satisfy the "same set of transactional facts" element. <span class="Italic">Ammex</span>, 334 F.3d at 1056.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We note initially that the appellant has asserted, and the agency has not disputed, that he was covered by a collective bargaining agreement when the agency removed him from Federal employment. As an employee covered by a negotiated grievance procedure who raised allegations of whistleblower reprisal, the appellant therefore could have elected one of the three remedies set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g). Further, we have found that an employee has not elected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g)(4)(A) to pursue a Board appeal unless he has "timely filed a notice of appeal under the applicable appellate procedures." <span class="Italic">See Brundin</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. at 336.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the appellant's prior removal appeal was untimely filed, as discussed above, the appellant did not "elect" the Board remedy by filing that appeal.[2] <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 336. In addition, he apparently has not challenged his removal by using the negotiated grievance procedure. Thus, the appellant did not timely elect either of the first two remedies identified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g), and he could properly elect the remaining remedy of raising allegations of whistleblower reprisal with OSC in connection with his removal and subsequently filing an appeal. <span class="Italic">See Shannon,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6; 17. Accordingly, the 65-day limit applicable to otherwise appealable action (OAA) appeals, which are first filed before OSC, was the appropriate timeliness standard. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(b). Because the record shows that the appellant met this requirement, his appeal should not have been dismissed as untimely filed. <span class="Italic">See Westmoreland v.

Under these circumstances, the administrative judge improperly applied the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> to the "protected disclosure" issue because that issue was not properly before the Board in the 1992 IRA appeal.</p>
