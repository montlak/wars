<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-215"><span class="space">e.</span> Classification Issue</h5>
<p class="noindent">Many of the cases earlier noted touch on the distinction between non-grievable classification issues and temporary promotion claims based on work temporarily performed in previously-classified positions. FLRA's most recent guidance on the distinction is found in <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center, Twentynine Palms, and AFGE Local 2018,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-74.html">73 FLRA 379</a> (2022) (Member Kiko dissenting in part), <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Prior to <span class="Italic">Twentynine Palms</span>, FLRA often distinguished nongrievable classification disputes and grievable claims to temporary promotions, <span class="Italic">DHHS, Denver and NTEU Chap. 235</span>, 56 FLRA 133, 134-35 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7121(c)(5) of the Statute, grievances concerning "the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction of grade or pay of an employee" are removed from the scope of the negotiated grievance procedures. The Authority has construed the term "classification" in section 7121(c)(5) as involving "the analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a class under the position-classification plan established by [the Office of Personnel Management] under chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code." <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2025 and U.S. Department of the Air Force, Ninth Reconnaissance Wing, Beale Air Force Base, California</span>, 50 FLRA 39, 42 (1994) (quoting 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.101(c)); <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Department of the Army, Fort</span> <span class="Italic">Polk, Louisiana and National Association of Government Employees, Local R5-168, </span>44 FLRA 1548, 1552 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has distinguished between two situations in assessing whether a grievance concerns the classification of a position.&#x2003;Where the substance of a grievance concerns the grade level of the duties assigned to, and performed by the grievant, the grievance concerns the classification of a position within the meaning of section 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Social</span> <span class="Italic">Security Administration and American Federation of</span> <span class="Italic">Government Employees, Local 1923, AFL-CIO,</span> 31 FLRA 933, 936 (1988). However, where the substance of a grievance concerns whether the grievant is entitled to a temporary promotion by reason of having performed the established duties of a higher-graded position, the grievance does not concern the classification of a position within the meaning of section 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Marine Corps Air Station,</span> <span class="Italic">Cherry Point, North Carolina and International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Local</span> <span class="Italic">2297, </span>42 FLRA 795, 801-02 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator determined that the Union was "not complaining about <span id="page_2087"></span>classification, they are complaining about an individual not being properly compensated while on detail, and not being temporarily promoted as recognized and required by the Contract...." On review of existing Agency position descriptions, the Arbitrator found that the grievant had performed the established duties of the GS-11 Computer Specialist position. As the substance of the grievance, as found by the Arbitrator, concerned whether the grievant was entitled to a temporary promotion under the parties' agreement for performing previously-classified duties, the award does not concern the classification of a position and therefore, is not deficient as contrary to section 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings and Appeals,</span> <span class="Italic">Mobile, Alabama and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3627, </span>55 FLRA 778, 779-80 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA explained the distinction between a classification issue and temporary promotion entitlement, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Polk and NAGE Local R5-168</span>, 44 FLRA 1548, 1551-52 (1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7121(c)(5) precludes any grievance concerning "the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction in grade or pay of an employee." The Authority has uniformly and repeatedly held that grievances over whether a grievant was entitled under a collective bargaining agreement to have been temporarily promoted by reason of having temporarily performed the duties of a higher-graded position do not concern the classification of any position within the meaning of section 7121(c)(5) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has viewed the meaning of "classification" under section 7121(c)(5) in the context of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.101(c), which defines the term as "the analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a class under the position-classification plan established by OPM [Office of Personnel Management] under chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code." As emphasized by the Union, the grievant did not claim before the Arbitrator that her position should be reclassified because she had performed the duties of a higher-graded position. Before the Arbitrator, the grievant merely claimed that she was entitled to have been temporarily promoted for the time during which she performed the duties of the higher-graded budget analyst position. The Arbitrator did not reclassify the grievant's position at the higher grade. Instead, in resolving the grievance the Arbitrator merely examined the duties of the GS-7 budget assistant position and the GS-9 budget analyst position as previously established and classified by management. The question resolved by the Arbitrator was whether the grievant was entitled to a temporary promotion for performing the duties of the GS-9 budget analyst position for an extended period of time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We refuse to find that such a grievance concerns the classification of any position within the meaning of section 7121(c)(5) of the Statute.... Moreover, we are not persuaded otherwise by the grievant's request at the time she filed her grievance to be "non-competitively promoted to the GS-9 Budget Analyst position." Regardless of what the grievant may have intended by that request, the sole issue submitted to and resolved by the Arbitrator was whether the grievant was entitled to have been temporarily promoted....</p>
<p class="noindent">The distinction between nonarbitrable classification issues and arbitrable temporary promotion claims was succinctly parsed by <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1757 and Dept. of Air Force, Brooks AFB</span>, 58 FLRA 575, 576 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute, a grievance concerning "the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction of grade or pay of an employee" is removed from the permissible scope of a negotiated grievance procedure<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., NTEU Chapter 73</span>, 57 FLRA 412, 413 (2001). The Authority has construed the term "classification" in &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) as involving "the analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a class under the position-classification plan established by [the Office of Personnel Management] under chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code." <span class="Italic">See id</span>.

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has distinguished between two situations in assessing whether a grievance concerns the classification of a position.&#x2003;Where the substance of a grievance concerns the grade level of the duties permanently assigned to, and performed by, the grievant, the Authority finds that the grievance concerns the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5)<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. at 414. In contrast, where the substance of the grievance concerns whether the grievant is entitled to be compensated at a higher rate of pay by reason of having temporarily performed the duties of an established higher-grade position, the Authority has long held that the grievance does not concern the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5)<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. When an arbitrator has found such a grievance to be precluded by &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5), the Authority has determined that the award is deficient and has remanded the matter to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator to have the arbitrator resolve the merits of the grievance<span class="Italic">.

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the grievance concerns the grievant's claim that she had been temporarily assigned the duties of an established higher-graded position for an extended period of time and that consequently, she was entitled to a temporary promotion pursuant to Article 13 of the agreement. The grievant did not claim that her permanent GS-6 position was improperly classified. Instead, she claimed that she had been temporarily assigned the duties of an established GS-9 position. Accordingly, the Arbitrator was not being asked to classify a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5)<span class="Italic">. See AFGE Local 987</span>, 37 FLRA at 390; <span class="Italic">Robins AFB</span>, 37 FLRA at 159. Rather, the Arbitrator was required to decide only whether the grievant was temporarily assigned the duties of an established higher-grade position and whether the grievant was entitled to have been temporarily promoted under the terms of the parties' agreement. Furthermore, nothing in 7121(c) precluded the Arbitrator from considering the proper classification of the temporary duties allegedly performed by the grievant in resolving whether she was entitled to a temporary promotion<span class="Italic">.

On the other hand, where the substance of a grievance concerns whether the grievant is entitled to a temporary promotion under a collective bargaining agreement by reason of having performed the duties of a higher-graded position, the grievance does not concern the classification of a position within the meaning of section 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval</span> <span class="Italic">Aviation Depot, Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point, North</span> <span class="Italic">Carolina and International Association of Machinists and</span> <span class="Italic">Aerospace Workers, Local 2297</span>, 42 FLRA 795, 801-02 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator determined that the grievance concerned a claim that the grievant had been assigned the duties of a higher-graded position and that the assignment constituted a "detail" to a higher-graded position, thereby entitling her to a temporary promotion pursuant to the parties' agreement. The grievant did not claim that her permanent GS-5 position was improperly classified or that her permanent position should be classified at a higher grade. Therefore, the Arbitrator was not asked to classify a position within the meaning of section 7121(c) of the Statute. Rather, the Arbitrator was required to decide whether the grievant was assigned the duties of a higher-graded position and entitled to compensation for the performance of those duties under the terms of the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator determined that the grievance concerned a claim that the grievants had been assigned the duties of a higher-graded position and that the assignment constituted a "detail" to a higher-graded position. The grievants did not claim that their permanent GS-12 positions were improperly classified; the grievants asserted that they were assigned the duties of an already classified, higher-graded position and entitled to compensation for the performance of those duties under the terms of the parties' agreement. As the substance of the grievance before the Arbitrator concerned whether the grievants were entitled to a temporary promotion under the parties' agreement, we find that the award does not concern the classification of a position and, therefore, is not deficient as contrary to section 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Housing and Urban Development, Louisiana State</span> <span class="Italic">Office, New Orleans, Louisiana and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3475, </span>53 FLRA 1611, 1616-17 (1998); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force, Warner Robins Air Force Logistics Center, Robins Air Force Base, <span id="page_2088"></span>Georgia and American Federation</span> <span class="Italic">of Government Employees, Local 987, </span>37 FLRA 155, 159 (1990).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has distinguished between two situations in assessing whether a grievance concerns the classification of a position.&#x2003;Where the substance of a grievance concerns the grade level of the duties permanently assigned to and performed by the grievant, the grievance concerns the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Soc.</span> <span class="Italic">Sec.

<p class="noindent-1">Before the Arbitrator, the Union contended that the dispute hinged on whether the grievants performed the higher graded duties described in the Austin PD. The Arbitrator's ultimate conclusion was that "the evidence [wa]s insufficient to show that th[e g]rievants are performing [those higher graded duties]." This is not, on its face, a classification determination. The Arbitrator did not evaluate the grade level of the duties permanently assigned to and performed by the grievants to determine their appropriate classification. Rather, he focused simply on whether the grievants performed the established duties of a higher graded position, comparing the grievants' duties to those performed by the CAF Processing Clerks at the Austin Service Center, conceded by both parties to be properly classified as GS-503-5. The Arbitrator concluded that the grievants had not demonstrated that they performed those higher graded duties. The Arbitrator thus avoided treating the grievance as one dealing with the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Union's first exception, the Arbitrator did not impermissibly rely on classification standards rather than the employee PDs in determining the duties of the Austin clerks. Instead, the Arbitrator found that the concededly properly-classified Austin PD was in a series that required knowledge of budgeting, financial management, and accounting. The Arbitrator also determined from the record that the duties performed by the grievants did not require such knowledge. Further, the Arbitrator noted the lack of other testimony that would support the claim that the grievants performed higher graded duties in the manner required by the parties' agreement to justify additional compensation....</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA expanded on the relation between arbitration, temporary promotions, and classification issues in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Warner Robins Air Logistics Ctr., Robins AFB and AFGE Local 987</span>, 37 FLRA 155, 158-59 (1990). An arbitrator had jurisdiction over a grievance that claimed an employee was entitled to a temporary promotion because she performed duties at the GS-7 pay level and was paid only at the GS-6 level. FLRA determined that the grievance was not excluded by &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute, precluding arbitration of matters pertaining to classification of a position:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has consistently held to be negotiable contract provisions which permit employees to receive temporary promotions when they are assigned to perform the duties of higher-graded positions.... Such provisions are enforceable in arbitration proceedings....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's reliance on [<span class="Italic">United States v. Testan</span>, 424 U.S. 392 (1976),] is misplaced. <span class="Italic">Testan</span> concerned employees' claims that their positions were wrongly classified. The Supreme Court ruled that Federal employees are entitled to receive only the salary of the position to which they are appointed, even though they may have performed the duties of another position or claim that they should have been placed in a higher grade. <span class="Italic">See Testan</span>, 424 U.S. at 406. The Court concluded that "neither the Classification Act nor the Back Pay Act creates a substantive right in the respondents to backpay for the period of their claimed wrongful classifications." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 407.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Testan</span> does not apply in this case because the grievant is not seeking a reclassification of her position, but rather a temporary promotion for the time in which she claims to have performed the duties of a higher-graded position. <span class="Italic">Testan</span> does not preclude the enforcement of collective bargaining provisions which provide for temporary promotions for employees assigned to perform the duties of higher-graded positions. As the Comptroller General has recognized, such provision in collective bargaining agreements are enforceable exceptions to the general rule that an employee is entitled to pay only for the position to which the employee is actually appointed. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">Cassandra G. McPeak and Wayne E. Dabney</span>, 69 Comp. Gen [93] (B-232695) (Dec. 15, 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the grievance concerned the grievant's claim that she had been assigned the duties of a higher-graded position in the past and that "the assignment of duties beyond her pay grade constituted a detail to a higher grade position and therefore entitlement to a temporary pay grade pursuant to Article 13 of the Master Labor Agreement." The grievant did not claim that her permanent GS-6 position was improperly classified or that her permanent position should be reclassified at a higher grade. Therefore, the Arbitrator was not being asked to classify a position within the meaning of section 7121(c) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Sheppard AFB and AFGE Local 779</span>, 65 FLRA 137, 140 (2010) (<span class="Italic">Testan</span> does not apply if grievant is not seeking reclassification but rather temporary promotion for time spent performing duties of higher-graded position).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the contract calls for temporary promotion under stated conditions, the arbitrator does not engage in an improper classification analysis by comparing the grievant's duties with the duties assigned to the higher level position, <span class="Italic">VAMC Richmond and AFGE Local 2145</span>, 69 FLRA 427, 429 (2016):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, the Agency contends that the Arbitrator impermissibly "analy[zed] and identifi[ed]" the grade level of the duties assigned to the grievant and to the GS-11 specialists. But, as discussed above, the Arbitrator determined that the grievance concerned whether the grievant was entitled to a temporary promotion under Article 12 for performing GS-11 specialist duties. In order to resolve that issue, the Arbitrator appropriately examined the specialist duties and assessed whether the grievant performed such duties during his detail.[32] In this regard, the Arbitrator found that the grievant, while detailed, consistently performed specialist duties over 25% of the time, and that "all" specialists worked "at the GS-11 grade level." The Arbitrator did not evaluate the grade level of the duties assigned to, and performed by, the grievant in order to determine the appropriate classification of the grievant's <span class="Italic">permanent</span> position. Thus, the Arbitrator did not make a classification determination.[35]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[32]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Oxon Hill, Md.</span>, 56 FLRA 292, 298 (2000) ("In resolving a grievance alleging that a grievant is entitled to a temporary promotion because he or she has performed higher-graded duties, an arbitrator examines the higher[-]graded duties and determines whether the grievant in fact performed them." (citing <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R3-35</span>, 52 FLRA 866, 871 (1997) (<span class="Italic">NAGE</span>))); <span class="Italic">see also Keesler</span>, 60 FLRA at 428 (an arbitrator does not make a classification determination by comparing a grievant's duties to the properly classified duties of a higher-graded position to determine if the grievant is entitled to a temporary promotion).</p>

<p class="noindent">But an arbitrator improperly determined a classification issue in the temporary promotion case of <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Wright-Patterson AFB and AFGE Local 1138</span>, 59 FLRA 64, 67 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on evidence related to duties performed by other GS-13 managers, the Arbitrator concluded that the grievant regularly performed GS-13 duties. However, in reaching the conclusion that these duties were those of a higher-graded position, the Arbitrator improperly had to determine the classification of the grievant's position. That is, it is undisputed that there was not a properly classified civilian position for the work being performed by the grievant. Thus, the Arbitrator's determination as to the grade-level of the grievant's duties was not based on a comparison between the duties performed by the grievant and the already classified duties of that position. By relying on testimony as to the duties performed by managers in other positions, instead of evidence as to the properly classified duties of the position in question, the Arbitrator improperly made a classification determination as to that position. In effect, the Arbitrator relied on his finding that the duties of those other positions were similar to the duties performed by the grievant in the Program Manager position to classify that position. Consequently, we find that the Arbitrator's award is deficient because it is contrary to &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) and conclude that it should be set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another award was set aside when the arbitrator essentially resolved a grade classification issue rather than determining whether the grievant was assigned to a higher-graded position, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point and IAM Local 2296</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-037.html">60 FLRA 155</a>, 157-58 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the grievance seeks an upgrade of the grievant's permanent position based on his performing higher-graded duties. The Arbitrator evaluated the grade level of the duties permanently assigned to and performed by the grievant to determine their grade level. In this regard, the Arbitrator rejected the auditor's determination that the grievant was not performing WG-11 work and found that the grievant performed the same tasks as the other members of his work unit who were paid at the WG-11 rate. In addition, the Arbitrator reviewed Grade 10 and 11 position descriptions and found that the "job description of Grade 11 most clearly applies to the work of [the grievant]." Further, the Arbitrator explicitly found, and the parties do not dispute, that the grievance did not involve the issue of a detail or a temporary promotion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2142</span>, 51 FLRA 1140, 1142-43 (1996), the Authority found <span id="page_2089"></span>that, as "the substance of the grievances concerned the grade level of the duties assigned to, and performed by, the grievants in their permanent positions[,]" the grievances concerned the classification of the grievants' positions and were precluded by &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. As the grievance in this case also concerns the grade level of the permanent duties performed by the grievant and does not concern whether the grievant was entitled to a temporary promotion, it concerns a matter relating to the classification of that position. Accordingly, we find that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute and set it aside.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the duties of the higher-graded position have been classified, there is no classification issue that bars arbitrability of the grievance seeking temporary promotion, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1617 and Dept. of Air Force, San Antonio ALC</span>, 55 FLRA 345, 347 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the substance of the grievance concerned the grievant's entitlement to a temporary promotion based on the performance of WS-3705-10 duties. It is undisputed that the Agency had previously classified the WS-3705-10 position. Consequently, the grievance, which concerns a temporary promotion based on the performance of duties in a previously-classified position, does not raise a classification issue within the meaning of section 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Atlanta, Georgia and</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Council of Prisons Local 1145</span>, 51 FLRA 1422, 1425 (1996); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant</span> <span class="Italic">Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine and National Association of Agriculture Employees</span>, 51 FLRA 1210, 1215 (1996). In this regard, the Arbitrator's reliance on <span class="Italic">VA Tampa </span>was misplaced. The grievance in <span class="Italic">VA Tampa </span>[19 FLRA 1177 (1985)] concerned the proper classification of the grievant's permanent position. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local</span> <span class="Italic">987 and U.S. Department of the Air Force, Air Force</span> <span class="Italic">Logistics Command, Robins Air Force Base, Warner</span> <span class="Italic">Robins, Georgia, </span>52 FLRA 212, 215 (1996) (substance of grievance concerned grade level of duties assigned to, and performed by, grievant in his permanent position and not whether he was entitled to a temporary promotion); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2142 and U.S. Department of the Army, Corpus</span> <span class="Italic">Christi Army Depot, Corpus Christi, Texas, </span>51 FLRA 1140, 1142 (1996) (same).
