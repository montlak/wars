<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-25"><span class="space">m.</span> Disclosure of Information Already Known or Public</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act changed preexisting law by amending 5 USC 2302 to provide:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)(1) A disclosure shall not be excluded from subsection (b)(8) because--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; the disclosure revealed information that had been previously disclosed;</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Day v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/DAY_THOMAS_F_DC_1221_12_0528_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_WITH_CONCURRING_AND_DISSENTING_OPINION_836324.pdf">119 MSPR 589</a>, 2013 MSPB 49 (2013) (Member Robbins concurring in part and dissenting in part), concluded that this portion of the amendments could be applied to cases pending at the time of the WPEA's enactment. [Refer to Chapter 17, "<a href="0100-2023-20-121.html#sec13-117">Retroactivity</a>" for <span class="Italic">Day</span>.] <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. VA</span>, CH-1221-11-0328-W-1 (NP 1/22/2014) ("Additionally, the fact that the information in question may have been already known, previously disclosed, or disclosed to either a supervisor or to a person who participated in the activity that is the subject of the disclosure, does not in and of itself prevent it from being considered a protected disclosure under the provisions of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-199, 126 Stat. 1465 (WPEA), in which Congress clarified the types of disclosures covered under the law. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(1)(B); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Day v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 589, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12, 18 (2013)."). Earlier law is described below.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the WPEA, the Federal Circuit determined that if the appellant provided information that was already known, the disclosure was not protected, as the court explained in <span class="Italic">Meuwissen v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/2000243234f3d91242">234 F.3d 9</a>, 12-13 (Fed. Cir. 2000), involving what amounted to disagreement by an agency administrative judge with decisions that the AJ believed misapplied or misinterpreted statutes administered by his agency-employer:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Agency that Meuwissen did not make any "disclosure" that was protected under the WPA. As an initial matter, neither his statements to his supervisors nor his final <span class="Italic">Smith</span> decision "disclosed" any information that was not already known. As conceded by Meuwissen during oral argument, the Agency's policy of excluding illegitimate children from WELSA heirship determinations was publicly known, having been disclosed in the <span class="Italic">Beaupre</span> and <span class="Italic">Shangreau</span> decisions. A disclosure of information that is publicly known is not a disclosure under the WPA. The purpose of the WPA is to protect employees who possess knowledge of wrongdoing that is concealed or not publicly known, and who step forward to help uncover and disclose that information. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 95-969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted</span> in 1978 USCCAN 2730. As explained in the legislative history of the WPA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In the vast Federal bureaucracy it is not difficult to conceal wrongdoing provided that no one summons the courage to disclose the truth. Whenever misdeeds take place in a Federal agency, there are employees who know that it has occurred, and who are outraged by it. What is needed is a means to assure them that they will not suffer if they help uncover and correct administrative abuses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, because the Agency's alleged misconduct was not concealed and was already known, Meuwissen's statements to his supervisor and his final Smith decision were not "disclosures." <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, Black's Law Dictionary 464 (6th ed. 1990) (defining "disclose" as "[t]o bring into view by uncovering; to expose; to make known").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Allgood v. MSPB</span> (Fed.

Dept. of Army</span>, 88 MSPR 674, 680-83 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-23 (2001), sought to avoid or distinguish <span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span> on the basis that the information disclosed was not publicly known, although it was known to a degree within the agency. Additionally, the Board pointed out what it believed was incorrect analysis of the WPA by the Federal Circuit:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the appellant filed her petition for review, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decided <span class="Italic">Meuwissen v. Department of the Interior</span>, 234 F.3d 9 (Fed. Cir. 2001)<span class="Italic">. Meuwissen</span> has a bearing on our jurisdiction, so we address it <span class="Italic">sua sponte. See Waldrop v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 72 MSPR 12, 15 (1996) (the Board must satisfy itself that it has authority to adjudicate the <span id="Page_3669"></span>matter before it, and may raise the question of its own jurisdiction <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> at any time).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Meuwissen was an administrative law judge whose duties included rendering decisions on heirship claims under the White Earth Reservation Land Settlement Act (WELSA), which provides for compensation to the descendants of certain native Americans whose lands were taken by the federal government 95 years ago. Mr. Meuwissen came to believe that published administrative and judicial decisions which had held that illegitimate children were not "heirs" for purposes of WELSA had been incorrectly decided. 234 F.3d at 11. He issued a decision that expressly declined to follow precedent on the ground that it was "an erroneous interpretation of the WELSA." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board of Indian Appeals reversed this decision, and Mr. Meuwissen's employing agency later terminated his appointment, in part because of the decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. After exhausting his remedy with OSC, Mr. Meuwissen filed an IRA appeal claiming, insofar as is relevant here, that his decision was a whistleblowing disclosure, and that termination of his appointment therefore constituted prohibited retaliation. The Board denied Mr. Meuwissen's request for corrective action in a non-precedential final decision. <span class="Italic">Meuwissen v.</span> Department <span class="Italic">of the Interior,</span> MSPB Docket No. CH-1221-98-0870-W-1 (Initial Decision, Dec. 1, 1998), <span class="Italic">petition for review denied,</span> 84 MSPR 621 (1999) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On judicial review, the court issued a precedential decision affirming the Board. The court concluded that Mr. Meuwissen's decision disagreeing with published interpretations of WELSA was not protected activity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) because he did not disclose anything "that was not already known." 234 F.3d at 12. According to the court, a "disclosure of information that is publicly known is not a disclosure under the WPA [Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 13. Relying on the legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111, although referring to it as the "legislative history of the WPA [of 1989]," the court concluded that the appellant's decision on heirship related to matters that "w[ere] not concealed and w[ere] already known." 234 F.3d at 13. In further support of its conclusion, the court cited the Black's Law Dictionary definition of "disclose," as meaning "[t]o bring into view by uncovering; to expose; to make known." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span> case does bear some resemblance to the appeals currently before the Board. The accounting irregularities that the appellant described in her letter to the IG were longstanding and well-known to TACOM managers, to the IG, and to GAO. Accordingly, she did not "reveal" anything, insofar as her letter dealt with matters that were "not concealed" and "already known"; put differently, she did not "uncover" or "expose" anything. One could argue, on this basis, that in light of <span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span> the appellant's letter to the IG was not protected whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold otherwise, however, for two reasons. First, a key aspect of the <span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span> holding was the public nature of the information described in Mr. Meuwissen's heirship decision that disagreed with precedent. As noted by the court, the</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">policy of excluding illegitimate children from WELSA heirship determinations was publicly known, having been disclosed in [published] decisions. A disclosure of information that is publicly known is not a disclosure under the WPA. The purpose of the WPA is to protect employees who possess knowledge of wrongdoing that is concealed or not publicly known, and who step forward to help uncover and disclose that information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">234 F.3d at 13 (emphases supplied). In these appeals, by contrast, the accounting matters discussed in the appellant's letter to the IG were not publicly known. TACOM practices under the DVD system were internal to TACOM, and were nothing like the official, published interpretations of WELSA at issue in <span class="Italic">Meuwissen.</span> Accordingly, <span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span> is distinguishable on its facts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, we decline to give a broad reading to selected passages from <span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span>--specifically, the statements that a matter that is "not concealed" or "already known" cannot be the subject of a protected disclosure, and that "disclose" means to "uncover[]," to expose; to make known"--to find that the appellant's letter to the IG was not protected, because the passages conflict with the legislative history of the WPA. The court stated that its holding was consistent with "the legislative history of the WPA [of 1989]," but as support for this statement it cited "S. Rep. No. 95-969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 USCCAN 2730." 234 F.3d at 13. The report relied upon is from the legislative history of the CSRA of 1978, a comprehensive law that contained an early definition of a protected whistleblowing disclosure. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Eleven years after the passage of the CSRA, Congress passed the WPA of 1989 in an effort to strengthen the CSRA's protections for whistleblowers. The Senate Report on the bill that later became the WPA firmly rejected the notion that an individual who communicates wrongdoing that is "not concealed" or "already known" should not be protected from retaliation. S. Rep. No. 100-413, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., at 13 (1988) ("OSC, the Board and the courts should not erect barriers to disclosures which will limit the necessary flow of information from employees who have knowledge of government wrongdoing. For example, it is inappropriate for disclosures to be protected...only if the employee is the first to raise the issue").[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Although the report cited above relates to a version of the WPA that President Reagan "pocket-vetoed" after the 100th Congress adjourned in 1988, the report nonetheless may be relied on as authoritative legislative history of the WPA of 1989 where, as here, the relevant language of the bill did not change before it was ultimately enacted<span class="Italic">. See Smith v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 64 MSPR 46, 55 n.3 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the above, we conclude that unlike the alleged disclosures in <span class="Italic">Meuwissen,</span> the appellant's letter to the IG disclosing violations of accounting rules was protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Askew</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Stiles v. DHS</span>, 116 MSPR 263, 268-69 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12, 2011 MSPB 28 (2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the administrative judge found that the appellant's disclosure regarding the two Border Patrol Agents firing on illegal aliens was not protected because the agency already knew about the information at the time he disclosed it. Specifically, the administrative judge found that the appellant did not dispute that another Supervisory Border Patrol Agent reported the incident to the JIC before he did. In finding the appellant's disclosure not protected on that basis, the administrative judge relied on the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Meuwissen v. Department of the Interior</span>, 234 F.3d 9, 13 (Fed. Cir. 2000), for its holding that "[a] disclosure of information that is publicly known is not a disclosure under the WPA." The court also stated that a matter that is "not concealed" or "already known" cannot be the subject of a protected disclosure, and that "disclose" means to "uncover[]"; "to expose; to make known." <span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span>, 234 F.3d at 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the Board distinguished <span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span> in <span class="Italic">Askew v. Department of the Army</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 674, &#x00B6; 22 (2001). There, the Board found that the appellant made a protected disclosure when she reported accounting irregularities to the OIG, even though they were longstanding and well-known to management and to the OIG. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-23. In addressing the applicability of <span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span>, the Board in <span class="Italic">Askew</span> initially noted that a key aspect of the <span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span> holding was the public nature of the information disclosed. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 21. Further, the Board declined to give a broad reading to the <span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span> court's words quoted above, noting that, although the court had stated that its holding was consistent with the legislative history of the WPA, it had relied for support on the legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) of 1978, a comprehensive law that contained an earlier definition of a protected whistleblowing disclosure. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 22. The Board went on to point out that, 11 years after passage of the CSRA, Congress passed the WPA in an effort to strengthen the CSRA's protections for whistleblowers, and that the Senate Report on the bill that later became the WPA firmly rejected the notion that an individual who communicates wrongdoing that is "not concealed" or "already known" should not be protected from retaliation. <span class="Italic">Askew</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 674, &#x00B6; 22 (citing S.

For example, it is inappropriate for disclosures to be protected...only if the employee is the first to raise the issue")).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the appellant's disclosure regarding the two Border Patrol Agents firing on the illegal aliens was not protected, we note that the administrative judge did not specifically find that the disclosure was publicly known, and we would agree that it was not. Even if a member of the public had observed the border shooting--and there is no suggestion that that occurred--such an observation would not necessarily have indicated a violation of law without consideration of the additional information the appellant provided to the JIC, information that was not publicly known. <span class="Italic">Cf. Wadhwa v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 615, &#x00B6; 8, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 353 Fed. Appx. 435 (Fed. Cir. 2009), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 130 S.

The administrative judge in this case found that the appellant's disclosure was not protected because another Supervisory Border Patrol Agent had reported the shooting to the JIC before the appellant did. Based on the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Askew</span>, and its well-placed reliance on the legislative history of the WPA, we find that that factor did not preclude the appellant's disclosure from being protected.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant spoke to Deborah Weatherly, a House subcommittee staffer, by telephone on November 3, 2003. The appellant made the call to object that the Park Police was being asked by House appropriators to pay for a follow-up study on how much progress the Park Police had made in implementing the NAPA recommendations. According to the appellant's own account of the conversation, Weatherly criticized the appellant for not "straighten[ing] ...out" the Park Police, which Weatherly said the appellant had been hired to do. The appellant asked for a "chance to be heard," but Weatherly turned her down, saying that it would be "inappropriate" because she was already in close contact with the appellant's superiors at the National Park Service about the situation with the Park Police. Further, according to the appellant, Weatherly told the appellant that if in fact the Park Police was making progress toward implementing the NAPA recommendations, the follow-up study that the appellant had called to complain about could actually improve the appellant's standing. The appellant says that the conversation ended on this "positive" note.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A communication is not protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) unless the speaker reveals something to the listener. <span class="Italic">Meuwissen v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the AJ erred in relying on <span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span> to find that the appellant's July 23, 2006 disclosures were not protected because PVAMC's staff and management were aware of the safety issues. An employee's decision to go outside the chain of command to correct a problem that local management has failed to address is a form of protected disclosure under the WPA, notwithstanding that local employees and management were aware of the problem. <span class="Italic">See Grubb</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 27-28 (holding that an employee's complaint to the agency IG that local agency management violated the law was a protected disclosure); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 38, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14 (2002) (holding that an employee who went to the agency IG after making numerous complaints to his supervisors that he believed were ignored made a protected disclosure under the rule that where an employee "goes outside the chain of command because he feels that those officials are 'unresponsive,' his disclosures are protected"); <span class="Italic">Askew v. Department of the Army</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 674, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9 (2001) (holding that an appellant's statements to the agency IG were protected disclosures, notwithstanding that the facility's management had previously detected the same problem identified by the appellant, but failed to act to the appellant's satisfaction).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the AJ erred on the facts in relying on <span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span> to find that the appellant's July 23, 2006 disclosures were not protected under the "publicly known" exception. As previously noted, the AJ stated that issues that the appellant raised in his letter were publicly known because "many of the safety devices or strategies, or lack thereof, would have been apparent to anyone who walked into the hospital, <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> guards, cameras, metal detectors, room configurations, etc." However, there was no evidence that members of the public generally, as opposed to the potentially dangerous patients from whom the appellant sought protection, had access to examination rooms. In addition, many of the other alleged safety deficiencies raised by the appellant would not have been visible to the public, such as the failure to provide panic buttons in examination rooms, patient criminal background information to treating physicians, special VA Police Officer protection in cases where a patient who was known to be potentially violent arrived for treatment, and warnings on the charts of potentially violent patients.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, the appellant here did more than merely restate observable facts. Rather, as a physician practicing at the facility, he provided a perspective not discernable to members of the visiting public by recognizing the potential threat to medical providers' safety that the lack of security caused. For instance, the appellant complained that the examination rooms' furniture was arranged such that a doctor could be pinned against the wall by a patient, that the absence of a second exit door in the rooms could trap a doctor, and that the rooms lacked panic buttons. A member of the public would not necessarily recognize the potential danger posed by these factors. Consequently, even assuming that all of the safety issues raised by the appellant were discernable by the public, the public would not have had the additional information necessary to recognize the threat to the health and safety of the medical staff posed thereby, and therefore could not effectuate the WPA's remedial purpose of encouraging that the threat be disclosed to someone in a position to correct it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In that regard, we further find that the AJ erred in interpreting the "publicly known" test too restrictively. In <span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span>, the appellant, an administrative judge, first complained about, and then issued an opinion inconsistent with, an agency's statutory interpretation that had been articulated in published decisions. 234 F.3d at 11. The court explained that the WPA's purpose to "correct" abuses is not served by "encourag[ing] employees to disclose the illegality of such decisions, which are known and readily redressable by appeal." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 13-14. In <span class="Italic">Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 263 F.3d 1341, 1347-50 (Fed. Cir. 2001), as in <span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span>, the court explained the requirement that a disclosure be "unknown" in the context of the legislative intent to encourage employees to make disclosures so that wrongdoing can be remedied. Thus, the court opined that the statutory purpose of encouraging disclosures that are likely to remedy a wrong is not served by making a "disclosure" to the wrongdoer himself. 263 F.3d at 1350. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Horton v. Department of the Navy,</span> 66 F.3d 279, 282 (Fed. Cir. 1995), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 516 U.S. 1176 (1996), the court held that an employee's criticism directed to the wrongdoers themselves was not whistleblowing because such disclosures do not serve the WPA's purpose of remedying wrongs. But in <span class="Italic">Horton</span>, the court did not even address whether the information conveyed by the employee was unknown or known. <span class="Italic">See also Mogyorossy v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 652, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-20 (2004) (analyzing the "disclosure" requirement based on whether the complaints were made to an individual other than the policy maker, without considering whether the recipient might also already have been aware of the allegedly dangerous policy).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span>, <span class="Italic">Huffman</span>, and <span class="Italic">Horton</span> examined whether the statutory purpose of affording a remedy for alleged government wrongdoing would be served in determining that the subject statements were not "disclosures" within the meaning of the WPA. In contrast, the remedial purpose of the WPA is furthered by encouraging employees to bring to the attention of agency IGs alleged threats to safety that are ignored by local management, and based upon facts which, even if known to the public, do not necessarily indicate a safety threat without also considering additional information not publicly known.</p>
