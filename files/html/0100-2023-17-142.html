<h3 class="h3" id="sec9-140"><span class="space">D.</span> AWARD IS BASED ON "NONFACT"</h3>
<p class="noindent">Attentive readers with good memories will recall the grounds for exceptions in FLRA's regulation, 5 CFR 2425.6 (2022):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Grounds for review; potential dismissal or denial for failure to raise or support grounds.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;The Authority will review an arbitrator's award to which an exception has been filed to determine whether the award is deficient--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;On other grounds similar to those applied by Federal courts in private sector labor-management relations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1916"></span>(b)&#x2003;If a party argues that an award is deficient on private-sector grounds under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, then the excepting party must explain how, under standards set forth in the decisional law of the Authority or Federal courts:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;The award:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(ii)&#x2003;is based on a nonfact;...</p>
<p class="noindent">Providing no aid in defining a nonfact are venerable editions of <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary, Bouvier's Law Dictionary</span>, or certain conveniently-located editions of Random House or Webster's dictionaries. Help us out, FLRA. And it did. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 72,</span> 64 FLRA 39, 57-58 (2009), described the "nonfact" exception:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish that an award is based on a nonfact, the appealing party must show that a central fact underlying the award is clearly erroneous, but for which the arbitrator would have reached a different result. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, Lowry Air Force Base, Denver, Colo.,</span> 48 FLRA 589, 593 (1993). The Authority will not find an award deficient on the basis of an arbitrator's determination on any factual matter that the parties disputed at hearing. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 594 (citing <span class="Italic">Nat'l Post Office Mailhandlers v. United States Postal Service,</span> 751 F.2d 834, 843 (6th Cir. 1985)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An arbitrator's legal conclusions cannot be challenged on the ground of nonfact. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU, Chapter 143,</span> 60 FLRA 922, 931 (2005). The Agency's claim that the Arbitrator erred, as a matter of nonfact, in finding that the Agency did not make a good faith effort to accommodate the grievant's disability constitutes a challenge to the Arbitrator's legal conclusions. Specifically, the exception disputes the Arbitrator's conclusion that the Agency failed to properly initiate and participate in the required interactive process with the grievant. Moreover, as recommended above, the Arbitrator's conclusions in this regard are consistent with law. Consequently, the Agency's exception does not provide a basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Disagreement with an arbitrator's determinations regarding the credibility of witnesses also provides no basis for finding an award deficient on the ground of nonfact. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Army, Norfolk Dist., Army Corps of Engineers, Norfolk, Va.,</span> 59 FLRA 906, 909 (2004). The Agency's claim that the Arbitrator erred in finding that it failed to rebut the coordinator's testimony essentially challenges the Arbitrator's conclusion that the coordinator's testimony was more credible than that of witnesses on whose testimony the Agency relies. Consequently, the Agency's exception does not provide a basis for finding the award deficient. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">An example of nonfact analysis is provided by <span class="Italic">DHHS, FDA and NTEU Chapter 254</span>, 72 FLRA 179, 179-80 (2021) (Member Abbott concurring), involving a dispute over the nature of a telework grant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is based on a nonfact. Specifically, the Agency argues the Arbitrator's finding that the grievant was previously on a recurring telework agreement is directly contradicted by the evidence, and is the reason the Arbitrator sustained the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish that an award is based on a nonfact, the excepting party must establish that a central fact underlying the award is clearly erroneous, but for which the arbitrator would have reached a different result.[10] The record clearly shows that the grievant was on an episodic telework agreement starting in 2015. Therefore, the Agency is correct that the award contains an erroneous fact.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Federal courts in private sector cases will sustain a challenge to an arbitrator's award on the basis that the award is based on a nonfact.

Therefore, the Federal Labor Relations Authority will <span id="page_1917"></span>grant a petition for review of an arbitration award on the ground that the award is based on a nonfact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, with respect to this ground the Authority notes that in <span class="Italic">Electronics Corporation</span> the arbitrator had based his award of reinstatement upon the "fact" that there was no pretermination suspension of the grievant. In fact, there had been such a suspension. The court held that "where <span class="Italic">the</span> 'fact' underlying an arbitrator's decision is concededly a non-fact and where the parties cannot fairly be charged with the misapprehension, the award cannot stand." Thus, in order to support a challenge to an arbitration award on the ground that the award is based on a nonfact, it must be shown that the fact in question is a matter which is objectively ascertainable and is <span class="Italic">the</span> fact upon which the award is based. Additionally, the parties cannot be responsible for the arbitrator's misapprehension and it must be readily apparent from the arbitrator's award that but for the arbitrator's misapprehension, the arbitrator would have reached a different result.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the union's exception that the award is based upon a nonfact is not supported by the facts and circumstances described in its petition. Thus the union's petition does not clearly demonstrate that the alleged nonfacts involved facts which were objectively ascertainable, that they were the central facts underlying the award, that they were concededly erroneous, and that but for the arbitrator's misapprehension he would have reached a different result. Instead, the union is merely disagreeing with the arbitrator's findings of fact.

However, this basis for finding an arbitration award deficient does not permit the appealing party to dispute the arbitrator's findings of fact.

<p class="noindent-1">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit recognized these principles in adopting nonfact as a basis on which to find an arbitration award deficient. <span class="Italic">Electronics Corporation v.

Chief Judge Coffin specifically rejected any attempt "to subvert the arbitral process" and emphasized how restrictive nonfact is as a basis for finding an arbitration award deficient. 492 F.2d at 1257. The court indicated that in order for an award to be found deficient on this ground, the appealing party should demonstrate that the arbitrator not only erred in the view of the facts, but that the sole articulated basis for the award was clearly in error and that the evidence discloses a gross mistake of fact but for which, in accordance with the expressed rationale of the arbitrator, a different result would have been reached<span class="Italic">.

<p class="noindent-1">In reviewing awards alleged to be deficient because they are based on a nonfact, we apply the limitations recognized by the Federal courts in reviewing arbitration awards in the private sector, and we apply the principles of the Supreme Court in generally refusing to disturb the factual findings and determinations of arbitrators in the Federal sector. Exceptions constituting nothing more than disagreement with the arbitrator's factual findings and determinations on disputed or ambiguous evidence will not be found deficient as based on a nonfact and will be summarily denied.</p>

The evidence was considered by the arbitrator. There was no demonstration that the articulated basis for the award, involving construction of correspondence from the (former) Civil Service Commission concerning qualification requirements for certain positions, was concededly and indisputably in error. It is the award itself, rather than the specific reasoning and conclusions employed by the arbitrator, that is subject to review.
