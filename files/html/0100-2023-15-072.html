<p class="Body-Text">In contexts other than air traffic control, if an employee is removed for failing to complete training, but the failure is attributable to the agency's deficiencies in handling the program, the removal will not likely be sustained. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hopkins v. DOJ</span>, 10 MSPR 600, 602 (1982) (agency should have permitted the appellant, a deputy marshal, to recycle through a FLETC training course when a temporary vision problem may have impaired his performance on the test and the agency's policy appeared to require recycling under those conditions before removing the employee); <span class="Italic">Davies v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 3 MSPR 565, 570, 4 MSPB 83 (1980) (remanding case for AJ to consider whether agency committed harmful error by failing to offer appellant remedial study program to assist passage through apprenticeship). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 19 MSPR 556, 557 n.* (1984) (removal for the failure to succeed in machinist apprenticeship program: six days to prepare for a retest or makeup test was sufficient); <span class="Italic">Nance v. FAA</span>, 16 MSPR 243, 245 (1983) (although the agency did not immediately search for a vacancy for an electronics technician who did not pass a training course, no harm occurred because the agency's later proof demonstrated that a search of vacancies at the time of the demotion disclosed none within the appellant's qualifications). Refusal to take a required four-week training course constituted insubordination and warranted disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">Metcalfe v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3429). <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Favreau v. Dept. of Army</span>, SF-0752-11-0273-I-1 (NP 2/21/2014) (considering whether removal of the appellant (reversed on due process grounds) discriminated against the appellant based on a perceived disability when the appellant did not qualify to take a required course of training for his position as a police officer: "There was also no evidence that the individuals from the Office of the Provost Marshal General, who were responsible for denying the appellant's waiver request and denying the appeal of the denial of the waiver request, were even aware that the appellant had any medical conditions."); <span class="Italic">Gormley v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 48 MSPR 181, 187 (1991) (Chapter 43 case: agency failed to properly inform the employee about a make-up test opportunity; the employee was not given a reasonable period to improve his performance, a requirement of a Chapter 43 action).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Marquand v. DOD</span>, PH-0752-14-0636-I-1 (NP 7/7/2016), discussed a challenge to the existence of a job condition requiring completion of Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) Level II Certification within 40 months of her entrance on duty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The charge of failure to fulfill a condition of employment contains two elements: (1) the requirement at issue is a condition of employment; and (2) the appellant failed to meet that condition. <span class="Italic">Gallegos v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 349, &#x00B6; 6 (2014). Absent evidence of bad faith or patent unfairness, the Board defers to the agency's requirements that must be fulfilled for an individual to qualify for appointment to, or retention in, a particular position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge further found that the following factors demonstrate that DAWIA Level II Certification was a condition of the appellant's employment: (1) the job announcement for the appellant's position states that it is an acquisition position requiring DAWIA Level II Certification within 24 months of entrance on duty; (2) the relevant position description states that the incumbent of the position is subject to the provisions of the DAWIA and associated DOD and DCMA policies and guidelines; and (3) the appellant's tentative and final job offers state that DAWIA certification is required and that she has 24 months from her entrance on duty to meet certification requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant challenges these findings on review, alleging that 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1723, "DOD Instruction 5000.52," and DOD Instruction 5000.66 do not establish DAWIA certification as a condition of employment and that neither DOD Instruction 5000.52 nor 5000.66 mandate discipline for failure to obtain DAWIA certification. Contrary to the appellant's apparent assertion, however, the administrative judge did not find that these authorities establish certification as a condition of employment. Rather, the administrative judge correctly found that these authorities--in conjunction with DCMA Instruction 629, the Defense Acquisition University (DAU) Catalog, and the statement in the appellant's position description that the incumbent of the position is subject to the provisions of the DAWIA and associated DOD and DCMA policies and guidelines--provide the agency with the authority to require certification as a condition of employment in an AT&#x0026;L position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also challenges the administrative judge's findings that statements in the job announcement for her position, as well as her tentative and final job offers, demonstrate that DAWIA Level II Certification was a condition of her employment. Regarding the job announcement, the appellant contends that the copy that the agency submitted in the record during the proceedings below is not the same job announcement to which she responded in applying for the position. She alleges that the agency "fabricated evidence" by submitting a similar job announcement that does not contain a vacancy announcement number or any information establishing that it is the job announcement for her position. Therefore, she asserts the administrative judge relied on the wrong job announcement in finding that DAWIA Level II Certification was a condition of her employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find this argument unavailing. Contrary to the appellant's assertion, the job announcement in the record cited by the administrative judge does contain a vacancy announcement number. Moreover, that number corresponds to the vacancy announcement number for the appellant's position set forth in the notice of proposed removal. Thus, we find that the evidence supports the finding that the job announcement in the record is the same job announcement for the appellant's position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the alternative, the appellant argues that, even if the job announcement submitted by the agency is the same announcement to which she responded in applying for the position, it does not support a finding that DAWIA Level II Certification was a condition of her employment because it does not list such certification as a condition of employment or as a "qualification factor." The appellant asserts that conditions of employment are clearly identified as such on a position's job announcement. She thus seems to assert that, because the job announcement here did not explicitly identify DAWIA Level II Certification as a condition of employment, it does not support the administrative judge's finding that such certification was a condition of her employment. The appellant similarly argues that her job offers, like the job announcement, do not indicate that certification is a condition of employment or a "qualification factor," and that, therefore, they do not support the administrative judge's finding that the agency proved that DAWIA Level II Certification was a condition of employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although it may be true that the job announcement and the appellant's job offers do not include the term "conditions of employment," and thus do not explicitly state that DAWIA Level II Certification is a condition of employment as a GS&#8209;12 Contract Price/Cost Analyst, they clearly state that the person who occupies that position must attain certification within 24 months after his or her entrance on duty. We find that these statements are the functional equivalent of a statement that the attainment of certification within 24 months after entrance on duty is a condition of employment for a GS-12 Contract Price/Cost Analyst. Given the extension of the time limit for attaining certification to 40 months and the lack of a waiver of that deadline, the appellant thus was required to attain certification by January 27, 2014 (40 months from her entrance of duty) to retain her position. Such certification was therefore a condition of her continued employment as a GS-12 Contract Price/Cost Analyst, regardless of whether the position's job announcement or the appellant's job offers explicitly identified DAWIA Level II Certification as a condition of employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant reasserts her arguments from below that DAWIA Level II Certification was not a condition of her employment for the following reasons: (1) conditions of employment must be "spelled out" in the position description and her position description does not explicitly state that certification is a condition of employment; (2)10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1724(b) prohibits the Secretary of Defense from requiring that applicants for or incumbents of her position have certification; (3) although DAWIA training is identified as mandatory, it is not a condition of employment because other DOD training identified as mandatory is not a condition of employment; and (4) the document "DOD Acquisition Career Field Certification Facts and Not So Frequent Questions," states that certification is not a qualification requirement for employment within DOD.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge addressed each of these arguments in the initial decision and found them unpersuasive. Although we agree with these findings, we modify the initial decision to further address the appellant's argument that certification was not a condition of her employment because her position description does not contain the certification requirement. In the initial decision, the administrative judge identified the basis of this argument as 5.B. of the Desk Guide, which requires "[c]ivilian 1102 series (and comparable military) positions [to] be designated as AT&#x0026;L positions in the Contracting Position Category." The administrative judge rejected the appellant's argument, finding that Section 5.B. of the Desk Guide only requires that AT&#x0026;L positions be designated in the Contracting Position Category and does not mandate that certification requirements be spelled specifically out in the position description.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, however, the appellant argues that the mandate that position descriptions contain certification requirements is based on Section 5.G. of the Desk Guide, which provides as follows: "AT&#x0026;L position information (e.g., AT&#x0026;L position category, AT&#x0026;L career field certification level, CAP/KLP designation and tenure period, and any special statutory requirements) should be annotated on the cover sheet of the position description." <span id="Page_2518"></span>Consequently, we modify the initial decision to address whether Level II DAWIA Certification was a condition of the appellant's employment pursuant to Section 5.G., rather than Section 5.B., of the Desk Guide.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Section 5.G. states that the certification level should be annotated on the cover sheet of the position description, and DAWIA Level II Certification was not specifically listed as a condition of employment on the appellant's position description, we find that it was nonetheless a condition of employment, given the statement in her position description that the employee who holds the job is subject to the provisions of the DAWIA and associated DOD and DCMA policies and guidelines. As discussed above, these policies required the appellant to obtain certification to retain her position. Therefore, we find that the appellant's contentions regarding Section 5.G. of the Desk Guide provide no basis to disturb the administrative judge's finding that such certification was a condition of the appellant's employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues on review that the administrative judge "erred [in] stating that the occupational code on the Standard Form 50 and the position classification on the [position description] demonstrates [sic] that DAWIA Level II [C]ertification was a condition of employment." The appellant asserts that this statement is "unfounded" because 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14) provides that conditions of employment do not include matters relating to the classification of any position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has apparently misconstrued the initial decision. The administrative judge did not state that DAWIA Level II Certification was a condition of the appellant's employment because her position was classified as a contracting position. Rather, the administrative judge explained that the appellant's position description explicitly states that the position is subject to the provisions of the DAWIA and associated DOD and DCMA policies and guidelines, and she found that those policies require that persons in the appellant's position attain certification. We find that this determination does not run afoul of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts that, in finding that DAWIA Level II Certification was a condition of her employment, the administrative judge improperly concluded that she acknowledged in emails to various agency officials that she was aware of the requirement to obtain certification and that failing to do so could result in her removal. The appellant reiterates her argument from below that, although she referenced certification in these emails and stated that she would be unable to obtain it by January 27, 2014, she was not acknowledging that such certification was a condition of employment, but was merely quoting the proposing official, who introduced the term "condition of employment" in his September 27, 2013 email. The administrative judge considered this argument in the initial decision and disagreed with the appellant's assertion that her emails to various agency officials did not constitute an admission of knowledge that certification was a condition of employment. The appellant's reiteration of this argument on review constitutes mere disagreement with the administrative judge's finding and, as such, provides no basis for disturbing the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Yang v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 112, &#x00B6; 12 (2010) (explaining that mere disagreement with the administrative judge's findings is insufficient to disturb the initial decision).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further argues on review that the administrative judge's finding that DAWIA Level II Certification is a condition of employment as a GS-12 Contract Price/Cost Analyst is "unsupported by case law," specifically, the Board's nonprecedential final order in <span class="Italic">England v. Department of the Army</span>, MSPB Docket No. DA-0752-14-0176-I-1, Final Order (Aug. 4, 2014), and its decision in <span class="Italic">Gamboa v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 594 (2014). In these cases, the Board found that the agency had improperly removed the appellant for failure to meet a condition of employment (a security clearance) where the record evidence did not indicate that a security clearance was a condition of employment. <span class="Italic">See Gamboa</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 594 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 11; <span class="Italic">England</span>, MSPB Docket No. DA-0752-14-0176-I-1, Final Order, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 5. As explained above, the documentary evidence in this case, including the vacancy announcement and the appellant's position description and job offers, supports a finding that certification was a condition of the appellant's employment. Therefore, we find that the appellant's reliance on <span class="Italic">England</span> and <span class="Italic">Gamboa</span> is misplaced.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, moreover, argues on review that the administrative judge improperly failed to analyze the major duties of her position in assessing whether DAWIA Level II Certification was a condition of her employment. The appellant asserts that, if the administrative judge had conducted such an analysis, she would have found that certification was not a condition of her employment because none of the major duties of her position required her to possess such certification.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is essentially arguing that DAWIA Level II Certification was not a condition of her employment because she was able to perform the duties of her position satisfactorily without such certification. As previously noted, the administrative judge properly found that the record evidence established that the appellant was required to attain the pertinent certification within 40 months of her entrance on duty to retain her position. We find that the appellant's ability to perform her duties without certification has no bearing on whether certification was a condition of employment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Marquand</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, determined that the appellant had sufficient opportunities to complete the coursework for the required certification. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ukandu v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, AT-0752-21-0261-I-1 (NP 12/8/2022), <span class="Italic">supra</span> (involving a charge that "he appellant did not maintain a condition of employment because he did not possess a DAWIA Level II certification").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Removal is warranted if the appellant fails to pass examinations during the course of a required training program for an electrician helper trainee. <span class="Italic">Clancy v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-532); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Lopez v.

Postal Service employees have been removed for failing to pass tests evaluating their ability to sort mail. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vidal v. USPS</span>, 75 MSPR 191, 193-94 (1997) (rejecting the argument that a collective bargaining agreement precluded the removal of a part-time flexible clerk who was reassigned to a letter sorting position and then failed to qualify for that job); <span class="Italic">Sanders v. USPS</span>, 32 MSPR 455, 460 (1987) (removal for failure to qualify on an assigned scheme after training for the scheme examinations); <span class="Italic">Catalano v.

Under <span class="Italic">Ryba v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-1038), removal of an employee from a mail distribution position may be an appropriate penalty for unsatisfactory performance of duties, including the inability to pass a proficiency test for a position, but the agency must establish that (1) the charges are valid; (2) the action will promote service efficiency; and (3) the action taken is appropriate in light of the charges. An INS trainee was removed for failure to meet the Spanish language proficiency requirement of his training program. <span class="Italic">Grannum v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 94-3573). The Federal Circuit found that an agency properly removed a criminal investigator who failed to complete one component of his basic training: running a mile and a half in under 14 minutes and 25 seconds (a pretty precise measure for government work). The court considered whether the agency properly considered a waiver of the requirement, but as to the requirement itself, neither MSPB nor the court had review authority: "This determination as to the requirements necessary to perform a certain job is the type of judgement call reserved for the agency itself." <span class="Italic">Jaliwala v.

<p class="Body-Text">Before the litigation over inadequate training schemes for air traffic specialists, discussed earlier, the Board declined to review alleged agency errors in training or examination of employees unless patent unfairness was demonstrated, an analytical approach applied in <span class="Italic">Woodby v. DOJ</span>, 11 MSPR 593, 596 (1982), <span class="Italic">followed</span> <span class="Italic">in</span> <span class="Italic">Bryant v. GSA</span>, 12 MSPR 270, 273 (1982). <span class="Italic">Woodby</span> sustained removal of an employee who failed a law enforcement training course. The appellant unsuccessfully attempted to challenge the agency's evaluation of the response to one question on an examination. Had that question been deemed correctly answered, she would have successfully completed her training. The Board declined to set aside the agency's evaluation of the results:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant did not contest the fact that she had been dismissed for academic failure by the FLETC [Federal Law Enforcement Training Center], but alleged error in the grading of a specific test question. Both parties have stipulated that if the FLETC had accepted appellant's response to the specific question as correct, she would have passed the examination and continued in the program. Although appellant offered evidence in general terms about the ambiguity of the question, the record shows that the answers and questions were drawn from the material taught and that the grading standards were the same for all employees at the FLETC. Appellant took full advantage of extensive agency procedures to question the fairness of a particular question, and the resultant review confirmed the validity of the question in issue. Appellant did not allege malicious intent, prohibited personnel practice, or absence of good faith or fair dealing by the agency. <span class="Italic">See Hopkins v. Department of Justice</span>, 9 MSPB 805, 10 MSPR 600 (1982). Considering the broad discretion which has been entrusted to management, a decision to remove an employee because of failure to meet a requirement to successfully complete training will not be disturbed when the record demonstrates that the agency procedures have been properly applied and the result is not patently unfair. Having so determined, we find that in this case the Board lacks authority to go <span id="Page_2519"></span>behind the action and speculate whether the question was properly graded. The presiding official, therefore, erred in including the validity of a test question in his review of the agency action. We further find that the agency's action for failure to successfully complete training promotes the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Woodby</span> was applied in <span class="Italic">Kane v. FDIC,</span> PH-0752-10-0340-I-1 (NP 9/29/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Here, the administrative judge based her rulings on the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Woodby v. Department of Justice</span>, 11 M.S.P.R. 593, 596 (1982). Ms. Woodby was removed from the U.S. Marshals Service for failure to successfully complete a basic training course at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), as required by her employment contract. On appeal, she challenged a specific question on the remedial examination, for which her answer was marked as incorrect, resulting in her dismissal for academic failure. She contended that her answer was acceptable and that she had, therefore, passed the examination. The presiding official agreed and reversed the removal action. On petition for review, however, the Board found that the presiding official erred in reaching the validity of the test question. In reaching that conclusion, the Board noted that the answers and questions were drawn from the material taught, that grading standards were the same for all employees at FLETC, that the appellant took advantage of extensive agency procedures to question the fairness of the question, and that the appellant did not allege "malicious intent, prohibited personnel practice, or absence of good faith or fair dealing by the agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While it does not appear that the agency in this case offered a procedure for challenging the fairness of questions on the TE, the other considerations identified in <span class="Italic">Woodby</span> apply equally well to this case, and we agree with the administrative judge that the decision is controlling. The appellant attempts to distinguish <span class="Italic">Woodby</span> on the grounds that the test at issue in that case was prepared and administered by a third party, rather than the employing agency. However, the Board in <span class="Italic">Woodby</span> did not rely on that distinction, but instead found that, in light of the broad discretion of the management of the employing agency, it was unnecessary to reach the question of whether FLETC should be made a party to the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> 11 M.S.P.R. at 596. Thus, the appellant's proposed distinction provides no basis for limiting the scope of the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Woodby</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts that he is "not seeking to find fault with particular test questions or rehash his disappointment over low scores," but instead seeks to challenge the reliability and methodology of the test as a whole. If, however, the appellant did not intend to contest particular questions and answers, he gave no other reason why he wished to obtain them. He suggests for the first time on petition for review that the validity of the test might be called into question on account of his "widely varying" scores within each question category. He also cites an academic article by the agency's proposed expert witness, which, according to the appellant, calls into question the agency's use of "test banding," i.e., reporting scores in ranges, as opposed to strict numerical ordering. The appellant did not raise these arguments below, however, but simply expressed general doubts as to the validity of the test in light of the discrepancy between his scores and his on-the-job performance. <span class="Italic">Banks v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 268, 271 (1980) (the Board will not consider an argument raised for the first time in a petition for review absent a showing that it is based on new and material evidence not previously available despite the party's due diligence). Under the circumstances, the appellant's discovery request gave every appearance of being a fishing expedition, and the administrative judge did not abuse her discretion in denying his motion to compel. Moreover, given that the motion was denied, the administrative judge did not abuse her discretion in denying his request to call Dr. Scott as a witness.</p>
