<p class="Body-Text">An AJ may exclude documents offered at a hearing if the appellant fails to comply with a hearing order requiring identification and production of documents prior to the hearing. <span class="Italic">Juarez v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-842); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Pak v. VA,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20201222171">840 Fed. Appx. 533</a> (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP) (AJ properly limited witnesses and evidence of protected disclosures in IRA appeal for appellant's "failing to comply with multiple orders and failing to explain that failure"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Felder v. USPS</span>, 68 MSPR 312, 313 (1995) (appellant's failure to respond to the AJ's order directing the filing of information pertaining to the timeliness of the appeal: the party may be subject to sanctions for failing to respond to an AJs order, "including being prohibited from introducing evidence concerning the information sought"). An AJ limited an appellant's defenses to those raised in response to the agency's interrogatories when the appellant failed to present a prehearing statement of facts and issues. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Donathan v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 16 MSPR 206, 209 (1983). <span class="Italic">Baker v. DHHS</span>, 912 F.2d 1448, 1457 (Fed. Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">following</span> <span class="Italic">Curtin v. OPM</span>, 846 F.2d 1373, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1988), noted that sanctions relating to discovery and evidentiary issues fall within the sound discretion of the Board and its officials, and that if an abuse of discretion does occur as to an AJ's evidentiary rulings, the appellant must prove harmful error "that could have affected the outcome of the case" if the sanctions are to be overturned on judicial review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An AJ erred by precluding an appellant from producing evidence at a hearing on compensatory damages when the appellant's error was a belated prehearing submission, <span class="Italic">Ellshoff v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 78 MSPR 615, 618 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-5 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge may impose sanctions against a party for failure to follow the Board's regulations or failure to respond to the administrative judge's orders. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.43; <span class="Italic">Williams v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 71 MSPR 597, 603 (1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 119 F.3d 16 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table). The appropriate analysis in cases involving late-filed responses to orders, however, is not whether good cause exists for waiving the time limit for filing, but rather whether sanctions are warranted in the interest of justice<span class="Italic">. See Hey v. U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Postal Service,</span> 57 MSPR 443, 448, (1993). Sanctions should be imposed only when a party has failed to exercise due diligence <span id="Page_1298"></span>in complying with any order or has exhibited negligence or bad faith in its efforts to so comply. <span class="Italic">See id.; Williams</span>, 71 MSPR at 603.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as a consequence of the administrative judge's sanction, the appellant would only be able to present oral argument at her hearing. A single failure to comply with an order is insufficient to show a lack of due diligence, negligence or bad faith in the appellant's compliance with the administrative judge's orders, such as would justify such a drastic sanction. <span class="Italic">See Carrier v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 65 MSPR 54, 57 (1994). Further, the Board has held that a party is not entitled to sanctions for the untimely filing of a submission absent a showing of prejudice. <span class="Italic">See Osler v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 64 MSPR 539, 542 (1994). The appellant submitted her prehearing submissions 11 days before the scheduled hearing. While the agency argued that it was unreasonably prejudiced by not receiving <span class="Italic">any</span> prehearing submissions from the appellant, it did not argue, much less show, that it was prejudiced by the subsequent untimely filing of those submissions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The element of prejudice to the other party as a significant consideration in the imposition of a sanction for the failure to adhere to a prehearing order was emphasized in <span class="Italic">Hay v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge may impose sanctions against a party for failure to respond to the administrative judge's orders. <span class="Italic">Ellshoff v. Department of the Interior</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 615, &#x00B6; 4 (1998); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43. In determining whether to impose sanctions for a late-filed response to an order, the administrative judge must determine whether sanctions are warranted in the interests of justice. <span class="Italic">Ellshoff</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 615, &#x00B6; 4. Sanctions should be imposed only when a party has failed to exercise due diligence in complying with an order or has exhibited negligence or bad faith in its efforts to comply. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> A party is not entitled to sanctions for the untimely filing of a submission absent a showing of prejudice. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its Motion to Strike Appellant's Untimely Submission, the agency presented no evidence or argument to show that it was prejudiced by the appellant's late response to the timeliness order. We fail to see how the agency was prejudiced by the appellant's 6-day delay, particularly when the present appeal was delayed from May 2004 until August 2006 by the agency's failure to promptly come forward with evidence regarding the appellant's preference eligible status (i.e. a PS 50 issued in May 2004 correctly reflecting the appellant's preference eligible status). Thus, the agency has not shown that it was entitled to sanctions. <span class="Italic">See Ellshoff</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 615, &#x00B6; 5. The consequence of the administrative judge's sanction was severe: the administrative judge declined to consider the appellant's evidence tending to show his appeal was timely filed, and ultimately dismissed the appeal as untimely. The appellant's single failure to timely comply with the administrative judge's order is not sufficient to show a lack of due diligence so as to justify such a sanction. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 5 (finding that a single failure to timely file prehearing submissions did not warrant barring the appellant from presenting witnesses or documentary evidence at the hearing). Moreover, the appellant here acted with due diligence in filing his response within 5 days of receiving the order. As discussed below, within 5 days of receipt of the timeliness order, the appellant was able to ascertain that mixed case procedures were applicable to his appeal, an issue to which the timeliness order did not alert him, and to compile evidence and argument to show that his appeal was timely filed under the rules applicable to mixed case appeals. The appellant's written response included a request for an extension of time. Although the appellant may have exercised even greater diligence by calling the administrative judge to seek an extension of time, the facts of the present appeal do not show a lack of due diligence sufficient to justify the sanction imposed. <span class="Italic">See Ellshoff</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 615, &#x00B6; 5. For these reasons, we will consider the appellant's late submission in determining whether his appeal was timely filed.</p>

USPS</span>, 88 MSPR 101, 103 &#x00B6; 8 (2001) (failure to participate in a prehearing conference did not warrant the sanction of a hearing preclusion when the appellant filed a substantial prehearing submission, participated in a second prehearing conference, and was not given an opportunity to explain the failure to participate in an earlier conference). <span class="italic">But see</span> <span class="italic">Brissette v. DOD</span>, DC-1221-13-0170-W-2 (NP 8/10/2022) (AJ properly declined to admit exhibits submitted with prehearing submission when, because of appellant's failure to follow the AJ's directive concerning use of e-filing, agency counsel did not get the exhibits until the morning of the prehearing conference).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A sanction is improper if the orders that received no response were improperly addressed by Board error. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McFarland v. DHHS</span>, PH-315H-14-0578-I-1 (NP 8/19/2014) ("Evidence that a letter was sealed, properly addressed, and deposited in the U.S. Mail with postage prepaid gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that the letter reached the addressee in due course of the mails. <span class="Italic">Reynolds v.

However, this presumption does not apply to the Board orders that were addressed to the wrong house number. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Furthermore, the Board has previously reversed an administrative judge's imposed sanctions when an incorrect address affected the appellant's ability to proceed. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Moore v.

<p class="Body-Text">An AJ improperly denied a hearing in <span class="Italic">Stein-Verbit v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 72 MSPR 332, 337-38 (1996). The appellant may have been rude or somewhat uncommunicative with the AJ during prehearing conferences, but her hearing should have proceeded:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Board have consistently recognized the importance of an appellant's right to a Board hearing. <span class="Italic">See Crispin v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 732 F.2d 919, 922-23 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Wildberger v. Small Business Admin.</span>, 63 MSPR 338, 346 (1994). An appellant's right to a hearing should not be denied as a sanction absent extraordinary circumstances. <span class="Italic">Wildberger</span>, 63 MSPR at 346.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, although the administrative judge found that the appellant waived her right to a hearing, it is clear that the appellant did not do so. There is no pleading in the record indicating that the appellant ever intended to waive her right to a hearing. Instead, the appellant has consistently maintained throughout the adjudication of her appeal that she wants a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the administrative judge's denial of the hearing is in fact in the nature of a sanction for the appellant's failure to participate in the November 22 and November 29 prehearing teleconferences. Inasmuch as the type of "extraordinary circumstances" that might warrant such an extreme sanction are lacking in this case, the administrative judge's ruling was error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we find that it was not appropriate to sanction the appellant for failing to participate in the November 22 teleconference. It is undisputed that the appellant had laryngitis and coughing fits on that date and was too ill to participate. The appellant should not have unilaterally hung up the telephone when the administrative judge attempted to address matters that did not require the appellant's participation. The administrative judge, however, should have rescheduled the teleconference in accordance with the appellant's request instead of requiring the appellant to listen in without being able to ask questions, voice objections, or discuss issues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, it was not appropriate to sanction the appellant for her failure to participate in the November 29 teleconference. When the administrative judge contacted the appellant on November 29, the appellant stated that she had not received the administrative judge's November 22 notice scheduling the conference, and that she had a prior appointment and was not available. She further stated that she relies on a service called Metro Access which provides transportation for disabled people, that such service requires making arrangements 24-48 hours in advance, and that she could not simply cancel her appointment and reschedule it because of her transportation difficulties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the appellant's explanation that she did not receive the administrative judge's November 22 order scheduling the November 29 teleconference is reasonable, especially considering that the intervening time period contained the Thanksgiving holiday. While the appellant should not have unilaterally hung up the telephone, the administrative judge should not have rescheduled the teleconference on such short notice without ensuring that the appellant would be available.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant acted inappropriately by hanging up the telephone during both teleconferences. Nevertheless, her failure to participate in the November 22 and November 29 teleconferences was not sanctionable, and certainly did not warrant the extreme sanction of denial of a hearing. Therefore, we find that the administrative judge abused her discretion by denying the appellant a hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Wildberger v. SBA</span>, 63 MSPR 338, 343 (1994), relied on in <span class="Italic">Stein-Verbit</span>, the Board admonished regarding the sanction of denial of a hearing improperly imposed based on the appellant's disagreement with the AJ's prehearing rulings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's expressions of his intent to file prehearing submissions and to conduct discovery beyond the administrative judge's deadlines reflected his continuing objection to, or disagreement with, her uncompromising denials of his nonfrivolous motions for extensions of time and a continuance. The administrative judge did not find, nor is it apparent from the record, that the appellant adopted abusive or threatening language. We therefore find that the appellant's continuing commitment to the merits of his motions was not propounded in <span id="Page_1299"></span>objectionable terms or bad faith as to support the ultimate sanction imposed upon him.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit confirmed the authority of the AJ to limit evidence if prehearing procedures are not followed, <span class="Italic">Jennemann v. EPA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1993 NP No. 93-3191):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner argues that the Administrative Judge incorrectly refused to admit clarifying submissions relating to the affirmative defense of whistle blowing and sexual and religious discrimination and improperly held that said affirmative defenses were waived. The AJ, however, had given petitioner ample opportunity to make the necessary submission. In fact, the record shows that prior to the AJ's refusal to accept clarifying submissions, petitioner was notified three times that the submissions relating to her affirmative defenses were required, was provided with an extension of time to produce such submissions, and upon failure to file such submissions was ordered to show cause why said affirmative defenses should not be considered waived. Petitioner had been specifically warned about the consequences of failure to file in a timely manner the required clarifications and had never indicated that the time limits would be impossible to meet. Therefore, the AJ's ruling of waiver of the affirmative defenses and denial of admission of further evidence related thereto did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But the Federal Circuit concluded that the AJ arbitrarily precluded a hearing for an appellant whose communications with the Board were delayed, in part, by international mail problems. <span class="Italic">Habtemariam v. OPM</span>, 180 Fed. Appx. 968 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A sanction by another name remains a sanction. In <span class="Italic">Guzman v. VA</span>, 114 MSPR 566, 570-71 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14, 2010 MSPB 170 (2010), the AJ decided that the appellant waived a whistleblower reprisal defense because the appellant did not properly follow the process for filing a prehearing submission. The waiver was construed as an unsupported sanction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sanctions were not requested here, nor did the administrative judge use the term "sanctions." Nevertheless, in a sanction-like ruling, the administrative judge found that the appellant had waived his affirmative defense of whistleblowing. In <span class="Italic">Simon</span>, the Board found that the administrative judge essentially imposed a sanction in light of the appellant's failure to respond timely to an order regarding affirmative defenses, even though, as here, she used the term "waived" and did not use the term "sanctions." <span class="Italic">Simon</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 381, &#x00B6; 10 &#x0026; n.3. The Board found the sanction of striking the appellant's affirmative defenses was excessive for the appellant's failure to timely respond to the administrative judge's orders without good cause. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As in <span class="Italic">Simon</span>, the appellant here did not waive the defense. Instead, he asserted his whistleblower defense in the initial appeal form and, in summary fashion, in the response to the acknowledgment order, and he never expressed any intent to withdraw that defense. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Further, the administrative judge here allowed some testimony from the appellant that would go to the whistleblowing issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An example of blatant disregard by an AJ of Board guidance on sanctions appears in <span class="Italic">Cobo v. FERC</span>, 29 MSPR 635, 636-37 (1986). The appellant filed a Board appeal after waiting a year for an agency decision concerning her EEO complaint protesting her discharge. The AJ dismissed the appeal as untimely because the appellant failed to provide a certificate of service with a response to the AJ's order to show cause to excuse her belated appeal. The Board disagreed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.26(b)(2) require an appellant to serve on the agency a copy of all pleadings submitted to the Board and also to file with the Board a certificate of service specifying how and when service was made. In this case, appellant failed to include the required certificate with her response to the presiding official's show cause order. Pursuant to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.12, the Board, however, may waive strict enforcement of a procedural regulation when the violation is minor and the other party has not shown harm by the failure to follow the regulation in question....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official's action in this case amounts to a sanction for the failure to comply with his order and the Board's regulation. Sanctions, however, may only be imposed "as necessary to serve the ends of justice." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.43.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, under the circumstances present here, that it would not serve the interest of justice to impose so severe a sanction as striking from consideration appellant's submission for failing to include a certificate of service. In this regard, the agency has not shown that it would be prejudiced by the acceptance of the appellant's submission. Moreover, we note that the presiding official's order returning the non-conforming submission did not inform her that a conforming copy could be submitted....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An AJ properly terminated the first session of a bifurcated hearing (split between two locations) because of the disruptive conduct of appellant's counsel. The A improperly canceled the second component of the hearing with the effect of precluding the testimony of the appellant, who was unable to attend the first segment of the hearing because of scheduled medical treatment. Although the AJ permitted the parties to submit written materials, preclusion of the appellant's testimony was "contrary of the congressional purpose to have hearings held for the employee's benefit." <span class="Italic">Williams-Scaife v. DODDS</span>, 26 MSPR 338, 340 (1985). [Refer to Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-10-067.html#sec3-67">Control and Exclusion of Representative or Participant</a>."]</p>
