<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-180"><span class="space">k.</span> Incomplete Notice of Right to File PFR</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Akin to the justification for a late PFR that the initial decision was not received is the allegation that the initial decision did not contain a complete statement of appeal rights. One appellant claimed that the AJ failed to state his appeal rights as to EEO allegations. The Board dismissed the argument, however, determining that the appellant had not raised any EEO allegations before the AJ or in his appeal and there was no reason to provide advice of EEO appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 34 MSPR 579, 581 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Sing v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 51 MSPR 251, 254 (1991) (lack of notice of EEO appeal rights was immaterial because appellant agreed in settlement not to pursue any claims in "mixed case appeal"; further, whether or not the agreement omitted consideration of relinquishment of other prohibited personnel practice defenses "does not provide a basis to extend the time limit for filing a petition for review"). If the appellant was issued an initial decision with a statement of rights concerning the filing of a PFR, a delayed PFR was not excused by the failure of an agency to provide notice of the right to petition the Board for review when the agency dismissed a related EEO complaint for lack of prosecution. <span class="Italic">Lee v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 258, 261 (1990). When the appellant was informed of his review rights, a late PFR was not excused because, after the passing of the deadline, he then was advised to file a petition by an EEO counselor and did so after receiving that advice. <span class="Italic">Leeman v. USPS</span>, 54 MSPR 476, 480 (1992).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even if the Board's initial decision fails to provide notice of the final date of that decision, a late PFR is not likely to be excused if the appellant could have readily determined the PFR deadline, <span class="Italic">Nagy v. DHHS</span>, 60 MSPR 464, 466 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Board regulations require an administrative judge to inform an appellant in the initial decision of the date when the initial decision becomes final. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.111(b)(4). The administrative judge's failure to do so was error. We find, however, that the error did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights and thus does not provide good cause to waive the filing deadline. The initial decision indicated that a filing deadline existed. The fact that the date was omitted would lead a diligent person or a person of ordinary prudence to inquire about or attempt to determine the deadline for filing the petition for review. <span class="Italic">See Caldwell v. Dept. of the Interior</span>, 58 MSPR 54, 57 (1993). The appellant does not allege that he attempted to learn the date of the last day for filing. Furthermore, the agency's notice of removal, issued July 13, 1989, but not effected, stated that a copy of the Board's regulations, which set out the 35-day deadline <span id="Page_1769"></span>for filing, was included. <span class="Italic">See Upshaw v. Dept. of</span> <span class="Italic">Defense</span>, 56 MSPR 94, 97-98 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 5 F.3d 1502 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Price v. USPS</span>, 98 MSPR 25, 27-29 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-11 (2004), rejected a PFR filed 21 years after the initial decision was issued. Although the appellant asserted that the initial decision was either incomplete as to its notice of appeal rights or not received at all, the Board concluded the appellant's explanation incredible and, if credible, it did not excuse the belated filing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, whose January 13, 1982 removal from his Full Time Carrier position with the agency was sustained by the administrative judge on June 4, 1982, filed a letter with the Board on February 9, 2004, stating he would "like to reopen this case through [the] MSPB."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 1, 2004, the Clerk of the Board sent the appellant a letter enclosing a form for filing a "Motion to Accept Filing as Timely or to Ask the Board to Waive or Set Aside the Time Limit." The letter explained that the Board's initial decision had become final when neither party petitioned for review, that the Board's regulations did not allow reconsideration of a final decision, and that a petition for review would now be substantially untimely. The Clerk wrote that the appellant must complete and submit the enclosed motion form, along with anything else he wished to include with his petition for review, by March 26, 2004, if he now wished to file a petition for review of the June 4, 1982 decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 12, 2004, the appellant filed his timeliness motion on the form provided, appearing to allege that the copy of the initial decision enclosed with his letter dated February 8 was different from the initial decision he received previously, and stating that "it could have been switched." He went on to state that he was "filing because I was never told that I could have the decision reviewed before the Board, 30 days later." The Board responded that, based on the March 12, 2004 submission, it would consider the appellant's request for reopening as a petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under regulations that were in effect at the time the initial decision in this case was issued, the deadline for filing a petition for review was 35 days after the date on which the initial decision was issued. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(b) (1982). Because the initial decision in this case was issued on June 4, 1982, the appellant's petition for review should have been filed no later than July 9, 1982, more than 21 years before he filed his letter dated February 8, 2004.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The length of the delay in this case, from the issuance of the initial decision to the filing of the petition for review, is over 21 years. Moreover, the copy of the initial decision that the appellant enclosed with his petition for review--a copy he indicates he received recently from the Board office that issued it in 1982--clearly advises the appellant of the filing time limit. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The appellant's central claim related to the timeliness issue, however, is that he was not notified of his appeal rights at the time the initial decision was issued. The appellant is not clear as to exactly what he received at that time. On the one hand, he seems to allege that he did not receive a copy of the initial decision until shortly before he filed his petition for review. That is, he states in his petition for review that he has "been trying to get a copy of the judgement for twenty years...." Conversely, he swears in his motion regarding timeliness that he received a different document that did not notify him of his appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Statements by a party, even if made under the penalty of perjury, as the appellant's statements in his timeliness motion in this case were, are entitled to little weight if they are inherently incredible or if they are disputed or rebutted by other evidence. <span class="Italic">See Anthony v. Department of Commerce</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 246, 248-49, <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, No. 98-3264 (Fed. Cir. Oct. 26, 1998) (NP). The appellant's claim, made under penalty of perjury, that "[g]iven what was happening at the time, [the initial decision] could have been switched[,]" and he was therefore not notified of his appeal rights, is inherently incredible. Moreover, it consists only of speculation, rather than a factual assertion based on the appellant's personal knowledge; the appellant offers no evidence in support of his claim; and he has not explained how such a substitution was even possible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the appellant's sworn statement in his motion seems inconsistent with, if not rebutted by, his previous allegation that he had tried unsuccessfully to get a copy of the initial decision for over twenty years. With respect to the latter allegation, we note that, ultimately, the appellant never alleges that he did not know about the initial decision sustaining his removal; he only claims that he was not told that he could appeal. Even assuming that the appellant did not receive notice that he could appeal, the appellant has not shown why it took him over 21 years to discover and exercise his appeal rights. It stands to reason that a person exercising due diligence and ordinary prudence, in the face of losing his removal appeal, would either inquire about how to challenge the outcome or accept the result and move on. How long before that inquiry should be made may be open to debate, but a delay of 21 years can only be described as so unreasonable as to be grossly negligent. <span class="Italic">See Pearce v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 251, 253 (1992) (after an 11-year delay "the appellant cannot sit on his rights for an unreasonable amount of time and then recover back-pay for that period.");<span class="Italic"> see also Campa v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 321, 323 (1994) (failing to inquire for 14 months after the initial decision was issued, even if the appellant failed to receive that decision, is not reasonably prudent under the circumstances). Further, the appellant has not described any circumstances that would show that this neglect is excusable or that he experienced any unavoidable casualty or misfortune that precluded his inquiry.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, but while a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant is not expected "to be made to jump through a confusing array of procedural hoops[,]" <span class="Italic">Walls</span>, 29 F.3d at 1583, he is accountable for his failure to make a prudent inquiry about his case, <span class="Italic">see Campa</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. at 323.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Because we find herein that the appellant has not shown good cause for his untimeliness, we need not consider the extent and nature of the prejudice to the agency that would result from waiver of the time limit. <span class="Italic">See Womack v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 798 F.2d 453, 456 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But cf</span>. <span class="Italic">McCurn v. DOD</span>, 119 MSPR 226, 234 &#x00B6; 12, 2013 MSPB 17 (2013) ("We recognize that in <span class="Italic">Simpson v. Department of Defense,</span> 53 M.S.P.R. 518, 521 (1992), and <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of the Navy,</span> 37 M.S.P.R. 560, 564 n.2 (1988), the Board concluded that providing an appellant with notice of his right to directly appeal an adverse action to the Board and a copy of the Board's regulations constituted sufficient notice of an appellant's right to request Board review of an arbitration decision. Those cases were decided prior to the Board's May 3, 2000 revision of its regulations to require agencies to inform employees in adverse action decision letters of their right to request Board review of an arbitration decision. 65 Fed. Reg. 25,624 (May 3, 2000). Simply put, <span class="Italic">Simpson</span> and <span class="Italic">Smith</span> have been superseded by the 2000 regulatory change. Thus, although the agency's decision letter informing the appellant that he could obtain a copy of the Board's regulations by contacting the agency's personnel office may have been adequate at one point, doing so was not adequate at the time of the agency's decision.").</p>
