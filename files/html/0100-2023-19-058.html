<p class="Body-Text">Discrimination based on a disabling condition is an affirmative defense to be pleaded and proved. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kosanowsky v. Dept. of Army</span>, 659 F. Supp. 872, 876 (S.D.N.Y. 1987) (in an MSPB case, disability discrimination is an affirmative defense to be pleaded and proved by the party having the burden of presenting the defense; MSPB had no authority to raise the defense <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">McKowen v. DLA</span>, 10 MSPR 98, 101 (1982) (principle of <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> consideration under circumstances that would otherwise work manifest injustice against the appellant applies to the affirmative defense of disability discrimination; the circumstances were not present, however, in appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pridgen v. OMB</span>, 2022 MSPB 31, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 35-37, 40, 42 (2022), outlined the elements of a disability discrimination affirmative defense in a Chapter 43 appeal (an analysis distinct from an assertion that reasonable accommodation was not provided to the disabled person). <span class="Italic">Pridgen</span> also explained that the remedies available for disparate treatment disability discrimination will vary based on the level of causation; when disability discrimination is a but-for cause of the personnel action, full relief, including reinstatement, back pay, and damages, is available. When disability discrimination is merely a motivating factor, but not a but-for cause, injunctive or other forward-looking relief is available:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board adjudicates claims of disability discrimination raised in connection with an otherwise appealable action under the substantive standards of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act. The standards under the ADA, as amended by the Americans with Disabilities Act <span id="Page_3416"></span>Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), have been incorporated by reference into the Rehabilitation Act, and the Board applies them to determine whether there has been a Rehabilitation Act violation. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791(f); <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of the Army</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 13 n.3 (2014). The ADA originally prohibited discrimination "because of" an individual's disability; Congress changed this language in the ADAAA to prohibit discrimination "on the basis of disability." ADAAA, Pub. L. No. 110-325, &#x00A7; 5(a), 122 Stat. 3553, 3557. Because the ADAAA went into effect prior to the events in this matter, we apply the standards set forth in the ADA as amended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant proved she was regarded as disabled, and thus was an individual with a disability for purposes of the ADA. We clarify that the appellant met her burden to prove she was an individual with a disability by proving that she was actually disabled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To prove disability discrimination under the ADA, the appellant must establish that she is an individual with a disability as that term is defined in the ADA and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations. <span class="Italic">Thome v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 315, &#x00B6; 24 (2015). She may prove that she has a disability by showing that she: (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; (2) has a record of such impairment; or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(1); <span class="Italic">Thome</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 315, &#x00B6; 24; 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g)(1). Major life activities include the operation of major bodily functions, such as bowel functions. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(2)(B); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(i)(1)(ii). The determination of whether a condition is substantially limiting is made by comparing the ability of the allegedly disabled individual to the abilities of "most people in the general population." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(ii). The "substantially limits" standard is not "demanding," and is intended to "be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(i).</p>

To sustain [a] <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, there should also be a facial showing or at least plausible reasons to believe that the handicap can be accommodated...." The EEOC's implementing regulations concerning the term "qualified handicapped employee" require that such an employee be able to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodation. [29 CFR 1614.203(a)(6)].A qualified handicapped employee who performs the essential functions of the job is one who can fully perform the required work given accommodation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming that an employee establishes status as a qualified handicapped employee, an agency is then required to provide reasonable accommodation unless the agency can show undue hardship....&#8197;Of course, the appellant is not required to suggest all possible reasonable accommodation in order to establish that he is a qualified handicapped employee. The employing agency is often in a much better position to suggest such accommodations....&#8197;An agency is not required to provide accommodation to a qualified handicapped employee if it can prove that to do so would create an undue administrative or financial burden, or substantial modification of job requirements....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency not only suggested and considered alternative reasonable accommodations, it implemented them. The agency's actions prior to proposing removal of liberally granting leave, significantly reducing appellant's workload, and providing close supervision of appellant's work are evidence of this....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant contends that he never received substantive training in areas of law that comprised the major areas of his work responsibility....&#8197;[S]uch training was offered by the agency on a general basis to appellant and other attorneys in his office. Appellant failed, however, to request the opportunity to attend specific training sessions. More importantly, the agency was under no duty to provide training as an accommodation where no indication existed that training would have improved appellant's performance....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant offered no evidence, medical or otherwise, demonstrating that training would or could have improved his work performance....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the appellant had established such a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the agency established that the suggested accommodation was not likely to result in improved performance. An agency is not required to spend its money and exert its resources pursuing every conceivable accommodation advanced by an employee when there is little or no likelihood that the accommodation will correct the performance or conduct deficiencies claimed to be caused by the handicap....&#8197;This result especially applies when the handicapped employee...fails in any way to assist the agency by showing how the accommodation might enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The next accommodation suggested was reassignment....&#8197;No vacancies existed in positions appellant would have been qualified to fill, in part because a freeze on filling positions was in effect at the time reassignment was considered. Despite this, a diligent effort was made to locate a non-legal programmatic position...an offer...was made....&#8197;The offer was declined. The appellant may not force consideration of reassignment <span class="Italic">ad</span> <span class="Italic">infinitum</span>....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The final accommodation suggested by appellant is the excusing of the AWOL charge that partially supported the agency's sustained third reason for his removal....&#8197;The Rehabilitation Act was not designed to excuse handicapped employees for acts of misconduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Mr. Lynch took his case to district court. The court vacated the order of the Special Panel, finding that it had overstepped its jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Lynch v. Bennett</span>, 665 F. Supp. 62 (D.D.C. 1987) (the district court decision is discussed earlier in comments about Special Panel operations). On remand to the Board, the analysis of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case changed slightly as the Board sought to justify a different result in the appeal, <span class="Italic">Lynch v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 37 MSPR 12, 15-16 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was an epileptic during all of his employment with the government. However, in 1979, appellant's condition worsened, such that his memory and ability to concentrate were adversely affected. Appellant's treating physician changed appellant's medication...which, while providing relief from the seizures, caused insomnia and further exacerbated his difficulties with concentration. It is appellant's contention that his epileptic condition and the medication required to treat that condition, combined with his inexperience in the legal duties assigned him, adversely affected his ability to work at the desired level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On numerous occasions, the appellant advised his supervisors of the effects of his epilepsy and medication and he provided medical documentation of same. On each occasion he requested accommodation. Specifically, the appellant asked that he be provided training in legal drafting and in Titles VI and IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; specific structured assignments, including clear written assignment directions and increased supervisory assistance; and the opportunity to make up the hours of work missed because of late arrivals. Although the agency allowed appellant to work a flexible schedule, he was not provided the other accommodations he requested.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's protection against discrimination on account of his handicap is derived from section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 USC 791, and implementing regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations define "handicapped person" as one who has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities. 29 CFR 1603.702(a). There is no question that appellant is a handicapped person. Ample evidence is in the record to show that appellant has a history of epilepsy and that the disease and its treatment affect his ability to remember and to concentrate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant must show, however, that with or without reasonable accommodation, he can perform the essential functions of the position in question without endangering the health and safety of himself or others. [29 CFR 1614.203(a)(6)].That burden, in our opinion, has been met. Appellant has presented evidence that he had previously performed the duties of an attorney in an outstanding manner. In addition, his testimony and the medical evidence demonstrates that it is very likely that the difficulties he eventually experienced on the job were caused by the effects of epilepsy and the drugs required to control the disease. Finally, he has articulated an accommodation which quite possibly would ameliorate the adverse effects that his epilepsy had on his ability to perform. Accordingly, the appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency's obligation is to make reasonable accommodation to <span id="Page_3419"></span>the known physical or mental limitations of a qualified handicapped employee unless it can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has never asserted that the requested accommodation would cause it undue hardship, but instead argued that it had adequately accommodated appellant by allowing him to come in late and leave late and by excusing his typos. The agency also contended that the training provided by the appellant, although not the substantive training requested of the agency, was sufficient to meet its burden. We find the agency's conclusory claims that the additional accommodations requested by the appellant would not have the effect of overcoming the appellant's difficulties are insufficient to meet the agency's burden.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even if an individual's condition does not qualify as a disability subject to an employer's accommodative responsibility, that condition may still serve to mitigate an adverse action.
