<h3 class="h3" id="sec1-14"><span class="space">C.</span> ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGES</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Board members need not be lawyers; some members have had a quite different professional education and career before arriving at the Board. The requirement to be a Board member is expressed at 5 USC 1201: "The members of the Board shall be individuals who, by demonstrated ability, background, training, or experience are especially qualified to carry out the functions of the Board." Any member of the Board may adjudicate cases, but few do. Adjudication is entrusted by delegation under 5 USC 1204(b)(1) to any designated "employee of the Board" who "may administer oaths, examine witnesses, take depositions, and receive evidence." And under 5 USC 7701(b)(1):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may hear any case appealed to it or may refer the case to an administrative law judge appointed under section 3105 of this title or other employee of the Board designated by the Board to hear such cases, except that in any case involving a removal from the service, the case shall be heard by the Board, an employee experienced in hearing appeals, or an administrative law judge....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board has employed a couple administrative law judges in past years, but now, when an ALJ is required (e.g., to provide a hearing to an ALJ whose removal is sought by that ALJ's employing agency), the ALJ is obtained through contract with another federal agency that has a permanent corps of ALJs for its own adjudications--a loaner judge. The ordinary appeal is heard by an "other employee" designated to hear such cases, except in removal cases the case is heard by "an employee experienced in hearing appeals." Those "other employees" are administrative judges (AJs), as designated and authorized by Board regulations. The only statutory references to MSPB administrative judges appear in 2017 legislation modifying appellate rights of Department of Veterans Affairs personnel, 38 USC 714, 731.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Those employees "experienced in hearing appeals" need not be attorneys, but they are. The Board's policy is to entrust adjudication to attorney-examiners designated as AJs in the regional and field offices. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-018.html#sec1-19">Judges' Position Description, Performance Standards</a>."] The Board's definition of a "judge" (usually referred to as an AJ) is broadly stated, 5 CFR 1201.4 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Judge</span>. Any person authorized by the Board to hold a hearing or to decide a case without a hearing, including the Board or any member of the Board, or an administrative law judge appointed under 5 U.S.C. 3105 or other employee of the Board designated by the Board to hear such cases, except that in any case involving a removal from the service, the case shall be heard by the Board, an employee experienced in hearing appeals, or an administrative law judge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ receives his or her authority to adjudicate appeals under Board regulations that implement 5 USC 7703. Under 5 CFR 1200.10 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Regional and Field Offices</span>. The Board has regional and field offices located throughout the country (See Appendix II to 5 CFR part 1201 for a list of the regional and field offices). Judges in the regional and field offices hear and decide initial appeals and other assigned cases as provided for in the Board's regulations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The authority of Board AJs is generally outlined by 5 CFR 1201.41 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exercise of authority</span>. Judges may exercise authority as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section on their own motion or on the motion of a party, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Authority</span>. Judges will conduct fair and impartial hearings and will issue timely and clear decisions based on statutes and legal precedents. They will have all powers necessary to that end unless those powers are otherwise limited by law. Judges' powers include, but are not limited to, the authority to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Administer oaths and affirmations;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Issue subpoenas under &#x00A7; 1201.81 of this part;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Rule on offers of proof and receive relevant evidence;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Rule on discovery motions under &#x00A7; 1201.73 of this part;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;After notice to the parties, order a hearing on his or her own initiative if the judge determines that a hearing is necessary:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;To resolve an important issue of credibility;</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The term "administrative judge" is scattered throughout 5 CFR Part 1201, outlining other authorities and responsibilities of AJs.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Only one member of the Board's corps of AJs will constitute, for most litigants, the "judge" and the most significant and most visible point of contact with the Board, for the assigned AJ is entrusted with development of the appeal record and the issuance of an initial decision that, if challenged through a petition for review (PFR), leads to the Board's final administrative disposition of the appeal at the headquarters level. If the initial decision is not challenged by PFR or reopened at the initiative of the Board (a rare occurrence), it becomes the final decision of the Board, still subject to further review by the EEOC or in court.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because AJs' decisions are subject to review by the MSPB through a petition <span id="Page_15"></span>for review from a party, and they are subject to reopening by the Board, the appointment scheme for AJs appears to be valid--without the need for their presidential appointment and Senate confirmation. The matter of when administrative adjudicators are "principal officers" rather than "inferior officers" of the United States is complex, but the review and reopening authority of the Board over AJs' decisions seems to leave the AJs federal civil servants removable for cause and properly appointed to hear appeals without a direct (or indirect) presidential appointment. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Lucia v. SEC</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/insco20180621g87">138 S. Ct. 2044</a> (2018), <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">Arthrex, Inc. v.

In <span class="Italic">Arthrex</span>, the Federal Circuit, reviewing a patent dispute, considered the status of administrative patent judges (APJs) and, deciding that their tenure was not within the direct control of the USPTO head, and determining that their decisions were not subject to direct reopening authority by the USPTO head (or someone with delegated authority), constructively created USPTO control of the judges' tenure by announcing (without involvement by the judges as <span class="Italic">amicus</span> or intervenors) that the judges' could not continue with preexisting CSRA civil service protections. The court having stripped the patent judges of statutory employment protections, they became employees at will (the will of the agency head) and were under the direct control of the USPTO head (who could summarily remove a judge), creating, to the satisfaction of the court, the appropriate degree of control by the agency head of policy decisions made through decisions of patent judges. The unfortunate judges found advocates for their employment protections in a dissent by Judges Dyk, Newman, Wallach, and Huges to the courts' denial of rehearing <span class="Italic">en banc</span>, <span class="Italic">Arthrex Inc. v. Smith &#x0026; Nephew, Inc</span>., <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/18-2140.Order.3-23-2020.1_1555686.pdf">953 F.3d 760</a>, 769-773 (Fed. Cir. 2020). The dissent correctly argued that the solution should be legislative and that "[b]y eliminating Title 5 removal protections for APJs, the panel is performing major surgery to the statute that Congress could not possibly have foreseen or intended." Questions concerning the <span class="Italic">Arthrex</span> "fix" of the issue of agency head control over APJs' decisions were also echoed in a concurrence by Judges Huges and Wallach in <span class="Italic">Polaris Innovations Ltd. v.

Arthrex, Inc., <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/insco20210621954">141 S. Ct. 1970</a> (2021), when that Court resolved the problem of control over the decisions of those judges not by denying them civil service protection, but by vesting in the Patent Office Director the authority to review their decisions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McClenning v. Dept. of Army</span>, 2022 MSPB 3 (2022), provided extensive explanation of the <span class="Italic">Lucia</span> issue as it was raised to challenge the appointment of an MSPB AJ, but the issue was deemed untimely raised since it was not first presented to the AJ. On the day two MSPB members were sworn in, March 4, 2022 (establishing a quorum absent since 2017), those members issued a "Ratification Order" for the MSPB AJs, affirming their delegation of authority to act for Board members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In our capacity as Members of the Merit Systems Protection Board ("MSPB"), we hereby ratify the prior appointments of the individuals listed below to the position of MSPB Attorney Examiner (commonly known as Administrative Judge), Supervisory Attorney Examiner (commonly known as Chief Administrative Judge), or Regional Director, as the case may be, and we today approve these appointments as our own under Article II of the Constitution.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Also on March 4, 2022, the Board issued a "Ratification Order" covering ALJs whose services are loaned or contracted to MSPB by other federal agencies.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Determining that its ratification order was valid, in <span class="Italic">Jolley v. DHUD</span>, AT-4324-18-0576-I-2 n.7 (NP 3/31/2022), the Board advised:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Appointments Clause permits the appointment of inferior officers by the head of a department; principal officers must be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. We see no basis to conclude that the Board's administrative judges are principal officers. <span class="Italic">See Freytag v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</span>, 501 U.S. 868, 880-82 (1991) (holding that special trial judges of the Tax Court, who exercise significant discretion in adjudicating matters before them, are inferior officers). Thus, the appointment of administrative judges by the Board satisfies the requirements of the Appointments Clause even if Board administrative judges are officers, rather than mere employees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Flynn v. SEC</span>, DC-1221-14-1124-M-4 (NP 3/31/2022), involving a remand from the Fourth Circuit in an IRA appeal, avoided the <span class="Italic">Lucia</span> issue by assigning a new AJ to adjudicate the case on remand (when the AJ assigned at the time of the court remand had not yet taken evidence on the remanded issues but instead DWOP'd the appeal pending resolution of the Appointments Clause issue): "In order to avoid any additional Appointments Clause issues, we direct the regional office to assign the appeal to a properly appointed official other than either the administrative judge who issued the first initial decision or the administrative judge who certified the interlocutory appeal."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit reentered the Appointments Clause arena--this time with focus on MSPB AJs--and found that the AJs operated under administrative control by MSPB and subject to reopening (and Board control) of their decisions through either the PFR process or through the Board's authority to reopen its own decisions, <span class="Italic">McIntosh v. DOD</span>, 53 F.4th 630, 638-42 (Fed. Cir. 2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. McIntosh first argues that, under the Appointments Clause, the Board's administrative judges are principal officers and are therefore required to be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Because the administrative judge here was not appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, Ms. McIntosh contends that her final decision is invalid. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Appointments Clause provides that only the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, can appoint principal officers. U.S. Const. art. II, &#x00A7; 2, cl. 2; <span class="Italic">United States v. Arthrex, Inc.</span>, 141 S. Ct. 1970, 1979 (2021). For inferior officers, the Clause permits Congress to vest appointment power "in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments." U.S. Const. art. II, &#x00A7; 2, cl. 2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court has explained that "[w]hether one is an 'inferior' officer depends on whether he has a superior," and "'inferior officers' are officers whose work is directed and supervised at some level by others who were appointed by Presidential nomination with the advice and consent of the Senate." <span class="Italic">Edmond v. United States</span>, 520 U.S. 651, 662-63 (1997). Edmond emphasized three factors for distinguishing principal and inferior officers: (1) whether an appointed official has the power to review and reverse the officers' decision; (2) the level of supervision and oversight an appointed official has over the officers; and (3) whether an appointed official has the power to remove the officers without cause. See id. at 664-65; <span class="Italic">see also Intercollegiate Broad. Sys., Inc. v. Copyright Royalty Bd.</span>, 684 F.3d 1332, 1338 (D.C. Cir. 2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">United States v. Arthrex, Inc.</span>, the Supreme Court determined that the administrative patent judges of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), who are appointed by the Secretary of Commerce and issue decisions on behalf of the Executive Branch, were improperly appointed principal officers because they had the "'power to render a final decision on behalf of the United States' without any...review by their nominal superior or any other principal officer in the Executive Branch." 141 S. Ct. at 1981 (quoting Edmond, 520 U.S. at 665). Ms. McIntosh contends that the same problem exists with the Merit Systems Protection Board's administrative judges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's structure and, in particular, how its administrative judges are appointed and issue decisions, is different from the PTAB. The MSPB itself is made up of three members who are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, making them principal officers. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1201. The Board's administrative judges, who are appointed under the Board Chairman's general authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(j), adjudicate cases and issue initial decisions under the Board's appellate jurisdiction. See 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(1) ("The Board may hear any case appealed to it or may refer the case to an...employee of the Board designated by the Board to hear such cases...."). An administrative judge's initial decision becomes the final decision of the Board unless a party appeals or the Board reopens the case on its own motion. Id. &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1). Thus, unlike the PTAB, an administrative judge's decision is subject to review by a principal officer, in this case, the three member MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Still, Ms. McIntosh argues that the Board's administrative judges qualify as principal officers because "an appointed official...does not have the power to review and reverse [their] decision[s] in cases that are <span class="Italic">not</span> appealed to the Board." Appellant's Br. 49 (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)-(b)) (emphasis added). Ms. McIntosh is incorrect. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1)(B), the Board, whose members are principal officers appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, see 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1201, may "reopen[ ] and reconsider[ ] a case <span class="Italic">on its own motion</span>." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1)(B) (emphasis added). Review is not limited only to cases in which a party appeals to the full Board. Even "[o]ne member of the Board may grant a petition or otherwise direct that a decision be reviewed by the full Board." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> And the Board has discretion to determine whether "unusual or extraordinary circumstances" warrant reopening the appeal. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.118. In contrast, no principal officer had the power to review the final decisions of administrative patent judges before the constitutional remedy in <span class="Italic">Arthrex. See Arthrex</span>, 141 S. Ct. at 1981.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal employees retain the unilateral ability to petition for the Board's review of an administrative judge's initial decision, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1)(A); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(c), and so need not rely on the Board's discretion to obtain review. Upon review, the Board may "reverse, modify, or vacate" the administrative judge's decision. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.117. Moreover, "the board is free to substitute its judgment for that of one of its presiding officials." <span class="Italic">Connolly v. U.S. Dep't of Just</span>., 766 F.2d 507, 512 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The statutes and related regulations show that the Board maintains significant review authority over administrative judges' decisions, and the first and second prongs of <span class="Italic">Edmond</span> weigh in favor of concluding that the Board's administrative judges are not principal officers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. McIntosh next argues that the Board Chairman "lack[s] unfettered removal authority" to remove the Board's administrative judges, <span id="Page_16"></span>suggesting that they are principal officers under the third <span class="Italic">Edmond</span> prong. Appellant's Br. 50 (quoting <span class="Italic">Arthrex, Inc. v. Smith &#x0026; Nephew, Inc</span>., 941 F.3d 1320, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2019), <span class="Italic">vacated</span>, 141 S. Ct. 1970). While true that the Board's administrative judges can only be removed "for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a), that fact alone is insufficient to render them principal officers. Indeed, in <span class="Italic">Arthrex</span>, the same for-cause removal restriction applied to administrative patent judges, but the Supreme Court ultimately held that the administrative patent judges could properly be considered inferior officers, even with the restriction on removal, as long as their decisions were subject to review by a principal officer. <span class="Italic">Arthrex</span>, 141 S. Ct. at 1985-87. To remedy the unconstitutional statutory structure in <span class="Italic">Arthrex</span>, the Supreme Court held unenforceable the provision of the America Invents Act that shielded administrative patent judges' decisions from Director review. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1987. This enabled the Director to "review[ ] the decisions of the PTAB on his own." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Court left in place the removal restrictions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513, because, "regardless [of] whether...at-will removal by the Secretary would cure the constitutional problem, review by the Director better reflects the structure of supervision within the PTO and the nature of [administrative patent judges'] duties." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Court emphasized that "the Director need not review <span class="Italic">every</span> decision of the PTAB. What matters is that the Director have the discretion to review decisions rendered by [administrative patent judges]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1988 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, unlike the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Director or the Secretary of Commerce, principal officers who previously lacked the authority to review administrative patent judges' decisions, <span class="Italic">see Arthrex</span>, 141 S. Ct. at 1978, the Board, a body of properly appointed principal officers, already has the discretion and authority to review administrative judges' decisions <span class="Italic">sua sponte, see supra</span> section III.A. The Board's statutory structure mirrors that of the PTAB following the <span class="Italic">Arthrex</span> remedy: the Board has the unfettered authority to review decisions rendered by administrative judges, and so even if the administrative judges are protected by the &#x00A7; 7513 removal standard, they are "subject to the direction and supervision of an officer nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate," just as administrative patent judges are following the <span class="Italic">Arthrex</span> remedy. <span class="Italic">Arthrex</span>, 141 S. Ct. at 1988. We hold that the Board's administrative judges are not principal officers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, Ms. McIntosh argues that the administrative judge's decision violates the Appointments Clause because no Board was in place throughout her case, meaning "whatever review authority or removal authority the Board has over [administrative judges] is non-existent and inapplicable as applied to Ms. McIntosh." But Ms. McIntosh could have still petitioned for Board review and had her decision reviewed once a quorum was established, as explained at the end of the administrative judge's decision. Furthermore, this court recently considered this argument in another Board appeal and rejected it:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The absence of a quorum...is a temporary circumstance, not a structural defect resulting from statutory limitations on Board review of administrative judges' initial decisions.... To be sure, the temporary absence of a quorum means that, at present, if an employee seeks review by the Board, the review will be delayed. But the delay, while unfortunate, does not convert a constitutionally valid review process into a violation of the Appointments Clause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Dep't of Veterans Affs</span>., 8 F.4th 1290, 1309 (Fed. Cir. 2021). We note that Board members have since been nominated and confirmed, and a quorum has been restored. Press Release, U.S. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., MSPB Welcomes Acting Chairman Cathy A. Harris (June 6, 2022), <a href="https://mspb.gov/publicaffairs/press_releases/Cathy_Harris_ Press_Release_1930967.pdf">https://mspb.gov/publicaffairs/press_releases/Cathy_Harris_ Press_Release_1930967.pdf</a>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Ms. McIntosh argues in her Reply Brief that even if the Board's administrative judges are inferior officers and not principal officers, they are still not properly appointed by the "President," a "court[ ] of law," or a "head[ ] of department[ ]" as required by the Appointments Clause. The government argues that she has doubly forfeited this challenge by not raising it before the Board or in her opening brief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. McIntosh did not preserve this argument because challenging the appointment of an inferior officer is a separate ground for reversal that she failed to raise in her opening brief. "Our law is well established that arguments not raised in the opening brief are" forfeited. <span class="Italic">Smithkline Beecham Corp. v. Apotex Corp</span>., 439 F.3d 1312, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (citation omitted). We have found similar belated Appointments Clause challenges forfeited following our initial decision in <span class="Italic">Arthrex</span>. <span class="Italic">See Customedia Techs., LLC v. Dish Network Corp</span>., 941 F.3d 1173, 1174 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (concluding that Appointments Clause challenges not raised in the opening brief are forfeited).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the administrative judges are inferior officers, any issues with their appointment have since been remedied. A quorum of the reconstituted Board, who qualify as "heads of departments" under the Appointments Clause, issued a Ratification Order on March 4, 2022 that ratified the prior appointments of administrative judges, "approv[ing] these appointments as our own under Article II of the Constitution." U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board Ratification Order (Mar. 4, 2022), available at <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/foia/files/AJ_Ratification_Order_3-4-2022.pdf">https://www.mspb.gov/foia/files/AJ_Ratification_Order_3-4-2022.pdf</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In sum, the Board's administrative judges are not principal officers under the Appointments Clause because the Board retains the unfettered authority to review their decisions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1)(B), meaning they are "subject to the direction and supervision of an officer nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate." <span class="Italic">Arthrex</span>, 141 S. Ct. at 1988. Ms. McIntosh's Appointments Clause challenge thus fails, and we turn to the merits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">MSPB has statutory, 5 USC 7701(e)(1)(B), and regulatory, 5 CFR 1201.118 (2022), authority to reopen decisions, so that the constitutional problem considered by the Federal Circuit and resolved by the Supreme Court in Arthrex should not be an impediment to the proper exercise by MSPB AJs of their (reviewable) decisional authority. The Federal Circuit decided that the record was not sufficiently developed to consider an Appointments Clause challenge to MSPB AJs in Rodriguez v. VA, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210812139">8 F.4th 1290</a>, 1309 (Fed. Cir. 2021), although the court noted another pending appeal raising the issue and, as to the effect of the lack of a quorum of Board members on AJs' ability to issued decisions by reason of those three empty chairs (filled in early 2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...To be sure, the temporary absence of a quorum means that, at present, if an employee seeks review by the Board, the review will be delayed. But the delay, while unfortunate, does not convert a constitutionally valid review process into a violation of the Appointments Clause. See United States v. Eaton, 169 U.S. 331, 343 (1898) (holding that a subordinate "charged with the performance of the duty of the superior for a limited time, and under special and temporary conditions" is not "thereby transformed into the superior and permanent official."). The delay caused by the absence of a quorum on the Board does not render the statutory adjudicative scheme constitutionally suspect any more than would be true in the event of a lengthy delay in the resolution of Board appeals caused by a severe backlog in cases pending before the Board.[12]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;If the absence of a quorum were to continue for a significant additional period with no prospect that new Board members would be appointed, the absence of a quorum might give rise to an Appointments Clause issue. However, two nominees for the three-person Board (a quorum) have now been named, and there is therefore a reasonable prospect that the absence of the availability of prompt Board review will soon be resolved--perhaps before this case is readjudicated on remand.</p>
