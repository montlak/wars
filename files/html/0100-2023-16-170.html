<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-170"><span class="space">j.</span> Other Working Conditions</h5>
<p class="noindent">Interference and coercion resulted from a supervisor's denial of a union steward's opportunities to earn hazard duty pay when the supervisor's actions resulted from response, proved through both direct and circumstantial evidence of timing, to the steward's protected activity, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA,</span> 64 FLRA 365, 365-71 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The steward is an Aerospace Engineer whose duties involve, among other things, the certification of various types of aircraft, including conducting or observing the in-flight testing of aircraft. He receives a 25 percent pay differential for any 8-hour work period in which he witnesses or performs in-flight testing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the fall of 2004; the supervisor stated to the steward that he (the steward) was not required to have a third class medical certificate to perform duties while in flight. The supervisor told the steward that, instead, the steward could provide a doctor's note indicating his fitness to perform those duties. Thereafter, the steward presented, and the supervisor accepted, a doctor's note stating: "Patient in satisfactory condition for flight long distance." As a result of the doctor's note, the supervisor approved the steward to participate in flight testing on a project that involved a trip to Brazil.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On October 24, while in Brazil, the steward sent an email to other Union representatives. The email concerned the supervisor's statements regarding the necessity for third class medical certificates and a doctor's note. The steward's message read, in part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The agency has recently told me AND the [Federal Labor Relations Authority] that there is currently no longer ANY requirement for a[n] engineer, including those in flight test, to maintain a 3rd Class medical certificate in order to perform flight test related duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">However, the supervisor of the Flight Test Branch in [Los Angeles] told those of us without a 3rd class medical it is his responsibility to ensure that when he assign[s] a project that those he assigns it to are physically capable of performing the job. As such, we were told <span id="Page_1399"></span>that he either requires us to show him that we posses[s] a 3rd Class medical certificate or provide him a doctor[']s note saying I and [sic] physically able to fly (those were his exact words).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">As such, I provided him a doctor[']s note that said precisely that "Patient is OK able to fly." I submitted this and made sure they knew that the doctor performed absolutely no extra tests or anything prior to giving me the note. I guess this was satisfactory since just prior to leaving for Brazil he asked about flying down here and I told him I would [be] flying with Embraer since I had given him the doctor's note just as he had asked.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Please let everyone know that the agency is now claiming that there is no requirement for an engineer to have a 3rd class medical and that if there [sic] supervisor assigns them work, they should assume the supervisor has satisfactorily carried out his responsibility of ensuring that the person is physically capable of [sic] do the job.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If any person is told otherwise, i.e., they are told FAA policy or orders require them to hold one, please let me know immediately as this would demonstrate that what they are telling the [Federal Labor Relations Authority] is untrue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On October 28, the supervisor sent an email to several of the Respondent's supervisors that discussed and contained a copy of the steward's October 24 email. As relevant here, the supervisor's message stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Due to the sensitive nature of this topic could you please comment on the following bold text I plan to send to [the steward]. I included in italics [the steward's] email for reference. (My use of the word "developments" is meant to indicate [the steward's] inappropriate, and partially inaccurate email which he only addressed to union personnel). FYI Adam 500 FAA flight testing is continuing next week and [the steward] will now not be participating until this is resolved.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">After further developments and scrutiny by, additional FAA personnel involved, the doctor [sic] note you submitted stating your fitness "to fly on long flights" has been determined not to meet the proper intent. The medical fitness determination needs to specifically attest to your fitness for flying as a crewmember. If your personal physician does not understand, or is unable to make such a determination a qualified flight surgeon should conduct the examination. As I explained previously, you also have the option of obtaining a Class 3 Medical Certificate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On November 1, after the steward returned from Brazil, he read an email dated October 29 from the supervisor to him stating that the doctor's note submitted was no longer acceptable as proof of the steward's fitness to participate in flight tests. The supervisor further advised that the steward was required either to undergo an examination by a flight surgeon or to obtain a third class certificate. In this regard, the supervisor stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">After further review, I do not consider the doctor's note you submitted regarding your fitness "for [f]light long distance" to be adequate. The medical determination needs to specifically attest to your fitness for flying as a crewmember. Since your personal physician cannot make such a determination, a qualified flight surgeon must conduct the examination. As I explained previously, you also have the option of obtaining a Class 3 Medical Certificate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the same day, the steward received by facsimile a copy of the supervisor's October 28 email to other Respondent officials.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also on November 1, the steward and the supervisor had a conversation regarding the email. The parties' versions of the conversation, which differ, are discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The GC issued a complaint alleging that the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (2) of the Statute by disqualifying the steward from participating in the Adam 500 flight test based on his protected activity. The complaint also alleges that the Respondent independently violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) when the supervisor informed the steward that he was disqualified from flying as a crew member based on his protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7116(a)(2) of the Statute provides that it is an unfair labor practice for an agency to encourage or discourage membership in a union by discrimination in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment. The <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> framework applies in resolving allegations of discrimination claimed to violate &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2). Under that framework, whether the GC has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is determined by considering the evidence in the record as a whole, not just the evidence presented by the GC. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Warner Robins Air Logistics Ctr., Robins Air Force Base, Ga.,</span> 55 FLRA 1201, 1205 (2000). The timing of management actions may be significant in determining whether an employee's protected activity was a motivating factor, within the meaning of <span class="Italic">Letterkenny.</span> <span class="Italic">US. Dep't of Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Northampton, Mass.,</span> 51 FLRA 1520, 1528 (1996) (<span class="Italic">VA Northampton</span>); <span class="Italic">Frenchburg,</span> 49 FLRA at 1033; <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA, El Paso, Tex.,</span> 39 FLRA 1542, 1552 (1991); <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Serv. Region IV, Miami Dist, Miami, Fla.,</span> 36 FLRA 489, 496 (1990). Moreover, when the alleged discrimination is based on conduct occurring during protected activity, "a necessary part of the respondent's defense is that the conduct constituted flagrant misconduct <span class="Italic">or otherwise exceeded the boundaries of protected activity.</span>" <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Defense, Defense Contract Mgmt. Agency, Orlando,</span> <span class="Italic">Fla.,</span> 59 FLRA 223, 226 (2003) (<span class="Italic">DoD</span>) (emphasis in original) (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case's first prong under <span class="Italic">Letterkenny,</span> there is no dispute that the steward's October 24 email to other Union representatives constituted protected activity under &#x00A7; 7102 of the Statute. The first requirement for establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination is therefore satisfied. <span class="Italic">See</span> 35 FLRA at 118, 126.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To satisfy the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case's second prong, the GC must show that the protected activity was a motivating factor in the Respondent's treatment of the employee in connection with conditions of employment. We find that this showing has been made.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A preponderance of the record evidence supports the finding that the steward's protected activity was a motivating factor in the activity's decision to disqualify the steward from the Adam 500 flight test. As set forth above, on October 28, the supervisor sent an email to several of the Respondent's supervisors that discussed and contained a copy of the steward's October 24 email to other Union representatives. <span class="Italic">The next day,</span> by email dated October 29, the supervisor notified the steward that a doctor's note was no longer acceptable as proof of the steward's medical fitness for flight tests. This timing strongly suggests that the steward's email was a motivating factor in the Respondent's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the supervisor's October 28 email makes an <span class="Italic">explicit</span> <span class="Italic">connection</span> between the steward's protected activity and the decision to disqualify the steward from participating in the Adam 500 flight test. In particular, the supervisor expressly stated that he proposed to notify the steward that the steward's doctor's note would not be acceptable because of "developments" and that "the word 'developments' is meant to indicate [the steward's] inappropriate and partially inaccurate email[.]" This evidence supports a finding that the steward's protected activity was a motivating factor in the activity's disqualification of the steward from the Adam 500 test flight.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the evidence to the contrary unpersuasive.&#x2003;In determining that the October 24 email was not a motivating factor in the activity's treatment of the steward, the Judge viewed the activity's decision to ground the steward as merely a correction of an obvious error. Further, in the Judge's view, the steward knew or should have known that his doctor's statement was insufficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge's determinations lack a foundation in the record. As the Judge acknowledged, at the time of the steward's disqualification, there were no written requirements that employees such as the steward have third class medical certificates. In fact, the Respondent did not issue such a requirement until July 2005, well after the steward's disqualification.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At most, any policy that was in place at the time of the incident was unclear. The Respondent argues that its July 2005 issuance was only a clarification of "any misinterpretation" of the activity's policy existing at the time of the incident. However, the Respondent's argument is an admission that any such policy was so unclear that it required clarification. Further, the supervisor's initial acceptance of the steward's doctor's note was consistent with the supervisor's prior statement to the steward that, in lieu of a third class medical certificate, the steward could provide a doctor's note indicating his fitness to perform his duties while in flight.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the record does not provide a basis for concluding that the steward knew or should have known that his doctor's statement was insufficient because the doctor was not a flight surgeon. As discussed previously, the supervisor told the steward that a doctor's note was sufficient, and indeed accepted such a note. It was not until the time of the incident that the supervisor told the steward in an email message that the steward was required to obtain a statement from a different doctor--a qualified flight surgeon. Similarly, the fact that the steward previously held a third class medical certificate does not support a conclusion that the steward should have known that his supervisor was mistaken in both soliciting and accepting his doctor's note.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is also clear that the activity's improper treatment of the steward was "'in connection with...conditions of employment." <span class="Italic">Letterkenny,</span> 35 FLRA at 118. The Authority has held, and the parties do not dispute, that the distribution of hazardous duty pay constitutes a condition of employment within the meaning of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Air Force, Loring AFB, Limestone, Me.,</span> 43 FLRA 1087, 1101, 1131 (1992) (distribution of environmental differential pay is a condition of employment). It follows that the activity's grounding of the steward, depriving him of the opportunity to receive hazardous duty pay for witnessing or performing in-flight testing, was treatment in connection with a condition of employment. The <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case's second prong is therefore substantiated by the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, we conclude that the GC has established a <span class="Italic">prima <span id="Page_1400"></span>facie</span> case of discrimination under <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>. As the discrimination is based on protected activity itself, a necessary part of the Respondent's defense is to establish that the steward's action (here, the email) exceeded the bounds of protection. <span class="Italic">See DoD,</span> 59 FLRA at 226. However, the Respondent makes no such claim and does not respond to the GC's exceptions on this point in its opposition. Therefore, consistent with <span class="Italic">Letterkenny,</span> we conclude that the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (2) of the Statute by disqualifying the steward from flying as a crew member on the Adam 500 flight test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B. The Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) when the supervisor informed the steward that he was disqualified from flying as a crew member based on protected activity</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7102 of the Statute, an employee has the right to form, join, or assist any labor organization freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal. An agency's interference with this right violates &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1). <span class="Italic">Nuclear Regulatory Comm'n,</span> 28 FLRA 820, 831 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The standard for determining whether management's statement or conduct independently violates &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) is an objective one. The question is whether, under the circumstances, the statement or conduct tends to coerce or intimidate the employee, or whether the employee could reasonably have drawn a coercive inference from the statement. <span class="Italic">Frenchburg,</span> 49 FLRA at 1034. Although the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement are considered, the standard is not based on the subjective perceptions of the employee or on the intent of the employer. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The standard is satisfied where, <span class="Italic">inter alia,</span> a statement explicitly links an employee's protected activity with treatment adverse to the employee's interests. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Frenchburg,</span> 49 FLRA at 1034-35 (statement linking employee's use of official time with negative perceptions of employee's performance violates &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1)); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Serv., Region IV, Miami, Fla.,</span> 19 FLRA 956, 968-69 (1985) (statements linking employee's position as a union official with the denial to the employee of new, challenging, and interesting job assignments, and with limitations on the employee's career opportunities violates &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record establishes that the supervisor made a statement to the steward that violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1). As noted by the Judge, the steward testified that the supervisor stated to the steward that he (the steward) was grounded because his email had "pissed off" a number of other managers. The supervisor also allegedly said that he would have continued to accept the steward's doctor's note if the steward had not sent the email to other Union representatives.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent failed to offer evidence to rebut this testimony.&#x2003;Rather, as also noted by the Judge, the supervisor testified "that, although he did not deny having had a conversation with [the steward], he had no specific recollection of the conversation and did not remember saying that [the steward] had made people [angry] or words to that effect." Thus, the supervisor did not dispute the testimony by the steward as to what the supervisor said to the steward. Based on the evidence in the record, we conclude that the supervisor made a statement to the steward that explicitly linked the steward's protected activity to the decision to disqualify the steward from participating in the Adam 500 flight test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further conclude that the supervisor's statement violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1). The logical conclusion to be drawn from the supervisor's statement was that assignment to flight status was being denied the steward solely because the steward had sent an email to other Union representatives. The supervisor's statement conveyed the clear implication that participation in this type of union activity would affect an employee's opportunity to earn hazardous duty pay. Such a statement, linking the steward's protected activity with treatment adverse to his interests, reasonably may be construed as having interfered with, restrained, and coerced the steward in the exercise of &#x00A7; 7102 rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the contrary view of the Judge on this point.&#x2003;The Judge reasoned that the supervisor's statement could not reasonably be construed as coercive or threatening because the steward knew or should have known that the supervisor's statement of disqualification was no more than the correction of an error. However, as set forth above in section V.A., a preponderance of the record evidence does not support this determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we conclude that the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) of the Statute when the supervisor informed the steward that he was disqualified from flying as a crew member on the Adam 500 flight test based on the steward's protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">Coercion and restraint were attributed to a supervisor who told unit employees that the reason they lost a privilege--permission to sit on stools during certain periods that they were engaged in customs inspection duties--resulted from an unsuccessful grievance by an employee in another area of the country who sought the same privilege. <span class="Italic">Customs Serv., Region I and NTEU</span>, 15 FLRA 309, 310 (1984). Management violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) by telling employees that some employee awards might be in jeopardy because of offensive articles in a union publication. <span class="Italic">San Antonio Air Logistics Ctr., Kelly AFB and AFGE Local 1617</span>, 13 FLRA 661, 673-74 (1984) (ALJ Decision); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 46 FLRA 1126 (1993) (sustaining award of arbitrator who directed that union official receive award after employer declined to provide award because of amount of time spent devoted to union activities). An agency violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(4) when, after a union official filed a ULP charge in response to management's procrastination in granting annual leave, management refused to give the employee a final decision on the leave request because the employee had "elected" a forum for his dispute concerning the leave request by filing the ULP. <span class="Italic">FEMA and AFGE Local 4060</span>, 52 FLRA 486, 493 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent">Termination of the administrative duties assignment of an air traffic control specialist because the employee filed a grievance constituted a ULP. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and Canales</span>, 39 FLRA 1542, 1552 (1991). Failure to give credit for purposes of calculating "gainsharing" dividends to union officials on official time was a ULP in <span class="Italic">SSA Inland Empire Area and AFGE</span>, 46 FLRA 161, 174 (1992). A ULP occurred when a supervisor told employees that their protected activity was to blame for shift changes. <span class="Italic">Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing, Western Currency Facility and Midder</span>, 51 FLRA 1014, 1015 n.2 (1996) (also finding violation when supervisor "told employees that an officer had been discharged because he had engaged in protected activity"). But a uniform policy, evenhandedly administered, of requiring employees to make up assignments they miss, whether because of union activities or for other reasons, does not constitute discrimination on the basis of union activities when that policy was applied to a union steward. <span class="Italic">EEOC, Phoenix and AFGE Local 3230</span>, 50 FLRA 261, 263-64 (1995). An arbitrator concluded that the agency conveyed no threat by communicating to a union official a potential standard of conduct violation arising out of a compensation arrangement. The union was free to obtain independent counsel. <span class="Italic">See EPA and AFGE Local 3911,</span> 63 FLRA 476, 478 (2009).</p>
