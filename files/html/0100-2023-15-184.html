<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-183"><span class="space">d.</span> Conditional Threat</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">"If you go down in the woods today, you'd better not go alone." [<span class="Italic">Teddy Bears' Picnic</span>]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A conditional threat may warrant discharge, as in <span class="Italic">Robinson v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR <span id="Page_2687"></span>678, 679 (1986). The appellant, a distribution clerk, was fired because he told his supervisor that if he called the security guards, the "appellant would take his head off." The appellant calmed down and returned to work after the exchange, but the supervisor was apprehensive and fearful, called a foreman and security guards to the scene, and had the appellant escorted from the workroom. In his assessment of the conditional statement, the AJ should consider subjective or objective evidence that others perceived the statement as a threat. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Freitas v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 01-3054) ("An implied threat can be a basis for disciplinary action."); <span class="Italic">Greenough v. Dept. of Army</span>, 73 MSPR 648, 655 (1997) ("The appellant's statements were conditional, indicating that the appellant would not act because of concern for his family. However, their wording is unsettling <span class="Italic">per se</span>, thus supporting a finding that they constituted a threat."); <span class="Italic">Hutson v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 67 MSPR 432, 442 (1995) (hearsay evidence is admissible to prove a threat).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rose v. USPS</span>, 109 MSPR 31, 32-39 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 8-29, 2007 MSPB 294 (2007), analyzed a threat--both its conditional nature and its impact on the objects of the threat--as discharge was sustained with the observation that a conditional threat may support removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective January 31, 2007, the agency removed the appellant from his position as a preference-eligible PS-4 Regular Mail Handler with the agency's Cardiss Collins Postal Facility (Cardiss Collins) in Chicago, Illinois, based on a charge of Unacceptable Conduct/Violent and Threatening Behavior Towards Co-Workers. The agency based its charge on a November 5, 2006 incident in which the appellant went to Cardiss Collins's attendance control office and allegedly shouted at Mail Processor Clerks Janice Dean and Roslyn Oliver, "Give me my [time] card before I blow your brains out." After Ms. Dean and Ms. Oliver informed him that his card was not in the office, the appellant left the office, then returned about ten minutes later and allegedly acted as though he was "holding a machine gun/firearm and making machine gun sounds while pointing at Ms. Dean and Ms. Oliver." He then allegedly laughed and walked away.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have reopened this case because we find that the AJ erred in not analyzing the charge under <span class="Italic">Metz v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 780 F.2d 1001, 1002-03 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The AJ correctly noted that, in deciding whether statements constitute threats, the Board applies the reasonable person standard, considering the listeners' reactions, the listeners' apprehension of harm, the speaker's intent, any conditional nature of the statements, and any attendant circumstances. <span class="Italic">Metz,</span> 780 F.2d at 1002-03. However, the AJ then incorrectly identified the charge as "making statements that caused anxiety and disruption in the workplace" and stated that, "because intent is not an element of the charge, the appellant's intent is irrelevant to determine whether he engaged in the charged misconduct...." Accordingly, the AJ did not analyze the charge under <span class="Italic">Metz.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the charge in this case is Unacceptable Conduct/Violent and Threatening Behavior Towards Co-Workers. When an agency's charge is labeled as a threat, the Board will require the agency to meet the requirements set forth in <span class="Italic">Metz. Roseberry v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 51 M.S.P.R. 172, 175-76 (1991) (the Board did not sustain the agency's charge of "insolent, insubordinate and threatening behavior" as it failed to satisfy the <span class="Italic">Metz</span> standard); <span class="Italic">cf. Otero v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 198, 203-04 (1997) (because the agency charged the appellant with "improper conduct," it was not required to prove a threat under <span class="Italic">Metz</span> even though the narrative description of the misconduct accompanying the charge described the appellant's behavior as threatening). The AJ therefore erred by not applying <span class="Italic">Metz</span> in her analysis of the agency's charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding this error, we find it unnecessary to remand this case for further proceedings. Instead, we rely on the AJ's adequate fact findings and analyze the evidence at this level under the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Metz,</span> considering the individual <span class="Italic">Metz</span> factors. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Larry v. Department of Justice,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. 348, 357 (1997); <span class="Italic">Greenough,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. at 652, 654.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to Ms. Dean and Ms. Oliver, the following witnesses provided testimony regarding the first two <span class="Italic">Metz</span> factors, the listeners' reaction and apprehension of harm: Calmal Buford, the supervisor to whom Ms. Dean and Ms. Oliver first reported the November 5, 2006 incident; Demeitrus Williams, Manager of Distribution Operations and the supervisor to whom Ms. Buford reported the incident; Barbara Reynolds-Morgan, Acting Senior Manager of Distribution Operations and the supervisor to whom Mr. Williams reported the incident; and deciding official Larry Muse, Senior Manager of Distribution Operations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Dean testified that she felt "kind of scared" and "shocked" by the appellant's actions on November 5, 2006, and did not report the incident until the next day because she was in shock and did not consider it a threat until the following day. She also testified that after the incident she was "scared" and concerned about returning to work and remains afraid because she does not know what the appellant is going to do. In addition, she testified that she does not want to see the appellant return to Cardiss Collins.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ stated in the ID that Ms. Oliver was visibly upset on the witness stand and cried during her testimony. Ms. Oliver testified that she was "shocked" after the incident and later realized that both she and Ms. Dean had their lives threatened but did not report the incident on November 5, 2006, because it occurred on a Sunday and there were no managers present to report the incident to. In addition, she testified that she is afraid of the appellant and worries that he might come back and "do something" to her, reasoning that, if he threatened her for not having a card, there is no telling what he will do to her if he loses his job. Ms. Oliver testified that "if he loses his job it might be a disaster...I don't want to die."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Buford testified that on November 6, 2006, she noticed Ms. Dean and Ms. Oliver staring into space and asked them what was wrong because they are usually happy-go-lucky and friendly. She testified that they replied, "We've been threatened...he's going to kill us," and then described the incident of the previous day. Ms. Buford also testified that, when Ms. Dean and Ms. Oliver were recounting the incident, their demeanor "was scary" and "in some part of the conversation I think they maybe shook. She further testified that Ms. Oliver told her that she had been unable to sleep the night of the incident.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Williams testified that he learned of the incident from Ms. Buford, who told him that Ms. Dean and Ms. Oliver had been threatened and were very afraid. He also testified that, after meeting with the appellant, he checked on Ms. Dean and Ms. Oliver to see if they were alright because they were afraid. In addition, Mr. Williams testified that, when he reported the incident to Ms. Reynolds-Morgan, he told her that Ms. Dean and Ms. Oliver waited a workday to report the incident because they were afraid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Reynolds-Morgan testified that on November 6, 2006, Ms. Dean and Ms. Oliver told her that they were afraid that the appellant would "do something" because he had come to the window of the attendance control office and said that he was going to "do them bodily harm. She said that, because Ms. Dean and Ms. Oliver were "very, very afraid" of the appellant, after the meeting on November 6, 2006, she informed them that the appellant had been placed on "emergency placement," his access card had been deactivated, and he would not be able to get in the building.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Muse testified that, when he interviewed Ms. Dean and Ms. Oliver regarding the incident on November 5, 2006, he asked them if they felt threatened or scared, and they "emphatically said, yes...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the ID, the AJ noted that Ms. Dean and Ms. Oliver attempted to retract their complaints against the appellant about three weeks before the hearing and informed the agency that they would not testify at the hearing absent a subpoena from the AJ. The AJ found that, "based on their testimony during the hearing, it is clear Ms. Dean and Ms. Oliver requested not to participate in this appeal because they remain afraid of the appellant."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ also found that Ms. Buford, Mr. Williams, and Ms. Reynolds-Morgan provided straightforward, consistent, unbiased, and corroborative testimony. She concluded that "[c]learly, the women were afraid and believed the appellant intended to cause them physical harm."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant alleges that Ms. Dean's and Ms. Oliver's failure to report their November 5, 2006 encounter with him until the following day is inconsistent with their claim that they were afraid following the incident.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the ID, the AJ addressed why Ms. Dean and Ms. Oliver did not report the November 5, 2006 incident until the next day, stating as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Although Ms. Dean and Ms. Oliver did not report the incident until the following workday, the record demonstrates they had to leave the Absence Control office shortly after the incident occurred, to process mail for the remainder of their shift. Moreover, this incident occurred on a Sunday, and there were no managers to report it to.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges on review that Ms. Oliver's testimony that there were no managers present on the date of the incident "is an outright lie. This argument is mere disagreement with the AJ's explained fact findings and credibility determinations and, as such, does not warrant disturbing the ID. <span class="Italic">See Weaver,</span> 2 M.S.P.R. at 133-34.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, even if there were managers present at Cardiss Collins on November 5, 2006, Ms. Dean's and Ms. Oliver's failure to report the incident until the next day does not disprove their expressed concern for their safety. Both Ms. Dean and Ms. Oliver testified that they were shocked by the appellant's actions and Mr. Williams testified that he informed Ms. Reynolds-Morgan that they did not report the threat immediately because they were afraid. In light of the testimony concerning Ms. Dean's and Ms. Oliver's reactions to the November 5, 2006 incident, we agree that their failure to report the incident immediately is more likely attributable to their fear and shock in response to the events of November 5, 2006, than to a belief that the appellant's conduct was not threatening. In any event, Ms. Dean's and Ms. Oliver's failure to report the incident immediately does not outweigh all of the other evidence, described above, that indicates that they perceived the appellant's behavior as threatening.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2688"></span>The third <span class="Italic">Metz</span> factor, the speaker's intent, also supports the conclusion that the appellant's statement and gesture were threats. Whether an employee intends to carry out a threat is irrelevant to whether an employee intends to make a threat. <span class="Italic">See Greenough,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. at 652. The statement at issue was an expression of the appellant's intention to kill Ms. Dean and Ms. Oliver and there is no evidence that the appellant intended his conduct to be humorous or that he was just "blowing off steam." We also note that the deciding official, Mr. Muse, determined that the appellant made the threat intentionally and maliciously. Considering these circumstances, it is apparent that the appellant intended to express violent thoughts towards Ms. Dean and Ms. Oliver.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fourth <span class="Italic">Metz</span> factor is the conditional nature of the statement. The use of conditional language weighs against a finding of threat under <span class="Italic">Metz,</span> 780 F.2d at 1003 ("an employee who [makes] a generalized conditional statement is less likely to have intended to threaten a co-worker than an employee who stated a simple threat"). The statement at issue here was clearly conditional because the appellant threatened to "blow [Ms. Dean's and Ms. Oliver's] brains out" if they did not give him his time card. However, when the appellant returned to the window and pointed at Ms. Dean and Ms. Oliver as though he had a machine gun, the appellant essentially communicated to Ms. Dean and Ms. Oliver that he considered them to have fulfilled the condition that he had placed on his earlier statements. Thus, while the conditional nature of the appellant's prior statement might have weighed against finding that the appellant made a threat, his subsequent gesture of pointing at Ms. Dean and Ms. Oliver as though he had a machine gun, thereby essentially accusing them of fulfilling the condition, supports a finding that the appellant threatened Ms. Dean and Ms. Oliver.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the conditional nature of a statement does not necessarily preclude its being an actionable threat. <span class="Italic">Hutson v. Department of the Interior,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. 432, 438 (1995). For example, threats of bodily harm with a firearm, even if conditional, are unsettling <span class="Italic">per se</span>, and thus support a finding that they constitute a threat. <span class="Italic">See Greenough,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. at 651, 655.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the fifth and final <span class="Italic">Metz</span> factor, the attendant circumstances, in determining whether the appellant made a threat, the Board must consider the context in which the appellant made the allegedly threatening statements. <span class="Italic">Powell v. Department of Justice,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 29, 33 (1997). As previously noted, the context for the appellant's comments was his inability to find his time card. The appellant's problems finding his time card were not attendant circumstances warranting a finding that his statement and gesture were not threats. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Sands v. Department of Labor,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 281, &#x00B6; 11 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the evidence shows that Ms. Buford, Mr. Williams, and Ms. Reynolds-Morgan acted with concern for the employees' safety. Ms. Buford showed her concern for Ms. Dean and Ms. Oliver by reporting the incident to Mr. Williams, who, along with Ms. Reynolds-Morgan, took steps to ensure the safety of other employees by placing the appellant on emergency off-duty status effective November 6, 2006.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of these circumstances, we find that the agency has shown by preponderant evidence that the appellant's statement and gesture as set forth in the proposed notice of removal constituted threats under <span class="Italic">Metz.</span> Accordingly, we sustain the charge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Marcell v. VA</span>, 2022 MSPB 33, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 14 (2022) (sustaining termination for conditional threat of "If I have to go into work tomorrow, I will probably kill someone": "Ultimately, a threat to take someone's life is a serious offense. <span class="Italic">Facas v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 426, 431 (1987). The Board has held that a removal based on a threat often will be within the bounds of reasonableness even if there are mitigating factors. <span class="Italic">Rose</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 31, &#x00B6; 31; <span class="Italic">Facas</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. at 430-31.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Yet a threat was not made by an individual who told a coworker that he would "kick his ass" if he lost any time off the clock as a result of an altercation with the employee. The employee testified he did not feel frightened or threatened. Additionally, the statement was conditional. <span class="Italic">Hayslett v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 267, 269-71 (1988) (still sustaining dismissal for altercation with another employee and completing untrue workers' compensation form); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Vernon v. USPS</span>, 87 MSPR 392, 401 &#x00B6; 24 (2000) (mitigating penalty for improper statement: "We must also consider the absurd nature of the statement--involving the throwing of grocery cans--and that the appellant's statement involved some sort of future action conditioned on his meeting the supervisor at a particular location."). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Poust v. DOD</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3074) (threat charge sustained for statements of an employee that "he hoped he would not become a postal worker" and that "he felt like he wanted to get his gun and just start shooting," and similar comments); <span class="Italic">Murphy v. DHHS</span>, 34 MSPR 534, 538 (1987) (threat was not conditional when expressed in terms that the appellant "would or could burn [a] house").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit eschewed parsing words too closely in <span class="Italic">Hughes v. SSA</span>, 106 Fed. Appx. 715, 716 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP), declining to consider a threat to be conditional:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both Ms. Green and Mr. Garrison testified that they perceived Mr. Hughes' comments as a threat and that they reacted accordingly. The AJ found that Mr. Hughes' statements conveyed that he could bring an AK-47 to the workplace if he wanted to and that he had the means to do so. The AJ also found that Mr. Hughes intended to convey how upset he was and what the consequences of the harassment could be. The AJ found that Ms. Green had reason to believe the threat was real since Mr. Hughes had presented himself not as a rational person, but as someone suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder who could "lose it." The AJ found that Mr. Hughes' use of the word "could" instead of "would" did not render the threat "conditional."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Singh v. DOD,</span> SF-0752-15-0774-I-1 (NP 4/15/2016), did not consider a threat conditional:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from the GS-6 position of Transportation Assistant based on the charge of making comments of a threatening nature. The agency based its action on an email that the appellant sent to the facility manager while he was on leave and awaiting a decision on his request for a transfer to a different supervisor. In the email, the appellant stated "if i [sic] experience any form of stress, intimidation, hostile, or abusive behavior towards me by [my supervisor], i [sic] may perceive it as a THREAT and i [sic] may be obligated to DEFEND myself with FORCE. I'm just giving you both a fair warning, this is not what i [sic] want." In proposing the removal penalty, the agency relied on the appellant's prior disciplinary record, a reprimand for absence without leave (AWOL). <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether a charge of making threats or engaging in threatening behavior can be sustained, the Board will apply the reasonable person standard, considering the speaker's intent, the conditional nature of his statements, the listeners' reactions, their apprehension of harm, and the attendant circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Metz v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 780 F.2d 1001, 1004 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Here, we agree with the administrative judge that the most significant criteria are the listeners' reactions and apprehension of harm and the attendant circumstances. The employee who received the appellant's email testified that its wording caused her great concern. She testified further that she did not consider the appellant's statements to be conditional, but saw them as him verbalizing a threat against his supervisor if he came back to work for her, and others who read the email perceived it in the same way. Another employee who received the email immediately contacted the agency's legal office about it, and the agency issued an order to bar the appellant from entering the agency's premises. When the appellant's supervisor read the email she testified that she was not feeling well, remembered that the appellant had earlier stated to others that he disliked the supervisor, and that he was not going to listen to her. She testified, moreover, that, after she read the email, she took a different route home and went to the police to obtain a restraining order. The administrative judge found the appellant's supervisor testified credibly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we find that the appellant's assertion that the penalty was unreasonable is unavailing. When the Board sustains an agency's charges, it will defer to the agency's penalty determination unless the penalty exceeds the range of allowable punishment specified by statute or regulation, or unless the penalty is "so harsh and unconscionably disproportionate to the offense that it amounts to an abuse of discretion." <span class="Italic">Saiz v. Department of the Navy</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 521, &#x00B6; 5 (2015). That is because the employing agency, and not the Board, has primary discretion in maintaining employee discipline and efficiency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Balouris v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 574, &#x00B6; 6 (2008), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, No. 2008-3147, 2009 WL 405827 (Fed. Cir. 2009). The Board will not displace management's responsibility, but instead will ensure that managerial judgment has been properly exercised. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Mitigation of an agency&#8209;imposed penalty is appropriate only where the agency failed to weigh the relevant factors or where the agency's judgment clearly exceeded the limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The deciding official need not show that he considered all the mitigating factors, and the Board will independently weigh the relevant factors only if the deciding official failed to demonstrate that he considered any specific, relevant mitigating factors before deciding on a penalty. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the removal decision, the deciding official stated that he considered the relevant factors of <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 306 (1981), to be the nature and seriousness of the offense, the appellant's past discipline, his past work record and length of service, the consistency of the penalty and consistency with the table of offenses, and the use of alternative sanctions. He indicated that he considered the appellant's threatening email very serious and considered that the appellant was recently reprimanded for AWOL. The deciding official also considered the mitigating factors of the appellant's 16 years of Federal service and his fully successful performance rating. He further considered that removal was within the range of penalties in the agency's table of penalties and that he believed that alternative sanctions would not serve to correct the appellant's misconduct. The deciding official stated that <span id="Page_2689"></span>he did not consider any of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors not listed in the decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the deciding official did not specifically consider the appellant's rehabilitative potential, the mitigating circumstances that he was under the influence of psychiatric drugs, and that he had remorse for his actions. However, the deciding official testified that he did not agree with the appellant's representation that his medication caused him to write the email containing the threatening comments. Further, in finding that the agency proved its charge, the administrative judge found that there was no medical evidence provided that the appellant's threatening comments in his email were the result of any medical condition or medication, thus making unpersuasive the appellant's assertion that the influence of psychiatric drugs is a mitigating circumstance. As to the appellant's unsupported assertion that he has rehabilitative potential and remorse for his actions, these factors are outweighed by the seriousness of his misconduct. We thus conclude that the administrative judge properly found that the removal penalty was within the bounds of reasonableness for the sustained misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 306</p>
