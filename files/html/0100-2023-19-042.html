<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Patel v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, DC-0432-17-0032-I-1 (NP 2/1/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Age Discrimination in Employment Act states that "personnel actions...shall be made free from any discrimination based on age." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a). Similarly, Title VII requires that such actions "shall be made free from any discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a). Thus, an appellant may prove a claim of discrimination by showing that such discrimination "play[ed] any part" in the way a decision was made. <span class="Italic">Babb v. Wilkie</span>, 140 S. Ct. 1168, 1173-74 (2020); <span class="Italic">Pridgen v. Office of Management &#x0026; Budget</span>, 2022 MSPB 31, &#x00B6; 21. A finding that prohibited discrimination played "any part" in the contested action is the same as a finding of "motivating factor." <span class="Italic">Pridgen</span>, 2022 MSPB 31, &#x00B6; 21. Although an appellant who proves motivating factor and nothing more may be entitled to injunctive or other forward-looking relief, to obtain the full measure of relief available under the statute, including <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief, compensatory damages, or other forms of relief related to the end result of an employment decision, the appellant must show that discrimination was a but-for cause of the employment outcome. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 22. One may prove discrimination under these different standards of proof by various methods, including comparator evidence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23-24.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Most Board analysis of discrimination allegations involves analysis of presumptions and of articulation by agencies of the nondiscriminatory rationale for their decisions. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DLA</span>, 61 MSPR 601, 603-10 (1994), considered direct evidence of discrimination and concluded racial discrimination infected a discharge:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a claim of prohibited employment discrimination through circumstantial evidence, the employee first must establish by a preponderance of the evidence a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case; the burden of going forward then shifts to the agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action; and, finally, the employee must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the agency's stated reason is merely a pretext for prohibited discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, __ U.S. __, __, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 2752, 125 L. Ed.2d 407 (1993); <span class="Italic">Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 252-53, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 1093-94, 67 L. Ed.2d 207 (1981); <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 1824-25, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973); <span class="Italic">Fenn v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 MSPR 362, 366-67 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, when an employee alleges a case of prohibited discrimination by direct, rather than circumstantial evidence, application of the <span class="Italic">Hicks/Burdine/McDonnell Douglas</span> test is inappropriate. <span class="Italic">See EEOC v. Alton Packaging Corp.</span>, 901 F.2d 920, 923 (11th Cir. 1990). A case in which the agency responds to the employee's direct evidence with a legitimate reason(s) for its adverse action is referred to as a "mixed motive" case. In such a case, where the employment "decision was the product of a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate motives,...it simply makes no sense to ask whether the legitimate reason was <span class="Italic">'the "true reason"'...</span>for the decision--which is the question asked by <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>." <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> <span class="Italic">v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228, 247, 109 S. Ct. 1775, 1789, 104 L. Ed.2d 268 (1989) (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, in a "mixed motive" case, under the <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> framework, the appellant must prove by direct evidence that membership in a protected category was a "substantial factor" in the employment decision in question. <span class="Italic">See Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 259, 109 S. Ct. at 1795 (White, J., concurring) (the employee must "show that the unlawful motive was a <span class="Italic">substantial</span> factor in the adverse employment action") (emphasis in original); <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 279, 109 S. Ct. at 1805 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (an employee must show that "an illegitimate consideration played a substantial role in an adverse employment decision"); <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 281, 109 S. Ct. at 1806 (Kennedy, J., Rehnquist, C.J., and Scalia, J., dissenting) ("Title VII liability requires a finding of but-for causation"). Once the employee makes such a showing, the burdens of production and persuasion shift to the agency to show that it had a legitimate motive sufficient to account for its action. <span class="Italic">See Price</span> <span class="Italic">Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 244-45, 252-53, 109 S.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In her initial decision, the administrative judge found that the appellant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of racial discrimination. Our prior remand decision did not disturb that finding. <span class="Italic">See Johnson</span>, 54 MSPR at 373-74. In our prior remand decision, we specifically instructed the administrative judge to determine whether the agency's articulated reason for the removal action was a pretext for discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 373. Although the administrative judge followed our instructions in her remand initial decision by examining the issue of pretext under the <span class="Italic">Burdine/McDonnell Douglas</span> test, the agency correctly argues in its petition for review that this analysis employs an incorrect and inapplicable legal standard. Therefore, we find that the <span class="Italic">Price</span> <span class="Italic">Waterhouse</span> test is applicable in this appeal and that the administrative judge's evaluation of the evidence under the <span class="Italic">Burdine/McDonnell</span> <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> standard is erroneous. We must therefore re-evaluate the evidence under the proper legal standard and determine whether: (1) the appellant proved that membership in a protected category was a substantial factor in the agency's decision to remove him, <span class="Italic">see supra</span> at 604-605, and, if so, whether (2) the agency showed that it had a legitimate motive for the action that, "standing alone, would have induced it to make the same decision." <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 252, 109 S. Ct. at 1791; <span class="Italic">see also id.</span> at 260, 109 S. Ct. at 1795 (White, J., concurring); <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 261, 109 S. Ct. at 1796 (O'Connor, J., concurring).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that the appellant, by virtue of his race, is a member of a protected category. As to whether he showed that his membership in a protected class was a substantial factor in the agency's decision to remove him, the appellant produced unrebutted testimony that his immediate supervisor and the proposing official in this appeal, Scott Sheipe, fostered a hostile and discriminatory working environment. The administrative judge found that the appellant testified credibly that he had overheard Sheipe tell other employees several times that he was "going to get [the appellant's] black ass." The administrative judge further found that Linda Rathfon, the appellant's co-worker, testified credibly that Sheipe had told her on more than one occasion that he was "going to see [the appellant's] black ass burn" or that he was "going to burn [the appellant's] black ass."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to racial slurs attributable directly to Sheipe, the administrative judge found that the appellant, Rathfon, and another co-worker, Ralph Jacobs, all testified credibly that a work leader under Sheipe's supervision, Bob Fenton, made frequent racially derogatory comments, both about the appellant and in general. Jacobs and the appellant testified that racial jokes were permitted to be part of the culture of the workplace. The appellant testified that his co-workers frequently called him "little black boy," and that once co-workers joked that they should entertain themselves by taking the appellant to Perry County and hanging him from a cherry tree. The appellant and his witnesses testified that racial cartoons were often circulated anonymously through the workplace. Rathfon testified that one of these cartoons stated that recruiters for athletic teams would find the best athletes if they went to slums looking for blacks because blacks were the best hubcap stealers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to evidence of repeated racial slurs and epithets, the appellant produced evidence that Sheipe treated him more harshly than white employees. Rathfon testified that, after the appellant returned from lunch 2 minutes late on one occasion, Sheipe announced to her that he intended to monitor the appellant's every move to ensure that he worked to the rule. She noted that Sheipe did not monitor white employees as carefully and permitted them to stretch their lunch breaks by leaving early or returning late. The appellant testified that Sheipe disciplined him for leaving the worksite between the end of his regular shift and the start of his overtime shift to buy cigarettes, but that he received a 5-day suspension for this offense and the co-worker who accompanied him to buy cigarettes received only a 1-day suspension. The administrative judge found that the appellant testified credibly that Sheipe allowed white employees to leave the worksite between shifts to eat and drink beer, but that they were never disciplined.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that Jacobs testified credibly that Sheipe treated the appellant like a "second-class citizen," and like a "problem employee" rather than like a regular worker. Jacobs also stated that he was frequently a witness to Sheipe verbally harassing the appellant in a manner he did not use with other employees, but that it was such a common occurrence that he could not remember the content of the harassment specifically. The appellant testified that, if he had to go to the bathroom, Sheipe would follow him into the restroom and time him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rathfon further testified that the appellant frequently complained to her that Sheipe would not grant him sick leave even when he submitted medical documentation. The appellant testified that, on one occasion, Sheipe refused to accept medical documentation submitted in support of a request for sick leave because the physician had signed the letter using a signature stamp rather than signing it by hand in ink.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also testified that for a while he was on medication that made him drowsy and that he would nap during his break time. The administrative judge found that Rathfon testified credibly that Sheipe encouraged other employees to allow the appellant to sleep through his break time so that he could catch the appellant sleeping once the break was over and discipline him for sleeping on duty. The appellant testified that Sheipe told him once that he had ordered other employees to let the appellant sleep through his break so that Sheipe could catch him sleeping and "burn [his] black ass."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sheipe testified that he has disciplined white employees for AWOL, but that, to the best of his recollection, he had only proposed the removal of a white employee for AWOL in one instance, and that was just before the hearing in this appeal. The administrative judge found that Sheipe's recall of the events surrounding the alleged discipline of the white employees was vague compared with his recall of disciplining the appellant, and that Sheipe's testimony that he had disciplined white employees for similar offenses was therefore not credible under <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Department of the <span id="Page_3380"></span>Army</span>, 35 MSPR 453, 458 (1987). She further found, based on the credible testimony of the appellant and his witnesses, that Sheipe's denial that he made racially derogatory remarks and had a predisposition to remove the appellant was also not credible. The agency failed to produce any documentary evidence of discipline imposed on white employees, and specifically did not produce any evidence to corroborate Sheipe's testimony that he had proposed the removal of a white employee for AWOL. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that Sheipe's uncorroborated, unsupported testimony with regard to his discipline of white employees was not credible and that he had a racially motivated predisposition to remove the appellant....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the testimony submitted by the appellant was unrebutted below by the agency and establishes a pattern of racial discrimination against the appellant. Indeed, the agency produced no evidence whatsoever even disputing the appellant's showing, except for Sheipe's blanket denial of racial prejudice and any predisposition to remove the appellant because of his race. However, as noted above, the administrative judge found Sheipe's denial not credible and the agency does not challenge this finding on review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that Sheipe was not the deciding official in this appeal. However, as the appellant's first-line supervisor and the proposing official in this action, Sheipe's role in the agency's decision-making process cannot be ignored. <span class="Italic">See Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 257, 109 S. Ct. at 1794 (sexist remarks made by partners in an accounting firm who submitted comments recommending that a female candidate be denied partnership were properly deemed evidence of a sexually discriminatory motive in denying the candidate partnership; the firm's argument that the comments were irrelevant because the partners who made them were not the sole decision-makers "ignores the critical role" their comments played in the decision-making process); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Wynne v. Department of the Army</span>, 46 MSPR 320, 324-25 (1990) (discriminatory remarks allegedly made by the proposing official were relevant to consideration of the appellant's allegation of racial discrimination), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 940 F.2d 677 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table). Nonetheless, our analysis is incomplete without an examination of the proceedings before the deciding official.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, the agency makes much of the fact that the deciding official, Dorothea Brown, is of the same race as the appellant. The agency's argument appears to be that a black person, by virtue of her race alone, can never discriminate against another black person on the basis of race. While this type of discrimination may be rather uncommon, we are not persuaded that a person's race precludes the possibility of racial discrimination against a person of the same race. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fuentes v. United States Postal Service</span>, 54 MSPR 4, 11 (1992). Thus, we find that Brown's race is of little probative value in deciding whether the agency discriminated against the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Brown testified that the appellant informed her that Sheipe did not like him for racial reasons, he considered the proposed removal action to be discriminatory, and he requested reassignment to another supervisor. She further testified that she "didn't hear anything" to confirm the appellant's contention that Sheipe was out to get him. However, she acknowledged that, with regard to a prior 30-day suspension the appellant received for sleeping on duty, she had heard allegations that Sheipe had instructed employees not to wake him up at the end of his break so that Sheipe could catch him asleep. She admitted with regard to this incident that "it could have been considered that [the appellant] was being set up."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Brown further testified that, during her deliberations concerning the proposed removal action, she received a note, later discovered to be from Rathfon, about Sheipe's racially derogatory remarks, including his statement that he intended to "burn [the appellant's] black ass," and Sheipe's practice of holding the appellant to a much stricter standard of conduct than white employees. She testified that she questioned Sheipe about the allegations in the note, and that he admitted making comments to that effect, but that she credited his explanation that the remarks were taken out of context. Aside from discussing the note with Sheipe, Brown stated that she did not investigate the allegations in the note. Brown testified that this type of talk was common "warehouse language" and she disregarded the allegations in Rathfon's note.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The most telling testimony, however, is that Sheipe admitted to Brown that he made racially derogatory comments, but stated that they were taken out of context. The appellant has established, however, that the agency maintained a racially hostile atmosphere in his work place, which supports a finding that Sheipe's remarks are not being taken out of context. Moreover, we cannot conceive of a context in which such remarks would be appropriate. Furthermore, we do not accept Brown's contention that these comments constituted mere "warehouse language" and were not directed towards the appellant in a racially derogatory manner. In sum, we concur with the administrative judge's determination that Brown was on notice that there was a potential problem with racial discrimination in Sheipe's warehouse, but she ignored the appellant's allegations, despite the corroboration in Rathfon's note, and despite her knowledge that Sheipe disciplined the appellant for sleeping on duty under questionable circumstances in the past. We find that Brown's knowledge of the racially derogatory remarks Sheipe made to and about the appellant, and of Sheipe's role in sustaining a racially hostile and discriminatory working environment, establishes a direct connection between Sheipe's racial discrimination against the appellant and the agency's decision to remove him. <span class="Italic">See Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Alton Packaging Corp.</span>, 901 F.2d at 924. Therefore, we find that the appellant has demonstrated that his race was a substantial factor in the agency's decision to remove him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the appellant was AWOL as charged and that AWOL is a legitimate basis for imposing discipline on him. <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 54 MSPR at 372-73. Most of his prior disciplinary record relied upon by the agency in taking the removal action meets the criteria for Board consideration under <span class="Italic">Bolling v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 8 MSPB 658, 9 MSPR 335, 339-40 (1981). However, we note that AWOL under similar circumstances does not necessarily warrant the penalty of removal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lewis</span> <span class="Italic">v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 51 MSPR 475, 484-86 (1991) (the Board mitigated the appellant's removal for AWOL and failure to request leave according to established procedures to a 30-day suspension where the appellant had three instances of prior discipline for other offenses); <span class="Italic">Vaughn v. Veterans Administration</span>, 50 MSPR 114, 118-19 (1991) (the Board found that the agency's 30-day suspension of the appellant was reasonable for a third offense of AWOL totalling 92 hours); <span class="Italic">Gottlieb v. Veterans Administration</span>, 39 MSPR 606, 610-11 (1989) (the Board mitigated the appellant's removal for a third offense of AWOL to a 30-day suspension).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that, under the circumstances of this appeal, this removal action was so tainted by racial discrimination that we are persuaded that the agency has not met its burden of proving by preponderant evidence that it would have taken the same action absent consideration of a discriminatory motive. <span class="Italic">See Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 252-53, 109 S. Ct. at 1791-92; <span class="Italic">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Alton Packaging Corp.</span>, 901 F.2d at 923.</p>
