<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-97"><span class="space">5.</span> Material Accompanying Exceptions; New Evidence</h4>
<p class="noindent">The regulatory requirements governing the content of exceptions and oppositions to exceptions are, 5 CFR 2425.4-.5 (2022):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Content and format of exceptions.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">What is required</span>. You must date your exception, unless you file it electronically through use of the eFiling system on the FLRA's Web site at <a href="http://www.flra.gov/">www.flra.gov</a>. Regardless of how you file your exception, you must <span id="page_1841"></span>ensure that it is self-contained and that it sets forth, in full, the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;A statement of the grounds on which review is requested, as discussed in &#x00A7; 2425.6 of this part;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Arguments in support of the stated grounds, including specific references to the record, citations of authorities, and any other relevant documentation;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;Legible copies of any documents (which you may upload as attachments if you file electronically through use of the FLRA's eFiling system) that you reference in the arguments discussed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and that the Authority cannot easily access (such as internal agency regulations or provisions of collective bargaining agreements);</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;Arguments in support of any request for an expedited, abbreviated decision within the meaning of &#x00A7; 2425.7 of this part;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(5)&#x2003;A legible copy of the award of the arbitrator; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(6)&#x2003;The arbitrator's name, mailing address, and, if available and authorized for use by the arbitrator, the arbitrator's e-mail address or facsimile number.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">What is not required. </span>Exceptions are not required to include copies of documents that are readily accessible to the Authority, such as Authority decisions, decisions of Federal courts, current provisions of the United States Code, and current provisions of the Code of Federal Regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">What is prohibited. </span>Consistent with 5 CFR 2429.5, an exception may not rely on any evidence, factual assertions, arguments (including affirmative defenses), requested remedies, or challenges to an awarded remedy that could have been, but were not, presented to the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Format</span>. You may file your exception on an optional form that is available on the FLRA's Web site at <a href="http://www.flra.gov/">www.flra.gov</a>, or in any other format that is consistent with paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section. You meet this requirement if you file your exception electronically through use of the FLRA's eFiling system on that Web site. Your failure to use, or properly fill out, an Authority-provided form will not, by itself, provide a basis for dismissing your exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2425.5 <span class="Italic">Content and format of opposition.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">If you choose to file an opposition, then you may file your opposition on an optional form that is available on the FLRA's Web site at <a href="http://www.flra.gov/">www.flra.gov</a>, or in any other format that is consistent with this section. You meet this requirement if you file your opposition electronically through use of the FLRA's eFiling system on that Web site. Your failure to use, or properly fill out, an Authority-provided form will not, by itself, provide a basis for dismissing your opposition. If you choose to file an opposition, and you dispute any assertions that have been made in the exceptions, then you should address those assertions--including any assertions that any evidence, factual assertions, arguments (including affirmative defenses), requested remedies, or challenges to an awarded remedy were raised before the arbitrator. If the excepting party has requested an expedited, abbreviated decision under &#x00A7; 2425.7 of this part, then you should state whether you support or oppose such a decision and provide supporting arguments. You must provide copies of any documents upon which you rely (which you may upload as attachments if you file your opposition electronically through use of the FLRA's eFiling system), unless the Authority can easily access those documents (as discussed in &#x00A7; 2425.4(b) of this part) or the excepting party provided them with its exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent">If evidence is not presented to the arbitrator, it is not likely to be considered by FLRA on exceptions, as in <span class="Italic">DOD, DDE&#x0026;S and FEA Stateside Region</span>, 67 FLRA 138, 139 (2013), involving submission to FLRA of an OPM manual:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the award is contrary to "Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations." Specifically, the Agency cites the "OPM Guide to Processing Personnel Actions" to argue that an employee's appointment cannot be effective prior to the date of the appointing officer's approval, as documented in the SF-50.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2425.4(c) and 2429.5 of the Authority's Regulations, the Authority will not consider any evidence or arguments that could have been, but were not, presented to the arbitrator. Before the Arbitrator, the Agency argued that the date of the SF-50 established that Section 3.b. applied to the grievant. But the Agency does not claim, and nothing in the record demonstrates, that the Agency cited the "OPM Guide to Processing Personnel Actions" or any other "OPM regulations" to the Arbitrator. Because the Agency could have, but did not, cite this authority to the Arbitrator, it may not do so now. Consequently, we dismiss this exception under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2425.4(c) and 2429.5 of the Authority's Regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VA Pershing MC and AFGE Local 2338</span>, 71 FLRA 511, 512 (2020) ("Moreover, the Arbitrator did not state in the award when the Union filed its grievance, and the Agency does not provide a copy of the grievance, a transcript of the arbitration hearing, or any other documentary evidence, to support the alleged filing date.").</p>
<p class="noindent">A brief arbitration award under a contract's expedited procedure offered little for meaningful FLRA review (still, FLRA set aside the award as a matter involving a classification issue), <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 3438</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-37.html">71 FLRA 205</a>, 207-08 (2019) (Member Abbot concurring; Member DuBester dissenting), Member Abbott commenting at n.1 of his concurrence:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's written award consisted of one sentence, rendered in an email message. The only record of the evidence and arguments presented below are the written, opening statements of each party. There is no transcript, no written fact findings or considered legal conclusions by the Arbitrator, and so, the record contains not much more than a summary of the issues and evidence actually raised and considered by the Arbitrator. While agencies and exclusive representatives are free to negotiate, and live under, what appears to be an expedited, abbreviated arbitration proceeding, this decision in turn leaves the Authority with little to rely on when faced with exceptions, and oppositions, that cite to various statutes, regulations, policies, caselaw, and legal arguments. How this grievance, wherein <span class="Italic">both</span> parties argued the significance of the grievant's employment status, the significance of duties assigned to the grievant, when they were assigned, and how they came to be assigned, seemed to be a good fit for an expedited procedure utterly escapes me.</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the 2010 revisions in the regulations, little was said about what may legitimately be supplied to FLRA with exceptions, that is, what latitude a party has in defining the record that will accompany (or oppose) exceptions. If a document, e.g., a settlement agreement, referenced in the award and necessary to an understanding of the exceptions, is not included with the exceptions, FLRA may determine that the exceptions are unsupported. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 12</span>, 55 FLRA 1019, 1022 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent">The failure to provide a required document to FLRA does not necessarily result in dismissal of the exception if FLRA can make sense of the case without the document, as in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 61 FLRA 54, 56 (2005), when the agency did not provide the arbitrator's award to FLRA:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2425.2 of the Authority's Regulations requires that an exception include a copy of the arbitrator's award. We reject the Union's claim that the Agency failed to provide a copy of the Arbitrator's award to the Authority. In this regard, the Agency did provide a copy of the Arbitrator's award to the Authority when it filed its exceptions, consistent with &#x00A7; 2425.2(d). To the extent that the Union's argument is based on a claim that the Agency failed to serve it with a copy of the award, the record demonstrates that the Union had access to, and made use of, the award in preparing its opposition. In this regard, the opposition contains several references to the Arbitrator's award. Under these circumstances, we deny the Union's request that the Authority dismiss the Agency's exceptions. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2006</span>, 52 FLRA 380, 384-85 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the exception relies on argument concerning sufficient of particular evidence, that evidence should be presented to FLRA. When an agency challenged an award of counsel fees because the timesheets supporting the fee request lacked particularity in their description of counsel's work, FLRA denied the exception when the agency did not supply copies of the timesheets. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Pope Air Force Base, and AFGE Local 1770</span> (<span class="Italic">Union</span>) 71 FLRA 338, 340 &#x0026; n.24 (2019) (Member DuBester concurring) ("The Agency disputes the Arbitrator's findings, but has neglected to provide the Authority a copy of the billing records which it alleges were inadequate. Because the Agency's exception is unsupported, we deny it"; "Parties are reminded that exceptions must be accompanied by any relevant documents that the Authority cannot easily access, such as exhibits presented during the arbitration proceeding.").</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA considers evidence of what occurred during the arbitration proceedings, but it will ordinarily reject evidence that could have been but was not presented to the arbitrator on the merits of the dispute, <span class="Italic">AID and AFGE Local 1534</span>, 53 FLRA 187, 187-88 n.2 (1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union requested that the Authority strike the documents submitted as Tabs Q and S in the Agency's exceptions because the documents were not part of the original hearing exhibits....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The document submitted as Tab S was in existence at the time of the arbitration hearing but was not presented to the Arbitrator.&#x2003;Therefore, consideration of the document is precluded by section 2429.5<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Fort Polk, Louisiana and National Association of Government Employees, Local R5-168</span>, 44 FLRA 1548, 1565-66 (1992). Although the document submitted as Tab Q did not exist at the time of the arbitration hearing, there is no reason asserted or apparent why the information contained in the document could not have been presented to the Arbitrator. This case is distinguishable from the situations in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 45 and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Tulsa, Oklahoma</span>, 52 FLRA 1458, 1460-61 (1997), and <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Sacramento Air Logistics Center, McClellan Air Force Base, California and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1857</span>, 50 FLRA 96, 99 (1995), where the Authority considered documents created after the date of the arbitration proceedings that sought to reflect what transpired at expedited arbitration proceedings. The Agency has not demonstrated that the document should be considered by the Authority. Therefore, we grant the Union's motion to strike the Agency's exhibits at Tabs Q and S.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union objects to two documents (Exhibits 2 and 3) attached to the Agency's opposition because the documents were not submitted at the arbitration hearing. It is undisputed that both documents were in existence at the time of the arbitration hearing but were not presented to the Arbitrator. Consideration of the documents is precluded by section 2429.5. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Agency for International Development and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1534</span>, 53 FLRA 187, 188 n.2 (1997); <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration</span>, 5 FLRA at 471. Accordingly, we have not considered these documents.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's supplemental submission encloses an Agency memorandum concerning the status of part-time employees. The Union requests that the Authority accept the memorandum "as new and material evidence which was only recently discovered and which is material to the instant exception" in that it "is in direct contradiction to the evidence and testimony offered by the [A]gency at the hearing." The Agency asserts that the Authority disregard the supplemental submission because it is "immaterial to the arbitration."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that the memorandum did not exist at the time of the hearing.&#x2003;Nevertheless, consistent with Authority precedent, such evidence may not be introduced to refute material on the record. <span class="Italic">See Veterans Administration</span>, 5 FLRA at 471.

For that reason, we reject the Union's request that we take official notice of the proposal letter under &#x00A7; 2429.5. To the contrary, we find that &#x00A7; 2429.5 bars considering the proposal letter."); <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU Chap. 164</span>, 67 FLRA 8, 10 (2012) ("There is no dispute here that the Agency could have, but did not, present either of the documents to the Arbitrator.

<p class="noindent-1">In agreeing with the Authority's denial of the Union's exception, Member DuBester notes the following. The Union argues that the Arbitrator was clearly erroneous in finding that the grievant's Bid 3 was incomplete. In support, the Union cites testimony at the hearing before the Arbitrator assertedly indicating that Bid 3 was considered by the parties to be acceptable and complete. However, the parties elected to use an expedited arbitration proceeding that apparently did not include preparation of a formal transcript. In any event, the Authority was not provided with a copy of a transcript. Therefore, the Authority is unable to substantiate the Union's claims concerning hearing testimony. Accordingly, the Authority will only consider the Union's claims as arguments in support of its exceptions. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Sacramento Air Logistics Ctr., McClellan AFB, Calif.,</span> 50 FLRA 96, 99 (1995). Moreover, as the Arbitrator noted, the Bid and Rotation Committee, consisting of three management members and three union members, deemed the grievant's bid preference requests, including Bid 3, "invalid."</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 2429.5 of the Regulations, the Authority generally will not consider evidence or arguments that could have been, but were not, presented to the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See supra </span>note 4 for text of &#x00A7; 2429.5; <span class="Italic">see Soc. Sec.

In addition, the Authority has held that awards are not subject to review on the basis of evidence that comes into existence after arbitration. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot, Corpus Christi, Tex.</span>, 56 FLRA 1057, 1068 n.12 (2001) (<span class="Italic">Corpus Christi</span>). However, &#x00A7; 2429.5 does not preclude consideration of arguments in support of exceptions where such arguments arise from the issuance of an award and could not have been presented at arbitration. <span class="Italic">See NAGE, Local R3-77</span>, 59 FLRA 937, 940 (2004) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting as to other matters) (<span class="Italic">Local R3-77</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Supervisor of Shipbuilding Conversion &#x0026; Repair, Pascagoula, Miss.</span>, 57 FLRA 744, 745 (2002)); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Agric., Animal &#x0026; Plant Health Inspection Serv., Plant Prot. &#x0026; Quarantine</span>, 57 FLRA 4, 5 (2001) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring) (<span class="Italic">USDA</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">Prof'l Airways Sys.

<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Attachments B and C concern a grievance arbitration over an Agency employee's <span class="Italic">Garrity </span>rights; that arbitration involved the same agency and union as this dispute but a different grievant. Both attachments are dated months before the Arbitrator issued the award at issue here. However, there is no indication that the Union submitted these materials to the Arbitrator, although the Union presented other evidence at arbitration regarding the use of <span class="Italic">Garrity </span>preambles by other Agency employees. Thus, the Union could have presented attachments B and C at arbitration. Because there is no indication that the Union did so, we strike attachments B and C from the record. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.5; <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 57 FLRA at 534.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Attachments D and E are letters to another arbitrator addressing whether he should take official notice of the Arbitrator's award in the instant dispute, which establishes that the letters came into existence after the Arbitrator issued the award. However, the question of whether another arbitrator should take notice of the Arbitrator's award is a matter that arises from the issuance of the award and could not have been presented to the Arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See Local R3-77</span>, 59 FLRA at 940; <span class="Italic">USDA</span>, 57 FLRA at 5. Because &#x00A7; 2429.5 does not bar the consideration of matters that arise from the issuance of the award and could not have been presented to the Arbitrator, we deny the motion to strike attachments D and E from the record.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Although the Agency objects to several of these attachments as irrelevant, a party need not demonstrate the relevance of the documents that it files with its exceptions or opposition in order for the Authority to accept those documents for consideration. <span class="Italic">Cf. NFFE, Bureau of Indian Affairs Council</span>, 31 FLRA 3, 8 n.3 (1988) (although various documents were "of questionable relevance" to resolving the parties' dispute, they were not "of such nature to warrant granting a motion to strike"). In contrast, as discussed above, if a party requests permission to file a <span class="Italic">supplemental </span>submission, then that party must demonstrate why its supplemental submission should be considered, <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 98</span>, 60 FLRA at 448 n.2, including that submission's relevance to the parties' dispute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Union argues in its opposition to the exceptions that the Arbitrator's professional qualifications, as reflected in attachments F and G, counsel in favor of upholding his award. The Union would have had no reason to make this argument until after the award issued. <span class="Italic">Cf. U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., N. Chi., Ill.</span>, 52 FLRA 387, 399 n.10 (1996) (submissions pertaining to whether award was deficient arose as result of award and, thus, were not barred by &#x00A7; 2429.5).
