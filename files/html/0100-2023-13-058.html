<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-59"><span class="space">e.</span> Involuntary Reassignment</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency may not use a transfer or reassignment to obtain a retirement and deprive an employee of appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wright v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 24 MSPR 550, 553 (1984). An appellant may demonstrate that the agency engages in a pattern and practice of using directed reassignments for improper purposes. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Umshler v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 44 MSPR 628, 631 (1990). To develop a record permitting review of the reassignment, the AJ should not preclude witnesses who have information bearing on the legitimacy of the move. <span class="Italic">Rayfield v. USDA</span>, 26 MSPR 244 (1985), <span class="Italic">post</span>. The agency must refute an allegation that a transfer was intended to coerce a retirement by showing that the transfer was based on a legitimate management reason. The appellant may then try to rebut the reason by showing that the transfer had no solid or substantial basis in personnel practice or principle<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Roskos v. United States</span>, 549 F.2d 1386 (Ct. Cl. 1977) (retirement was involuntary when it resulted from family pressures after the agency suspended the appellant for a brief period and also geographically reassigned him; there was no evidence that the appellant's presence at his original location was disruptive or that his effectiveness there had been impaired by the conduct leading to the brief suspension).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A retirement may be involuntary and an adverse action if it results from the agency's direction that the appellant accept a geographical reassignment that lacks a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> management reason, <span class="Italic">Welhouse v. USDA</span>, CH-0752-12-0387-I-2 (NP 8/19/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When a retirement involves a directed reassignment, the Board has held that the involuntariness of the retirement may be established by showing that the reassignment had no solid or substantial basis in personnel practice or principle. <span class="Italic">Caveney v. Office of Administration</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 667, 670 (1993). A reassignment must be "properly ordered due to <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> management considerations in the interest of promoting the efficiency of the service." <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of the Interior</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 426, &#x00B6; 11 (2013). Although an agency may exercise its management discretion to reassign its employees as necessary for the efficiency of the service, it may not use its discretionary reassignment authority as a veil to improperly pressure an employee to retire or resign. <span class="Italic">Caveney</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. at 670; <span class="Italic">see McClelland v. Andrus</span>, 606 F.2d 1278, 1291 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (an agency must establish that a reassignment promotes the efficiency of the service, and the fact that an agency articulates a rational basis for a reassignment "does not eliminate the possibility that the transfer was a sham way of achieving a predetermined result").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges that his reassignment to Viroqua was not based on <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> management considerations, but rather, on agency management's desire to make his reassignment as "difficult as possible." He contends that the agency "intentionally inconvenienced and badgered [him] by reassigning him to an office outside of his commuting area to coerce him into retirement." In support of this claim, he references the affidavit of his former second-level supervisor, who was "present at meetings where relocations were discussed." The former second-level supervisor states his belief that agency officials "did not transfer the [appellant] to the Fond du Lac office because they wanted to make [his] transfer as difficult as possible" and that the appellant "could have been transferred within his local commuting area if [agency officials] wanted to work with him." He further states that the Farm Loan Manager in Fond du Lac, "had a personality conflict with" the appellant, noting that this should not constitute "an adequate justification to force the [appellant] to retire."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the foregoing constitutes a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction over the appellant's involuntary retirement appeal and that the appellant is therefore entitled to a jurisdictional hearing if his appeal was timely filed. <span class="Italic">See Coufal v. Department of Justice</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 31, &#x00B6; 23 (2004). We therefore remand this appeal for further adjudication.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Having received a notice of transfer from the agency, the appellant retired rather than accept this transfer or refuse it and be removed by adverse action. Normally, the fact that an employee retires in order to avoid an unpleasant personnel action is not sufficient to render the retirement involuntary, as noted by the presiding official. <span class="Italic">See Christie v. United States,</span> 518 F.2d 584 (Ct. Cl. 1975); <span class="Italic">Else v. Department of Justice,</span> 3 MSPB 475, 3 MSPR 397 (1980). However, an agency may not use a transfer in order to obtain a retirement and thus deprive the employee of appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See Motto v. United States,</span> 502 F.2d 1165 (5th Cir. 1974), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 420 U.S. 927, 95 S. Ct. 1125, 43 L. Ed.2d 398 (1975). Although the appellant bears the burden of establishing that his retirement was involuntary, the agency must refute his allegation that the transfer was intended to coerce his retirement by showing that the transfer was based on a legitimate management reason. <span class="Italic">See Gifft v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 7 MSPB 147, 148, 7 MSPR 242, 244 (1981), citing <span class="Italic">Ketterer v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 2 MSPB 459, 461, 2 MSPR 294, 298 (1980). The appellant must then be allowed an opportunity to rebut that averred reason. If he can successfully demonstrate that the transfer had "no solid or substantial basis in personnel practice or principle," the Board may conclude that it was not a valid discretionary management determination but was either an improper effort to pressure the appellant to retire or was at least an arbitrary and capricious adverse action. <span class="Italic">Roskos v. United States,</span> 549 F.2d 1386, 1389 (Ct. Cl. 1979).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the agency set forth its averred legitimate management reasons for the appellant's transfer in its notice to him of that action, dated May 29, 1984. However, the presiding official and a Board Administrative Law Judge denied the appellant's motions to approve and subpoena witnesses by whose reputed testimony he sought to rebut the alleged <span class="Italic">bona fides</span> of the agency's decision to transfer him.[1] Further, the presiding official erred in repeatedly sustaining the agency's objections to the attempts of the appellant's representative to question its own witnesses regarding the legitimacy of the transfer. The denial of such inquiry improperly denied the appellant the opportunity to rebut the agency's asserted reasons for the transfer and potentially to demonstrate that the resulting retirement was involuntary and thus <span id="Page_1999"></span>appealable to the Board under 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512 and 7513 as a constructive removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Once it is established that the transfer was properly ordered due to <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> management considerations in the interest of promoting the efficiency of the service in accordance with agency discretion under 5 CFR Part 335, this Board will not review the management considerations which underlie that exercise of agency discretion. <span class="Italic">Cf. Griffin v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 2 MSPB 335, 2 MSPR 168 (1980). However, agency discretion to transfer may no more properly be invoked as a veil to effect an employee's separation than may a reduction in force. <span class="Italic">See Losure v. Interstate Commerce Commission,</span> 2 MSPB 361, 2 MSPR 195 (1980).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency does not win the case by alleging legitimate management considerations existed or enumerating them. The dispute as to the legitimacy of those assertions must be resolved through a hearing, if one has been requested, as was explained in <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 107 MSPR 466, 470-73 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-17, 2007 MSPB 304 (2007), also addressing assertions that management made unsupported threats of action based on fallacious claims of poor performance and assertions that the agency gave the employee an unreasonably short period of time to consider his options:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant alleged that he retired when faced with a threatened removal for refusing to accept a directed reassignment. In order to remove an employee for failure to accept a reassignment, the agency's decision to reassign the employee must be <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> and based upon legitimate management considerations in the interest of the service. <span class="Italic">Umshler v. Department of the Interior,</span> 44 M.S.P.R. 628, 630 (1990); <span class="Italic">Ketterer v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 2 M.S.P.R. 294, 299 (1980). An unjustifiable reassignment cannot serve as the basis for a removal action. Therefore, if the appellant can show that the agency knew or should have known that its reasons for reassigning him to the Project Manager position in New Carrollton were not <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> and based upon legitimate management considerations in the interest of the service, then he can show that the agency knew or should have known that it could not substantiate Hunt's threat to remove the appellant for declining the reassignment and that the threatened removal was coercive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency alleges that it had legitimate management reasons for reassigning the appellant, i.e., the agency was going through a reorganization, the appellant was suffering from performance problems as Senior Manager of Operations, and the agency determined that the appellant's talents could best be utilized as an Automation Project Manager at the New Carrollton post of duty. The appellant alleges, however, that he was not experiencing any performance problems as Senior Manager of Operations. The appellant also alleges that, even as Automation Project Manager, there was no legitimate reason for the agency to require him to move to New Carrollton, as no one else working on the project, including the other Automation Project Manager, had been required to move to New Carrollton. The other employees on the automation project were permitted to work from their respective posts of duty throughout the United States.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that the agency's decision to reassign the appellant was justified because the appellant's supervisors contended that the appellant's performance was lacking. However, the fact that the agency alleged that it had a justifiable reason for directing the reassignment was insufficient to divest the Board of jurisdiction over the appellant's claim. "Although the appellant bears the burden of establishing that his retirement was involuntary, the agency must refute his allegation that the transfer was intended to coerce his retirement by showing that the transfer was based on a legitimate management reason. The appellant must then be allowed an opportunity to rebut that averred reason," and must ultimately "demonstrate that the transfer had 'no solid or substantial basis in personnel practice or principle.'" <span class="Italic">Rayfield v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 26 M.S.P.R. 244, 246 (1985) (quoting<span class="Italic"> Roskos v. United States,</span> 549 F.2d 1386, 1389 (Ct. Cl. 1979)). Thus, the AJ erred in crediting the agency's explanation for the reassignment over the appellant's explanation because the appellant stated an adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of jurisdiction and, in the absence of an evidentiary hearing, the AJ may not accept the agency's assertions as dispositive. <span class="Italic">See Ferdon,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. at 329.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board will not review the management considerations which underlie the exercise of agency discretion if it is established that the reassignment was properly ordered due to legitimate and <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> management reasons, <span class="Italic">Rayfield,</span> 26 M.S.P.R. at 247 n.1, in the face of a non-frivolous allegation to the contrary, the propriety of the reassignment cannot be determined without a hearing. Because the appellant has alleged facts which, if proven, would show that the agency knew or should have known that it could not substantiate its threatened removal based on the appellant's declination of the directed reassignment, the appellant has non-frivolously alleged that the threatened removal was purely coercive. <span class="Italic">See Schultz,</span> 810 F.2d at 1136.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the threatened removal, the appellant has alleged that the agency showed bad faith in encouraging the appellant's retirement by qualifying him for a VSIP for which he was not otherwise eligible, and which exerted additional time pressure on his decision to retire. Specifically, the appellant alleges that the agency gave him an extra incentive to retire by making him VSIP eligible through reassignment to the CLD section while simultaneously presenting him with the prospect of choosing between termination and working in New Carrollton. In fact, both parties admit that there was no legitimate purpose for the agency to reassign the appellant to CLD and that the sole purpose of that reassignment was to qualify the appellant for a VSIP. Additionally, the appellant alleges that the VSIP put him under "tremendous pressure" to choose between retirement, relocation, or removal because he had only a few days within which to submit his retirement paperwork in order to qualify for the VSIP, and only a small window of time after that within which to withdraw it.[4] Thus, the appellant has made a non-frivolous allegation that the agency offered him the VSIP to coerce his retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;As the ID points out, this time pressure was associated not with the appellant's retirement <span class="Italic">per se</span>, but with the VSIP. <span class="Italic">See Patrick v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. 509, 522-23 (1996),<span class="Italic"> aff'd,</span> 173 F.3d 434 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (Table). However, this is not a reason to ignore the time pressure factor when considering whether the appellant's retirement was involuntary. Rather, the AJ should give this factor its appropriate weight when considering the totality of the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In conclusion, the appellant has made a non-frivolous allegation that his retirement was involuntary. A coercive threat of removal coupled with a VSIP offered in bad faith to encourage retirement and to apply time pressure to the retirement decision may constitute circumstances which would make a reasonable person feel compelled to retire. If proven, the appellant's allegations would show that the agency coerced his involuntary retirement and would establish Board jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A retirement is not involuntary because it follows a reassignment designed to correct a personality conflict in an office. Tension caused by a poor relationship with a supervisor constitutes a legitimate management reason for reassigning an employee. <span class="Italic">Renville v. DHHS</span>, 26 MSPR 566, 568 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Cox v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 34 Fed. Appx. 782, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP) ("Mr. Cox may have preferred employment in a division of the agency other than the Training Branch to which he was assigned for the year preceding his retirement, but this will not help his claim of involuntariness, because the agency was authorized to reassign him."). Although alternative means are available to correct an agency work force imbalance, once it is established that a reassignment was properly ordered due to <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> management considerations, the Board will not review those considerations. A retirement is not involuntary because the appellant was in AWOL status or was threatened with removal after having refused a geographic reassignment. Retirement to obtain an annuity and avoid the financial pressures facing the appellant if he opposed removal for refusing to accept the reassignment does not constitute coercion. <span class="Italic">Musone v. USDA</span>, 31 MSPR 85, 89 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Baum v. DHS</span>, NY-0752-12-0234-I-1 (NP 3/24/2014) ("'We further agree with the administrative judge that the appellant has failed to show that the agency's decision to reassign him to a different work unit "had no solid or substantial basis in personnel practice or principle.' <span class="Italic">Caveney</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. at 669. The agency established the routine, structured nature of its biannual staffing assessment and reassignment process, and the appellant has failed to show that the agency's proferred reason for his reassignment--namely that '[i]t is important that all members of the NY District be well-versed in multiple types of immigration benefits for efficiency and good customer service,'--was a veil designed to pressure the appellant into retirement....Finally, to the extent the appellant asks us to review the underlying wisdom and judgment of his transfer based on his years of experience and expertise, 'the Board will not review the management considerations underlying' the agency's discretion to reassign an employee once the <span class="Italic">bona fides</span> of that decision have been established. <span class="Italic">Caveney</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. at 670 n.1.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Caveney v. Office of Admin.</span>, 57 MSPR 667, 670-71 (1993), provided nonfrivolous allegations warranting a hearing on an involuntary retirement appeal. The case involved reassignment from one job to another within the same activity and office location, deliberate idling of the employee, his EEO complaint protesting the reassignment, followed by retirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Normally, the fact that an employee retires to avoid an unpleasant personnel action is not sufficient to render the retirement involuntary. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rayfield v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 26 MSPR 244, 246 (1985). In situations, as here, when a retirement involves a directed reassignment, however, the Board has held that the involuntariness of the retirement may be established by showing that the reassignment had "no solid or substantial basis in personnel practice or principle."[1] <span class="Italic">Cartwright</span>, 54 MSPR at 342, quoting <span class="Italic">Rayfield</span>, 26 MSPR at 246. Although an agency may exercise its management discretion to reassign its employees as necessary for the efficiency of the service, it may not use its discretionary reassignment authority as a veil to improperly pressure an employee to retire or resign. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rayfield</span>, 26 MSPR at 246; <span class="Italic">Ketterer v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 2 MSPB 459, 2 MSPR 294, 299 n.8 (1980). In analyzing the <span id="Page_2000"></span>jurisdictional issue in this appeal, the administrative judge merely applied the general coercion/duress or misrepresentation framework and failed to apply the more specifically appropriate <span class="Italic">Rayfield</span> framework. This was error.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Once it is established that the reassignment was effected based on <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> management considerations in accordance with the agency's discretion under 5 CFR part 335, the Board will not review the management considerations underlying that exercise of agency discretion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rayfield</span>, 26 MSPR at 247 n.1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note that the appellants in <span class="Italic">Cartwright</span> and <span class="Italic">Rayfield</span> resigned or retired rather than accept their directed reassignments.... In the present appeal, however, the appellant accepted his directed reassignment and contested the reassignment through equal employment opportunity channels before submitting his retirement application under protest. As noted by the administrative judge, the Board has stated that "[t]he focus in an allegedly involuntary resignation [or retirement] is on the circumstances immediately preceding the appellant's action." <span class="Italic">Powers v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 43 MSPR 626, 630, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 918 F.2d 187 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (Table); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Filliben v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 34 MSPR 31, 34 (1987). Nevertheless, this general rule does not preclude the Board's consideration of circumstances not immediately preceding the resignation or retirement in appropriate cases. Moreover, <span class="Italic">Powers</span> and <span class="Italic">Filliben</span> did not involve a directed reassignment. We therefore find that the factual differences between the present appeal and the <span class="Italic">Rayfield</span> line of cases do not preclude the application here of the <span class="Italic">Rayfield</span> principle that a resignation or retirement will be deemed involuntary if it was improperly obtained through a directed reassignment that was not based on <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> management considerations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged below that his retirement was involuntary because, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, his directed reassignment had "no solid or substantial basis in personnel management or management principles." In support of this allegation, he averred that: Before the reassignment, his supervisor verbally pressured him to retire from his GS-15 Supervisory Computer Specialist position; when he refused to retire, the agency reassigned him to a Budget Analyst position with no real duties and told him that this new position would soon be reclassified at a lower grade; the reassignment left him isolated, idled, and humiliated; and the reassignment was a sham designed to force him to retire and then to place in his former position an acquaintance of a friend of the agency's Personnel Director. We find that the appellant has raised nonfrivolous factual allegations that, if proven, would establish the involuntariness of his retirement and that such allegations are sufficient to entitle him to a jurisdictional hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Harper v. VA</span>, 68 MSPR 594, 600-01 (1995), added as to a reassignment to a sham job:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, the appellant alleged that the agency reassigned him to the Director, Contract Administration Staff position in order to place another employee in his former position and, based on the "meaningless" or "sham" nature of the new position, to force the appellant to retire. Although an agency may exercise its management discretion to reassign its employees as necessary for the efficiency of the service, it may not use this discretionary authority as a veil in an improper effort to pressure an employee to retire or resign. <span class="Italic">See Caveney,</span> 57 MSPR at 670; <span class="Italic">Rayfield</span>, 26 MSPR at 246. When (as here) a retirement involves the agency's use of this discretionary reassignment authority, an appellant may raise the issue of the voluntariness of the retirement by alleging that the reassignment had no "solid or substantial basis in personnel practice or principle." <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Under this standard, the Board has held that an appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of involuntariness entitling him to a jurisdictional hearing when he asserts that his reassignment was a "sham" designed to force him to retire and to place another employee in his former position. <span class="Italic">See Caveney,</span> 57 MSPR at 671. Because the appellant here has made such an assertion, he has set forth a nonfrivolous allegation of involuntariness entitling him to a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">The potential for problems in a reassignment does not make a retirement involuntary. <span class="Italic">Barnett v. USPS</span>, 59 MSPR 125, 128 (1993), remanded an involuntary retirement case on an issue of whether the appellant adequately understood his retirement options, but said of an appellant's claim that the retirement was involuntary because of uncertainty as to what a future assignment might be:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argued that he had no alternative but to retire, because the agency had assigned the duties of his position to another employee and he did not know what his next assignment would be. As the administrative judge observed, the appellant could have addressed that uncertainty simply by waiting to discover where and to which position he would be assigned, and whether that assignment would result in a reduction in grade or pay, which he could have appealed. The administrative judge correctly found that the fact that these alternatives were less pleasing to the appellant than the special retirement option offered by the agency did not render his decision to retire coerced and involuntary, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Nies v. United States Postal Service</span>, 32 MSPR 510, 512 (1987).</p>
