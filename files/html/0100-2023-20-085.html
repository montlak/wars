<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-87"><span class="space">2.</span> Election and Preclusion of Remedies; Managers and Supervisors; Notice of Rights</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1994 Congress enacted Pub. L. 103-424 (reauthorizing OSC and MSPB), amending the Reform Act and Whistleblower Protection Act. Section 9 of this statute added an election requirement that bars duplicative Board appeals (whether direct appeal or IRA appeal), OSC complaints, and negotiated grievance proceedings in covered prohibited personnel practice cases. The statutory amendment, at 5 USC 7121(g), provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(g)(1)&#x2003;This subsection applies with respect to a prohibited personnel practice other than a prohibited personnel practice to which subsection (d) [involving cases alleging discrimination within the ambit of laws administered by EEOC] applies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;An aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice described in paragraph (1) may elect not more than one of the remedies described in paragraph (3) with respect thereto. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a determination as to whether a particular remedy has been elected shall be made as set forth under paragraph (4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;The remedies described in this paragraph are as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; An appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under section 7701.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; A negotiated grievance procedure under this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003; Procedures for seeking corrective action under subchapters II and III of chapter 12 [prohibited personnel practice and Individual Right of Action cases].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)&#x2003;For the purpose of this subsection, a person shall be considered to have elected--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; the remedy described in paragraph (3)(A) if such person has timely filed a notice of appeal under the applicable appellate procedures;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; the remedy described in paragraph (3)(B) if such person has timely filed a grievance in writing, in accordance with the provisions of the parties' negotiated procedure; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003; the remedy described in paragraph (3)(C) if such person has sought corrective action from the Office of Special Counsel by making an allegation under section 1214(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The statutory provisions are reflected by MSPB regulations, 5 CFR 1201.3 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Limitations on appellate jurisdiction, collective bargaining agreements, and election of procedures:</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;For an employee covered by a collective bargaining agreement under 5 U.S.C. 7121, the negotiated grievance procedures contained in the agreement are the exclusive procedures for resolving any action that could otherwise be appealed to the Board, with the following exceptions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;An appealable action involving discrimination under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1), reduction in grade or removal under 5 U.S.C. 4303, or adverse action under 5 U.S.C. 7512, may be raised under the Board's appellate procedures, or under the negotiated grievance procedures, but not under both;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;An appealable action involving a prohibited personnel practice other than discrimination under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1) may be raised under not more than one of the following procedures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(A)&#x2003; The Board's appellate procedures;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(B)&#x2003; The negotiated grievance procedures; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(C)&#x2003; The procedures for seeking corrective action from the Special Counsel under subchapters II and III of chapter 12 of title 5 of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iii)&#x2003;Except for actions involving discrimination under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1) or any other prohibited personnel practice, any appealable action that is excluded from the application of the negotiated grievance procedures may be raised only under the Board's appellate procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Choice of procedure. When an employee has an option of pursuing an action under the Board's appeal procedures or under negotiated grievance procedures, the Board considers the choice between those procedures to have been made when the employee timely files an appeal with the Board or timely files a written grievance, whichever event occurs first. When an employee has the choice of pursuing an appealable action involving a prohibited personnel practice other than discrimination under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1) in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the Board considers the choice among those procedures to have been made <span id="Page_3788"></span>when the employee timely files an appeal with the Board, timely files a written grievance under the negotiated grievance procedure, or seeks corrective action from the Special Counsel by making an allegation under 5 U.S.C. 1214(a)(1), whichever event occurs first....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 1201.21 (2022) requires an agency to notify the appellant of Board and other appeal or complaint rights with a decision appealable to the Board, with notice of possible remedial elections:</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Taggart v. MSPB</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20200709113">820 Fed. Appx. 1002</a> (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP), reviewed the statutory election scheme involving IRA cases and grievances:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g) provides that an aggrieved employee may select only one of three remedies to challenge a personnel action in Taggart's circumstance: (1) a Board appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701; (2) a grievance under a CBA; or (3) a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel ("OSC"). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g)(3). Whichever procedure the employee brings first is deemed an election of that procedure and forecloses access to the other procedures. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g)(2) ("An aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice described in paragraph (1) may elect not more than one of the remedies described in paragraph (3)"); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g)(4); <span class="Italic">Agaranos v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 498, &#x00B6; 13 (2013) ("[W]hichever remedy is sought first by an aggrieved employee is deemed an election of that procedure and precludes pursuing the matter in either of the other two forums.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CBA includes a similar provision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In matters relating to...Prohibited Personnel Practices [and] Whistleblowing...an aggrieved employee will have the option of utilizing this grievance procedure or any other procedure available in law or regulation, <span class="Italic">but not both. An employee exercises that option when a grievance or appeal within a statutory procedure has been filed within the applicable time limits</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CBA &#x00A7; 47.03(c) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to filing the instant IRA appeal with the Board on May 7, 2019, Taggart had already elected the CBA grievance procedure on September 30, 2015 to challenge his suspension on both substantive and retaliation grounds. That election precluded his utilization of any of the other avenues to challenge the suspension, and thus stripped the Board of jurisdiction it otherwise could have had to adjudicate his suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before us, Taggart asserts error on four grounds. First, he argues that the deciding official responded to the grievance outside the timeframe required by the CBA. Even if true, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g)(4) fixes the employee's election <span class="Italic">at the date of filing</span> of the relevant procedure, without regard to the timeframe in which the deciding body makes a decision. The timeliness of the deciding official's decision, therefore, does not serve to vacate Taggart's election or grant jurisdiction to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, Taggart argues that his suspension was issued "over a year after the incident[s], well pass[ed] the timeline for investigation and decision." Taggart has failed to show how this fact impacts the Board's jurisdiction. We also note that the Agency proposed Taggart's removal in May 2015, about seven months after the alleged specifications. Taggart has not pointed us to anything indicating that this amount of time is unreasonable or carries any jurisdictional weight.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A note concerning the definition of "employee" for purposes of application of 5 USC 7121: that statute is part of Chapter 71 of Title 5 USC. Under 5 USC 7103(a)(2)(iii), "employee" is defined to exclude a supervisor or management official. The Federal Circuit confirmed that distinction and the ability of a supervisor to pursue both a matter through OSC and through direct MSPB appeal, <span class="Italic">Kammunkun v. DOD</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-1374.Opinion.4-6-2020_1563927.pdf">800 Fed. Appx. 916</a>, 917 (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge dismissed Ms. Kammunkun's Chapter 75 action because (a) Ms. Kammunkun had previously elected to contest her removal with the Office of Special Counsel and subsequent individual right of action appeal; and (b) the election requirement of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.2(d) prevented Ms. Kammunkun from also challenging her removal via a Chapter 75 action. The administrative judge's decision became the decision of the MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge erred in interpreting 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.2(d), which applies only to employees, as applying to Ms. Kammunkun, who was a supervisor. Section 1209.2(d) states that, "[u]nder 5 U.S.C. 7121(g)(3), an <span class="Italic">employee</span> who believes he or she was subjected to a covered personnel action in retaliation for whistleblowing or other protected activity" may elect only one of three listed remedies. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.2(d)(1) (emphasis added). An "employee" for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g)(3) is defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(2), which specifically excludes "supervisor[s]." It is undisputed that Ms. Kammunkun was a supervisor. Accordingly, the election requirement of &#x00A7; 1209.2 does not apply to Ms. Kammunkun.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Requena v. DHS</span>, 2022 MSPB 39 (2022) (accepting <span class="Italic">Kammunkun</span> analysis; remanding for analysis of whether appellant was a manager and impact of that status on her direct appeal after resort to OSC).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An election of remedies--OSC for an IRA appeal, MSPB for a direct appeal--when there is that choice, must be informed. As to a constructive suspension, <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of Army</span>, 122 MSPR 612, 624-25 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-18, 2015 MSPB 51 (2015), determined:</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An election of remedies--OSC for an IRA appeal, MSPB for a direct appeal--when there is that choice, must be informed. As to a constructive suspension, <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SAVAGE_TOMMIE_G_AT_0752_11_0634_I_2_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1217635.pdf">122 MSPR 612</a>, 624-25 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-18, 2015 MSPB 51 (2015), determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant contends that the administrative judge erred in requiring her to establish OSC exhaustion concerning her constructive suspension claim. In support of her argument, she cites <span class="Italic">Covarrubias v. Social Security Administration</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 583 (2010), <span class="Italic">overruled by Colbert v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 677 (2014), in which we held that an IRA appeal is limited to alleged personnel actions that are not otherwise appealable to the Board and that the involuntary retirement claim raised by the appellant in that case therefore was outside the scope of her IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 9 n.2. She reasons that, under <span class="Italic">Covarrubias</span>, her constructive suspension claim is subject to chapter 75 jurisdictional standards, rather than the jurisdictional standards for IRA appeals, and that it is unnecessary to prove OSC exhaustion to establish an affirmative defense of whistleblowing retaliation in an adverse action appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the appellant's reasoning was sound when she filed her petition for review, <span class="Italic">Covarrubias</span> has since been overruled. <span class="Italic">Colbert</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 12 n.5. The holding of <span class="Italic">Covarrubias</span> was based on our previous decision in <span class="Italic">Massimino v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 318 (1993), <span class="Italic">abrogated by</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g), in which we held that when an individual who was affected by an action that is directly appealable to the Board files a whistleblower retaliation complaint with OSC, the jurisdictional basis for a subsequent appeal to the Board is the "true nature" of the agency's action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 322-23. After <span class="Italic">Covarrubias</span> was issued, however, we recognized that <span class="Italic">Massimino</span> had been abrogated by the 1994 amendments to the WPA, in particular, the new section at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g). <span class="Italic">See Agoranos v. Department of Justice</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 498, &#x00B6; 18 (2013). Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g), an employee who claims to have suffered whistleblowing reprisal regarding an action may elect no more than one of the following remedies: a direct appeal to the Board; a negotiated grievance procedure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121; or a request for corrective action under 5 U.S.C. chapter 12, subchapters II and III, i.e., <span id="Page_3789"></span>an OSC complaint, potentially to be followed by an IRA appeal. Ordinarily, an individual who first requests corrective action from OSC will be deemed to have made a binding election to proceed in that forum. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g)(4)(C). In such a case, the jurisdictional requirements for an IRA appeal apply, even if the contested personnel action would have been directly appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Agoranos</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 498, &#x00B6; 14. This principle applies equally to alleged constructive actions. <span class="Italic">See Colbert</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 12 n.5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we also have held that an election under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g) is binding only if made knowingly and voluntarily. <span class="Italic">Agoranos</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 498, &#x00B6; 16. Here, neither the agency, nor the administrative judge, advised the appellant that contesting her alleged constructive suspension in an OSC complaint would preclude a subsequent chapter 75 appeal before the Board. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6; 18. Moreover, while the express language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g) negates <span class="Italic">Massimino</span> and <span class="Italic">Covarrubias</span>, the Board had not yet recognized this when the OSC complaint was filed, and the appellant and her attorney could have reasonably relied on those cases. <span class="Italic">See Agoranos</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 498, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18.[3] We therefore find that the appellant's decision to contest her alleged constructive suspension before OSC was not a binding election and did not preclude her from filing an adverse action appeal before the Board. Because the appellant has expressly indicated that she wishes for her constructive suspension claim to be adjudicated outside the scope of her IRA appeal, we will consider her claim as an adverse action appeal under chapter 75.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The administrative judge also appears not to have recognized the effect of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g), as evidenced by his decision to dismiss the removal appeal without prejudice to permit the appellant to file an OSC complaint. Ordinarily, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g), the appellant's removal would not have been properly before OSC, as she had already appealed it to the Board. To the extent the administrative judge may have erred in granting the appellant's request for dismissal without prejudice, or to the extent OSC may have erred in including the removal in the scope of its investigation, these errors have no effect on the outcome of this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Again addressing elections of remedies in constructive adverse actions, <span class="Italic">Corthell v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/CORTHELL_KINSMAN_PH_1221_15_0449_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1306718.pdf">123 MSPR 417</a>, 425-26 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17, 2016 MSPB 23 (2016) (overruled as to election of remedies for managers, <span class="Italic">Requena v. DHS</span>, 2022 MSPB 39 (2022)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant raised the matter of his alleged involuntary retirement with OSC before proceeding to the Board. Ordinarily, an individual who first requests corrective action from OSC will be deemed to have made a binding election to proceed in that forum. <span class="Italic">Agoranos</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 498, &#x00B6; 14; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.2(d). In such a case, the procedures for an IRA appeal apply, even if the contested personnel action would have been directly appealable to the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.2(d)(2). In adjudicating the merits of such an IRA appeal, Board will limit its inquiry to issues listed at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e), and will not consider affirmative defenses. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.2(c). Thus, if the appellant were to establish in the context of his IRA appeal that his retirement was involuntary, and thus tantamount to a removal, he could not pursue his discrimination claim, and any failure by the agency to provide him constitutional due process would not by itself entitle the appellant to a remedy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we have held that an election under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g) is binding only if it was knowing and informed. <span class="Italic">Agoranos</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 498, &#x00B6; 16. An agency's failure to inform an employee fully of his potential appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g) and any limitation on those rights precludes a finding that the appellant made a knowing and informed election of remedies under that provision. <span class="Italic">Agoranos</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 498, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-17. Here, the agency did not issue a letter of decision or otherwise provide the appellant with the required notice, and there is no indication that he was informed through some other means. <span class="Italic">See Mastrullo v. Department of Labor</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6; 10 (2015); <span class="Italic">Savage v. Department of the Army</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 18 (2015). We therefore find that the appellant's decision to seek corrective action with OSC does not preclude him from filing an adverse action appeal under 5 U.S.C. chapters 75 and 77, while continuing to contest the remaining personnel actions in his IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">See Savage</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 18. If the appellant elects to pursue his involuntary retirement claim separately from his IRA appeal, the adverse action appeal will not be subject to the jurisdictional requirements of an IRA appeal and will not be limited to the issues listed at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a). <span class="Italic">See Savage</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 61, &#x00B6; 22. On remand, the administrative judge should determine whether the appellant wishes to pursue that course of action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Hoffman v. Dept. of Army</span>, SF-0752-17-0432-I-1, n.2 (NP 2/22/2023) ("[T]he appellant has not been prejudiced by the docketing of this claim. <span class="Italic">See Colbert v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 12 &#x0026; n.5 (2014) (overruling <span class="Italic">Covarrubias v. Social Security Administration</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 583, &#x00B6; 9 n.2 (2010)). In either case, one aspect of the appellant's jurisdictional burden would be to make a nonfrivolous allegation that her resignation was tantamount to a constructive removal. <span class="Italic">See Mintzmyer v. Department of the Interior</span>, 84 F.3d 419, 423 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Comito v. Department of the Army</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 58, &#x00B6; 13 (2001).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The election must also be effective. <span class="Italic">Figueroa v. Dept. of Transp</span>., DC-1221-15-0982-W-1 (NP 5/17/2016), involved an appellant complaining of a constructive demotion resulting from a reassignment. He then filed an OSC complaint asserting the demotion resulted from whistleblower reprisal. A month later he filed a constructive demotion appeal with the Board. The AJ considered the appeal as an IRA case and dismissed it for failure to exhaust the OSC remedial process. Mr. Figueroa then filed a timely PFR. Meanwhile, after the initial decision, OSC closed out its investigation and he filed an IRA appeal. The Board remanded the case with the observation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant elected to proceed along the OSC complaint/IRA appeal route because he filed his complaint with OSC before filing his Board appeal in this case. His election, however, is only binding if it was knowing and informed. <span class="Italic">Agoranos v. Department of Justice</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 498, &#x00B6; 16 (2013). Further, if jurisdiction never attached to the appellant's original choice, then it was not a true choice among viable alternatives and is not binding. <span class="Italic">Scalera v. Department of the Navy</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 43, &#x00B6; 9 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ORDER</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons discussed above, we remand this case to the regional office for further adjudication in accordance with this Remand Order. On remand, the administrative judge shall join this appeal with the appellant's appeal in MSPB Docket No. DC-1221-16-0136-W-1 and shall, after informing the parties of their respective burdens and elements of proof and considering the parties' evidence and argument, determine whether the appellant made a knowing and informed election to pursue an IRA appeal. The administrative judge shall then adjudicate the appeal according to the course dictated by his or her determination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A forum chosen that lacks jurisdiction over a whistleblowing reprisal claim does not constitute an election of remedies precluding MSPB jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Kerr v. MSPB</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/17-2538.Opinion.11-15-2018.pdf">908 F.3d 1307</a>, 1314-15 (Fed. Cir. 2018):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government argues, in the alternative, that when Kerr elected to pursue her mixed case in district court, the MSPB lost jurisdiction over her WPA claim. An election of remedies typically requires the petitioner have "full knowledge of the circumstances that make both theories <span class="Italic">available</span> and inconsistent." 18B Charles A. Wright, Arthur B. Miller &#x0026; Edward H. Cooper, <span class="Italic">Federal Practice &#x0026; Procedure</span> &#x00A7; 4476 (2d ed. 2002) (emphasis added). Under our precedent, election of a review route that cannot afford a remedy (e.g., no jurisdiction over the claim) will generally not foreclose access to a route that can provide a remedy. <span class="Italic">See Biogen MA, Inc. v. Japanese Found. for Cancer Research</span>, 785 F.3d 648, 653 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that there was appellate jurisdiction over the administrative proceeding at issue pursuant to 35 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 141, despite the appellant's initial election of district court review under <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 146 because the district court lacked jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government relies on cases where the petitioner sought a second bite at the apple after review in the initially selected forum denied the claim on the merits. For example, in <span class="Italic">Connor v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 15 F.3d 1063 (Fed. Cir. 1994), we held that the MSPB lacked jurisdiction over a claim that was originally filed in the district court and was still co-pending when the complainant appealed to the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1066. The district court's jurisdiction over the claim was not questioned, and ultimately the petitioner received a decision on the merits. <span class="Italic">Connor v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 210 F.3d 369, 2000 WL 294392 (5th Cir. 2000) (unpublished); <span class="Italic">see also e.g., Williams v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 244 Fed. Appx. 345, 346 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>) ("[t]he district court addressed the same issues now presented by this appeal."). Here, Kerr is merely trying to secure review of her WPA claim in the first instance, not a second chance to relitigate a decision on the merits. The election of remedies doctrine has no application when the elected remedy is not available from the selected forum, and thus Kerr's filing in district court did not constitute an effective election that stripped the MSPB of jurisdiction over her claim.</p>
