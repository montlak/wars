<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-47"><span class="space">m.</span> Discriminatory Working Conditions</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cruz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 683, 687-88 (1989), considered the relation of EEO allegations, an agency removal proposal, and a claimed forced resignation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not reach the appellant's final contention that the agency proposed his removal in reprisal for his prior EEO complaints because we conclude that the administrative judge erred in reaching the reprisal claim in determining the voluntariness of the appellant's resignation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established that 5 USC 2302(b) (setting forth certain prohibited personnel practices, including certain forms of discrimination and reprisal) is not an independent source of Board jurisdiction and that the employee must establish subject-matter jurisdiction before the Board may review claims based on such practices.... In some cases, however, such claims are so intertwined with the question of jurisdiction that the Board must decide them in order to determine whether there exists an otherwise appealable action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Durden v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 18 MSPR 373, 376 (1983), the employee alleged that the agency forced him to retire from his position due to handicap discrimination because it failed to accommodate his physical condition. The Board concluded that the employee's retirement was involuntary where the agency had advised him to consider retirement or face removal for physical inability to perform his duties. It found that an arguable basis for his removal did not exist since it had previously accommodated his condition without affecting his work performance and his condition had not deteriorated.... In <span class="Italic">Durden</span>...the Board stated that it was not suggesting that a finding of discrimination will always negate voluntariness, "[o]nly where...discrimination is the sole reason for the threatened agency action, will a finding of involuntariness be made."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, the appellant's reprisal claim, even if true, cannot be considered the sole reason here, since the agency demonstrated an arguable basis for the proposed action based on the administrative judge's findings that: (1) The appellant repeatedly confronted his supervisor on matters of her authority and refused to comply with her directives and guidance; (2) the appellant was insubordinate and disrespectful; and (3) he had attempted to have the campus representative of a college removed without permission from his supervisors. We therefore find the administrative judge need not have decided the appellant's reprisal claim in order to determine the voluntariness of his resignation....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Initially, a less than unanimous court opinion overturned the Board's <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> decision. In <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 906 F.2d 689 (Fed. Cir. 1990), the court determined that the appellant's allegation of reprisal for having filed EEO complaints against his employer established "mixed case" jurisdiction with the Board, and the Board was obliged to decide the issues presented rather than ignore them on the basis that it lacked jurisdiction because the appellant had not proved that his resignation was involuntary. That result was set aside on reconsideration in <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240, 1244-47 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). The analysis in the 1991 <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> decision was not the clearest, but it would appear to permit the Board to assume jurisdiction if discriminatory acts constituted the sole cause of a resignation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the Board lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine an appeal from an employee who has voluntarily resigned. The courts, however, have recognized a corollary proposition, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that the Board does have jurisdiction to hear and determine an appeal by an employee whose resignation was not voluntary, an involuntary resignation being deemed a "constructive removal." The Board has jurisdiction to determine whether a resignation was voluntary or involuntary because it has jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction.... A resignation is either voluntary or involuntary on the date it is submitted, and jurisdiction must be determined as of that date. Cruz, who has the burden of establishing jurisdiction, alleged before the Board that his resignation was involuntary because the agency knew that the charges it cited as the basis for proposing his removal could not be substantiated....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Cruz' primary assertion in his appeal here is that the Board should have decided his reprisal claim and notified him of a right to appeal that decision to the EEOC or a district court because the agency's January 29, 1988 letter was in reprisal for filing his 1987 EEOC complaint. But that mere assertion does not provide a basis for Board jurisdiction in this voluntary resignation case. First, a petitioner's mere assertion cannot create jurisdiction. Second, as above indicated, bringing charges, for whatever reason, is not in itself an agency action appealable to the Board. Nor are discriminatory acts in themselves agency actions appealable to the Board. A statute, 5 USC 2302(b), makes reprisal a prohibited personnel practice, but that statute is not an independent source of Board jurisdiction....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor would a source of jurisdiction be created by accepting, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, Cruz' label for his reprisal assertion: "Title VII claim of discrimination." The Board has not been granted jurisdiction over Title VII claims <span class="Italic">per se</span>, i.e., over "pure" or "naked" Title VII claims unaccompanied by an appealable action over which the Board does have jurisdiction. Cruz on this appeal attempts to convert his attempted appeal under Title 5, USC to a suit for discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. As above indicated, when discrimination is asserted in an appeal from a removal or other appealable adverse agency action over which the Board <span class="Italic">has</span> jurisdiction, the case is a "mixed case" and the Board must decide the merits of the appealable action and whether it was a discriminatory act. 5 USC 7702. In such cases, the Board routinely notifies appellants of a right to EEOC review. Where, as here, it has been found that there never was an appealable adverse agency action, the case is not a "mixed case," &#x00A7; 7702 is not involved, and the Board correctly determined that it was without jurisdiction to consider Cruz' claim of procedural error or his reprisal assertion, or any other claim beyond the Board's jurisdiction. That holding and our affirmance break no new ground.... For the same reason, the Board correctly declined to refer to any right of EEOC review and Cruz' motion for transfer of this case to a district court must be denied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Cruz mistakenly relies on <span class="Italic">Durden v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 18 MSPR 373 (1983) as requiring the Board to notify him of a right to appeal the Board's decision to the EEOC. First, <span class="Italic">Durden</span> is not precedent in this court. Second, the Board noted that the handicap discrimination issue in <span class="Italic">Durden</span> required analysis to determine whether Durden's retirement in the face of the agency's advice to consider retirement or be removed <span class="Italic">because of his handicap</span> was a constructive discharge, whereas the proposal to remove Cruz was based on repeated acts of insubordination, on conduct most destructive of the efficiency of the service. Third, unlike the present case, the agency suggested retirement in <span class="Italic">Durden</span> and it was found, contrary to the facts here, that there was not even an arguable basis for Durden's discharge, the agency having previously accommodated his handicap. Finally, and most important, the Board said <span class="Italic">Durden</span> was a narrow exception because handicap discrimination was the <span class="Italic">sole</span> reason for the threatened discharge, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the threat and Durden's retirement were "intertwined" with, indeed <span class="Italic">based</span> on, Durden's handicap. There is no basis for a similar exception here, where Cruz' assertion of reprisal does not affect the voluntariness of his resignation in the face of serious charges of insubordination and <span id="Page_1972"></span>unacceptable performance. Unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">Durden</span>, as the Board held, Cruz' "reprisal claim, even if true, cannot be considered the sole reason here, since the agency demonstrated an arguable basis" for the proposal to remove him.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Collins</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. at 188-89, the Board found that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that her resignation was coerced by agency's discrimination and retaliation, where she did not specify the particular acts of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation directed against her, and did not <span class="Italic">explain</span> the link between this alleged conduct and the nature and severity of her <span class="Italic">health concerns</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By contrast, the appellant in the present case alleged specific acts of discrimination and harassment on the part of agency officials, <span class="Italic">and</span> expressly described the link between this conduct and her health concerns.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board decided that a jurisdictional hearing should be provided to an appellant who asserts that her resignation was coerced by a series of specific actions constituting reprisal after she settled an EEO case, <span class="Italic">McCray v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 80 MSPR 154, 159 &#x00B6; 9 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1994, the appellant and the agency entered into a settlement agreement to resolve an EEO complaint which she had filed against the agency in 1992. She claimed that the agency, and in particular "responsible management officials" (RMO's) she had named in her 1992 complaint, engaged in a pattern of reprisal against her following the settlement agreement. She alleged that this pattern of reprisal included denial of promotions, training, and assignments, a hostile work environment, and defamation of character. Among her allegations of such reprisal are the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">She did not receive a promotion in six years while she watched her white co-workers receive promotion after promotion. Unlike her co-workers, her position was singled out for a "desk audit."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">She was denied training unless the cost was less than $100, whereas training was approved for other employees that cost as much as $1,000. The appellant stated her belief that the denial of training was a means to prevent her from receiving any promotions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">RMOs advised new employees that the appellant was "dangerous," and a "troublemaker" who "would write anyone up." As a result of these negative comments, co-workers have avoided her and isolated her in the workplace. She adds that she has further isolated herself to avoid intentionally derogatory comments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Her desk was frequently "trashed," her desk drawers were rifled, and her name tag turned backwards inside its holder so that her name was not visible. Her chair would sometimes be adjusted so that it could tilt forward in a forceful manner, possibly causing injury to her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The "continuous use of obscene and vulgar language used by the Marines and a few civilians were [sic] intolerable."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">During a Division meeting in February 1997, an officer made negative statements about her that were untrue, and, when she tried to defend herself, she was told to shut up.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">On April 4, 1997, Lt. Col. Rogers (the appellant's supervisor) directed profanity at her and made a comment she took as a threat.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges that the above sorts of occurrences adversely affected her work performance and her health. She states there were times when she woke up with severe headaches and stomach problems, and had to call in sick. She states that her work environment deteriorated to the point that, "On a daily basis, I found it very difficult to go to work each morning." She reports that she had a discussion with Lt. Col. Rogers on April 28, 1997, in which she told him she needed to go on leave because she was stressed out and suffering from mental anguish. She asserts that she told him that she would take at least two weeks of annual leave, and if that was not enough, she would request leave without pay. After returning from that leave, she requested leave without pay. She apparently submitted her resignation only after her request was denied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish entitlement to a jurisdictional hearing, an appellant need not allege facts which, if proven, definitely <span class="Italic">would</span> establish that the resignation was involuntary; she need only allege facts which, if proven, <span class="Italic">could</span> establish such a claim. <span class="Italic">See Braun</span>, 50 F.3d at 1008; <span class="Italic">Dumas</span>, 789 F.2d at 894.

<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_1973"></span>We further hold that Mr. Braun has made a non-frivolous allegation that, if proven, could establish that his resignation was coerced. This non-frivolous allegation is all that is required to trigger the Board's jurisdiction at this threshold stage. It would be illogical to require a petitioner to prove in advance by preponderant evidence that a resignation or retirement was involuntary to secure a hearing on that very issue. When there is a question as to the voluntariness of the petitioner's resignation or retirement, <span class="Italic">and</span> the petitioner makes a non-frivolous allegation of the involuntariness of the resignation or retirement, an evidentiary hearing is required to determine whether the resignation or retirement was in fact involuntary.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">A coerced resignation was found when the appellant, who was involved as a complainant in EEO proceedings, left a law enforcement job after her coworkers repeatedly disrupted her radio communications, risking her safety, <span class="Italic">Bates v. DOJ</span>, 70 MSPR 659, 663-72 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To prove that her resignation was involuntary...it is not necessary that the appellant prove that the harassment was based on prohibited discrimination, but rather, she need only show that "working conditions were so difficult that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hurwitz</span>, 61 MSPR, at 439; <span class="Italic">see also Heining v. General Services Administration</span>, 68 MSPR 513, 522 (1995). We find that the cumulative effect of years of unremitting interference with her radio transmissions and the realization that no relief was in sight finally constituted the appellant's "last straw," and led to her resignation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was hired as a GS-5 BPA Trainee on September 24, 1984. She was stationed in Yuma, Arizona. It is undisputed that, in September 1985, while still a Trainee, she was sexually assaulted by BPA Reynolds, the Senior BPA to whom she reported. The appellant testified that she informed her supervisor, Bill Jordan, of the incident and that they filled out paperwork pursuant to filing an EEO complaint on this matter. Ultimately, however, a higher-level supervisory official, James Lockwood, assured her that the situation would be informally remedied by Reynolds's transfer from the area. Reynolds was in fact transferred, and the appellant testified that she was satisfied with that result at the time, and so, did not file a formal EEO complaint. The appellant also testified that, soon after, the "harassment really began." She stated that she was subjected by several of her fellow BPAs to the conduct described below and alleges that such conduct constituted harassment because of her sex and retaliation for her 1985 informal EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant testified that an unidentified BPA once placed behind the visor of her vehicle a dead rattlesnake, which fell into her lap while she was driving her truck at night in the performance of her duties. She contended variously that this incident occurred in 1985 and 1988. Given the detailed recollection the appellant displayed in her affidavit and her ability at that time to relate the incident to vehicular accidents occurring in 1985, we find that the incident occurred, if at all, in 1985.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that all BPAs, male and female, were subjected to incidents like the snake incident in this appeal, and that this type of occurrence was a common type of practical joke. Indeed, in contrast to her testimony at the December 1993 hearing, the appellant stated in her February 5, 1991 affidavit to the EEO investigator that she thought this incident was funny and that she considered cooking the snake and bringing it in to work. The administrative judge found that there was no evidence showing that the appellant was singled out for worse treatment in this regard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the snake incident, the evidence shows that, on July 25, 1987, at a check point, Greg Bates discovered a sign bearing the heading "Attention," which contained a derogatory story about the appellant. A dead cat had been placed beneath the sign. The "story began, "This rare breed of feline was captured around Timbuktu, Mail, near the Niger River flood plain by Border Patrol Agent Dorn [the appellant]." While the dead cat makes this "joke" offensive and certainly contributed to a working environment that no employee, male, or female, should be required to tolerate, this "joke," as insulting as it is, appears to be a mocking reference to the appellant's travels and not a slur based on her sex. Although the administrative judge did not mention this incident in his initial decision, we find that, because the incident occurred approximately two years prior to the appellant's resignation, it is too remote in time to have caused her resignation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserted that she was improperly treated in that she was not promoted to GS-11 positions she had applied for in August 1988 and January 1989, and was suspended for 1 day for accidentally discharging her service revolver in the ladies' room in September 1988. The agency showed that a 1-day suspension was the typical penalty for the improper discharge of a weapon, and it enumerated several valid considerations that were involved in the promotion decision, including seniority, test scores, operational ability and experience, and the like, while the appellant presented little or no testimony on this subject. The administrative judge found that both the suspension and the non-promotions were too remote in time from the appellant's resignation and did not cause her to resign. We agree with this finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also testified that cow dung was repeatedly placed in her mail drawer. In addition, she testified that, in the briefing room, fellow BPAs would occasionally reach into her pocket for a pen, touching her breasts in the process, and laugh. The appellant never reported either of these types of occurrences, even in her 43-page February 5, 1991 affidavit to the EEO investigator, and they are wholly uncorroborated. Two witnesses, BPA Jordan and Supervisory BPA Prather, testified that the appellant was not verbally harassed during briefings. Other than the appellant, none of the witnesses, not even Greg Bates, who married the appellant in 1989, proffered any testimony concerning cow dung or the alleged touching of the appellant's breasts in the briefing room. In fact, the appellant filed an EEO complaint on or about September 5, 1989 in which she complained of poor evaluations, denial of promotions, disciplinary actions, sexual innuendoes, posting of cartoons, and sexual gestures. She did not mention in her complaint either the cow dung or the alleged touching of her breasts during briefings although, obviously, she could have done so. The appellant's failure to mention these incidents prior to filing her petition for appeal discredits her allegations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, as noted above, there are reasons for concluding that the appellant's version of some of these events is not persuasive. Even those events that are corroborated are attributable, not to sex discrimination, but to the daily working environment at the agency's Yuma facility. The overwhelming weight of evidence shows that the Yuma facility was a place where BPAs commonly hazed and harassed each other with juvenile practical jokes, cartoons, and the like. This is simply not disputed. That the appellant was one of the BPAs subjected to this behavior is also not disputed. However, the mere fact that she, as a woman, was subjected to this, does not mean that the complained-of conduct is sex discrimination. In fact, because so many of the male BPAs were subjected to similar conduct, we find that the appellant has not carried her burden of proving that the conduct occurred because of her sex.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no question that BPA Reynolds's sexual assault of the appellant in September 1985 was egregious misconduct. All of the witnesses who testified at the hearing about this incident and about the appellant's 1985 informal EEO complaint resulting from the sexual assault, agreed that Reynolds's misconduct was unacceptable. We find, however, that the complained-of conduct in this appeal is too remote in time from the date of her informal 1985 EEO complaint concerning Reynolds's sexual assault to allow an inference that the conduct constitutes retaliation for her filing of that complaint. In addition, this conduct is too remote in time from the date of the appellant's August 26, 1989 resignation to allow an inference that it formed conditions recently prior to her resignation that "were so difficult that a reasonable person in [her] position would have felt compelled to resign." <span class="Italic">Hurwitz</span>, 61 MSPR at 439; <span class="Italic">see also Smith v. Bath Iron Works Corp.,</span> 943 F.2d 164, 167 (1st Cir. 1991) (where the employee resigned her position six months after the last discriminatory incident, the incident was too remote in time to support a claim of constructive discharge).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These findings do not, however, resolve this appeal. As we stated above, throughout her employment, the appellant's fellow BPAs would consistently interfere with her job-related radio transmissions by various methods. For example, the BPAs would "click" their own radio receivers when the appellant tried to transmit a message, causing static that prevented her messages from going through. Further, the BPAs would often regale the appellant with hoots, "catcalls," insults, laughter, hazing, and the like over the radio when she tried to use it in the performance of her duties. The appellant testified that this behavior over the radio not only embarrassed and humiliated her in that virtually everyone was able to hear it, including the aliens she was apprehending, coworkers, and police officials and others outside the agency who might be listening in on a scanner, but it also hampered her in the performance of her duties and placed her in potential danger because, at times, she was unable to get through to request back-up assistance as needed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserted that virtually all BPAs were subjected to clicking of their radio transmissions. The record is undisputed on this fact and we find that virtually all BPAs were clicked from time to time. The administrative <span id="Page_1974"></span>judge found, however, that the appellant was subjected to <span class="Italic">more</span> radio interference than the other BPAs were. The appellant testified that her radio transmissions were interfered with about 90% of the time. Her testimony was corroborated by several witnesses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One of these witnesses was Karen Clark, a law enforcement communications assistant whose duties are similar to those of a police dispatcher. Clark testified that she monitored radio traffic among the BPAs and that the appellant's radio transmissions were interfered with about 80% of the time. Clark admitted that sometimes BPAs used clicking activity as a way of laughing at each other in good faith or as an acknowledgment for good work in the nature of an "attaboy." However, with the appellant, it was different. The appellant "was being harassed, totally harassed." Clark added that unlike the situation with other agents who "might get one or two [clicks or] it might even be five at the most," with the appellant "it went on and on." She stated that, based on what she heard, the BPAs who clicked the appellant were "absolutely...not" complimenting her, joking with her, or giving her an "attaboy."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Clark further testified that the clicking to which the appellant was subjected was unprofessional and was contrary to the agency's written "net [radio] discipline" policy as set forth in its administrative manual. She stated that, once in a while, a supervisor might admonish BPAs to "cut it out guys," but that was the extent of the agency's attempt to enforce net discipline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">BPA William Buechele also testified that the appellant's radio transmissions were "messed with" frequently, and that, while other BPAs were subjected to some clicking, the appellant got "clicked a lot more often and longer in duration" than they did and the interference with her transmissions was "a little more malicious" than theirs. He expressed his view that the supervisors failed to fulfill their responsibility to control the clicking problem by stating:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The majority of the supervisors probably could not care less, one way or the other. If it doesn't affect them personally, they don't care. As long as they're not going to get in trouble for it, they wipe their hands of it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Buechele also testified that, if he had to put up with the same behavior that the appellant was subjected to, he would have quit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Against this background of constant interference with her radio transmissions, the appellant testified that the pattern of radio clicking culminated in the "last straw" incident on August 3, 1989. On that occasion, the appellant's call for back-up assistance to apprehend three aliens was interrupted in this manner, leaving her to chase and apprehend them by herself. She testified that, upon discussing the matter with her husband, she decided to quit. She explained that she felt unfairly treated because not only was no BPA penalized for his efforts in obstructing her radio call for assistance on that occasion, and not only did Lockwood tell her that it was all in fun and that there was no way to determine who was causing the interference, but also, <span class="Italic">she</span> was reprimanded for having thrown her walkie-talkie radio into the truck (because she was "fed up" with the situation) before setting off on foot to capture the three aliens alone.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has asserted that the appellant was in no real danger on the date at issue, that the radio interference was halted after about 15-30 seconds, and that BPAs were then unable to reach the appellant because she had discarded her radio. While this may have been the case, the appellant had no way of knowing this while in the throes of the immediate situation and in light of the pattern of constant and lengthy radio disruptions nearly every time she attempted to transmit any radio communications. Moreover, such radio interference is clearly hazardous. Lockwood acknowledged that radio clicking is dangerous and can even be life threatening, although he also maintained that a BPA could be expected to single-handedly apprehend up to 10 aliens. Also, a management official stated in a July 31, 1987 memorandum to staff that "[i]nappropriate radio traffic such as 'clicking,' 'cat-calling,' and the like, could very easily occur just at the moment an officer was calling for assistance in a life or death situation." Thus, we find no merit to the agency's after-the-fact opinion that the appellant was not in any danger during the August 3, 1989 incident.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was subjected to clicking behavior so severe that nearly all of her attempts to use the radio were disrupted. Throughout her career, she was subjected to a much higher degree of clicking than other BPAs. The other BPAs effectively rendered futile her attempts to use the radio to the point where a reasonable person would perceive that the appellant could not rely on being able to make necessary radio transmissions in the course of her duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a BPA, the appellant often worked alone and had to be able to rely on the radio to call for assistance. Her law enforcement position was inherently dangerous and she carried a service weapon. It is no great stretch of the imagination to consider that there are times when a BPA's ability to use the radio to call for assistance means the difference, not merely between apprehending or not apprehending undocumented aliens during an illegal border crossing, but between a BPA's own life and death. The constant clicking seriously interfered with the appellant's ability to perform the core duties of her position, and it posed an unreasonable, unnecessary, and unacceptable safety risk to her person.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, although the appellant complained repeatedly about the clicking to her supervisors, the agency took only token actions to control the problem. Indeed, the agency has essentially admitted that its purported attempts to halt radio clicking were not successful. The agency has argued that it was unable to detect which BPAs were guilty of the clicking behavior at issue. This does not suffice to excuse the almost total failure to even try to correct the problem....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employer's remedial action, however, should be reasonably calculated to end the harassment, and it should move beyond counseling to disciplinary action if necessary to obtain that end. <span class="Italic">See Intlekofer v. Turnage,</span> 973 F.2d 773, 777-81 (9th Cir. 1992). The agency's efforts were belated, half-hearted, and ultimately, ineffective. No one was ever disciplined or even threatened with discipline for harassing the appellant. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Intlekofer v. Turnage,</span> 973 F.2d at 780-81 (an agency's failure to impose more harsh discipline when its remedy has been ineffective renders an initial warning an empty threat). Therefore, we find that by its mild and ineffective remedial actions, the agency effectively permitted the continuation of an unreasonably harassing atmosphere. This culminated in the appellant's oral reprimand for the August 3, 1989 incident while no punishment was meted out to the BPAs who had prevented her use of the radio on that night, despite the potential danger to her from their conduct, and despite the fact that she successfully apprehended three illegal aliens alone and on foot.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the agency's argument that all BPAs received harassment, we find that few, if any, details regarding such purported harassment toward other BPAs were presented below. Nor did the agency assert that any other such incidents were "malicious," or potentially life threatening, as was the appellant's August 3, 1989 experience.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the agency argues that the appellant resigned, not because of harassment, but because she obtained a higher-paying job elsewhere. While the administrative judge credited this argument, it is not supported by the evidence. To the contrary, the appellant accepted a <span class="Italic">lower-paying</span> job when she left the agency. In addition, the fact that the appellant applied for another job before her resignation took effect does not rebut the appellant's testimony that she decided to resign and stopped reporting for duty before she found other employment while she was absent on approved sick leave. Moreover, as we have noted, the incident involving the appellant's apprehension of the three aliens occurred August 3, 1989, and inasmuch as the appellant left that same month, her resignation followed reasonably soon thereafter. <span class="Italic">Cf. Smith v. Bath Iron Works Corp.,</span> 943 F.2d 164, 167 (1st Cir. 1991) (to prevail on a sex discrimination claim under a constructive discharge theory, the resignation had to have taken place within a reasonable time after the last incident of discrimination).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">No employee should have to endure such intolerable working conditions day after day, with no recourse in sight, as were described by the appellant herein. Even if other employees were subjected to clicking and the like, neither that, nor the length of time that the appellant remained on the job prior to resigning, in itself, serves to render the working environment reasonably tolerable. <span class="Italic">Cf. Kopp,</span> 13 F.3d at 269 ("Over the course of more than a decade, Albagdadi was abusive to Samaritan employees."). Thus, the agency's argument that the appellant's action in remaining on the job for 5 years shows that the environment was not intolerable, is simply not persuasive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the appellant was effectively coerced into resigning by the continuous and unredressed pattern of harassment, which had escalated to a level potentially endangering her safety when she decided that she "couldn't take it anymore." Because the appellant was left with no reasonable alternative but to leave her place of employment through resignation, we find that she was constructively discharged and that action is REVERSED. <span class="Italic">Heining</span>, 68 MSPR at 522-23.</p>

Cir. 2002 NP) (employee alleging sexual harassment was not forced to resign when management investigated the allegations, assured her that the harasser would not be placed in position of authority over her, repeatedly assured her that she would not be a victim of reprisal, offered her a choice of positions so she would not be at the same location as her harasser, and obtained a military protective order that barred the harasser from having contact with her); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders</span>, 124 S. Ct. 2342 (2004) (considering whether an individual who claims a constructive discharge by reason of sexual harassment must attempt, before bringing a lawsuit, to use internal procedures of the employer to protest the harassment; suggesting through analysis of cases that unless conditions are beyond ordinary discrimination, a complaining employee may be required <span id="Page_1975"></span>to remain on the job while seeking redress); <span class="Italic">Belt v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 113 Fed. Appx. 381, 382 (Fed.

DOJ</span>, 88 Fed. Appx. 404, 407 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP) (resignation was not involuntary that involved harassment that was not excessive, that diminished over time, that was endured even during its most severe periods without the need to resign, when management was helpful although the appellant was not helpful in seeking to reduce the events of harassment, and when the appellant was never directly threatened with harm).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A general statement by a management official that an agency seeks younger scientists is not a basis for finding the resignation of an older scientist, related to a RIF, to be involuntary. The statement by itself is not the type that would coerce resignation. <span class="Italic">Haynes v. USDA</span>, 27 MSPR 537, 540 (1985). An employee may not be unreasonably sensitive to his working environment. <span class="Italic">Rabinovitz v. Pena</span>, 89 F.3d 482, 489 (7th Cir. 1996). "[He] must seek redress while remaining in his job unless confronted with an aggravating situation beyond ordinary discrimination." A resignation is not coerced, and it does not constitute a constructive discharge, if it is submitted by an employee who feels aggrieved by a discriminatory denial of promotion or reemployment rights. Other alternatives exist to protest actions that are discriminatory. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bartel v. FAA</span>, 14 MSPR 24, 36 (1982).
