<h3 class="h3" id="sec5-47"><span class="space">B.</span> DETERMINATION OF AGENCY BUDGET</h3>
<p class="noindent">The Authority considers a "budget" to be a "statement of the financial position of a body for a definite period of time based on detailed estimates of planned or expected expenditures during the period and proposals for financing them." <span class="Italic">AFGE and Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB</span>, 2 FLRA 604, 608 (1980). That formulation was approved in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Red River Depot v. FLRA</span>, 977 F.2d 1490, 1493 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (remanding negotiability proposal to FLRA for clarification of other points).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE and Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB</span>, 2 FLRA 604, 607-08 (1980), discussed the right of management to determine its budget as to a proposal to establish a day care center. FLRA set up a balancing test and allocated the burden of proof, stating that "[o]nly where an agency makes a substantial demonstration that an increase in costs is significant and unavoidable and is not offset by compensating benefits can an otherwise negotiable proposal be found to violate the agency's right to determine its budget under section 7106(a) of the Statute":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The underlying assumption of this position appears to be that a proposal is inconsistent with the authority of the agency to determine its budget within the meaning of section 7106(a)(1) if it imposes a cost upon the agency which requires the expenditure of appropriated agency funds. Such a construction of the Statute, however, could preclude negotiation on virtually all otherwise negotiable proposals, since, to one extent or another, most proposals would have the effect of imposing costs upon the agency which would require the expenditure of appropriated agency funds. Nothing in the relevant legislative history indicates that Congress intended the right of management to determine its budget to be so inclusive as to negate in this manner the obligation to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he agency's authority to determine its budget extends to the determination of the programs and operations which will be included in the estimate of proposed expenditures and the determination of the amounts required to fund them. Under the Statute, therefore, an agency cannot be required to negotiate those particular budgetary determinations. That is, a union proposal attempting to prescribe the particular program or operations the agency would include in its budget or to prescribe the amount to be allocated in the budget for them would infringe upon the agency's right to determine its budget under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, where a proposal which does not by its terms prescribe the particular programs or amounts to be included in an agency's budget, nevertheless is alleged to violate the agency's right to determine its budget because of increased cost, consideration must be given to all the factors involved. That is, rather than basing a determination as to the negotiability of the proposal on increased cost alone, that one factor must be weighed against such factors as the potential for improved employee performance, increased productivity, reduced turnover, fewer grievances, and the like. Only where an agency makes a substantial demonstration that an increase in costs is significant and unavoidable and is not offset by compensating benefits can an otherwise negotiable proposal be found to violate the agency's right to determine its budget under section 7106(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[The] Union Proposal...does not on its face prescribe that the agency's budget will include a specific provision for space and facilities for a day care center or a specific monetary amount to fund them. Furthermore, the agency has not demonstrated that [the union proposal] will in fact result in increased costs. On the contrary, the record is that the matter of the cost to the union for space and facilities is subject to further negotiation. It is not necessary, therefore, to reach the issue of whether the alleged costs are outweighed by compensating benefits....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, it is noted that the agency has not adverted to problems which might arise in connection with implementation and administration of an agreement...<span class="Italic">vis a vis</span> provisions of applicable law and Government-wide rule or regulation governing, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, the use or allocation of space. Therefore, the Authority makes no ruling as to whether [the proposal] is consistent with such law or regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and NRC</span>, 47 FLRA 980, 996-1002 (1993) ("whether the Agency has made a substantial demonstration that this proposal entails an increase in costs that is significant and unavoidable and is not offset by compensating benefits that are of a tangible, monetary nature.")<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The budget analysis was reiterated in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1897 and Dept. of Air Force, Eglin AFB</span>, 24 FLRA 377, 386 (1986), reviewing negotiability of a proposal binding the employer to a certain level of contribution toward the cost of NAF employees' health insurance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also contends that since it has decided to pay 46% of the cost of health insurance premiums for all covered employees, any increase in the employer's share of bargaining unit employee premium payments would require adjustments to other budgetary allocations considering the funding process of NAFIs. Thus, according to the Agency, the proposal has a direct impact on budgetary items and interferes with management's right to determine its budget.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Union's proposal would not directly interfere with the Agency's right to determine its budget. Under the test set forth in...<span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio</span>, 2 FLRA 604 (1980), <span class="Italic">enforced as to other matters</span> <span class="Italic">sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Defense v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 659 F.2d 1140 (D.C. Cir. 1981), <span class="Italic">cert. denied sub nom.</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 455 U.S. 945 (1982), we find that the proposal does not require the Agency to include a particular program or operation in its budget. Employer contributions to the cost of employee health insurance premiums are already included in budgets of the NAFIs....&#8197;The proposal does not directly determine the specific amount which the Agency must allocate to that program. It establishes a percentage of the total premium cost to be absorbed by the Agency. What that percentage means in terms of the amount to be budgeted depends on factors not covered by the proposal, but within the Agency's control, such as total premium cost and number of employees subject to the health insurance program. Furthermore, the Agency has not made a substantial demonstration that the proposal would result in significant and unavoidable costs which are not offset by compensating benefits. The Agency claims that implementation of the Union's proposal would potentially increase the costs of the employer's share of health insurance premiums....&#8197;The Agency does not show, however, that such an increase would be unavoidable or that it would not be offset by compensating benefits.</p>
<p class="noindent">The formulations involving the right of management to set a budget were restated in the context of another case involving the level of contributions toward NAF employees' health insurance premiums, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1857 and Dept. of Air Force, Air Logistics Ctr., Sacramento</span>, 36 FLRA 894, 901-03 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>, the Authority noted that neither the Statute nor the legislative history contains a definition of "budget." The Authority concluded, therefore, that it was appropriate to give the term "budget" its "common or dictionary definition."...&#8197;Using the dictionary definition, the Authority found that an "agency's authority to determine its budget extends to the determination of the programs and operations which will be included in the estimate of proposed expenditures and the determination of the amounts required to fund them."...&#8197;The first budget test stems from this finding. Under the first test, a proposal is negotiable if it "prescribe[s] the particular programs or operations the agency would <span id="page_550"></span>include in its budget or...prescribe[s] the amount to be allocated in the budget for them[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if a proposal does not require that an agency's budget include (1) specified programs or operations, or (2) specified amounts to be allocated to those programs, it may be nonnegotiable under the Authority's second test. The second test is used when an agency claims that a proposal conflicts with its right to determine its budget because the proposal would result in increased costs....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second budget test has three parts.&#x2003;To establish that a proposal interferes with its right to determine its budget, an agency must make a substantial demonstration that the proposal would lead to increased costs that are: (1) significant, (2) unavoidable, and (3) not offset by compensating benefits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the first test, a union may not specify the programs to be included in an agency's budget or the amounts to be allocated to those programs. This test safeguards the agency's right to determine its budget under the literal or dictionary definition of budget.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the dictionary definition of "budget," the right to determine the budget could be limited to the first test. However, the second test was developed to provide an agency with an opportunity to demonstrate that even if a proposal does not explicitly prescribe budget programs or dollar amounts, the proposal is nevertheless nonnegotiable because the proposal would result in unavoidable increased costs of such a magnitude as to implicitly determine the agency's budget. The second test depends on balancing whatever increased costs would unavoidably result from the proposal against the benefits of the proposal to determine whether the "net" costs of the proposal are significant and would, in effect, determine the agency's budget.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's argument that "any increase in costs may disrupt the budget" and that any proposal which requires management "to analyze costs versus expenses" necessarily interferes with the management right to determine budget....&#8197;Most bargaining proposals are subject to analysis for the purpose of determining their "cost" to an agency. The bargaining process inherently involves weighing "costs" against benefits.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to the first budget test, 36 FLRA at 904:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first budget test is a narrow one.&#x2003;It withdraws from bargaining only those proposals addressed to the budget <span class="Italic">per se</span>, not those that would result in expenditures by an agency and, consequently, have an impact on the budget process.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to the second test, 36 FLRA at 904-06:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency projects two sets of specific dollars increases that it contends will result from the proposals.&#x2003;The first set involves projections based on application of the proposal at McClellan Air Force Base. The second set involves projections based on application of the proposal Air Force-wide. These projections do not support a conclusion that the proposals would result in significant and unavoidable cost increases that would not be offset by compensating benefits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Agency has failed to provide any information placing its budget projections in perspective within the budget as a whole. Thus, no basis is presented for establishing that the dollar amounts provided are "significant."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Agency has failed to make a substantial demonstration that all the cost increases that it projects are "unavoidable." For example, the Agency has not provided substantial factual support for its projections of the increases in administrative costs that will result from the proposals. Although the Agency lists various administrative actions involved...and provides conclusions as to the number of hours required to implement the proposals, the Agency provides no details to support the dollar amounts projected for the administrative costs. Moreover, the Agency does not demonstrate that the projected increases could not be offset by (1) modifying the health benefits program, or (2) increasing efficiency in its administrative processes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency has failed to make a substantial demonstration that any cost increases would not be offset by compensating benefits....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he health benefits program does indeed offer compensating benefits to the Agency[,]...reducing absenteeism[,]...increasing productivity [and]...increasing the Agency's ability to attract and retain "the best qualified personnel"....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Ft. Knox Teachers Ass'n and Ft. Knox Dependents Sch.</span>, 28 FLRA 179, 181 (1987), considered a more specific claim that payment of incentive pay to teachers of one school system would interfere with the right of the agency to determine its budget:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency...contends that finding this proposal negotiable would result in a significant increase in costs for the entire dependents school system. Specifically, it states that there are seven additional bargaining units in the dependents school system involving 626 employees with a total salary expenditure of $11.3 million. It reasons that a finding of negotiability in this case would cause other bargaining units to seek negotiations on similar proposals. Thus, it claims that increased costs would be substantial and unavoidable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he information provided by the Agency does not support its claim that cost increases would be significant and unavoidable and not offset by compensating benefits. That is, while the Agency discloses the number of bargaining units, the number of employees in those units and the total salary of those employees, it does not indicate how many of those employees actually would be affected by the proposal or the monetary increases expected to be directly attributable to implementation of the proposal. Rather, the Agency's claim is simply based on an assumption that negotiations in each of the other bargaining units would result in provisions that would entail the most cost. Thus, in our opinion, the Agency has not established what increased costs could be expected or even that increased costs would be unavoidable.</p>
<p class="noindent">An argument advanced by an agency that negotiation of pay for employees would have a substantial, unavoidable impact on its ability to determine its budget and would result in a certain dollar cost was rejected in <span class="Italic">NTEU and NRC</span>, 29 FLRA 217, 222-23 (1987) (rev'd, <span class="Italic">NRC v. FLRA</span>, 879 F.2d 1225 (4th Cir. 1989), <span class="Italic">post</span>). The argument did not satisfy the requirement of a substantial showing that the proposal would result in substantial and unavoidable cost increases not offset by compensating benefits. FLRA added that "where a cost concern prevents parties from reaching agreement during the collective bargaining process, such concerns may be presented to the Federal Service Impasses Panel in a proceeding brought under section 7119 of the Statute to resolve a negotiation impasse." <span class="Italic">NRC</span> was upheld in <span class="Italic">NRC v. FLRA</span>, 859 F.2d 302, 312 (4th Cir. 1988) (salary negotiations that were predicted to increase agency budget by 5-8% did not defeat the right of agency to determine its own budget), but the Fourth Circuit panel decision was set aside when reviewed <span class="Italic">en banc</span>, <span class="Italic">post</span>. <span class="Italic">See Ft. Knox Teachers Ass'n and Ft. Knox Dependents Sch.</span>, 28 FLRA 179, 181 (1987) ("while the Agency discloses the number of bargaining units, the number of employees in those units and the total salary of those employees, it does not indicate how many of those employees actually would be affected by the proposal or the monetary increases expected to be directly attributable to implementation of the proposal"); <span class="Italic">Ft. Bragg Unit of N.C. Ass'n of Educators and Ft.

Bragg</span>, 25 FLRA 1132 (1987). As to specifics, rather than presumptions, that serve to defeat proposals, one decision concluded that a proposal that mandated that funding of incentive or performance awards be set at 1.5% of payroll would directly intrude into the budgetary process. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-144, FUSE and Dept. of Navy, Naval Underwater Sys. Ctr., Newport</span>, 38 FLRA 456, 480 (1990) (Proposals 7 and 10) (discussed in detail relative to proposals concerning incentive and performance awards).</p>
<p class="noindent">In an <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision, the Fourth Circuit, rejected much of FLRA's reasoning that a proposal involving employee pay did not directly affect the NRC budget, <span class="Italic">NRC v. FLRA</span>, 879 F.2d 1225, 1228, 1232-33 (4th Cir. 1989):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The NRC asserts that such a duty to bargain would interfere with the agency's right to determine its own budget....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With certain exceptions not relevant here, an agency..."may not bargain away" its authority to make decisions in those areas specified in &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1), including its authority to determine the agency's budget....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the FLRA contends that the union's salary proposal does not violate the management rights clause because the proposal does not prescribe a specific dollar amount to be allocated in the NRC's budget. According to the FLRA, the union's proposal "merely establishes a formula for adjusting [employee] salaries" and is therefore within the NRC's duty to bargain. We reject this argument. Although the union's salary proposal does not prescribe a specific dollar amount, it does provide a formula which ultimately will dictate a specific dollar amount to be allocated in the NRC's budget each time the Advisory Committee on Federal pay recommends a cost-of-living adjustment to Congress and the President....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This result would significantly affect the NRC's operations. Salaries, and benefits based upon those salaries, constitute more than forty percent of the NRC's annual budget. The union's proposal would vest a third-party with absolute authority to determine salary increases and would require the NRC to somehow absorb unfunded millions of dollars in salary adjustments. While the FLRA contends that the agency has failed to demonstrate that the anticipated increase in costs is significant and not offset by compensating benefits, nothing in the statute requires that this showing be made to the satisfaction of the FLRA. As applied to employee compensation, the FLRA's test makes itself, not the agency, the arbiter of the agency's budget. Congress, however, has vested the NRC with the <span id="page_551"></span>responsibility of balancing employee compensation against the agency's other goals.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA concluded that another proposal, involving profit sharing at a Navy shipyard, did not interfere with the right of the agency to determine its budget. Federal sector bargaining contemplates some expense to the government, and the proposal did not require a particular program or expenditure in the budget. <span class="Italic">FEMTC of Charleston and Charleston Naval Shipyard</span>, 32 FLRA 102, 114 (1988). But the Fourth Circuit decided the proposal concerning profit sharing to be nonnegotiable after it issued the <span class="Italic">NRC</span> decision. In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Charleston Naval Shipyard v. FLRA</span>, 885 F.2d 185 (4th Cir. 1989), the court rejected FLRA's reasoning that the union proposals did not prescribe a particular amount to be allocated for the shipbuilding program, because the exact amount of the yard's profits was speculative and the proposal concerned only the percentage distribution of the profits. The court determined that "even though the dollar figures which would have to be allocated under the Council's proposal are as yet unknown, the proposal completely divests Shipyard managers of discretion and control over the allocation of the profits to be realized. It is this discretion and control over an agency's funding decisions that Congress expressly reserved to managers in 7106(a)(1)<span class="Italic">."</span> The court added that union proposals, "no matter how carefully crafted to avoid specifying dollar amounts today," are improper if "once adopted and implemented...will have the effect of prescribing the use of agency funds in the future."</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1991 FLRA announced that it would not follow the court's <span class="Italic">Charleston Naval Shipyard</span> result. FLRA reasserted its formulation concerning the right of management to establish its budget, setting aside an arbitration award for failure of an arbitrator to apply the governing law correctly. In <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Council 220</span>, 41 FLRA 224, 230-33 (1991), <span class="Italic">rev'd in part</span>, <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA v. FLRA</span>, 983 F.2d 578, 580-81 (4th Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">post</span>, the union grieved the agency's allegedly unilateral change in what amounted to an incentive or "profit-sharing" program (known as the budgetary incentives pilot/gainsharing [BIP/G] program). The agency could not rely on its right to set the budget to defeat the union's right to negotiate over the changes:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Charleston Naval Shipyard</span> [885 F.2d 185 (4th Cir. 1989)], the agency had implemented a profit-sharing bonus plan as an incentive to complete overhaul projects at a lower cost. The plan allocated certain profits as a bonus to employees. Under the agency's plan, 50 percent of the profits would be returned to employees in the form of incentive payments. The union proposed that, instead, 80 percent of the profits would be returned to employees in the form of incentive payments. The Authority, among other determinations, determined that the proposal did not interfere with the agency's right to determine its budget under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. Specifically, the Authority determined that the proposal did not require the agency to establish in its budget any particular program or specified level of funding because the proposal concerned only the distribution of any profit realized from the shipyard projects. In the Authority's view, the budgetary programs had already been established by the agency and were untouched by the proposal. The Authority emphasized that both it and the courts have recognized that the collective bargaining system frequently involves the expenditure of funds and that the Statute was not intended to apply only in circumstances involving no cost to the Government. Consequently, the Authority refused to hold that the proposal was nonnegotiable merely because the proposal contemplated that the agency may be required to expend funds. The Authority also noted that the agency's arguments were based on speculation of what the amount of profit would be.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Charleston Naval Shipyard v. FLRA</span>, the court noted that the Authority determines the negotiability of proposals that allegedly interfere with management's budgetary prerogatives according to a two-prong test set forth in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO and Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio</span>, 2 FLRA 604 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd as to other matters sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of Defense v. FLRA</span>, 659 F.2d 1140 (D.C. Cir. 1981), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 455 U.S. 945 (1982)....&#8197;885 F.2d at 187. Under <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>, in order to establish that a proposal directly interferes with management's right to determine its budget, an agency must demonstrate that the proposal either: (1) prescribes the particular programs to be included in the budget or the amount to be allocated in the budget for those programs; or (2) entails an increase in costs that is significant and unavoidable and is not offset by compensating benefits. The court described the Authority's decision as reasoning that the proposal did not prescribe a particular amount to be allocated for the incentive program because the amount of profits was only speculative and because the proposal only concerned the percentage distribution of the profits. The court stated that, on this basis, the Authority determined that the proposal did not run afoul of the first prong of the test in <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court rejected the Authority's reasoning. The court concluded that, even though the proposals were not phrased in terms of dollar amounts, once the profits became certain, the proposal would dictate a dollar amount. Therefore, the court held that the proposal did run afoul of the first prong of the test in <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> because the proposal would have the effect of prescribing the use of agency funds. The court concluded that the proposal completely divested management of discretion and control over the allocation of the profits to be realized and that it is this discretion and control over agency funding decisions that Congress expressly reserved to managers in section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 188. Because the court found that the proposal prescribed a specific amount to be allocated in the agency's budget and violated prong one, the court reversed the Authority's decision and did not address the Authority's conclusion that the proposal also was not nonnegotiable under the second prong of the budget test. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 187 n.2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted by the Union, the Authority has not adopted the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Charleston Naval Shipyard v. FLRA</span>. With regard to the case before us, we disagree with the court's interpretation and application of section 7106(a)(1) and the first prong of the budget test in <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>. Therefore, we find the award to be deficient because it relies on the court's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>, the Authority noted that whether a proposal directly affects an agency's determination of its budget depends upon the definition of "budget" as used in the Statute. The Authority stated that, in the absence of a definition in the Statute or its legislative history, it was appropriate to give the term its common or dictionary definition. Accordingly, the Authority adopted the dictionary's definition of "budget" as "a statement of the financial position of a body for a definite period of time based on detailed estimates of planned or expected expenditures during the period and proposals for financing them." 2 FLRA at 608. From this definition, the Authority developed its two-prong test for determining whether a proposal directly interferes with management's right to determine its budget.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the first prong of this test, in order for an agency to demonstrate that a proposal directly interferes with management's right to determine its budget, the agency must show either that the proposal prescribes the programs and operations to be included in the agency's budget or prescribes the amount to be allocated for them. We adhere to the interpretation and application of the first prong of the budget test and the established meaning of the term "budget" as interpreted and applied by the Authority in <span class="Italic">Charleston Naval Shipyard</span>. Accordingly, we reject the court's conclusion in <span class="Italic">Charleston Naval Shipyard v. FLRA</span> that an agency's "discretion and control over an agency's funding decisions" equates to management's right to determine its budget pursuant to section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. 885 F.2d at 188.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the Authority's established interpretation of the first prong of the budget test and the established meaning of the term "budget," we find, as the Authority found with respect to the similar proposal in <span class="Italic">Charleston Naval Shipyard</span>, that the distribution formula for gainsharing under the BIP/G program does not prescribe a program to be included in the budget or an amount to be allocated in the budget for a particular program. Consequently, bargaining over the institution of the BIP/G program is not nonnegotiable under the first prong of the budget test. Because the distribution formula for gainsharing does not involve a budgetary program, it is distinguishable from proposals that would prescribe in percentage terms the amount to be allocated in an agency's budget for a particular established budgetary program, such as Proposal 7 in <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R1-144, Federal Union of Scientists and Engineers and U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Underwater Systems Center, Newport, Rhode Island</span>, 38 FLRA 456 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Naval Underwater Systems Center</span>), <span class="Italic">petition for review filed sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Underwater Systems Center, Newport, Rhode Island v. FLRA</span>, No. 91-1045 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 24, 1991). In contrast to <span class="Italic">Charleston Naval Shipyard</span> and this case, Proposal 7 in <span class="Italic">Naval Underwater Systems Center</span> prescribed that 1.5 percent of base aggregate payroll be allocated in the budget for performance awards. Because the proposal clearly prescribed an amount to be allocated for an established budgetary program, we found that the proposal directly interfered with management's right to determine its budget under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute under the first prong of the budget test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the award, in applying <span class="Italic">Charleston Naval Shipyard v. FLRA</span>, conflicts with section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, as we have interpreted and applied management's right to determine its budget. Furthermore, in applying <span class="Italic">Charleston Naval Shipyard</span>, the Arbitrator failed to address the obligation to bargain over procedures and appropriate arrangements under section 7106(b)(2) and (3) when an agency changes conditions of employment that constitutes the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Providence, Rhode Island and Laborers' International Union of North America, Local 1056</span>, 37 FLRA 566, 568-69 (1990) (and cases cited in the decision.) Accordingly, we reject the Arbitrator's application of <span class="Italic">Charleston Naval Shipyard v. FLRA</span> to conclude that there was no bargaining obligation over the institution of the BIP/G program because of the Agency's right to determine its budget under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Supreme Court then decided that presumptions concerning the effect of various proposals on an Agency's budget would not carry the day if agency managers sought to avoid negotiations through the management right <span id="page_552"></span>to determine budget. At least there should be figures concerning the total budget expenditures so that better analysis could be made of the impact of proposals. <span class="Italic">Ft. Stewart Sch. V. FLRA</span>, 110 S. Ct. 2043 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Fourth Circuit returned to reject the FLRA's position and to reaffirm its own in <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA v. FLRA</span>, 983 F.2d 578, 580-82 (4th Cir. 1992) (reviewing the ULP findings of FLRA and an arbitrator), partially setting aside FLRA's decision in <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Council 220</span>, 41 FLRA 224 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In October 1988, the SSA put into effect a "budget incentive pilot/gainsharing program." Under this incentive program, money previously budgeted for specific purposes was reallocated as one lump sum for local managers to allocate at their discretion. Fifty percent of any savings achieved at the work site would be returned to the managers and unit employees in the form of monetary rewards; the remainder would revert to the Social Security Trust Fund. The savings generated each year would be factored into the following year's budget through revised work factors based on the previous year's productivity. The SSA announced that the program would be put into effect unilaterally and refused the Union's request to bargain at the national level.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a grievance claiming that the SSA had violated the parties' national collective bargaining agreement and had committed an unfair labor practice under Title VII. The grievance was submitted to arbitration. The arbitrator denied the grievance, holding that, under this court's decision in <span class="Italic">Navy Charleston Naval Shipyard v. FLRA</span>, 885 F.2d 185, 187 (4th Cir. 1989) (<span class="Italic">Charleston</span>), Title VII does not require federal agencies to negotiate over an employee incentive program based on gainsharing. The arbitrator "was not prepared to conclude 'that negotiation at the national Component level is warranted with respect to a gainsharing program'" such as the SSA had proposed. <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 220</span>, 41 F.L.R.A. (No. 21) 224, 227 (June 13, 1991) (quoting from arbitrator's ruling)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA reversed, holding that: (1) the arbitrator's decision was inconsistent with FLRA precedent; and (2) the arbitrator had failed to address the SSA's obligation to bargain over impact and implementation arrangements as required by &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) &#x0026; (3) when a federal agency changes an employee's conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

(No. 77) 604 (Jan. 31, 1980)...the FLRA developed a two-prong test to determine whether a union proposal interferes with an agency's authority to determine its own budget under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1). Under <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>, a government agency need not negotiate over a union proposal if the agency can show that the proposal either (1) "attempt[s] to prescribe the particular programs or operations the agency would include in its budget or to prescribe the amount to be allocated in the budget for them"; or (2) involves "an increase in costs [that] is significant and unavoidable and is not offset by compensating benefits." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 608.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In the present case, the FLRA applied its precedent to determine that Title VII obligated the SSA to negotiate over its gainsharing proposal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 232. In <span class="Italic">Charleston</span>, however, we specifically disagreed with the FLRA's application of the first prong of the <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> test and held that neither the uncertainty of future profits nor the use of percentages rather than actual dollar amounts lessens the impact on an agency's budgetary prerogative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, as in <span class="Italic">Charleston</span>, the percentage of the SSA's savings to be distributed to its employees will determine the specific allocation of funds to the employees once the savings are realized. Applying <span class="Italic">Charleston</span>, therefore, we find that Title VII does not require the SSA to negotiate with the Union over the formula used for distributing savings realized through the SSA's gainsharing program.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA asks us to reexamine our holding in <span class="Italic">Charleston</span> because of an intervening Supreme Court decision. Specifically, the FLRA points out that the panel in <span class="Italic">Charleston</span> relied upon <span class="Italic">NRC v.

<p class="noindent-1">A decision by a panel of this court, or by the court sitting <span class="Italic">en banc</span>, does not bind subsequent panels if the decision rests on authority that subsequently proves untenable....&#8197;In evaluating the authority of <span class="Italic">Charleston</span>, we must consider whether the portion of <span class="Italic">NRC</span> upon which the panel in <span class="Italic">Charleston</span> relied, namely the interpretation of the language "to determine the...budget" in &#x00A7; 7106(a), is consistent with the Supreme Court's opinion in <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart Schools</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">NRC</span>, a union sought to bargain over a salary proposal for automatic cost of living increases. 879 F.2d at 1227. We held that the NRC did not have to bargain on two alternative grounds: (1) compensation was not a "condition[&#8197;] of employment" under 5 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7102(2); and (2) bargaining over the union's salary proposal would "interfere with the agency's right to determine its own budget" under 5 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1). <span class="Italic">NRC</span>, 879 F.2d at 1228, 1231. On the second point, we reasoned that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Although the union's salary proposal does not prescribe a specific dollar amount, it does provide a formula which ultimately will dictate a specific dollar amount to be allocated in the NRC's budget each time the Advisory Committee on Federal pay recommends a cost-of-living adjustment to Congress and the President....&#8197;The union's salary proposal would thus clearly "affect" the NRC's authority to determine its own budget and is therefore nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 1232. Although we did not explicitly mention <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> in <span class="Italic">NRC</span>, the discussion clearly relates to the first prong of the <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast to our <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">NRC</span>, the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart Schools</span> held that "conditions of employment" includes compensation. 495 U.S. at 647, 110 S. Ct. at 2047. The Court also held that, because the federal agency failed to prove that the compensation proposal would cause significant and unavoidable increases in cost, it had not satisfied the second prong of the <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> test. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 653, 110 S. Ct. at 2050. The Court expressly noted that the agency had not based its challenge to the union proposal in <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart Schools</span> on the <span class="Italic">first</span> prong of the <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> test. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 651, 110 S. Ct. at 2049. That prong of the test, therefore, was not an issue before the Court. Moreover, because neither party challenged the standard set out in the <span class="Italic">second</span> prong of the <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> test, the Supreme Court expressly limited its decision to finding that the agency had failed to meet its burden of proof. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 653 &#x0026; n.3, 110 S. Ct. at 2050 &#x0026; n.3.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart Schools</span> clearly overruled our interpretation of "conditions of employment," it did not challenge our application of the first prong of the <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> test in <span class="Italic">NRC</span>. Thus, that portion of <span class="Italic">NRC</span> germane to our decision in <span class="Italic">Charleston</span>, and to our decision here, is not inconsistent with the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart Schools</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA nevertheless urges us not to follow <span class="Italic">NRC</span> (and, by extension, <span class="Italic">Charleston</span>) because of the Supreme Court's vacatur of our judgment. We have reexamined <span class="Italic">NRC</span> and continue to find its reasoning persuasive. Because we adhere to our interpretation in <span class="Italic">NRC</span> of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1), we find no reason to reexamine our holding in <span class="Italic">Charleston</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Fourth Circuit impliedly agreed, however, in <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA v. FLRA</span>, 983 F.2d 578, 583 (4th Cir. 1992), that the agency had to bargain with the union concerning the impact and implementation of the profit-sharing program.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1993 FLRA again rejected the Fourth Circuit approach toward the budget test, as FLRA reaffirmed its application of the first prong of the <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> test. FLRA's reaffirmation of its past approach arose in the course of a remand from the D.C. Circuit of an FLRA decision finding negotiable a "gainsharing," i.e., incentive pay, proposal discussed in Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-14-476.html#sec6-477">Incentive Pay; Awards</a>," concerning incentive pay proposals. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-52 and Dept. of Army, Red River Depot, Texarkana</span>, 48 FLRA 1198, 1198-1209 (1993), went into considerable detail to explain how the <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> analysis would be applied to proposals claimed by agencies to interfere directly with agency budget authority by purportedly requiring specific budgetary expenditures. The test was in two parts. First, a proposal is nonnegotiable that directly prescribes the substantive composition of the estimates and plans that constitute the budget process. Assuming that the proposal does not run afoul of the first test, a proposal is nonnegotiable if the agency makes a substantial demonstration that an increase in costs is significant and unavoidable and is not offset by compensating benefits. FLRA explained in a decision that contained a succinct explanation of the federal budget process that "it is only when a proposal, by its terms, directly prescribes the substantive composition of the estimates and plans that constitute the budget process that the proposal comes within the ambit of the first part of the budget test":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This matter is before the Authority pursuant to a remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Red River Depot, Texarkana, Texas v. FLRA</span>, 977 F.2d 1490 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">Red River Depot v. FLRA</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our earlier decision in this case, we rejected, among others, the Agency's claim that the proposal at issue, which concerns the establishment of a gainsharing program, directly interferes with its management right to determine its budget under section 7106(a)(1) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute). In reaching this conclusion, we applied the budget test that was first set forth in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO and Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio</span>, 2 FLRA 604, 607-8 (1980) (<span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>). Viewing the proposal against that test, we found that the record in the case did not establish that the proposal directly interfered with management's right to determine its budget because the record did not show that the proposal prescribed a program or an amount to be included in the agency's budget as is required in order to meet the first part of the <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_553"></span>On review of our decision, the court stated that the decision had not "squarely addressed what it means to 'include' something in a budget[.]" <span class="Italic">Red River Depot v. FLRA</span>, 977 F.2d at 1492. Additionally, the court expressed its view that regardless of the approach adopted with respect to that issue, whether the Union's proposal would "pass muster under the <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> test almost certainly depends upon how 'gains' are to be calculated[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. More specifically, the court stated that a conclusion with regard to whether the proposal requires the inclusion in the budget of a particular program or amount might be dependent upon whether or not the Agency retained the ability to adjust the baseline productivity level each year to reflect prior productivity gains. The court remanded the case to the Authority "to clarify what it means to require inclusion of a particular program or amount in [a federal employer's] budget<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. At 1493.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Meaning of the Proposal</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal itself is silent concerning one of the issues raised by the court: namely, how the baseline productivity level will be adjusted each year under the gainsharing program. Some of the Union's statements in its supplemental statement and response to the Agency's clarification concerning the method used to adjust the productivity baseline level in implementing the gainsharing program are confusing. Specifically, the Union makes conflicting representations concerning the existence of a specific formula for making those calculations. At one point the Union states, "[e]ach successive year's gains would form a new baseline of productivity." Elsewhere, the Union states, "In fact, the Union is completely unaware of the baseline formula the [A]gency has used or will use in the future." Nonetheless, the Union emphatically states that under its proposal the Agency retains unilateral authority to adjust the baseline figure used to determine profits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that although it is unclear whether the Union is aware of the specific formula for adjusting the baseline that is contemplated by the Agency, it is clear that the Union disavows any intention of seeking to negotiate either the baseline itself or a formula for determining it. This statement of intent is consistent with the language of the proposal. Thus, for purposes of this decision, we interpret the proposal as not extending to that aspect of the gainsharing program that entails determination of the baseline on which gains will be calculated but, rather, as leaving such determination to the discretion of the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Budget Test</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the court's remand in this case, we take this opportunity to clarify our treatment of the management right to determine budget that is set forth in section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. As the Supreme Court has remarked, an agency's right to determine its budget can "only be understood to refer to the allocation of funds within the agency." <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart Schools v. FLRA</span>, 465 U.S. 641, 653 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Fort Stewart Schools</span>). Early in its history, in its decision in <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>, the Authority set forth a two-part test for determining whether a proposal directly interferes with an agency's right to determine its budget that reflects this understanding. The test also reflects an effort to strike a balance between the obligation to engage in collective bargaining over conditions of employment and the preservation of an agency's right to determine its budget, both of which are among the expressed purposes of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>, the Authority rejected an agency's suggestion that it should accord an expansive meaning to this particular management right based on the Authority's view that a broad interpretation would result in proposals being rendered nonnegotiable simply because they impose a cost on an agency that requires the expenditure of funds. 2 FLRA at 607. In rejecting an expansive meaning in favor of a more limited one, the Authority noted that to one extent or another, most proposals would have the effect of imposing costs on the agency so as to require the expenditure of appropriated agency funds. In its analysis, the Authority observed that the definition of the term "budget" was pivotal to determining whether proposals directly interfered with that particular management right. In the absence of any definition in either the Statute or its legislative history, the Authority concluded that it was appropriate to give the term its common or dictionary definition. The dictionary definition that the Authority relied on was "a statement of the financial position of a body for a definite period of time based on detailed estimates of planned or expected expenditures during the period and proposals for financing them." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 608. The Authority concluded that under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, an agency's authority to determine its budget extends to the determination of the programs and operations that will be included in the estimate of proposed expenditures and the determination of the amounts required to fund them. Thus, under the first part of the test, a proposal that prescribes the particular programs or operations that an agency would include in its budget or prescribes the amount to be allocated in the budget for them would infringe upon the agency's right to determine its budget.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority included a second part in the test for the purpose of addressing proposals that do not by their terms prescribe particular programs, operations, or amounts to be included in an agency's budget, but that are alleged to interfere with an agency's right to determine its budget because of increased costs. The Authority rejected an approach that would base a determination of negotiability on increased cost alone, and adopted instead an approach that would weigh that factor against "such factors as the potential for improved employee performance, increased productivity, reduced turnover, fewer grievances, and the like." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Under the second part of the test that was set forth in <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>, only where an agency makes a substantial demonstration that an increase in costs is significant and unavoidable and is not offset by compensating benefits will the Authority find that an otherwise negotiable proposal interferes with an Agency's right to determine its budget.[1]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;This portion of this test is not at issue in this case. <span class="Italic">See Red River Depot v. FLRA</span>, 977 F.2d at 1492. However, in a recent decision the Authority rejected a union's suggestion that the second part of the budget test be discarded. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission</span>, 47 FLRA 980 (1993) (Chairman McKee dissenting), <span class="Italic">petition for review filed</span>, No. 93-1422 (D.C. Cir. July 1, 1993). In finding that retention of the second part of the test was warranted, the majority stated, "We conclude that the balance struck by the <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> budget tests continues to offer a reasonable solution to the tension that exists between the management rights provisions of the Statute and the promotion of genuine collective bargaining over meaningful issues." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 998. In that decision, the majority stated that while it was retaining the second part of the test, it would no longer consider nonmonetary "intangible" benefits such as positive effects on employee morale in determining whether a proposal met the test. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>, the first part of the budget test was designed to bar from negotiations those proposals that determine directly what the agency's budget will be. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local No. 1 and U.S. Department of the Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span>, 38 FLRA 1589, 1595 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span>). The second part of the test concerns proposals that establish conditions of employment that would impose costs on the agency, but do not determine how those costs will be funded in the agency's budget. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first part of the budget test, which is at issue in this case, is a narrow one. It withdraws from bargaining only those proposals that are addressed to the budget <span class="Italic">per se</span>, not those that would result in expenditures by an agency and, consequently, would have an impact on the budget process....&#8197;As indicated above and as recognized by the court in this case, we adhere to a dictionary definition of "budget." That is, for purposes of applying section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, a budget is an agency's plan as to how it proposes to finance programs and operations during a specified period. We acknowledge that most costs to an agency will have an effect on the agency's budget as they will necessitate the use of funds, which is the focus of a budget. However, the first part of the budget test is limited in scope to the formal process of setting forth programs, operations, and amounts in a financial plan to fulfill the agency's mission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We turn for a moment to the context in which this particular management right applies.&#x2003;Budgets are a common fiscal practice in organizations. In the Federal Government, the President is required by law to prepare budgets of the United States Government and to submit a budget of the United States Government to Congress each year. 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1104-1105. The President is also responsible for proposing appropriations. 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1104. The head of each agency is responsible for preparing and submitting to the President each appropriation request for the agency. 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1108. Under law, agency appropriation requests must be developed from cost-based budgets. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, the determination of agency budgets generally is conducted in conjunction with the centralized budget and appropriations process.[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="page_554"></span>[2]&#x2003;It appears that most agencies in the Federal Government that are covered by the Statute are subject to this process; however, we do not rule out the likelihood that there are exceptions. For example, it is not clear to us to what extent individual agencies that operate on nonappropriated funds are subject to the same procedures as agencies that are dependent on appropriated funds. Where agencies are not subject to the particular process that is described here, it will be incumbent on them, in cases where management's right to determine its budget is an issue, to provide a full record describing their budget process in order to enable us to make a judgment concerning the applicability of the budget test to the fiscal context in which they operate. In this case, there is nothing in the record that indicates that the Agency is not subject to the budget and appropriation process described. In the absence of any indication to the contrary, we assume for purposes of this decision that it is.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has issued OMB Circular No. A-11, which contains instructions addressing the preparation and submission of budget estimates and applies to all agencies of the Government and Government-sponsored enterprises. OMB Circular No. A-11, &#x00A7; 11.1. Pursuant to that Circular, agencies are required to submit various materials to OMB for use in preparing the budget of the United States for submission to Congress. <span class="Italic">See</span> OMB Circular No. A-11, &#x00A7; 10.4. From this material OMB generates data that is reported at the appropriations or fund account level in the budget and aggregated to provide the totals in the President's budget. OMB Circular No. A-11, &#x00A7; 11.4. The President's budget, or the budget of the United States Government, sets forth the President's comprehensive financial plan and indicates the President's priorities for the Federal Government. The President's budget is submitted to Congress, which then enacts appropriations bills that provide authority to spend for specified purposes and other legislation that affects outlays or receipts, such as legislation to amend eligibility requirements for benefit payments or to amend revenue laws. <span class="Italic">See</span> Office of Management and Budget, <span class="Italic">The Budget System and Concepts of the United States Government</span>, 2 (Jan. 1992). The President's budget, as approved or modified through appropriations acts and other laws, "becomes the basis for the financial plan for the operations of each agency during the fiscal year." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The President's budget includes, among other things, individual agency budget estimates that set forth, for each account within the overall agency, appropriations language, various budget schedules, and narrative statements of program and performance. An examination of the budget of the United States Government reveals that the appropriations language and the budget schedules for individual agencies that are presented therein are expressed in relatively gross terms and represent the aggregation of financial estimates for constituent parts such as the organizational components covered by an account and the various goods and services financed. That is, the budget estimate for an agency and the accompanying appropriations language that are incorporated in the overall budget of the United States represent a condensation of more detailed and specific financial planning for that agency that is associated with the development of that estimate. It follows that the determination of the programs, operations, and amounts that will be aggregated and condensed to form the budget estimate contained in the President's budget is an integral part of the budget process. Also, in view of the condensed nature of the budget estimate that is included in the President's budget, it follows that subsequent to the approval of the President's budget, a more detailed statement of the underlying programs, operations, and amounts is necessary in order to provide the agency with a useful plan for funding its operations during the applicable fiscal year.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the first part of the budget test encompasses the specific process that is dedicated to formulating: (1) the budget estimate for an agency that is incorporated in the budget of the United States Government; (2) estimates for funding the operations and programs of an agency that are produced within the agency to provide the groundwork for the budget estimate that is incorporated in the budget of the United States Government; and (3) an agency's plan for allocating funds among its operations and programs once presidential and congressional action on the budget of the United States Government has occurred. Thus, the first part of the budget test removes from bargaining any mandated inclusion of programs, operations, and amounts in the estimates and plans that comprise an agency's budget process. As a practical matter, the first part of the test includes the prescription of the "line items" that will be contained in the budget estimates that are incorporated in the budget of the United States.[3] It also encompasses the prescription of the items and amounts that will be included in the funding estimates and plans that are developed by the agency in conjunction with formulating and executing the budget of the United States.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;"Line item" is a term that is used in the context of the Federal budget process. It is defined by the General Accounting Office as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In executive budgeting, a particular expenditure, such as program, subprogram, or travel costs and equipment....&#8197;In appropriations acts, it usually refers to an individual account or part of an account for which a specific amount is available.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">United States General Accounting Office, Accounting and Financial Management Division, <span class="Italic">A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process, Exposure Draft</span>, 54 (Revised Jan. 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before the court, the Agency urged adoption of an expansive view of the first part of this test. Specifically, the Agency contended that any "'proposal specifying dollar amounts [must be included in the budget because it] leaves management without any choice as to how to use available resources.'" <span class="Italic">Red River Depot v. FLRA</span>, 977 F.2d at 1492. A review of the briefs that were filed with the court in this case shows that the Agency argued that a proposal, although not phrased in terms of an actual dollar amount, nonetheless would directly interfere with management's right to determine its budget if it ultimately would dictate a specific dollar amount, thereby divesting the Agency of discretion and control over its funding decisions. A similar approach has been adopted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services v. FLRA</span>, 983 F.2d 578 (4th Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">DHHS v. FLRA</span>) (holding that a proposal that would have the effect of prescribing the use of agency funds directly interferes with the right to determine budget). We decline to adopt an expansive view of the right to determine the budget of an agency that would bring proposals within the scope of that right simply because they translate into "dollar amounts" of agency financial resources. As we previously have pointed out, most bargaining proposals are subject to analysis for the purpose of determining their "cost" to an agency. If we were to rely on the fact that a proposal entails a cost to the agency or the use of agency funds, without more, as a basis for finding that proposals directly interfere with management's right to determine its budget, the scope of collective bargaining would be sharply curtailed. <span class="Italic">See Air Force Logistics Center, Sacramento</span>, 36 FLRA at 903. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span> (the Court's action in upholding the Authority's decision that a proposal calling for a 13.5 percent salary increase was negotiable suggests that the Court does not view a proposal as inconsistent with management's right to determine its budget simply because it entails some cost to the agency).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is a relationship between establishing conditions of employment that result in a cost to an agency and the determination of its budget in that, as we have noted, budgets by their nature are an exercise in determining how costs will be handled. However, for purposes of the first part of the budget test, negotiating a proposal relating to conditions of employment that could result in a cost to an agency does not equate to the inclusion of a program, operation, or amount in the budget if the proposal, standing alone, does not prescribe that action. Rather, it is only when a proposal, by its terms, directly prescribes the substantive composition of the estimates and plans that constitute the budget process that the proposal comes within the ambit of the first part of the budget test. As an illustration of this distinction, a proposal requiring that an agency pay a specified amount toward health benefits premiums for bargaining unit employees would not be inconsistent with the first part of the budget test. However, a proposal requiring that the agency place a specified amount in its budget for the purpose of funding health benefits premiums for bargaining unit employees would....&#8197;In sum, under this part of the test, a proposal that directly prescribes the items or amounts that will be specified in an agency's plan to fund its programs and operations during a fiscal year interferes with the agency's right to determine its budget.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Application of the Test</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Now we turn to the question of whether the proposal in this case directly interferes with management's right to determine its budget based on the first part of the budget test. As we have discussed above, the proposal does not attempt to determine the baseline figure the Agency will use to calculate the gains to be shared and is silent concerning what, if any, actions must be taken with respect to the budget itself to accommodate the contemplated gainsharing program. Thus, although the proposal defines various details of the gainsharing program, it does not extend to mandating the inclusion of any items or amounts in the Agency's budget. That is, the proposal does not mandate programs, operations, or amounts for inclusion in the Agency's budget estimate that is incorporated in the budget of the United States Government or the estimates and plans that are developed by the Agency in conjunction with formulating and executing the budget of the United States Government.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, this proposal does not prescribe programs, operations, or amounts to be included in the Agency's budget within the meaning of the first part of the <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> budget test. In reaching this conclusion, we have considered the Agency's contention that because it no longer has a gainsharing program, the proposal would require the establishment of one. While the proposal would require the Agency to reestablish gainsharing as an administrative program, the proposal <span id="page_555"></span>does not, by its terms, mandate any budgetary action. In this regard, the establishment of an administrative or operational program does not equate to the establishment of a program within the budget itself. While an agency may choose to structure its budget so that the programs and operations set forth in its budget exactly mirror its administrative and operational programs, it may also choose to structure its budget differently. For example, it may choose to combine funding for several administrative or operational programs into one budgetary program or to divide funding for one administrative or operational program among several budgetary programs. As long as a proposal that entails the establishment of an administrative or operational program leaves the agency with the discretion to determine how any necessary funding will be addressed in its budget, such a proposal is not inconsistent with the first part of the budget test. In any event, as was pointed out in our original decision in this case, the proposal at issue herein operates based on a budget that already has been established and simply involves the distribution of savings that accrue from productivity increases. 41 FLRA at 1066. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DHHS v. FLRA</span>, 983 F.2d at 585 (Murnaghan, J. dissenting) ("The first prong focuses on the <span class="Italic">budget</span> process, not the mere <span class="Italic">use</span> of agency funds <span class="Italic">already</span> budgeted." [Emphasis in original]).</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1993 FLRA modified its formulation of the budget test to discard consideration of any "nonmonetary" or "intangible" benefits that might be gained through proposals for increased agency expenditures.

Ct. 2043 (1990), over the partial dissent of Chairman McKee, FLRA stated that the issue was "whether the Agency has made a substantial demonstration that this proposal entails an increase in costs that is significant and unavoidable and is not offset by compensating benefits that are of a tangible, monetary nature."

FLRA</span>, 659 F.2d 1140 (D.C. Cir. 1981), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 455 U.S. 945 (1982), the Authority established two separate tests for determining whether a proposal conflicts with an agency's right to determine its budget. The Authority held that, in order to establish that a proposal directly interferes with management's right to determine its budget, an agency must demonstrate that the proposal either: (1) provides the particular programs to be included in the budget or the amount to be allocated in the budget for those programs; or (2) entails an increase in costs that is significant and unavoidable and is not offset by compensating benefits. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span> [<span class="Italic">Fort Stewart Schools v. FLRA</span>, 495 U.S. 641 (1990)].</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first budget test in <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> makes nonnegotiable only those proposals that are addressed to the budget <span class="Italic">per se</span>. A proposal will be found to violate an agency's right to determine its budget under the first test if the proposal prescribes the particular programs or operations an agency will include in its budget or prescribes the amount to be allocated in the budget for those programs or operations. Under the second test, a proposal will be found to violate an agency's right to determine its budget if the proposal does not, by its terms, prescribe the particular programs or amounts to be included in an agency's budget but, nevertheless, would result in an increase in costs that is significant and unavoidable and not offset by compensating benefits. <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>, 2 FLRA at 608.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal in this case is not addressed to the budget <span class="Italic">per se</span>. It does not by its terms prescribe the particular programs or amounts to be included in the Agency's budget. Its relationship to, and potential effect on, the budget results from the fact that it entails increased costs to the Agency. Thus, it does not satisfy the first test and is appropriately analyzed under the second test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, both parties have requested that we reconsider the second budget test. The Agency questions whether that test lawfully may include nonmonetary compensating benefits. The Union questions the propriety of using a cost-benefit test to analyze whether a proposal interferes with management's right to determine its budget and urges the Authority to "jettison" the second budget test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In articulating the tests for determining whether a proposal interferes with an agency's right to determine its budget, the Authority rejected a construction of management's right to determine its budget that would foreclose the negotiation of any proposal that imposes a cost on an agency that requires an expenditure of agency funds. <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>, 2 FLRA at 607. The Authority noted that such a construction of the Statute could preclude negotiation of virtually all otherwise negotiable proposals because, to one extent or another, most proposals would have the effect of imposing costs upon the agency that would require the expenditure of agency funds. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Authority stated that "[n]othing in the relevant legislative history indicates that Congress intended the right of management to determine its budget to be so inclusive as to negate in this manner the obligation to bargain." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, the Authority has declined to define "budget" in a manner that is so expansive that all proposals with cost ramifications are rendered nonnegotiable. However, the Authority recognized that proposals may entail costs of such significance that they, in effect, determine the agency's budget. In an effort to strike a balance between rendering all proposals that have any budget impact nonnegotiable and requiring an agency to negotiate over proposals notwithstanding a significant cost, the Authority developed the two <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> budget tests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our dissenting colleague would discard the second test in its entirety.&#x2003;We acknowledge that application of this test involves an examination of the merits of proposals, an approach we have generally avoided when assessing whether proposals directly interfere with other management rights set forth in section 7106. Accordingly, adoption of a test focused solely on whether a proposal addresses an agency's budget <span class="Italic">per se</span> has considerable appeal. Nonetheless, the longevity of the <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> tests and the considerable body of case law that relies on the <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> approach to the budget right provide a compelling counterweight to that appeal. We conclude that the balance struck by the <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> budget tests continues to offer a reasonable solution to the tension that exists between the management rights provisions of the Statute and the promotion of genuine collective bargaining over meaningful issues....&#8197;We find that retention of this balance is warranted. Thus, we will continue to adhere to the two tests that were set forth in <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> and we reject the Union's suggestion that we discard the second test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, in applying the second test, we will heed the admonition of the Court in <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span> and we will not consider "nonmonetary 'intangible' benefits such as the positive effects...on employee morale." <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span>, 495 U.S. at 652. As the Court stated, "it is difficult to see how the Authority could possibly derive a test measured by nonmonetary benefits from a provision that speaks only to the agency's 'authority...to determine...[its] budget,' a phrase that can only be understood to refer to the allocation of funds within the agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 653. On reflection, we agree that it is extremely difficult, at best, to place an objective and reliable monetary value on intangibles such as employee morale. In view of this difficulty, we will no longer require that parties submit information concerning such benefits in order to meet the second budget test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question before us is whether the Agency has made a substantial demonstration that this proposal entails an increase in costs that is significant and unavoidable and is not offset by compensating benefits that are of a tangible, monetary nature. We conclude that, in this case, the Agency has made such a demonstration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts, and the Union does not dispute, that this proposal would cost $56 million for 1991. We are not free of doubt as to the accuracy of this figure....&#8197;However, the Union has raised no questions as to the accuracy of the Agency's cost figures. It asserts only that 1991 is not a representative year.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the absence of any question raised by the Union and any firm basis for questioning the accuracy of the Agency's cost figure on our own, we accept the Agency's assertion that this proposal would cost $56 million for 1991 for purposes of this decision. The Agency asserts that $56 million represents approximately 25 percent of its salary budget for fiscal year 1991 and approximately 12 percent of its entire appropriated budget for that fiscal year. This represents a substantially larger percentage of the Agency's budget than has been established in cases in which the Authority previously has held that costs were not significant for purposes of the budget test. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R4-26 and Department of the Air Force, Langley Air Force Base, Virginia</span>, 40 FLRA 118, 133-34 (1991) (the Authority found that an increase of either 2.34 percent or 5.75 percent in a $7,100,000 budget was not significant); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 3106 and U.S. Department of Agriculture</span>, 21 FLRA 711, 713 (1986) (the Authority found that a claimed increase of 1.7 percent of "the total budget for the T[ick] E[radication] P[rogram]" was not significant); <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 6 and Internal Revenue Service, New Orleans District</span>, 3 FLRA 748, 766 (1980) (the Authority found that a cost representing 1/6 of 1 percent to 1/7 of 1 percent of the total budget for the New Orleans Regional Office was not significant). Based on our previous experience in applying the budget test under the Statute, we conclude that this proposal entails an increase in costs that is significant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because this proposal expressly provides that the required salary increases were to become effective in 1991, there is little, if anything, that the Agency can do to avoid the cost of the proposal for that year....&#8197;While that section allows the Agency to "assert an inability to pay," it still requires the Agency to negotiate with the Union "as to the asserted reasons concerning the alleged inability to pay." There is no assurance that the outcome of these negotiations would permit the Agency to avoid the cost of the proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_556"></span>Section C is limited to authorizing the Agency to seek renegotiation of the pay requirements that are set forth by section A of the proposal when it determines that it has an "inability to pay." Section C does not afford the Agency with a means of accomplishing cost savings while operating within the confines of the pay system that is established by the proposal but, rather, requires that the Agency attempt to obtain an alteration in that established system through subsequent negotiations. In our view, the concept of avoidability relates to the existence of potential measures that an agency can take to minimize or offset cost increases that would otherwise flow from a proposal while operating within the established terms of the proposal. We do not view costs as avoidable simply because an agency may reopen negotiations over the proposal in an attempt to alter the requirements established by the proposal itself....&#8197;The Union's argument that the presence of a section within a proposal that effectively authorizes the Agency to seek renegotiation of the terms of the proposal renders the costs of the proposal avoidable is unpersuasive. We find that, under the circumstances of this case, the cost of the proposal for 1991 is unavoidable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Now, we turn to the question of whether the significance of the cost of the proposal is offset by compensating benefits. The Agency has submitted information to show that the attrition rate (based on separations for any reason) that it experienced from fiscal years 1981 through 1991 ranged between 4.9 percent and 9.82 percent. According to undisputed information submitted by the Agency, the number of grievances filed by Agency employees from fiscal years 1987 through 1991 ranged from 14 to 28 per year. The Agency also states that the percentage of employees rated "outstanding" or "excellent" ran between 61.9 percent to 93.6 percent for fiscal years 1983 through 1990. For fiscal years 1987 through 1990, this percentage ranged from 91.8 percent to 93.6 percent. Based on the information submitted by the Agency, it appears that the potential for tangible, monetary benefits flowing from a reduction in turnover, a lower number of grievances, and improved employee performance and consequent increases in productivity is limited.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency has made a substantial demonstration that this proposal entails an increase in costs that is significant and unavoidable and not offset by compensating benefits.&#x2003;Therefore, we conclude that this proposal directly interferes with the Agency's right under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute to determine its budget and that it is nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NFFE Council of VA Locals and VA</span>, 49 FLRA 923, 936-42 (1994), involved the negotiability of a proposal for a monthly commuter allowance of $21 for drivers of car pools or employees using public transportation. The decision demonstrates the detailed analysis that an agency may be required to provide to substantiate a claim that a proposal interferes with its ability to establish a budget:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>, the Authority set forth a two-part test for determining whether a proposal directly interferes with management's right to determine its budget under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. In that decision, the Authority applied the common or dictionary definition to the term "budget"; that is, "a statement of the financial position of a body for a definite period of time based on detailed estimates of planned or expected expenditures during the period and proposals for financing them." 2 FLRA at 608. The Authority concluded that under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, an agency's authority to determine its budget extends to the determination of the programs and operations that will be included in the estimate of proposed expenditures and the determination of the amounts required to fund them. Under the first part of the test, a proposal that prescribes the particular programs or operations that an agency would include in its budget or prescribes the amount to be allocated in the budget would infringe on the agency's right to determine its budget.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second part of the test addresses proposals that do not by their terms prescribe particular programs, operations, or amounts to be included in an agency's budget, but that are alleged to interfere with an agency's right to determine its budget because of increased costs. The Authority rejected an approach that would base a determination of negotiability on increased cost alone, and adopted instead an approach that would weigh that factor against "such factors as the potential for improved employee performance, increased productivity, reduced turnover, fewer grievances, and the like<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. Under the second part of the test that was set forth in <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>, only where an agency makes a substantial demonstration that an increase in costs is significant and unavoidable and is not offset by compensating benefits will the Authority find that an otherwise negotiable proposal interferes with an agency's right to determine its budget.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;In applying the second part of this test, the Authority no longer considers nonmonetary "intangible" benefits such as positive effects on employee morale in determining whether a proposal has met the test. <span class="Italic">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Recently, we clarified our treatment of the first part of this test in <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees</span>, <span class="Italic">Local R14-52 and U.S. Department of the Army, Red River Depot</span>, <span class="Italic">Texarkana, Texas</span>, 48 FLRA 1198 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Red River Depot</span>) [discussed, <span class="Italic">supra</span>]. In that case we stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">We find that the first part of the budget test encompasses the specific process that is dedicated to formulating: (1) the budget estimate for an agency that is incorporated in the budget of the United States Government; (2) estimates for funding the operations and programs of an agency that are produced within the agency to provide the groundwork for the budget estimate that is incorporated in the budget of the United States Government; and (3) an agency's plan for allocating funds among its operations and programs once presidential and congressional action on the budget of the United States Government has occurred. Thus, the first part of the budget test removes from bargaining any mandated inclusion of programs, operations, and amounts in the estimates and plans that comprise an agency's budget process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 1206.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">There is a relationship between establishing conditions of employment that result in a cost to an agency and the determination of its budget in that, as we have noted, budgets by their nature are an exercise in determining how costs will be handled. However, for purposes of the first part of the budget test, negotiating a proposal relating to conditions of employment that could result in a cost to an agency does not equate to the inclusion of a program, operation, or amount in the budget if the proposal, standing alone, does not prescribe that action. Rather, it is only when a proposal, by its terms, directly prescribes the substantive composition of the estimates and plans that constitute the budget process that the proposal comes within the ambit of the first part of the budget test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1207-8. Thus, the first part of the budget test is limited in scope to the formal process of setting forth programs, operations, and amounts in a financial plan and does not apply to proposals that simply require expenditures by an agency and, consequently, have an impact on the budget process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While Proposal 4 would necessitate an expenditure of funds by the Agency, it does not, by its terms, directly prescribe how any resultant funding requirements will be addressed in the Agency's budget. Also, we reject the Agency's argument that the fact that it currently does not have a "program" for commuter subsidies brings this proposal within the ambit of the first part of the budget test. The proposal does not, by its terms, prescribe the establishment of a program within the budget itself. Even assuming that this proposal requires the Agency to establish a subsidy "program," as we stated in <span class="Italic">Red River Depot</span>, the establishment of an administrative or operational program does not equate to the establishment of a program within the budget itself. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 1209. Indeed, a recent study by the General Accounting Office found that, in practice, agencies that had provided transit benefits to their employees obtained funding from different object classification categories in their existing budgets. Specific object classification categories cited as sources of funding for transit benefits were: "civilian personnel benefits," "personnel compensation," "travel," and "other services." United States General Accounting Office, <span class="Italic">Mass Transit: Federal Participation in Transit Benefit</span> <span class="Italic">Programs</span> 43-44 (September 1993) (<span class="Italic">Mass Transit</span>). As long as a proposal leaves the agency with the discretion to determine how any necessary funding relating to an administrative or operational program will be addressed in its budget, that proposal is not inconsistent with the first part of the budget test. <span class="Italic">Red River Depot</span>, 48 FLRA at 1209. This proposal leaves the Agency discretion in that regard intact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While this proposal would have an effect on the budget process, it does not prescribe the particular programs or operations that the Agency will include in its budget or prescribe the amount to be allocated in the budget for them. Thus, we conclude that, under the first part of the budget test, this proposal does not interfere with management's right to determine its budget.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the second part of the budget test, we find that the Agency has failed to make a substantial demonstration that the proposal would entail an increase in costs that is significant. In making its cost projections, the Agency has provided two sets of figures. One set is based on application of the proposal to the bargaining unit that the Union represents and the second set is based on application of similar provisions to all bargaining units throughout the Agency. The question before us is whether Proposal 4, which is limited to employees who are represented by the particular union that is party to this case, conflicts with the Agency's right to determine its budget. The likelihood that identical provisions would be adopted in all bargaining units throughout the Agency is speculative and would be dependent on factors not present in this case. Such speculation does not provide a valid basis for determining whether this proposal interferes with the Agency's right to determine its budget. Therefore, we find that the projection of the cost that would result from application of identical provisions to all employees in bargaining units throughout <span id="page_557"></span>the Agency does not provide a basis for concluding that this proposal directly interferes with management's right to determine its budget. <span class="Italic">See American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1857 and U.S</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Air Logistics Center, Sacramento</span>, <span class="Italic">California</span>, 36 FLRA 894, 906 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that this particular proposal would result in an annual cost of $3.628 million. However, the Agency has not provided reliable support for this cost projection, which is based on the assumption that all 14,400 employees in the Union's consolidated unit would receive the proposed subsidy. Specifically, we note that in presenting its arguments with respect to Proposal 2, above, the Agency states that the collective bargaining agreement that is the subject of this petition applies to only 2,500 of the employees in the consolidated unit. Based on that figure, the potential cost of the proposal would be considerably less than that specified by the Agency. Additionally, we note that the proposal limits the subsidy to drivers of car pools and van pools and employees who use public transportation. The Agency has presented no support for its assumption that all employees covered by this collective bargaining agreement would fall into one of these three categories. Moreover, the Agency has offered no information as to the current commuting practices of its employees and what changes in those practices realistically might be expected based, for example, on the experience of agencies and employers who have provided similar subsidies. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">for example, Mass Transit</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even accepting, for the sake of argument, the Agency's cost projection at face value, we find that the projected increase in cost is not significant in relation to the Agency's budget. In this regard, the Agency states that $3.628 million represents 6.5 percent of its travel budget for Fiscal Year 1994. The Agency provides only budget figures for travel from nine accounts within its overall budget and has not provided figures for the total obligations or budget authority for those accounts. The Budget of the United States Government reveals that the cumulative total obligations and budget authority for those nine accounts as estimated for Fiscal Year 1994 are each approximately $18 billion. Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 1994, U.S. Government Printing Office 1993. We realize that these figures represent the amount included in the budget that the President submitted to Congress and that they have undergone modification as a consequence of the appropriation process; however, it does not appear that the numbers changed to a degree that alters the significance of the estimated cost of the subsidy. <span class="Italic">See</span> Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-124, 107 Stat. 1275 (1993). It is clear that when compared against the total amounts estimated for the nine accounts, the cost of the subsidy, even if accepted as proffered by the Agency, represents considerably less than 1 percent of the overall amounts for total obligations and budget authority estimated for those accounts as a group.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Comparison of the cost of the proposal against various object classification category totals for the nine accounts in the Agency's budget reveals that the cost equates to 6.5 percent of the total that is provided for travel and considerably less than 1 percent of each of the totals provided for personnel compensation and civilian personnel benefits. When compared to the sums of the amounts for budget authority and total obligations for the nine accounts, the cost represents a small faction [sic] of 1 percent of those sums. We find that a cost of such proportions does not constitute a significant increase in costs. <span class="Italic">See, for example</span>, <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R4-26 and</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Langley Air Force Base, Virginia</span>, 40 FLRA 118, 133-34 (1991) (the Authority found that an increase of either 2.34 percent or 5.75 percent in a $7.1 million budget was not significant); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 3106 and U.S. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Agriculture</span>, 21 FLRA 711, 713 (1986) (the Authority found that a claimed increase of 1.7 percent of "the total budget for the T[ick] E[radication] P[rogram]" was not significant); <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 6 and Internal Revenue Service, New Orleans District</span>, 3 FLRA 748, 766 (1980) (the Authority found that a cost representing 1/6 to 1/7 of 1 percent of the total budget for the New Orleans Regional Office was not significant). <span class="Italic">Compare Nuclear Regulatory</span> <span class="Italic">Commission</span> (Chairman McKee dissenting in relevant part) (the Authority found that an increase in cost that represented approximately 25 percent of the agency's salary budget and approximately 12 percent of the agency's entire appropriated fund budget was significant).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Agency has failed to make a substantial demonstration that Proposal 4 would result in an increase in costs that is significant....</p>
