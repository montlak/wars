<h2 class="h2s" id="pre">PREFACE</h2>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_i"></span>When the holdover appointment for former Chairman DuBester expired in January, Susan Grundmann became FLRA's Chairman. A quorum was not lost. FLRA still issues decisions, but there are fewer of them; the most recent resolve no controversial issues. When fully populated, FLRA decided issues of importance. A few are mentioned here.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On matters involving unit recognition and union status, FLRA reviewed NTEU's petition for rulemaking concerning the intervals for federal employees to revoke voluntary, written assignments of payroll deductions for union dues. FLRA requested public comment on the regulation. No news yet. FLRA declined to reconsider a regional director's acceptance of a union's disclaimer of interest in a 6,000 person bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">DHS ICE and AFGE,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-58.html">73 FLRA 299</a> (2022). Member Grundmann concurred, with reservations; Member Kiko dissented, rightfully criticizing the disclaimer as abnegating unit members' statutory and contractual interests. On April 12, 2022, OPM issued <span class="Italic">Guidance on Implementation of EO 14025: Highlighting Union Rights to Access and Communicate with Bargaining Unit Employees,</span> encouraging agencies to provide unions access to bulletin boards, agency space, and internet websites to post union contact information; to review policies concerning union solicitation of members on nonduty time; and to involve unions in orientation of new employees and town hall events.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Through 2022, FLRA considered interlocutory exceptions from arbitrators' rulings on procedural issues possessed of an outcome-determinative effect, e.g., the timeliness of a grievance, the proper level that the grievance should be presented, whether arbitration was timely invoked or an arbitration hearing timely requested. Determining that its approach was inconsistent with treatment of judicial challenges to arbitration in the private sector, FLRA changed course: it will only consider interlocutory exceptions when the excepting party demonstrates that the arbitrator lacks jurisdiction as a matter of law and when resolution of the exceptions concludes the entire dispute submitted to arbitration. Review of jurisdictional issues--whether an arbitrator is legally barred from hearing a grievance--is <span class="Italic">de novo,</span> without deference to the arbitrator's interpretation. And the exception will be considered only if an excepting party demonstrates that the arbitrator lacks jurisdiction as a matter of law. "It will not be sufficient to merely allege, or even present a 'plausible' claim, regarding legal bars to jurisdiction." When is a grievance barred as a matter of law? Statutory jurisdictional challenges should not be many. 5 USC 7121(c) rules out grievance coverage of Hatch Act matters; disputes over retirement, life insurance, or health insurance; national security suspensions or removals; examinations, certifications, or appointments (as in probationary terminations); and classification of a position that does not result in reduction in grade or pay. Jurisdiction may include employee status (e.g. whether the grievant is in the bargaining unit); whether a statutory remedial election precludes a grievance; whether sovereign immunity bars the remedy sought. <span class="Italic">Army Materiel Command, Redstone Arsenal and NFFE Local 1332,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-70.html">73 FLRA 356</a> (2022).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Increased deference to arbitrators' awards is demonstrated by <span class="Italic">DODDEA and FEA,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-76.html">73 FLRA 398</a> (2022), reconsidering an earlier decision setting aside an arbitrator's timeliness determination, explaining that FLRA would henceforth exercise deferential review of arbitrators' interpretations of contractual procedural requirements, that is--in essence--FLRA will not, under the "essence" exception, second-guess an arbitrator's construction or application of a contract requirement. The <span class="Italic">DODDEA </span>analysis was prompted by <span class="Italic">NWSEO v. FLRA,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20200731295">966 F.3d 875</a> (D.C. Cir. 2020), urging FLRA to adhere in the federal sector to the deferential standard of review by courts of awards in the private sector under the <span class="Italic">Steelworkers' </span>trilogy: "'[a]s long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract'...the Authority may not reverse the arbitrator's award even if [the Authority] is 'convinced [the arbitrator] committed serious error.'"</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Concerning jurisdictional implications of classification issues, <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center, Twentynine Palms and AFGE Local 2018,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-74.html">73 FLRA 379</a> (2022), will reduce disputes over what are, or are not, nongrievable classification matters rather than temporary promotion claims based on contract and legitimately resolved under the grievance process. The nub of FLRA's analysis is: if the substance of a grievance concerns the grade level of the duties permanently assigned to and performed by an employee, the grievance concerns the nongrievable classification of a position within the meaning of &sect; 7121(c)(5); if the substance of the grievance concerns whether the employee is entitled to a temporary promotion under a collective bargaining agreement because the employee has performed the established duties of a higher-graded position, the grievance does not concern position classification.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Matters preliminary to a removal, e.g., the propriety of a PIP, coupled with allegations of a ULP concerning a related bargaining failure, do not make the award reviewable by FLRA if the matter contested relates to an action (e.g., a removal) reviewable by MSPB or the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1998 and Dept. of State, Passport Serv.,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-25.html">73 FLRA 111</a> (2022). <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2338 and Pershing VAMC,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-4.html">73 FLRA 24</a> (2022), involving a constructive removal and an associated ULP claim, was beyond FLRA's exceptions jurisdiction. But if there's been no adverse action taken (a proposed removal is reduced by management to a short suspension), under <span class="Italic">Pershing VAMC and AFGE Local 2338,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-128.html">72 FLRA 662</a> (2022), FLRA will review exceptions to an award involving the proposal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reducing the likelihood of severance in negotiability appeals, under <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1748 and Dept. of Labor, Kansas City,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-48.html">73 FLRA 233</a> (2022), "[w]hen a proposal is outside the duty to bargain, and another proposal is 'inextricably intertwined' with the former proposal, the Authority will dismiss the petition as to both proposals." Increasing the likelihood of impact and implementation negotiation, <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20220201137">25 F.4th 1</a> (D.C. Cir. 2022), vacated an FLRA policy issuance establishing a substantial impact analysis, returning us to the <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>bargaining test. FLRA's <span class="Italic">Guidance </span>on the effect of contract continuance clauses was set aside. Continuance of a contract does not open the door for agency-head review. <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA,</span> 45 F.4th 121 (D.C. Cir. 2022), determined that operation of a continuance clause extending a contract pending negotiation of a successor agreement does not permit a second round of agency-head review and enforcement of conflicting regulations that became effective after the original agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Unions dissatisfied with FSIP decisions cannot directly challenge them. FLRA reaffirmed its reluctance to create an avenue for that review. <span class="Italic">DODDES and FEA Stateside,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-35.html">73 FLRA 149</a> (2022), determined that an arbitrator lacked jurisdiction to consider an objection to a Panel decision. The review scheme is statutory, through a ULP charge against a union for noncompliance. (FLRA pointed out that agencies have filed ULP charges against unions for refusing to comply with Panel orders.)</p>
<p class="Body-Text">FLRA declined to honor an exception to an award that corrected discriminatory staffing practices that violated Title VII and the contract. An arbitrator may lawfully award a remedy directing relief that is provided for by Title VII, notwithstanding interference with a management right. <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons, FCI Memphis and AFGE Local 3731,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-5.html">73 FLRA 26</a> (2022). Averaging of overtime for employees was rejected in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3954 and Bureau of Prisons, FCI Phoenix,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-8.html">73 FLRA 39</a> (2022), remanding for particularized calculations when there was no finding that the agency could not produce records of precise pay for employees at particular facility posts. <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-61.html">73 FLRA 315</a> (2022), explained that arbitrators cannot set shorter time limits for the filing of fee motions than allowed by FLRA decisional law or a collective bargaining agreement. Absent a contrary agreement, the default rule is that an attorney fee request under the Back Pay Act may be filed within a reasonable time after the backpay award becomes final.</p>
