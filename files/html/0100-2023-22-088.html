<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-89"><span class="space">d.</span> Substantial Justification</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Scarborough v. Principi</span>, 124 S. Ct. 1856, 1865-66 (2004), offered Supreme Court commentary on the "substantial justification" criterion of the EAJA in a case that resolved questions concerning amendment of EAJA petitions filed in court:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We turn next to the reason why Congress required the fee applicant to "allege" that the Government's position "was not substantially justified," &#x00A7; 2412(d)(1)(B). Unlike the &#x00A7; 2412(d)(1)(B) prescriptions on what the applicant must <span class="Italic">show</span> (his "prevailing party" status and "eligib[ility] to receive an award" and "the amount sought, including an itemized statement" reporting "the actual time expended and the rate at which fees and other expenses were computed"), the required "not substantially justified" allegation imposes no proof burden on the fee applicant. It is, as its text conveys, nothing more than an allegation or pleading requirement. The burden of establishing "that the position of the United States was substantially justified," &#x00A7; 2412(d)(1)(A) indicates and courts uniformly have recognized, must be shouldered by the Government. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Pierce v. Underwood,</span> 487 U.S. 552, 567 (1988); 108 S. Ct. 2541, 101 L. Ed.2d 490 (1988); <span class="Italic">id</span>., at 575, 108 S. Ct. 2541 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); <span class="Italic">Davidson v. Veneman</span>, 317 F. 3d 503, 506 (C.A.5 2003); <span class="Italic">Lauer</span> v. <span class="Italic">Barnhart</span>, 321 F. 3d 762, 764 (C.A.8. 2003); <span class="Italic">Libas, Ltd. v. United States</span>, 314 F. 3d 1362, 1365 (C.A. Fed. 2003). <span class="Italic">See</span> also H.R. Rep. No. 96-1005, at 10 ("[t]he strong deterrents to contesting Government action that currently exis[t] require that the burden of proof rest with the Government.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress did not, however, want the "substantially justified" standard to "be read to raise a presumption that the Government position was not substantially justified simply because it lost the case...." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. By allocating the burden of pleading "that the position of the United States was not substantially justified"--and that burden only--to the fee applicant, Congress apparently sought to dispel any assumption that the Government pay fees each time it loses. Complementarily, the no-substantial-justification-allegation requirement serves to ward off irresponsible litigation, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, unreasonable or capricious fee-shifting demands....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1988, the Supreme Court discussed the substantial justification requirement of EAJA. Discounting the legislative history previously discussed, and relying on constructions of the phrase "substantial evidence" in the Administrative Procedure Act, <span class="Italic">Pierce v. Underwood</span>, 108 S. Ct. 2541, 2550 (1988), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4622"></span>We are of the view...that as between the two commonly used connotations of the word "substantially," the one most naturally conveyed by the phrase before us here is not "justified to a high degree," but rather "justified in substance or in the main"--that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person....&#8197;To be "substantially justified" means, of course, more than merely undeserving of sanctions for frivolousness; that is assuredly not the standard for Government litigation of which a reasonable person would approve.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;[A] position can be justified even though it is not correct, and we believe it can be substantially (i.e., for the most part) justified if a reasonable person could think it correct, that is, if it has a reasonable basis in law and fact.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pierce</span> rejected as indicators of lack of substantial justification the interest of the government in settling litigation (if there was no examination into the reasons for the settlement), its disposition on the basis of pleadings, and the fact that the government lost the particular case in court (if there was no litigation history involving similar cases). <span class="Italic">Commissioner, INS v. Jean</span>, 110 S. Ct. 2316 (1990), determined that when an EAJA applicant presents a fee application, the substantial justification that is examined concerns the position that the government took in the past, the examination is of the case as a whole rather than "atomized line-items," and that "Congress intended the EAJA to cover the cost of all phases of successful civil litigation addressed by the statute." Interpreting legislative history, <span class="Italic">Schuenemeyer v. United States</span>, 776 F.2d 329 (Fed. Cir. 1985), determined that the mere fact that the government prevails in the lower tribunal does not constitute substantial justification<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Community Heating &#x0026; Plumbing v. Garrett</span>, 2 F.3d 1143, 1145-46 (Fed. Cir. 1993) ("the position of the government is not shown to be substantially justified merely because the government prevailed before a lower tribunal"); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Hitkansut LLC v. United States</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-1884.Opinion.5-1-2020_1580986.pdf">958 F.3d 1162</a>, 1167-68 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (substantial justification is based on the position taken by the government in litigation in the civil action generating the attorney fees, not on its earlier actions or failures to act; pre-litigation facts may be considered when deciding if litigation positions were substantially justified).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Olsen v. Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau</span>, 735 F.2d 558 (Fed. Cir. 1984), considered the standards for EAJA fees, noting first that the Act requires a court to award fees to the prevailing party (other than the United States) in judicial proceedings, "unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust." 28 USC 2412(d)(1)(A). The "position" taken by the government that must have been substantially justified was the position in court rather than at the administrative level, a holding taken from <span class="Italic">Broad Avenue Laundry &#x0026; Tailoring v. United States</span>, 693 F.2d 1387 (Fed. Cir. 1982). One factor considered is whether the lawyers for the government completely and fairly presented the law to the lower tribunal that gave them a favorable result. Additional guidance concerning the application of EAJA may be found in <span class="Italic">Alger v. United States</span>, 741 F.2d 391 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The "substantially justified" standard is one of reasonableness under <span class="Italic">Broad Avenue Laundry</span>. Finding that the government's position in <span class="Italic">Olsen</span> only repeated what was argued in the administrative litigation, the court determined the government's position to be unreasonable. The inference was that the Board's decision was clearly wrong, but the court did not say how it would determine an administrative decision sufficiently indefensible to warrant fees. In a different context, the D.C. Circuit stated in <span class="Italic">Lundin v. Mecham</span>, 980 F.2d 1450, 1459 (D.C. Cir. 1992), that "the 'substantial justification' test applies to both the government action that gave rise to the litigation and to the government's conduct of the litigation."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">EAJA was reenacted in 1985 after a period of <span class="Italic">de facto</span> repeal. Pub. L. 99-80, 99 Stat 183 (1985). The House report accompanying HR 2378, the bill that was passed, stated as to the "substantially justified" language:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another problem which has developed in the implementation of the Act has been the fact that courts have been divided on the meaning of "substantial justification." Several courts have held correctly that "substantial justification" means more than merely reasonable. Because in 1980 Congress rejected a standard of "reasonably justified" in favor of "substantially justified," the test must be more than mere reasonableness.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gavette v. OPM</span>, 785 F.2d 1568, 1578-79 (Fed. Cir. 1986), addressed the EAJA entitlement standard in the 1985 amendments. Concerning the requirement of an award of fees and expenses unless the position of the United States is substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust, the court declared:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Substantial justification" is not defined in the 1980 EAJA. The 1985 amendments, together with the legislative history, clarify the meaning of that term.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The amendments require changes in the Federal Circuit's interpretation of substantial justification in two respects. First, it is now clear that the position of the United States includes the position taken by the agency at the administrative level....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, it is clear that substantial justification is not simply equivalent to reasonableness....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, it is also clear that the EAJA was not intended to be an automatic fee-shifting device in cases where the petitioner prevails before the Federal Circuit....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that "substantial justification" requires that the Government show that it was <span class="Italic">clearly</span> reasonable in asserting its position, including its position at the agency level, in view of the law and the facts. The Government must show that it has not "persisted in pressing a tenuous factual or legal position, albeit one not wholly without foundation." It is not sufficient for the Government to show merely "the existence of a colorable legal basis for the government's case."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts of record here are more than adequate for this court to determine whether the Government's position was substantially justified. In the present case, the Government has failed to show that it was substantially justified in its position. The Government has not shown that the agency was clearly reasonable in refusing to disclose the information sought by Gavette or in failing to certify that no alternative positions were available for reassignment. The Government has failed to show that the Government, including the agency, did not persist in pressing a tenuous factual or legal position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Government also has failed to show special circumstances that would make an award of fees unjust.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gavette</span> returned for <span class="Italic">en banc</span> consideration. <span class="Italic">Gavette v. OPM</span>, 808 F.2d 1456 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The court essentially adopted its earlier opinion as to substantial justification and modified the opinion as to entitlement to expenses, a topic subsequently discussed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The position of the government that must be substantially justified is the government's litigating position, not the merits of the Board's decision reviewed in court. <span class="Italic">Keely v. MSPB</span>, 793 F.2d 1273 (Fed. Cir. 1986). When is the position of the government not substantially justified so as to permit an EAJA award? One looks to the underlying opinion. In <span class="Italic">Beardmore v. USDA</span>, 788 F.2d 1537 (Fed. Cir. 1986), the statutory condition was met. The agency action was characterized by the court as "arbitrary," "beyond the pale of reasonableness," and unsupported by specific, meaningful evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Chiu v. United States</span>, 948 F.2d 711, 714-15 (Fed. Cir. 1991), explained "substantial justification" in a civil service case predating the Reform Act:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">What meaning to ascribe to the statutory language that the "position of the United States" must be "substantially justified" is not readily apparent. As indicated previously, in 1985 the EAJA was amended to clarify the meaning of "position of the United States." Subparagraph (1)(B) of section 2412(d) was revised to read:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Whether or not the position of the United States was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the record <span class="Italic">(including the record with respect to the action or failure to act by the agency upon which the civil action is based)</span> which is made in the civil action for which fees and other expenses are sought. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, subparagraph (2)(D) was added to reflect that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(<span class="Italic">D</span>) "position of the United States," means, in addition to the position taken by the United States in the civil action, the action or failure to act by the agency upon which the civil action was based; except that fees and expenses may not be awarded to a party for any portion of the litigation in which the party has unreasonably protracted the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to this amendment, this court had interpreted the "position of the United States" for purposes of evaluating whether a claimant was entitled to attorney fees to be limited to the position the government took during the litigation phase of the challenged government action....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...However, the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Underwood</span>, 487 U.S. at 565, 108 S. Ct. at 2550, mandated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We are of the view, therefore, that as between the two commonly used connotations of the word "substantially," the one most naturally conveyed by the phrase before us here is not "justified to a high degree," but rather "justified in substance or in the main"--that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, applying the 1985 EAJA amendments to determine whether the overall position of the United States is substantially justified (footnote omitted), trial courts are instructed to look at the entirety of the government's conduct and make a judgment call whether the government's overall position had a reasonable basis in both law and fact.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Chiu</span> was applied in <span class="Italic">Athey v. United States</span>, Fed. Appx. (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP), denying EAJA fees when the government's overall position in Claims Court litigation over pay claims by a group of former federal employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We turn next to Plaintiffs' request for fees under &#x00A7; 2412(d)(1)(A). The trial court denied Plaintiffs' motion after determining the Government's position to have been "substantially justified." <span class="Italic">Athey IV</span>, 149 Fed. Cl. at 510-13. On appeal, Plaintiffs ask us to reweigh the trial court's determination, discounting the issues Plaintiffs consider to have been "minor" or "peripheral" and focusing only on what Plaintiffs call the <span id="Page_4623"></span>"singular 'position'" of the Government&#x2014;i.e., the position regarding the issues on which Plaintiffs ultimately prevailed. We decline Plaintiffs' request to reweigh the trial court's determination based on its view of the entire record, a determination that is reviewed with a significant amount of deference under the abuse of discretion standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When evaluating a claim under &#x00A7; 2412(d), "trial courts are instructed to look at the entirety of the government's conduct and make a judgment call whether the government's overall position had a reasonable basis in both law and fact." <span class="Italic">Chiu</span>, 948 F.2d at 715; <span class="Italic">see also Pierce v. Underwood</span>, 487 U.S. 552, 565 (1988). In making this judgment call, "the entirety of the conduct of the government is to be viewed, including the action or inaction by the agency prior to litigation." <span class="Italic">Chiu</span>, 948 F.2d at 715; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2412(d)(2)(D) (defining "position of the United States"). "When a party has prevailed in litigation against the government, the government bears the burden of establishing that its position was substantially justified." <span class="Italic">Doty v. United States</span>, 71 F.3d 384, 385 (Fed. Cir. 1995), <span class="Italic">as modified</span>, 109 F.3d 746 (Fed. Cir. 1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the trial court agreed with the Government that its overall position was substantially justified largely based on its "string of successes" in paring the case down. <span class="Italic">Athey IV</span>, 149 Fed. Cl. at 513. In particular, the trial court pointed to the Government's success in defending against claims made by Plaintiffs to "night premium pay, weekend additional pay, and Sunday pay after October 1, 1997," back pay for "non-General Schedule employees" (i.e., nurses), as well as "pre-judgment interest under the Back Pay Act." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Athey I</span>, 78 Fed. Cl. 157 (granting motion to dismiss as to those issues)); <span class="Italic">see also Athey III</span>, 908 F.3d 696 (affirming those issues). The Court of Federal Claims determined that this "drumbeat of favorable decisions for the United States on multiple key issues...strongly indicates the United States' position was 'justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.'" <span class="Italic">Athey IV</span>, 149 Fed. Cl. at 513 (quoting <span class="Italic">Pierce</span>, 487 U.S. at 569). Considering the trial court's familiarity with the record before it and the high standard of review applicable here, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in determining that the issues on which the Government won were "key issues"; nor can we say that it abused its discretion in concluding that these wins were sufficient to render the Government's overall position substantially justified such that fees under &#x00A7; 2412(d) are precluded.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Plaintiffs ask us to second guess the trial court's weighing of the relative importance of the issues in determining whether the United States' position was "substantially justified." More specifically, Plaintiffs challenge the trial court's weighing of the COLA and locality increases (issues on which Plaintiffs prevailed), on the one hand, against the night premium pay, weekend pay, Sunday pay, and pre-judgment interest issues (issues on which the Government prevailed), on the other hand. The key piece of evidence Plaintiffs point to in making this argument is their expert's declaration, which estimated monetary values for the various issues and indicated that the two issues on which Plaintiffs prevailed were much more valuable than the issues on which the Government prevailed. The expert's speculation as to the potential monetary values of the issues, even if accurate, cannot substitute for the trial court's judgment in weighing those issues. This required weighing is a highly discretionary task reserved for the trial court, as we described in <span class="Italic">Chiu</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This exercise...is quintessentially discretionary in nature. For instance, whether the government was substantially justified overall where in litigation it depended on the ground of lack of jurisdiction and a party prevails on a substantive aspect of the agency's action which gave rise to the litigation necessarily involves an apples to oranges comparison. It is for the trial court to weigh each position taken and conclude which way the scale tips, and as an appellate court we must be wary not to redistribute these weights among different positions unless a serious error in judgment has been made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">948 F.2d at 715 n.4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Plaintiffs identify no such "serious error in judgment" by the trial court and instead simply ask that we assign more weight to the particular issues on which they prevailed. We exercise our judicial restraint and decline this invitation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The trial court also addressed what it discerned to be "the Class's primary complaints": "(1) the delay in obtaining relief for class members and (2) the failure of the United States to correct the procedures which led to class members failing to receive compensation to which they were entitled." <span class="Italic">Athey IV</span>, 149 Fed. Cl. at 512. On appeal, Plaintiffs do not challenge the trial court's determination on the first concern, calling the "court approved enlargements [of time] irrelevant," Appellants' Reply Br. 12, and thus we do not address it here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the second concern, however, Plaintiffs' reply brief forcefully contests the Government's narrative regarding previous settlement offers. For context, in the Government's response to Plaintiffs' motion for fees at the trial court, the Government countered Plaintiffs' assertions that the United States failed to correct the underpaid back pay by highlighting a previous offer to settle by the Government. This offer was refused by Plaintiffs' counsel. Plaintiffs did not respond to this contention in their reply at the trial court, and the trial court, accordingly, relied on this contention. <span class="Italic">Athey IV</span>, 149 Fed. Cl. at 512-13. Plaintiffs' opening brief on appeal once again raised no issue concerning this contention by the Government or the trial court's reliance thereon. It was only after the Government again relied on this settlement offer in its response brief that Plaintiffs addressed this contention, calling it a "false narrative" because, according to Plaintiffs, the offer related only to a small fraction of the plaintiffs' class.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiffs, however, failed to raise this argument at a time when the Government could have responded, either at this court or at the trial court. And in any case, this issue only relates to the COLAs and locality pay issues on which Plaintiffs were successful, but it in no way diminishes the trial court's view of the importance of the "multiple key issues" that it relied on in finding the Government's position to have been "substantially justified." Therefore, even if we were to credit Plaintiffs' reply argument, Plaintiffs still fail to show the trial court abused its discretion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">Monroe v. United States</span>, Fed. Appx. (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP), required an EAJA determination to be made on the basis of the record as a whole in the litigation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether a government position is substantially justified is measured by looking back at the government's stance throughout the proceedings, including all administrative proceedings related to the civil action, and the government's position is viewed as a whole, with one "threshold determination for the entire civil action to be made." <span class="Italic">Commissioner v. Jean</span>, 496 U.S. 160, 159 (1990). In <span class="Italic">Jean</span>, the Supreme Court emphasized the need for a singular assessment of the government's position in the whole of the case by holding that the government can be unjustified in individual matters and still justified on the inclusive whole of the case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 161-62. Further, "substantially justified" does not mean "justified to a high degree, but rather ‘justified in substance or in the main,'--that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person." <span class="Italic">Pierce v. Underwood</span>, 487 U.S. 552, 565 (1988). More particularly, "a position can be justified even though it is not correct, and...it can be substantially (i.e., for the most part) justified if a reasonable person would think it correct, that is, if it has a reasonable basis in fact and law." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 566, n.2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, when deciding the substantial justification issue, "trial courts are instructed to look at the entirety of the government's conduct and make a judgment call whether the government's overall position had a reasonable basis in both law and fact." <span class="Italic">Chiu v. United States</span>, 948 F.2d 711, 715 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Where an award is ordered, the court's decision that the position of the government was not substantially justified, when appealed as in this case, is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">Pierce v. Underwood</span>, 487 U.S. 552, 557-63 (1988). Abuse of discretion is shown if the court "erred in interpreting the law or exercised its judgment on clearly erroneous findings of material fact," <span class="Italic">Chiu</span>, 948 F.2d at 713, or "make[s] a clear error of judgment in weighing relevant factors." <span class="Italic">DGR Assocs., Inc. v. United States</span>, 690 F.3d 1335, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Our task now is to apply this standard to the decision of the Claims Court that the government's overall position in this case was not substantially justified.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an abbreviated commentary on "substantially justified," <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz v. USPS</span>, 981 F.2d 528, 531 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The government states that when a petitioner seeks attorney fees for an appeal, "[t]he sole issue before the Court is whether the position of the United States regarding the issues presented <span class="Italic">in the appeals in this Court</span> was substantially justified."

Pointing to these cases, the government argues that its litigating position on this appeal was substantially justified. However, this position was rejected by Act of Congress ten years ago. Effective August 5, 1985, Congress acted to clarify the definition of "position of the United States" in the EAJA as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(D)&#x2003;"position of the United States" means, in addition to the position taken by the United States in the civil action, the action or failure to act by the agency upon which the civil action is based; except that fees and expenses may not be awarded to a party for any portion of the litigation in which the party has unreasonably protracted the proceedings;</p>

The following year the Federal Circuit revisited the attorney fee issue <span class="Italic">en banc</span> and explained that, as clarified by the 1985 amendments to the EAJA, the term "position of the United States" refers to the government's position throughout the dispute, including not only its litigating position but also the agency's administrative position. <span class="Italic">Gavette</span>, 808 F.2d at 1467 ("[i]t is now clear that the position of the United States includes the position taken by the agency at the administrative level."). The Supreme Court has also been explicit on this point:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The most telling answer to the Government's submission that it may assert a "substantial justification" defense at multiple stages of an action is the complete absence of any textual support for this position. Subsection (d)(1)(A) refers to an award of fees "in any civil action" without any reference to separate parts of the litigation, such as discovery requests, fees, or appeals. The reference to "the position of the United States" in the singular also suggests that the court need make only one finding about the justification of that position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Jean</span>, 496 U.S. at 158-59, 110 S. Ct. at 2319-20. Quoting the 1985 amendment to the EAJA, the Court rejected the rule that the government now presents:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The fact that the "position" is again denominated in the singular, although it may encompass both the agency's prelitigation conduct and the Department of Justice's subsequent litigation positions, buttresses the conclusion that only one threshold determination for the entire civil action is to be made.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not repeat the discussion in <span class="Italic">Doty v. United States</span> of the lapses of due process, fundamental fairness, and failure to comply with the orders of the Court of Federal Claims. Although the government continues to argue that it should have prevailed on the merits of the appeal, the government has not met its burden under the EAJA. Nor does the government point to any special circumstances that might make the award of attorney fees unjust.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">According to <span class="Italic">Norris v. SEC</span>, 695 F.3d 1261, 1263-66 (Fed. Cir. 2012), a government position, reversed by the court, that was arguable or had some support, was sufficient to deny an EAJA fee petition involving a labor arbitration of an adverse action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Norris was removed from his position as Trial Attorney with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") based on three incidents of misuse of government equipment by sending unauthorized or inappropriate emails. Pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, Norris sought arbitration. Norris did not dispute the charges or that his conduct was improper. He contended, however, that removal was not a reasonable penalty for his actions. Norris urged that a lesser penalty was appropriate, among other things, because his actions were influenced by several personal and family circumstances. Although the arbitrator allowed Norris to introduce evidence related to the improvement of his personal and family circumstances since his removal, he declined to consider that evidence in rendering a decision, explaining that "the issue before [him was] whether [the deciding official's] decision, based upon the facts and circumstances known to her at the time, was within tolerable limits of reasonableness." <span class="Italic">Norris v. SEC</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/11-3129%20order.pdf">675 F.3d 1349</a>, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). On appeal to this court, Norris urged that it was improper for the arbitrator to not consider the post-removal evidence. The government contended that the arbitrator acted properly because, since Board review of penalties is limited to whether the penalty imposed was reasonable, such a determination must be based only on the evidence before the agency at the time of its decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We held that the arbitrator erred in refusing to consider post-removal evidence and vacated the arbitrator's decision, remanding for the arbitrator to "consider the post-removal evidence submitted by Norris" to determine whether the penalty of removal was reasonable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1357. We explained that this holding followed from the fact that Congress required a full evidentiary hearing in appeals to the Board, and thus the Board should consider all relevant evidence introduced, even post-removal evidence, regarding the reasonableness of the penalty. We also recognized that the Board consistently considered post-removal evidence and that we had impliedly decided this issue in one of our decisions, <span class="Italic">Malloy v. United States Postal Service</span>, 578 F.3d 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2009), in which we remanded a case so the Board could consider medical evidence that included a post-removal report from a physician.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Norris now seeks attorneys' fees and expenses under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2412(d) in the amount of $62,863.80 for the fees and costs incurred in relation to his prior appeal. He properly filed his application here in the first instance. Fed. Cir. R. 47.7.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the American rule, attorneys' fees are not awarded to a prevailing party absent explicit statutory authorization. <span class="Italic">Buckhannon Bd. &#x0026; Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dept. of Health &#x0026; Human Res.</span>, 532 U.S. 598, 602 (2001). One such authorizing statute, EAJA, provides that</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2412(d)(1)(A) (emphases added). Under this statute, fees must be awarded if the party seeking the award timely files its application for fees to the court, the applicant is a "prevailing party" in the litigation, the government's position in the case was not "substantially justified," and no special circumstances exist that would make an award unjust. <span class="Italic">Comm'r, I.N.S. v.

One purpose of EAJA was to enable citizens to vindicate their rights against the government, particularly where, due to the government's greater resources and expertise and the limited amount at stake in relation to the cost of litigation, there otherwise would be no effective remedy, even in situations where the government was not justified in its refusal to provide relief. <span class="Italic">See Scarborough v. Principi</span>, 541 U.S. 401, 406 (2004); S. Rep. No. 96-253, at 5 (1979). So too, Congress sought to discourage the government from initiating litigation that was not substantially justified. Congress determined that, because of its unique position, the government must be held to a higher standard in litigation than private parties, both as defendant and plaintiff. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 96-1434, at 21 (1980) ("The Senate bill makes findings that certain named entities may be deterred from seeking review of or defending against unreasonable governmental action because of the expense involved and that because of the greater resources and expertise of the United States the standard for an award of fees against the United States should be different from the standard governing an award against a private litigant in certain situations.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute thus discourages the government from asserting or defending claims where the claim or defense might not be frivolous but nevertheless should not have been brought or defended in the first place. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 96-253, at 6. To meet these goals, the "substantially justified" formula was adopted as an "acceptable middle ground between the mandatory award [of fees to prevailing parties] and the restrictive standard adopted in the Department of Justice draft proposal," which proposed that fees be awarded only where the contested government action was "arbitrary, frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless, or [where] the United States continued to litigate after it clearly became so." S. Rep. No. 96-253, at 2-3; <span class="Italic">see also Gavette v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 808 F.2d 1456, 1465-66 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be substantially justified, the government's position need not be "correct," or even "justified to a high degree." <span class="Italic">Pierce v. Underwood</span>, 487 U.S. 552, 565, 566 n.2 (1988). Instead, the term "substantially justified" means that the government's position was "justified in substance or in the main--that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 565. In other words, in order to be substantially justified, the government's position must be "more than merely undeserving of sanctions for frivolousness" and must instead have "a reasonable basis in law and fact." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 566 &#x0026; n.2; <span class="Italic">see also Chiu v. United States</span>, 948 F.2d 711, 715 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (holding that courts are "to look at the entirety of the government's conduct and make a judgment call whether the government's overall position had a reasonable basis in both law and fact"); H.R. Rep. No. 96-1434, at 22 (1980) (Conf. Rep.) ("The test of whether the government's position is substantially justified is essentially one of reasonableness in law and fact."). Furthermore, in assessing the justification of the government's position, courts consider the clarity of the governing law, that is, whether "judicial decisions on the issue left the status of the law unsettled," <span class="Italic">Nalle v. C.I.R.</span>, 55 F.3d 189, 192 (5th Cir. 1995), and whether the legal issue was novel or difficult. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also Schock v. United States</span>, 254 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2001) ("When the issue is a novel one on which there is little precedent, courts have been reluctant to find the government's position was not substantially justified."). "Put another way, substantially justified means there is a dispute over which 'reasonable minds could differ.'" <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. Free Speech Coal.</span>, 408 F.3d 613, 618 (9th Cir. 2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This standard does not "raise a presumption that the Government position was not substantially justified, simply because it lost the case." <span class="Italic">Broad Ave. Laundry &#x0026; Tailoring v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We are satisfied that the government's position that the arbitrator's review of the penalty imposed should be based only on the evidence before the agency at the time of its decision was "substantially justified," that is, "justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person." <span class="Italic">Pierce</span>, 487 U.S. at 565. First, we find that there was a reasonable basis in law for the government's theory. "It is a well-established rule of civil service law that the penalty for employee misconduct is left to the sound discretion of the agency." <span class="Italic">Miguel v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 727 F.2d 1081, 1083 (Fed. Cir. 1984). In light of this, our cases establish that Board review of an agency's penalty is not <span class="Italic">de novo</span> but only to determine whether the penalty imposed by the agency "did strike a responsible balance within tolerable limits of reasonableness." <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 333 (1981); <span class="Italic">see also Lachance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246, 1256-57 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The government reasonably argued that based on the limited review of penalties made by the Board and the policy concerns of leaving such determinations to the agency, it would follow that Board review should be limited to only the evidence existing before the agency at the time of its decision. Although we ultimately rejected the argument, we explicitly recognized that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[s]ince the Board's review is designed to determine whether the agency's action was reasonable, <span class="Italic">it can be argued that such a determination limits the Board's review to the evidence before the agency at the time of its decision</span>. After all, a court's review of agency action to determine whether it was arbitrary and capricious is typically limited to review of the agency record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Norris</span>, 675 F.3d at 1355-56 (emphasis added). The government's argument was thus based on established precedent and the established policy considerations underlying Board review of penalties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we found that the issue in <span class="Italic">Norris</span> had been "impliedly decided" by <span class="Italic">Malloy</span>, 578 F.3d 1351, we find it relevant that Norris did not cite to <span class="Italic">Malloy</span> in either of his briefs as precedent. This suggests that Norris did not view <span class="Italic">Malloy</span> as controlling, and that <span class="Italic">Malloy</span>'s importance as precedent was not immediately apparent. Indeed, on its face, the decision in <span class="Italic">Malloy</span> was itself not clear, thus leaving room for the government to make a reasonable argument for a contrary result. In short, the government offered a reasonable legal argument on a somewhat "unsettled [and] difficult" issue, <span class="Italic">Nalle</span>, 55 F.3d at 192, "over which reasonable minds could differ," <span class="Italic">Free Speech v. Coal.</span>, 408 F.3d at 618, regarding the scope of Board review.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">How does one compare entitlement standards under EAJA, 5 USC 5596, and 7701(g)?
