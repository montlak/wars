<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-374"><span class="space">e.</span> Veterans Readjustment Act Appointment</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Piirainen v. Dept. of Army</span>, 122 MSPR 194, 197-200 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-12, 2015 MSPB 12 (2015), explained the application of veterans preference to VRA appointments and noted the necessity for application for a VRA position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's claim arises under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A) rather than 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(B). The former section pertains to alleged violations of statutes and regulations relating to veterans' preference, and the latter refers to alleged denials of the right to compete for a position under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). Section 3304(f)(1) applies only where the agency has accepted applications from outside its own workforce, <span class="Italic">see Washburn v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6; 6 (2013), and it is undisputed that the agency in this case did not do so. In fact, the agency did not even advertise the position through a vacancy announcement. HCD (testimony of Human Resources Specialist). Therefore, the appellant's only possible avenue of redress is to prove that the agency violated a law or regulation relating to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">See Isabella v. Department of State</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 333, &#x00B6; 22 (2007) (to prevail on the merits of a VEOA claim under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A), an appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that the agency violated one or more of his statutory or regulatory veterans' preference rights), <span class="Italic">aff'd on req. for recons.</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 453 (2008). The gravamen of the appellant's claim is that the agency should have applied competitive-examining procedures because both he and his coworker were preference-eligible veterans competing for the position. The Board has found that laws governing the competitive-examining process relate to veterans' preference for purposes of VEOA. <span class="Italic">Dean v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-19 (2005), <span class="Italic">aff'd on req. for recons.</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 1 (2006). We find that this is a viable claim and that the appellant would be entitled to relief if he established that the agency was required, but failed, to apply these procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency was not required to apply competitive-examining procedures because the appellant was not "on file" with the agency for the Senior TADSS Instructor position. Specifically, the agency chose to fill this position through its VRA appointing authority, as was its right. <span class="Italic">See Phillips v. Department of the Navy</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 184, &#x00B6; 6 (2008) (an agency has the discretion to fill a vacant position by any authorized method); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.102 (same). OPM's guidance provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Ordinarily, an agency may simply appoint any VRA eligible who meets the basic qualifications requirements for the position to be filled without having to announce the job or rate and rank applicants. However, as noted, Veterans' preference applies in making appointments under the VRA authority. This means that if an agency has 2 or more VRA candidates and 1 or more is a preference eligible, the agency must apply Veterans' preference. Furthermore, an agency must consider all VRA candidates on file who are qualified for the position and could reasonably expect to be considered for the opportunity; it cannot place VRA candidates in separate groups or consider them as separate sources in order to avoid applying preference or to reach a favored candidate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Vet Guide, <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/veterans-services/vet-guide-for-hr-professionals/">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/veterans-services/vet-guide-for-hr-professionals/</a>. With respect to being "on file," OPM's guidance provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A 10-point preference eligible may file a job application with an agency at any time. If the applicant is qualified for positions filled from a register, the agency must add the candidate to the register, even if the register is closed to other applicants. If the applicant is qualified for positions filled through case examining, the agency will ensure that the applicant is referred on a certificate as soon as possible. If there is no immediate opening, the agency must retain the application in a special file for referral on certificates for future vacancies for up to three years.</p>

We agree with the administrative judge that a 10-point preference eligible's application is "on file" if he has submitted it for retention in this "special file" for referral on certificates for future vacancies. Because the appellant did not file his application with the agency, he was not "on file" for purposes of the VRA, and the agency was not required to refer him for consideration for the appointment. Rather, it was entitled to appoint the appellant's coworker by "name request," i.e., by simply appointing him without announcing the job or rating and ranking applicants.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant disagrees with the administrative judge's analysis based on the following provision of OPM's guidance: "if an agency has 2 or more VRA candidates and 1 or more is a preference eligible, the agency must apply Veterans' preference." He argues that he became a "candidate" for the position when the agency reached out to him to solicit his application and that he was "on file" with the agency as a disabled veteran as evidenced by the fact that management was aware that he was a disabled veteran. We disagree because, as explained above, the term "on file" has a specific meaning, which requires that an individual actually file a job application with the agency. Under the appellant's interpretation, the agency would be required to consider every qualified VRA-eligible on its employment rolls in every hiring action regardless of whether they had submitted applications. This is not a reasonable interpretation of the provisions at issue. We find that an individual is only a "candidate" if he has taken the affirmative step to seek a position with the agency by filing an application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's argument that the Vet Guide provisions at issue are invalid because they require the agency to commit a prohibited personnel practice, we find that the appellant did not raise this argument below, and that he has not established a basis for us to consider it for the first time on review. <span class="Italic">See Banks v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 268, 271 (1980) (the Board generally will not consider an argument raised for the first time in a petition for review absent a showing that it is based on new and material evidence not previously available despite the party's due diligence). In any event, the appellant's argument appears to proceed from the premise that he was a candidate on file for the Senior TADSS Instructor position, which, as explained above, is not the case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the selectee and the appellant are in the same preference category under 38 USC 4214, the appellant's nonselection for a VRA appointment does not violate his veterans preference rights, <span class="Italic">Whitney v. Dept. of Army</span>, 92 MSPR 423, 427 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2002):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A VRA appointment is an excepted appointment made after April 8, 1970, to a position otherwise in the competitive service of eligible veterans <span id="Page_722"></span>of the Vietnam era and the post-Vietnam era. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 307.101(d). As relates to such appointments, and contrary to the AJ's statement, the VRA statute does provide that veterans who are entitled to disability compensation under the laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs or whose discharge or release from active duty was for a disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty shall be given a preference for appointment over other veterans. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b)(1)(C). OPM's guidance states that, if an agency has more than one VRA candidate for the same job and one or more is a preference eligible, the agency must apply the veterans' preference procedures prescribed in 5 C.F.R. Part 302 (Employment in the Excepted Service) in making VRA appointments. (Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998, Questions and Answers) and (Vet Guide, Chapter 6). According to those procedures, where, as here, numerical scores are not assigned, preference eligibles having a compensable service connected disability of 10% or more are considered first, followed, second, by other 10-point preference eligibles, third, by 5-point preference eligibles, and, last, by non-preference eligibles. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.304(b)(5)(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the selectee and the appellant are in the same preference category under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214, the appellant has not established a violation of his rights relating to veterans' preference. The result would be the same even if Part 302 applied since the selectee and the appellant are also in the same preference category under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.304(b)(5)(i). In fact, the agency's evidence demonstrates that all three candidates on the preference eligible list, including the selectee, were disabled veterans. The appellant has cited no statute or regulation which affords him superior preference rights to the selectee based on his 30% disabled status, and we are not aware of any.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an appeal with the Board alleging that he was not selected for a GS-7 Contract Specialist position in violation of his veterans' preference rights and as a result of discrimination based on his status as a 30% disabled veteran. He requested a hearing. The administrative judge issued a show-cause order informing the appellant of his burden of proof on the jurisdictional issues under VEOA and USERRA and ordering him to submit evidence and argument regarding these issues. The appellant responded. Without affording the appellant the hearing he requested, the administrative judge issued an initial decision that dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The undisputed record evidence shows that the agency issued a vacancy announcement for a GS-7 Contract Specialist position to be filled noncompetitively. The announcement indicated that the agency would accept applications from various categories of individuals, including 30% disabled veterans, those eligible for a VRA appointment, those eligible under the VEOA, and others not relevant here. The appellant applied as an external candidate under several appointing authorities. He was placed on the certificate of eligibles for 30% disabled veterans, VEOA applicants, and VRA applicants. On the 30% disabled veterans and VRA certificates, he was identified as a 10-point preference, 30% disabled veteran. He was not selected. Instead, the agency selected Jennifer Cera, who is a compensable disabled veteran with a 10-point preference, but who is not 30% disabled. The appointing authority was the VRA, specifically 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 307.103. The appellant filed a complaint with the Department of Labor (DOL) under the VEOA regarding the agency's failure to select him. DOL advised him on April 10, 2003, that it was closing its investigation. The appellant then filed this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the Board lacks jurisdiction under the VEOA because the appellant did not allege facts that would show that, under any statute or regulation, he is entitled to a preference eligibility based on his 30% disabled status superior to the individual selected for the position. He further found that the Board lacks jurisdiction under USERRA because the appellant failed to allege any facts that would demonstrate that his veteran status was a substantial or motivating factor in the determination not to select him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish Board jurisdiction over an appeal brought under the VEOA, an appellant must (1) show that he exhausted his remedy with DOL and (2) make nonfrivolous allegations that (i) he is a preference eligible within the meaning of the VEOA, (ii) the action(s) at issue took place on or after the October 30, 1998 enactment date of the VEOA, and (iii) the agency violated his rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">Abrahamsen v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 377 &#x00B6; 6 (2003). An appellant's allegations of a violation of his veterans' preference rights should be liberally construed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00B6; 9. Here, the appellant showed that he exhausted his remedy with DOL, that he is preference eligible, and that the nonselection took place after October 30, 1998.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged that the agency failed to afford him the proper preference to which he is entitled as a veteran with a 30% disability. He argued that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.304(b)(5)(i) requires the agency to give him preference over 10-point preference eligible applicants whose disability is less than 30%. We find that the appellant made a sufficient allegation that his veterans' preference rights were violated to afford the Board jurisdiction over his appeal. <span class="Italic">See Abrahamsen</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 377 &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, we further find that the appellant did not show that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights when it selected another disabled veteran with a 10-point preference. Under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214, certain veterans are eligible for veterans readjustment appointments. The statute further provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[A] veteran who is entitled to disability compensation under the laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs or whose discharge or release from active duty was for a disability incurred or aggravated in line of duty shall be given a preference for such an appointment over other veterans....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b)(1)(C). Under the Office of Personnel Management's implementing regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.304(b)(5)(i), when an agency does not assign numerical scores to applicants, preference eligibles having a compensable service-connected disability of 10% or more are considered first, followed, second, by other 10-point preference eligibles, third, by 5-point preference eligibles, and, last, by nonpreference eligibles. The agency does not dispute that the appellant is entitled to consideration under the VRA and that he is a compensable disabled veteran entitled to the preference set forth at section 4214(b)(1)(C).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is correct that compensable disabled veterans are entitled to a preference over other 10-point preference eligibles who are not compensable disabled veterans. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309; 2108(3)(C)-(G). Neither the statute nor the regulation, however, requires an agency to consider a 30% disabled veteran over one with at least a 10% disability rating. <span class="Italic">Whitney v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Army</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 423 &#x00B6; 12 (2002). The record shows that the applicant selected, Jennifer Cera, was a compensable 10% disabled veteran with a 10-point preference. Thus, the appellant has not shown that the agency violated his rights under any veterans' preference statute or regulation in selecting Cera rather than him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, we find that the administrative judge erred in dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction under USERRA. In order to establish Board jurisdiction over a USERRA appeal, the appellant must show: (1) performance of duty in a uniformed service of the United States; (2) an allegation of a loss of a benefit of employment; and (3) an allegation that the benefit was lost due to the performance of duty in the uniformed service. <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh v. Department of Justice</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 490 &#x00B6; 7 (2002), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 336 F.3d 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2003). An allegation that an employer took or failed to take certain actions based on an individual's military status or obligations in violation of USERRA constitutes a nonfrivolous allegation entitling the appellant to Board consideration of his claim. <span class="Italic">Tindall v. Department of the Army</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 230 &#x00B6; 9 (1999). Claims of discrimination under USERRA should be broadly and liberally construed in determining whether it is nonfrivolous. <span class="Italic">Lazard v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 337 &#x00B6; 8 (2003). In his appeal, the appellant cited to USERRA and asserted that the agency "discriminat[ed] against (30% Disabled Veteran) [him]." The agency selected a veteran who is not 30% disabled, rather than the appellant or the other 30% disabled veteran on the VRA certificate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, as noted above, the administrative judge found that "the appellant has not demonstrated that [the] agency's failure to select him for the positions in question [was] based on his past military service." This is not the proper standard under which to determine whether the Board has jurisdiction over an appeal. The Board has stated that the weakness of the appellant's assertions in support of his claim is not a basis to dismiss the USERRA claim for lack of jurisdiction and that, rather, if he fails to develop his contentions, his USERRA claim should be denied on its merits. <span class="Italic">Lazard</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 337 &#x00B6; 5. Thus, we find that the administrative judge erred in dismissing this appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Nevertheless, we affirm his finding that the appellant failed to present any evidence to support his allegation of discrimination based on his military status.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency may select a VRA appointee from a group of qualified individuals with veterans preference without distinguishing the degrees of preference, <span class="Italic">Launer v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> DE-3330-11-0188-I-1 (NP 4/30/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly disposed of these arguments <span id="Page_723"></span>below. As noted above, the July 2010 vacancy was a VRA to which the agency may appoint qualified covered veterans without regard to the competitive examining system. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 307.101. As the agency pointed out, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401, it is not required to, and did not, use numerical scores when making this appointment. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Whitney v. Department of the Army</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 423, &#x00B6; 11 (2002). In such a circumstance, the agency must instead make its selection from the highest available preference category, unless there are fewer than three candidates in that category, in which case consideration may be extended to candidates in lower preference categories to ensure the presence of the required three candidates on the list. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency provided evidence indicating that the top three candidates on the referral certificate for the July 2010 vacancy were a 10-point preference eligible with a 30% service-connected disability, a 10-point preference eligible with a non-compensable service-connected disability of less than 10% (the appellant), and a 5-point preference-eligible. Under the "rule of three," once such a certificate is established, the agency may select any one of the highest three eligibles on the certificate. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(a); <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Augustine v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 407, &#x00B6; 11 (2001). Moreover, because, as described above, all three of the individuals on the certificate were preference eligible, the agency did not "pass over" the appellant as he asserts and it was therefore not required to follow the dictates of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b) in order to select another candidate from the referral list. Accordingly, we agree with the administrative judge's decision to deny the appellant's request for corrective action with regard to the July 2010 vacancy.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency properly excluded a temporary employee from consideration for a vacancy that permitted applications from agency employees with career, career-conditional, and excepted appointments under VRA and authorities authorizing employment of disabled persons. "Whether a person has "VRA status," that is, whether they are a veteran with certain employment rights, is a different matter from whether a person with that status is appointed to a job under authority that provides for VRA appointed positions. <span class="Italic">Ruffin v.
