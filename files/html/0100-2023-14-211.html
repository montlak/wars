<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-212"><span class="space">3.</span> Required and Precluded Documentation, Evidence; Expungement of Disciplinary Records</h4>
<p class="noindent">A union could not require negotiations restricting the agency's ability to evaluate employee performance critically if documentation used for reviewing some work was not generated. <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 91 and Dept. of Treasury, IRS Southwest Region</span>, 19 FLRA 647, 648-49 (1985). As to a proposal that, to be valid, a complaint against a unit member must be reduced to writing and the complainant must be identified, the D.C. Circuit concluded in <span class="Italic">POPA v. FLRA</span>, 26 F.3d 1148, 1155 (D.C. Cir. 1994), that the proposal was not a negotiable procedure:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While section 7106(a)(2)(A) preserves management's right to discipline its employees, section 7106(b)(2) permits bargaining over "procedures which management officials of the agency will observe in exercising" those rights. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) (1988). Caselaw holds that a "procedural" proposal is nonnegotiable if it directly interferes with management's disciplinary rights. <span class="Italic">See Customs Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 854 F.2d 1414, 1418 (D.C. Cir. 1988). The Union insists that proposal 27 itself does not interfere with management's rights, relying on the following dicta in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068 (D.C. Cir. 1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If the only procedures that qualify under [section 7106(b)(2)] are those that an agency can violate without fear of a sanction interfering with substantive management rights, then negotiable procedures would seem virtually unenforceable, and paragraph (b)(2) would then lack real content<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1071.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This statement in <span class="Italic">Department of Treasury </span>is true enough, but it cannot be read to condone proposal 27.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The procedure to which the court was referring in <span class="Italic">Department of Treasury </span>was one that required the agency to provide a written performance evaluation to an employee within forty-five days after an evaluation was prepared. If it failed to do so, the evaluation could not be used and any material it contained that might adversely affect an employee's appraisal or rating would have to be destroyed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1070 n.1. The agency complained that the provision interfered with its right to "direct" employees and to "assign work," because the proposal prohibited management from using evaluative information that is not shared with employees within the stipulated time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike the proposal in <span class="Italic">Department of Treasury</span>, which imposed a time-frame within which management had to act in order to use a poor evaluation against an employee, proposal 27 does not simply establish a procedural requirement that, if followed, would permit the agency to make full use of its evidence. Rather, proposal 27 effectively eliminates an entire class of evidence--anonymous source evidence--that the Agency can use in disciplining its employees. Such a proposal violates section 7106(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">See American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1931 v. FLRA</span>, 32 F.L.R.A. 1023, 1047-50 (1988) (finding that a proposal that required statements used or relied upon in adverse actions be in writing and signed by the employee interfered with management's right to make use of many forms of evidence). Thus, the Authority properly recognized that proposal 27 is not merely a procedure for the exercise of managerial rights, but an encroachment on those rights.</p>
<p class="noindent">Proposals were nonnegotiable that statements be written and signed if they were from other employees for the purpose of supporting disciplinary or adverse actions. Under <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1931 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Weapons Station, Concord</span>, 32 FLRA 1023, 1047-48, 1050 (1988), the proposals directly interfered with management's right to discipline because they shielded employees from disciplinary or adverse action if the information possessed by the agency and obtained from other employees was not in the form of signed and written statements. The proposals were not appropriate arrangements because the detriment to management was not outweighed by the union's interest in restricting admission of hearsay evidence--evidence that an adjudicator could discount based upon the form of its submission. Nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1827 and DOD NIMA</span>, 58 FLRA 344, 352 (2003), was Proposal 6-2a, precluding consideration of unwritten criticism of a unit employee by a contractor employee. FLRA "has repeatedly held that blanket restrictions on an agency's use of evidence to support disciplinary action excessively interfere with the right to discipline and do not constitute an appropriate arrangement."</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">NATCA and Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 61 FLRA 341, 346-47 (2005), was Section 3, precluding the agency from relying on "ARMT data" to initiate performance and disciplinary actions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union "acknowledges" that Section 3 "may interfere with a management right[.]" Union Response at 5. The Authority has found that proposals that prevent management from taking action based on certain types of information affect management's right to discipline. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1345</span>, 48 FLRA 168, 199 (1993) (Member Armendariz dissenting, in part and concurring, in part as to other matters). In addition, proposals that prevent management from using certain types of information in support of disciplinary action based on conduct or performance affect the right to discipline. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1709</span>, 56 FLRA 549, 552 (2000) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1709</span>) (proposal precluding an agency from taking disciplinary action based on an employee's performance-related or non-performance related actions identified in an assessment under the agency's quality assurance program affects management's right to discipline); <span class="Italic">Patent Office Prof'l Ass'n</span>, 47 FLRA 10, 63 (1993) (<span class="Italic">POPA</span>) (provision preventing agency from taking disciplinary action because of a complaint from an unidentified source affects management's right to discipline); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3295</span>, 44 FLRA 63, 69 (1992) (proposal precluding the agency from using certain information to affect performance ratings adversely and to support performance-based actions based on those ratings affects management's right to discipline).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As Section 3 of the proposal prevents the Agency from relying on ARMT data to initiate discipline, we find that it affects management's right to discipline under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;Section 3 does not constitute an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a proposal is an appropriate arrangement, the Authority applies the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>). Under that test, the Authority initially determines whether a proposal is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31. An arrangement must seek to mitigate adverse effects "flowing from the exercise of a protected management right." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992). The alleged arrangement must also be sufficiently tailored to compensate or benefit employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NFFE, Local 2015</span>, 53 FLRA 967, 973 (1997). If a proposal is determined to be an arrangement, then the Authority determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the relevant management right. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-33. In doing so, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded to employees under the arrangement against the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that the proposal constitutes an arrangement, we find that it is not appropriate because it excessively interferes with management's right to discipline. In this regard, Section 3 of the proposal absolutely precludes the Agency from initiating discipline when the only evidence of employee misconduct is ARMT data.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that Section 3 is intended to serve as an arrangement whereby "employees would [not] be improperly disciplined or negatively cited for poor performance based on unreliable non-certified ARMT data." According to the Union, Section 3 would not preclude the Agency from taking performance-based discipline against employees because the Agency can rely on "other certified sources [to] support ARMT's non-certified findings." Further, the Union asserts that the Agency would not be precluded from using ARMT data to support discipline based on certified data.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Clearly, Section 3 would benefit employees by preventing the initiation of discipline based solely on non-certified data. However, Section 3 would burden the Agency by restricting its right to discipline employees when ARMT data is the only evidence of misconduct. Even though Section 3 would allow the Agency to use ARMT data to support a finding of wrongdoing initiated on the basis of certified data, this section nonetheless places an absolute restriction on the Agency's right to take disciplinary action based solely on ARMT data. As Section 3 would prohibit the Agency from taking any disciplinary action based solely on ARMT data, the Agency's right to discipline employees would be substantially impaired.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In previous cases, the Authority has found that proposals or provisions that restrict or totally preclude the agency's use of certain information or evidence in disciplining employees excessively interfere with management's right to discipline. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., IAM</span>, 41 FLRA at 1454-56 (proposal that restricts the prior offenses the agency may rely on to enforce its progressive disciplinary system excessively interferes with the <span id="page_775"></span>right to discipline); <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 1931</span>, 32 FLRA 1023, 1047-50 (1988) (provisions that would preclude the agency's use of oral statements, unsigned reports, anonymous information, confidential statements, and similar information at any stage of the disciplinary process excessively interfere with management's right to discipline). Here, Section 3 of the proposal would allow the Agency to use ARMT data to support employee discipline that is initiated on the basis of certified data. However, this section totally precludes the Agency from taking disciplinary action where ARMT data is the only evidence of wrongdoing. Since the Agency is restricted from taking any disciplinary action based on ARMT data, this section places a severe restriction on the type of information the Agency can rely on in disciplining employees, effectively limiting the Agency's discretion to rely on any and all available evidence. As such, the proposal excessively interferes with management's right to discipline and is not an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 900 and Dept. of Army, Army Reserve Personnel Ctr., St. Louis</span>, 46 FLRA 1494, 1510 (1993), was Provision 5, requiring destruction of counselings or admonishments after a year (or after transfer of a supervisor or employee from a current position). The proposal both controlled evidence available to the agency for subsequent disciplinary action and limited the agency's ability to use evidence of prior offenses to sustain current discipline. Relying on <span class="Italic">NAGE and VAMC, Brockton</span>, 41 FLRA 529 (1991), FLRA declined to justify the proposal as an arrangement to balance a violation of a contract clause compelling management to share adverse information with employees. Distinguished in <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 243 and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 49 FLRA 176, 202-03 (1994), was Provision 7, that letters of reprimand be removed from employees' records not later than 18 months from issuance; oral admonishments confirmed in writing were to be removed after three months. The proposal was negotiable. It did not limit management's discretion to impose discipline:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As explained by the Union, this provision requires the removal of written reprimands and written confirmation of oral admonishments only from employee personnel folders after the specified periods. The Union specifically states that this provision does not prevent the Agency from using a previous disciplinary record to determine the appropriate penalty in subsequent discipline. This statement of intent is consistent with the language of the provision and is adopted for purposes of this decision. Thus, we construe the provision as not preventing the Agency from using copies of written reprimands and written confirmation of oral admonishments that are maintained in places other than the employee's personnel folder beyond the time periods set forth in the provision. In this regard, the Agency makes no claim that it is prevented from keeping copies of those documents in locations other than employee personnel folders and there is no evidence in the record of this case to support such a conclusion. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Army Reserve Personnel Center</span>, 46 FLRA at 1510-14 (undisputed portion of Provision 5 required that if counseling or admonishments were reduced to writing, the document would be kept only in the supervisor's employee personnel folder and a copy would be provided to the employee).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals that restrict the prior offenses that an agency can rely on to enforce a progressive disciplinary system directly interfere with management's right to discipline employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for</span> <span class="Italic">example</span>, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1512. Management's right to discipline employees also encompasses the right to obtain and use evidence to support disciplinary actions. <span class="Italic">See, for example, id</span>. Thus, a proposal that requires the destruction of the only written documentation of prior discipline limits an agency's ability to obtain and use evidence in subsequent disciplinary actions and directly interferes with management's right to take disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The provision in this case, unlike Provision 5 in <span class="Italic">Army</span> <span class="Italic">Reserve Personnel Center</span>, does not require the elimination of the only written documentation of prior written reprimands and oral admonishments available to the Agency. Rather, as explained above, the provision requires removal of that documentation only from employee personnel folders. Similarly, this provision is distinguishable from Proposal 2(e) in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Council</span> <span class="Italic">214 and U.S. Department of the Air Force, Air Force Logistics</span> <span class="Italic">Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio</span>, 38 FLRA 309, 313-324 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd as to other</span> matters, 949 F.2d 475 (D.C. Cir. 1991). Proposal 2(e), which required that "Last Chance" or "Pre-Removal" agreements would be cancelled and expunged from employees' personnel records upon completion of the probationary period, was held nonnegotiable to the extent that the proposal would restrict the evidence the Agency could consider to support a subsequent disciplinary action. The record in this case does not support a conclusion that Provision 6 requires the cancellation of the written reprimand or the oral admonishment. Provision 7 is also distinguishable from Proposal 1 in <span class="Italic">United Power Trades Organization and U.S. Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla, Washington</span>, 44 FLRA 1145, 1147-52 (1992).... Proposal 1 established a time limit on the use of prior disciplinary actions to determine the penalty in subsequent discipline and, consequently, directly interfered with management's right to discipline employees. Provision 7 does not establish a time limit on the use of prior disciplinary actions but only requires removal of documentation relating to them from specified files.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that there is no basis for concluding that Provision 7 directly interferes with management's right to discipline employees because the record in this case does not establish that this provision deprives the Agency of all copies of prior written reprimands and oral admonishments confirmed in writing or requires the cancellation of them. Consequently, we conclude that the Agency head's disapproval of Provision 7 must be set aside....</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiable in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1900 and Dept. of Army, Ft. McPherson</span>, 51 FLRA 133, 139-40 (1995), was Provision 6, that "[e]vidence which Management is not permitted to divulge to an employee under the Privacy Act will not be used against the employee unless permitted by law":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Read consistent with the Union's explanation, the provision authorizes the use of certain information (evidence which management is not permitted to divulge to an employee under the Privacy Act) in disciplinary actions, provided the information has been legally obtained and is admissible under "the accepted rules of evidence." The Union has not offered a definition of the phrase "the accepted rules of evidence." Therefore, noting that the Agency does not argue to the contrary, we find it appropriate to conclude that the Union intends the phrase to be defined contextually and to construe "the accepted" rules of evidence as those applicable in whatever proceeding is involved.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 6 thus is distinguishable from proposals or provisions found nonnegotiable by the Authority in previous decisions because they would have restricted an agency's use of materials and documentation as evidence in disciplinary proceedings. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Brockton and West Roxbury, Massachusetts</span>, 41 FLRA 529, 533 (1991). Under Provision 6, as construed herein, admissibility of evidence is determined by whether it was "legally obtained" and by whatever "accepted rules of evidence" apply. The provision itself does not create any restrictions on admissibility--those restrictions derive from what is otherwise legal and consistent with evidentiary rules, and would be applicable without regard to the provision. Accordingly, the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">PTO</span>, 41 FLRA 1349, is misplaced. Provision 1 in that case prevented the Agency from using certain documentation that would be otherwise admissible in a disciplinary or adverse action proceeding. For the reasons discussed above, Provision 6 does not impose such a restriction. As Provision 6 does not prevent the use of any evidence that has been legally obtained and is admissible under whatever rules of evidence apply in a particular disciplinary proceeding, there is no basis on which to conclude that the provision is nonnegotiable as inconsistent with management's right to discipline.</p>
