<h3 class="h3" id="sec13-210"><span class="space">B.</span> ANALYSIS FOR PROHIBITED PRACTICES NOT COVERED BY WPA, WPEA; VIOLATIONS OF 5 USC 2302(b)(9)</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Through 1989, the burden of proof in a prohibited personnel practice case, including whistleblowing reprisal, was defined by Board case law. The Board fashioned that law from legislative history and decisions of the courts concerning cases that evolved under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and other statutes and provisions of the federal constitution. The resulting case law was muddled, but clearly the employee had a tough time proving a prohibited personnel practice. The 1989 amendments to the Reform Act modified the Board's case law governing whistleblower cases under 5 USC 2302(b)(8), but the amendments left intact the case law defining burdens of proof in other prohibited personnel practice cases (including those involving 5 USC 2302(b)(9) (until enactment in 2012 of the WPEA)), in cases concerning OSC disciplinary actions [discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-20-176.html#sec13-168">OSC Disciplinary <span id="Page_4023"></span>Action</a>"], and in appeals involving agencies excluded from the Whistleblower Protection Act, e.g., the Postal Service and employees of nonappropriated fund instrumentalities. Additionally, the 1989 legislation was inapplicable to administrative actions pending on the effective date, July 9, 1989, of the WPA. <span class="Italic">Lundberg v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 382, 385 (1990) (interpreting &#x00A7; 7(b) of the Act and 5 CFR 1201.191(b)(2) (1989)). As a result of the WPA amendments, the case law that follows will apply to reprisal cases other than those involving allegations of whistleblowing ordinarily raised as an affirmative defense, in an IRA appeal, or in an OSC whistleblower reprisal corrective action proceeding. The cases have continuing significance under a WPA analysis, however, to the extent motivational analysis is subsumed by the clear and convincing evidence defense.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to alleged violations of 5 USC 2302(b)(9), the 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act placed some violations of the statute into the analysis of an IRA case, establishing a statutory burden of proof. The legislative history is not clear on the exact scope of the changes brought about by inclusion of some (b)(9) violations. Elucidating litigation will inform the analytical path in the years to come. For the record, under the amended 5 USC 1221:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)(1)&#x2003;Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), in any case involving an alleged prohibited personnel practice as described under section 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D), the Board shall order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate if the employee, former employee, or applicant for employment has demonstrated that a disclosure described under section 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D) was a contributing factor in the personnel action which was taken or is to be taken against such employee, former employee, or applicant. The employee may demonstrate that the disclosure or protected activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure or protected activity; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure or protected activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2) Corrective action under paragraph (1) may not be ordered if, after a finding that a protected disclosure was contributing factor, the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of such disclosure.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the amended 5 USC 1214:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)(3) Except in a case in which an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment has the right to appeal directly to the Merit Systems Protection Board under any law, rule, or regulation, any such employee, former employee, or applicant shall seek corrective action from the Special Counsel before seeking corrective action from the Board. An employee, former employee, or applicant for employment may seek corrective action from the Board under section 1221, if such employee, former employee, or applicant seeks corrective action for a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D) from the Special Counsel and--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)(i) the Special Counsel notifies such employee, former employee, or applicant that an investigation concerning such employee, former employee, or applicant has been terminated; and</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Whatever may be the interpretation placed on (b)(9) violations by decisions of the Board and reviewing courts, the discussion below, likely still relevant, expresses the analysis for pre-WEPA cases.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Given the higher burden of proof on an agency if the appeal and associated affirmative defense of reprisal are covered by the WPA, no harm is done to the appellant if the AJ incorrectly applies the WPA standard of proof--more advantageous to the appellant--and finds no proof of reprisal when the appeal should have been analyzed without regard to the WPA. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Viens-Koretko v. VA</span>, 53 MSPR 160, 163-64 (1992); <span class="Italic">Buster v. VA</span>, 52 MSPR 206, 210 (1992) ("Because we find that the appellant's evidence, which was insufficient under the lower standard of proof, fails to meet the fourth requirement under <span class="Italic">Warren,</span> we conclude that the application of the incorrect standard by the administrative judge does not alter the outcome of this appeal and does not prejudice the rights of either party."); <span class="Italic">Joosten v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 198, 201-02 (1992) (because the Postal Service is not covered by the WPA, an analysis of proof under the IRA standard was not harmful error when the proper analysis was under a more strenuous standard under <span class="Italic">Warren v.

Before the WPEA, if an AJ mischaracterized a case as qualifying for protection under 2302(b)(9) rather than 2302(b)(8), the Board would remand the case for analysis of the "contributing factor" and "clear and convincing" evidentiary standards of the WPA rather than the CSRA standard of whether the agency demonstrated by preponderant evidence that it would have removed the appellant had she not engaged in protected activities. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. NLRB</span>, 59 MSPR 640, 646 (1993).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Crump v. VA</span>, 114 MSPR 224, 228-30 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-13, 2010 MSPB 119 (2010), summarized the appellant's burden of proof as to an affirmative defense under 5 USC 2302(b)(9) (alleged reprisal through a removal for filing an OWCP claim) to an adverse action (<span class="Italic">Crump overruled by Marcell v. VA</span>, 2022 MSPB 33 (2022), determining that retaliation for submission of an FMLA leave request and an OWCP claim were not covered by 5 USC 2302(b)(9), but allowing for possible consideration of the assertion of an affirmative defense in an adverse action under 5 USC 2302(b)(10)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition, the appellant also asserts that the administrative judge erred in failing to take into consideration the injury that resulted in his OWCP claim. He contends that the administrative judge erred in failing to find that the agency removed him in retaliation for filing this claim. Title 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) prohibits any employee who has the authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action, to take any personnel action against any employee "because of[] (A) the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule or regulation; [or] (B) testifying for or otherwise lawfully assisting any individual in the exercise of any right referred to in subparagraph (A)...." To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> violation of subsection (b)(9), the appellant must demonstrate that he engaged in an activity protected by the section; that he was subsequently treated in an adverse fashion by the employer; that the deciding official had actual or constructive knowledge of the protected activity; and that there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Wildeman v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 313, 320 (1984). Where, as here, the agency has already articulated a non-discriminatory reason for its action, i.e., the charged misconduct, it has done everything that would be required of it if the appellant had made out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors v. Aikens</span>, 460 U.S. 711, 715 (1983). Thus, the inquiry proceeds directly to the ultimate question of whether, upon weighing all of the evidence, the appellant has met his overall burden of proving illegal retaliation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, the question to be resolved is whether the appellant has produced sufficient evidence to show that the agency's proffered reason for taking the action was not the actual reason and that the agency intentionally discriminated or retaliated against him. <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502, 507-08 (1993); <span class="Italic">Aikens</span>, 460 U.S. at 714-16; <span class="Italic">Brady v. Office of Sergeant at Arms</span>, 520 F.3d 490, 494 (D.C. Cir. 2008). The evidence to be considered at this stage may include: (1) the elements of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case; (2) any evidence the employee presents to attack the employer's proffered explanations for its actions; and (3) any further evidence of discrimination or retaliation that may be available to the employee, such as independent evidence of discriminatory statements or attitudes on the part of the employer, or any contrary evidence that may be available to the employer. <span class="Italic">Aka v. Washington Hospital Center</span>, 156 F.3d 1284, 1289 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may consider circumstantial evidence in determining whether an appellant has met his burden. <span class="Italic">Wildeman</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. at 320. To show retaliation using circumstantial evidence, the appellant must show that the accused official knew of the protected activity, <span class="Italic">cf. Warren v. Department of the Army</span>, 804 F.2d 654, 656 (Fed. Cir. 1986), and provide evidence showing a "'convincing mosaic'" of retaliation against him, by which a number of pieces of evidence, "'each of which supports a proposition only weakly can, when taken as a whole, provide strong support if all point in the same direction....'" <span class="Italic">FitzGerald v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 666, &#x00B6; 20 (2008) (quoting <span class="Italic">Sylvester v. SOS Children's Villages Illinois, Inc.</span> 453 F.3d 900, 903 (7th Cir. 2006)). This mosaic generally includes three types of evidence: (1) evidence from which an inference of retaliatory intent might be drawn, such as suspicious timing or similar behavior and comments directed at other employees in the protected groups; (2) evidence that similarly situated employees received more favorable treatment than the appellant; and (3) evidence that the reason asserted by the employer for its actions is pretextual. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the record shows that the agency proposed the appellant's removal on July 24, 2006, the day that he returned to a light-duty assignment following an on-the-job injury. At first blush, this evidence suggests possibly suspicious timing between his OWCP claim and his removal. However, as the administrative judge noted, the appellant resigned from his position after the on-the-job injury occurred in November, 2005. The Cemetery Director, Arthur Smith, testified that the agency proposed to remove the appellant upon his return to duty because, prior to that, he was not an employee of the agency and, therefore, not subject to disciplinary action by it. Additionally, the record shows that, in October 2005, prior to the appellant's on-the-job injury, Smith had initiated an investigation into whether the appellant was posing as a Navy Officer in order to receive and use military leave to which the appellant was not entitled. Thus, the timing between the appellant's OWCP claim and the agency's adverse action does not give rise to an inference of discrimination. The appellant presented no evidence that similarly-situated employees were treated better and no evidence that the agency's stated reason for its <span id="Page_4024"></span>action was pretextual. Thus, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant failed to show that the agency removed him in retaliation for his protected activity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf. Walton v. Dept. of Army</span>, CH-0752-15-0550-I-1 (NP 4/27/2023) ("'convincing mosaic' merely describes one type of evidence that, either alone or in combination with other evidence, an appellant may introduce in support of his claim. <span class="Italic">See Pridgen</span>, 2022 MSPB 31, &#x00B6; 24."); <span class="Italic">Marcell v.

<p class="Body-Text">The essential elements of proof of a pre-WPA case presenting an affirmative defense of reprisal were that (1) a protected disclosure was made; (2) the accused official knew of the disclosure; (3) retaliation resulted; and (4) there was a genuine nexus between the retaliation and the employee's removal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dunning v. NASA</span>, 718 F.2d 1170 (D.C. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Mingoia v. USPS</span>, 33 MSPR 169, 173 (1987) (restating the four elements of proof; the record did not show that a supervisor or the deciding official knew of protected testimony in an EEO case; agency officials were not the focus of the testimony; adverse action occurred four years after the protected activity). Analysis of elements three and four constituted analysis of causation. One might wonder how element three of the equation differed from element four, as did the Court of Appeals in <span class="Italic">Warren v. Dept. of Army</span>, 804 F.2d 654 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The court concluded in <span class="Italic">Warren</span> that element three of the test should be that "the adverse action under review could, under the circumstances, have been retaliation." Circuit Judge Nies concurred, stating that she thought that instead of being a test of inference, element three was only a test of timing, i.e., the adverse action occurred after the protected activity. One way or another, the court appeared to be stating that the elements of the prohibited practice are that a disclosure was made, the acting official knew about it, the circumstances suggested that the official acted because of the disclosure, and that it could be concluded, given all the evidence, that the reason for the action was in fact the protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">Haine v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 41 MSPR 462, 472-73 (1989), restated element four of the equation to be that "after careful balancing of the intensity of the motive to retaliate against the gravity of the misconduct, a nexus is established between the adverse action and the motive." The Board added: "The final criterion requires a more searching scrutiny to determine whether there is a genuine nexus and whether the action was taken in retaliation," and that "[t]he appellant has the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse action taken against him."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In subsequent discussion of <span class="Italic">Warren</span>, the Federal Circuit stated in <span class="Italic">Webster v. Dept. of Army</span>, 911 F.2d 679, 689-91 (Fed. Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">reh'g denied</span>, 926 F.2d 1149 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Warren</span> specifically states that the petitioner "has the burden" of establishing the four elements of retaliation. 804 F.2d at 656, quoting <span class="Italic">Hagmeyer</span>, 757 F.2d at 1284; <span class="Italic">see Stromfeld v. Department of Justice</span>, 21 MSPR 428, 431 (1984) (employee has the burden of establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal); <span class="Italic">see also Mortensen v. Department of Army</span>, 27 MSPR 433, 437 (1985); <span class="Italic">Kennedy v. Department of Army</span>, 22 MSPR 190, 193 (1984). Thus, the AJ properly placed the burden on Webster to "meet the test for reprisal." Webster must carry his burden of demonstrating, <span class="Italic">prima facie</span>, that retaliatory motive was a significant causal factor for the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Cf. National Labor Relations Bd. v. Transportation Mgmt. Corp.</span>, 462 U.S. 393, 401 (1983); <span class="Italic">Mount Healthy School Dist. v. Doyle</span>, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977); <span class="Italic">see Stromfeld</span>, 21 MSPR at 431 (burden shifts from the petitioner once all elements of reprisal are established, including "causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action," i.e., nexus).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The burden of demonstrating a "nexus" between "the retaliation and petitioner's removal," <span class="Italic">Warren,</span> 804 F.2d at 656, ultimately involves establishing a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action, as the Board correctly phrased it in <span class="Italic">Stromfeld</span>, 21 MSPR at 431.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor is the burden too onerous. Petitioner is not required to produce direct evidence of the deciding official's intent, but only evidence from which the AJ can properly infer that the retaliatory motive caused the adverse action<span class="Italic">. Warren</span>, 804 F.2d at 657, quoting <span class="Italic">In re Frazier</span>, 1 MSPR 163, 193 (1979). Because direct evidence, such as an explicit admission, rarely is available, the Board has accurately noted, "in almost all situations (the causal connection) must be inferred from circumstantial evidence." <span class="Italic">McClellan v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 19 MSPR 237, 239 (1984); <span class="Italic">See Frazier</span>, 1 MSPR at 194. If, for example, Webster had offered evidence of other employees at his postal facility who engaged in comparable conduct but received more lenient sanctions, the AJ could have found nexus was established<span class="Italic">. See Stromfeld</span>, 21 MSPR at 432 (Employee attempted to show that other employees "committed more serious acts of misconduct than he and were either not disciplined or less severely disciplined.") Webster would be likely to know of any disparate disciplinary action taken, or indeed not taken, against similarly situated fellow workers who engaged in comparable conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the record before us, however, petitioner offered no such evidence. The AJ did not find that Webster's protected activities caused the adverse action and we cannot say this record, as a matter of law, requires such an inference of nexus.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ did find that "the intensity of the agency's retaliatory motive was high." He then weighed the high intensity retaliatory motive against the gravity of the misconduct. Although he found that retaliatory motive "could" have been a factor, he did not find that the retaliatory motive was a factor in Webster's removal. Retaliatory motive does not, <span class="Italic">ipso facto</span> require a finding of causation. The dissent glosses over this important distinction between "could have been" (element 3) and "was" (element 4), but it is dispositive of this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Properly construed, the <span class="Italic">Warren</span> test is not met by demonstrating that a retaliatory motive "could have" been the cause of the adverse action. That merely meets element three of the affirmative defense of reprisal. The third element can be met, for example, by showing that the removing official might well have resented the protected activity as where it reflected poorly on him. Conversely, if the adverse action preceded the protected activity, one cannot conclude the former "could have been" the cause of the latter. Once the third element of the reprisal defense is met, however, the petitioner must still persuade the AJ of nexus, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, causation in fact.... We cannot reverse because on this record any such inference, even if permissible, certainly was not mandatory.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Webster</span> reverted to analysis of what an imaginary untainted supervisor would have done about the appellant's misdeeds. The concept of the imaginary untainted supervisor had been offered, without much analysis, in <span class="Italic">Warren</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 804 F.2d 654, 659 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Judge Nies criticized the "imaginary supervisor" analysis in her dissenting opinion in <span class="Italic">Webster</span>. She suggested the law governing reprisal analysis was muddled by the efforts of the Board and the circuit. As to the analysis of the theoretical supervisor, she stated, 911 F.2d at 697:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question then arises: <span class="Italic">What</span> must an agency prove to demonstrate that the adverse action would have been taken absent the retaliatory motive? It is not sufficient merely to hypothesize whether an imaginary unprejudiced supervisor, <span class="Italic">on the basis of given misconduct</span>, would have taken an adverse action. That sterile approach divorces the decision from the reality of what has actually happened in a particular case. Instead of ignoring the evidence concerning the particular situation, a trial judge must focus on it. Reprisal can only be assessed against the entire background of the normal or routine management of a particular office as contrasted with what happened in the particular case under review. Did the agency generally tolerate the type of infraction of procedures involved? Did the charged incidents of misconduct pre-date the alleged retaliating supervisor's knowledge of the protected activity? Can it be inferred or not be inferred that the employee was singled out for discipline? Has the agency taken adverse actions of equal severity against others for similar misconduct, where, as here, the misconduct is not unique in character? Did the supervisor react to the employee's protected activity by actively seeking to obtain evidence of unprotected conduct which would support charges against the employee; did he watch the employee more; did he provoke any misconduct? Are any sustained charges directed to the employee's poor performance of assigned duties? What has been the employee's work record historically; his relationship with prior supervisors? Has the employee been disciplined before for the same type of conduct? These are the types of critical inquiries, answerable by objective evidence, which courts must consider in determining whether, absent the taint of reprisal, the action would have been taken....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board explained the continuing significance of <span class="Italic">Warren</span> in <span class="Italic">Hankins v. Dept. of Transp.,</span> DE-0752-10-0078-I-1 (NP 7/18/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a genuine nexus between the protected activity and the adverse employment action, the appellant must prove that the employment action was taken because of the protected activity. <span class="Italic">See Keller v. Department of the Army</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 557, &#x00B6; 12 (2010); <span class="Italic">Kohler v. Department of the Navy</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 510, &#x00B6; 12 (2008). This requires the Board to weigh the gravity of the misconduct charges against the intensity of the motive to retaliate. <span class="Italic">See Keller,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 557, &#x00B6; 12. In assessing whether there is a genuine nexus between prior protected activity and the agency's adverse action, both the Federal Circuit and the Board have emphasized that "in the context of reprisal issues, the inquiry covers not only whether a retaliatory motive exists, but also whether there are independent grounds for initiating an action against the employee." <span class="Italic">Warren v. Department of the Army,</span> 804 F.2d 654, 657 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">see also Cole v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 572, &#x00B6; 8 (2000). The Board has held that, when an agency proves its charged misconduct, <span id="Page_4025"></span>the agency has established an independent basis for its adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Kohler,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 510, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">Moultrie v. Department of the Navy</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 153, 160 (1994) (in adverse action appeals before the Board, the agency's presentation of evidence to support its charges suffices to meet the burden to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Complex and confusing? It is and was until enactment of the WPA. Confusing as well was the evolving case law, described below, that defined the inferences that may arise under various factual circumstances and the "causation" formulation, translated into a motivational analysis, depending on whether the protected activity was a sole or contributing or peripheral factor in the personnel decision. In 1989 Congress, recognizing the morass in case law that evolved from the Board's efforts to define burdens of proof, simplified analysis in whistleblower cases by enacting legislative amendments defining the burden of proof: a complainant must show that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the challenged personnel action, subject to the right of the agency to rebut the case against it by showing by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the personnel action without the disclosure.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The WPA did not define the Special Counsel's burden of proof in a whistleblower reprisal disciplinary case, leaving that analysis to be controlled by <span class="Italic">Warren v. Dept. of Army,</span> 804 F.2d 654 (Fed. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">supra</span>. The Special Counsel's burden of proof was changed by the 2012 WPEA, so that 5 USC 1215(a)(3)(B) now provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any case brought under paragraph (1) in which the Board finds that an employee has committed a prohibited personnel practice under section 2302(b)(8), or 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D), the Board may impose disciplinary action if the Board finds that the activity protected under section 2302(b)(8), or 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D) was a significant motivating factor, even if other factors also motivated the decision, for the employee's decision to take, fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take a personnel action, unless that employee demonstrates, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the employee would have taken, failed to take, or threatened to take or fail to take the same personnel action, in the absence of such protected activity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Predating the 1989 legislation and the 2012 WPEA, there are decisions, discussed below, considering burdens of proof and analysis of causation in prohibited personnel practice cases other than those involving whistleblowing reprisal, for OSC disciplinary cases, and for appeals involving agencies not covered by the WPA that are accused of whistleblower reprisal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Special Counsel's fundamental burden in a disciplinary case was to prove the commission of a prohibited personnel practice by preponderant evidence. The evidence could be circumstantial, <span class="Italic">Acting Special Counsel v. Sullivan</span>, 6 MSPR 526, 545-46, 6 MSPB 442 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a general rule, the proponent in a civil administrative proceeding bears the burden of persuasion under the preponderance of the evidence standard. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Sea Island Broadcasting Corp.</span> <span class="Italic">of S.C. v. FCC,</span> 627 F.2d 240, 243 (D.C. Cir. 1980), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 449 U.S. 834, 101 S. Ct. 105, 66 L. Ed.2d 39 (1980); IX J. Wigmore,<span class="Italic"> Evidence &#x00A7;</span> 2498 (3d ed. 1940). <span class="Italic">See also In re Frazier,</span> 1 MSPB 159, 178, 1 MSPR 163, 185 (1979), where the Board adopted the general rule in the context of a corrective action proceeding under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1206(c)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a disciplinary action where, as here, petitioner seeks the imposition of penalties including debarment and a $1,000 fine, a lower standard of proof would not be appropriate. These penalties, however, are civil in nature and do not warrant the imposition of a higher standard. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Steadman v. SEC,</span> 450 U.S. 91, 101 S. Ct. 999, 67 L. Ed.2d 69 (1981). There, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that the clear and convincing standard of proof should apply in an administrative disciplinary proceeding which resulted in the permanent debarment of the petitioner from the investment advisory business. Accordingly, since the Congress neither prescribed a different standard under section 1207 nor spoke to the question in the legislative history, adherence to the general rule is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our finding that the record does not establish by a preponderance of the evidence that Paul Sullivan recommended the reassignment of any of the district directors for improper reasons is premised upon well-established legal principles. As is apparent from the factual analysis, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, petitioner's case is based primarily upon circumstantial evidence. Proper circumstantial evidence could, of course, be relied upon to establish Sullivan's intent. <span class="Italic">Village of</span> <span class="Italic">Arlington Heights v. Metro. Housing Dev.,</span> 429 U.S. 252, 266-267, 97 S. Ct. 555, 564, 50 L. Ed.2d 450 (1977). The Board has not hesitated to infer intent when the strength of the evidence warrants such an inference. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">In re Frazier,</span> 1 MSPB, 186-188, 1 MSPR 193-195. Conclusions as to subjective intent may not, however, be based on mere surmise or speculation as to what plausibly could have occurred. Even objective facts may not be established by a series of inferences which does not leave the fact finder with the sense that the fact sought to be established is reasonably probable and not mere guesswork. <span class="Italic">Omaha Indian Tribe v. Wilson,</span> 614 F.2d 1153, 1160-1161 (8th Cir. 1980), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 449 U.S. 825, 101 S. Ct. 87, 66 L. Ed.2d 28 (1980). Certainly "[A]n unlawful intent is not lightly to be inferred." <span class="Italic">Salinas Valley Broadcasting Corp v. NLRB,</span> 334 F.2d 604, 613 (9th Cir. 1964). The courts refuse to infer political discrimination from circumstances which may be suggestive considered in isolation but which, in light of the evidence as a whole, permit, at best, only a speculative conclusion which does not rise to the level of proof. <span class="Italic">Tanner v.

<p class="Body-Text">Preponderant evidence in a reprisal case outside the WPA was qualified by a "significant factor" analysis. In an early Special Counsel corrective action case, <span class="Italic">In re Frazier</span>, 1 MSPR 163, 195-96, 1 MSPB 159 (1979), the Board spoke of causation concerning reassignment of employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board does not dispute the general proposition that reassignment of employees, based on interpersonal conflicts and resulting tensions which interfere with productivity, is a legitimate tool of management. For this reason alone, resolution of the question of management motivation, based in large part on circumstantial evidence, is a difficult and close matter. When there is evidence of both legitimate and retaliatory motives for the same employer action, varying standards have been applied under both Title VII and the National Labor Relations Act in determining the degree to which the impermissible motive must influence the action so as to render it illegal. Some courts have found a prohibited reprisal for protected activity where the retaliatory motive played any part in the employer's decision. Other courts require a showing that retaliation was the employer's primary or dominant motive. We believe that the appropriate test for finding a violation of section 2302(b)(9) is whether retaliation for the exercise of appeal rights is a significant factor in the challenged personnel action.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Frazier</span> was a corrective action case. The burden of proof in corrective action cases is now set by statute, and the proof required is not as demanding as it would be in an OSC disciplinary case. Under 5 USC 1214(b)(4):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(B)(i) Subject to the provisions of clause (ii), in any case involving an alleged prohibited personnel practice as described under section 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D), the Board shall order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate if the Special Counsel has demonstrated that a disclosure or protected activity described under section 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D) was a contributing factor in the personnel action which was taken or is to be taken against the individual.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(ii)&#x2003;Corrective action under clause (i) may not be ordered if, after a finding that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor, the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of such disclosure.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As the Board noted in <span class="Italic">Frazier</span>, and as the Federal Circuit determined in <span class="Italic">Webster</span>, the analysis of "significant factor" motivational analysis was largely based on circumstantial evidence. Given the usual absence of direct evidence, the causal connection between protected and prohibited conduct consisted of an inference of retaliatory motive for the adverse personnel action. <span class="Italic">Bodinus v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 7 MSPR 536, 541, 7 MSPB 385 (1981). The inference could arise upon examination of several factors: (1) the employer's reaction to the protected activity; (2) the closeness of the adverse action to the protected activity; (3) the extent of the charges and disclosure forming the basis of the protected activity; (4) the seriousness of the charges (the Board may consider the truth of the charges as a factor in determining the likelihood that they provoked retaliation); (5) the amount of time that matters raised by the charges were left unresolved if resolution was possible. <span class="Italic">Valerino v. DHHS,</span> 7 MSPR 487, 489-90 &#x0026; n.1, 7 MSPB 347 (1981). Other factors included (6) the existence of intervening misconduct of a serious nature; (7) whether the penalty imposed was disparate in comparison to other like offenders; and (8) whether the penalty was the maximum or minimum allowable under the agency table of penalties. <span class="Italic">Dunning v. NASA</span>, 10 MSPR 183, 186 (1982) (no reprisal: the filing of a grievance, though protected activity, was remote in time from the disciplinary action; the two acts of insubordination were intervening elements of a serious nature; a diary or notebook kept by a supervisor "was merely documentation of the supervisor's continuing attempts to deal with a difficult, nonproductive employee"; the agency's close scrutiny of the appellant's work was reasonable since the appellant was "properly identified as a 'low performer'"; the appellant failed to show that other employees who had engaged in similar acts of insubordination were not disciplined; the penalty imposed, a fifteen-day suspension, was the minimum penalty set for a second act of insubordination by the agency penalty table); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Grant v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 61 MSPR 370, 377 (1994) (citing <span class="Italic">Wagner v. EPA</span>, 51 MSPR 337, 347 (1991) (reprisal alleged for the filing of an ULP complaint: "[t]he truth of a protected disclosure is of marginal importance[.]")).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Valerino</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Board reasoned that there was no retaliation, in part because the appellant's charges and disclosures involved matters too routine, minor, vague, implausible, or unrelated to agency business to spark reprisal. <span id="Page_4026"></span>Another decision discounted reprisal allegedly stemming from appellant's lawsuit against police for interference in his civil rights during an incident that led to his removal. Although the lawsuit was protected activity, it was not directed against the agency-employer, diminishing the significance of the suit as a factor leading to reprisal. <span class="Italic">Neff v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 39 MSPR 142, 146 (1988). A RIF was not a prohibited personnel practice, even though there may have been some animus against the only person adversely affected by the RIF, because the RIF was national in scope. <span class="Italic">McMillan v. Dept. of Army</span>, 84 MSPR 476, 483-85 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (1999) (RIF was not reprisal under a <span class="Italic">Warren</span> analysis when the individual making decisions as to positions to abolish was not the target of the appellant's grievances and the individual who was the target had no role in selecting positions to abolish); <span class="Italic">Walsh v. EPA</span>, 25 MSPR 460, 468 (1984) (RIF: "Even if Campbell's motives were impure, he was not in a position that his recommendations would be accepted regardless of their merits. In fact, the evidence is that the Inspector General was personally involved in the details of the reorganization plan and drew advice from various staff members, Campbell being only one."). Reprisal for filing grievance rights was discounted when superiors knew that the appellant filed an EEO complaint and contacted the IG, but the superiors did not know the substance of the complaints. <span class="Italic">Curtis v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 66 Fed. Appx. 891, 894 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP). One factor alone was usually not dispositive. In a circuit court case, for example, the court held it immaterial, as a defense to an action, that an employee was given a reprimand for filing an appeal; that alone did not show reprisal. <span class="Italic">Marques v. DHHS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-607).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board and the courts have had several occasions to define how the causation or motivational analysis should be conducted. The issue was how much bad motivation was too much. In an adverse action appeal, a prohibited personnel practice defense came into play, theoretically at least, only after the agency had shown that the employee committed misconduct. Given the misconduct, the issue was what degree of improper motivation should be required to set aside the adverse action. If OSC brought a case, no misconduct other than the prohibited personnel practice was required. If that practice, for example, was an improperly motivated promotion, the issue was how little evidence OSC could show of the impure motivation before the prohibited personnel practice was established.</p>
