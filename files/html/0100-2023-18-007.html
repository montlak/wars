<h3 class="h3" id="sec10-11"><span class="space">B.</span>ARBITRATION AWARD</h3>
<p class="noindent">The Reform Act makes FLRA the final arbiter of the validity of most arbitration awards. FLRA avoids using statutory enforcement procedures to obtain judicial review of one of its own orders denying exceptions that, unless reviewed, requires FLRA to follow judicial precedent that the FLRA or a party would prefer to see overturned or modified. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv., Pac. Region and NTEU</span>, 50 FLRA 656, 660 (1995). There are exceptions in the statutory scheme that permit judicial review of either an arbitration award or of an FLRA order denying exceptions to an award: an arbitrator's decision on an unacceptable performance action under 5 USC 4303 or adverse action under 5 USC 7512; an arbitration decision directly involving an unfair labor practice; an award appealable on an issue of discrimination within the province of EEOC regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">The controlling statutory provisions for direct judicial review of an FLRA decision are:</p>
<p class="noindent">5 USC 7123(a):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Any person aggrieved by any final order of the Authority other than an order under--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;section 7122 of this title (involving an award of an arbitrator), unless the order involves an unfair labor practice under section 7118 of this title....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">may...institute an action for judicial review of the Authority's order in the United States court of appeals....</p>
<p class="noindent">5 USC 7121:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;...Selection of the negotiated grievance procedure in no manner prejudices the right of an aggrieved employee to request the Merit Systems Protection Board to review the final decision pursuant to section 7702 of this title in the case of any personnel action that could have been appealed to the Board, or where applicable, to request the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to review a final decision in any other matter involving a complaint of discrimination of the type prohibited by any law administered by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(e)(1)&#x2003;Matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title which also fall within the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved employee, be raised either under the appellate procedures of section 7701 of this title or under the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(f)&#x2003;In matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title which have been raised under the negotiated grievance procedure in accordance with this section, section 7703 of this title pertaining to judicial review shall apply to the award of an arbitrator in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the matter had been decided by the Board....</p>
<p class="noindent">5 USC 7703 (applying to both decisions of the MSPB and arbitrators reviewing adverse actions and performance cases that would, but for the negotiated grievance/arbitration procedure, be within the jurisdiction of the Board) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)(1) Any employee or applicant for employment adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order or decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board may obtain judicial review of the order or decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;The Board shall be named respondent in any proceeding brought pursuant to this subsection, unless the employee or applicant for employment seeks review of a final order or decision on the merits on the underlying personnel action or on a request for attorney fees, in which case the agency responsible for taking the personnel action shall be the respondent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)(1)(A)&#x2003;Except as provided in subparagraph (B) and paragraph (2) of this subsection, a petition to review a final order or final decision of the Board shall be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any petition for review shall be filed within 60 days after the Board issues notice of the final order or decision of the Board.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;A petition to review a final order or final decision of the Board that raises no challenge to the Board's disposition of allegations of a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b) other than practices described in section 2302(b)(8), or 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D) shall be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for <span id="page_2512"></span>the Federal Circuit or any court of appeals of competent jurisdiction.

<p class="noindent">MSPB and EEOC regulations should be reviewed for the jurisdiction and procedures of those agencies as to federal sector arbitration awards.</p>
<p class="noindent">The nature of the review scheme was explained in <span class="Italic">Griffith v. FLRA</span>, 842 F.2d 487, 490-94 (D.C. Cir. 1988), involving an attempt to secure district court review of an FLRA ruling on exceptions to an arbitration award considering the denial by an agency of a within-grade increase. The court essentially determined that, with very limited exceptions concerning the basic jurisdiction of FLRA, nonstatutory review was precluded (allowing for and discussing review of constitutional claims, we note here only the discussion of bases for review other than the constitution):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are convinced that as a general matter Congress intended to preclude judicial review in the district courts of FLRA decisions concerning arbitral awards.&#x2003;&#x00A7; 7123 provides for circuit court review of FLRA final orders, but then explicitly excludes orders under &#x00A7; 7122 relating to FLRA decisions on arbitral awards. From that exclusion Congress makes a discrete exception for orders involving unfair labor practices. No one suggests that the exception is applicable here. Therefore, contrary to the appellant's contention, we need not resort to "negative inference" to find a preclusion of review in &#x00A7; 7123; although the statute authorizes certain types of review and fails to mention others, it specifically excludes review of the type of Authority decisions here at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus it is hardly surprising that all circuit courts addressing the matter have concluded that &#x00A7; 7123 bars circuit court review of arbitral decisions not involving unfair labor practices. <span class="Italic">Overseas Education Ass'n v. FLRA</span>, 824 F.2d 61, 63-69 (D.C. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">United States Dept. of Justice v. FLRA</span>, 792 F.2d 25, 28 (2d Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Tonetti v. FLRA</span>, 776 F.2d 929, 931 (11th Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1923 v. FLRA</span>, 675 F.2d 612, 613 (4th Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To be sure, Congress did not explicitly deny to <span class="Italic">district</span> courts the power to review FLRA decisions. Nevertheless, where Congress has set out a complex scheme authorizing certain types of review but not others, the express preclusion of review of FLRA orders under &#x00A7; 7122 in the one mention of the subject powerfully suggests an intent to preclude review in every court. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 108 S. Ct. 668, 673, 98 L. Ed.2d 830 (1988); <span class="Italic">Block</span>, 467 U.S. at 346-47, 104 S. Ct. at 2454; <span class="Italic">Switchmen's Union of North America v. National Mediation Board</span>, 320 U.S. 297, 305-06, 64 S. Ct. 95, 99, 88 L. Ed. 61 (1943). This is especially true in light of Congress's having explicitly given the district courts review authority in one area, namely temporary relief in unfair labor practice proceedings. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, Congress specified that the FLRA was to review arbitrators' decisions on grounds "similar to those applied by Federal courts in private sector labor-management relations." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a). Congress thus appears to have intended that in the area of arbitral awards the Authority would play in federal labor relations the role assigned to district courts in private sector labor law. The conference report on the Civil Service Reform Act confirms this view, stating that, "The Authority will only be authorized to review the award of the arbitrator on very narrow grounds similar to the scope of judicial review of an arbitrator's award in the public sector." H.R. Rep. No. 1717, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 153 (1978), U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978, pp. 2723, 2887. To give district courts review of FLRA decisions would tend to redundancy and would imperil the features of the arbitral process that we believe Congress had in mind when it set up the scheme: finality, speed and economy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The legislative history of the CSRA further supports our conclusion.&#x2003;The House version of the bill provided for review in federal courts of appeal of virtually all FLRA decisions, including those FLRA orders concerning arbitral awards. H.R. 11, 280, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. &#x00A7; 701 (1978) (House version of &#x00A7; 7123 authorizing review at behest of "[a]ny person aggrieved by any final order of the Authority...under section 7122 of this article (involving an award by an arbitrator)"). The Senate bill limited judicial review of the FLRA to unfair labor practice decisions, decisions involving constitutional issues, and decisions on exceptions to arbitrators' awards based on unfair labor practice complaints. S. 2640, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. &#x00A7; 701 (1978) (Senate's proposed &#x00A7; 7204(1) making all decisions of the Authority "final and conclusive" and stripping courts of jurisdiction to review, but allowing for review of "questions arising under the Constitution"). In conference, the House conferees acceded to the Senate view that FLRA decisions concerning arbitrator's awards would be reviewable only in cases involving unfair labor practices. The conference report made this intention crystal clear:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Senate Bill made reviewable in court decisions of the Authority concerning unfair labor practices, including awards of arbitrators relating to unfair labor practices. Otherwise, the Senate provides that all decisions of the Authority are final and conclusive, and not subject to further judicial review except for questions arising under the Constitution.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In the House bill, unfair labor practice decisions are appealable as in the Senate. In addition, all other final decisions of the Authority involving an award by an arbitrator, and the appropriateness of the unit an organization seeks to represent are also appealable to the courts...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]here will be no judicial review of the Authority's action on those arbitrators' awards in grievance cases which are appealable to the Authority. The Authority will only be authorized to review the award of the arbitrator on very narrow grounds similar to the scope of judicial review of an arbitrator's award in the private sector. In light of the limited nature of the Authority's review, the conferees determined it would be inappropriate for there to be subsequent review by the court of appeals in such matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">H.R. Rep. No. 1717, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 153 (1978), U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978, p. 2887. (emphasis added). Thus, the conferees were faced with two very different schemes of judicial review of FLRA decisions, but consciously and explicitly chose the one cutting off review of decisions of the sort at issue in the instant case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our reading of the Act comports also with what we believe to have been a major object of the legislation: extending the benefits of arbitration in labor relations from the private to the public sector. In <span class="Italic">The Steelworkers Trilogy</span>, the Supreme Court exalted the role of the arbitrator in labor-management disputes and set out a general policy of judicial deference to the decisions of arbitrators. <span class="Italic">United Steelworkers v. American Manufacturing</span>, 363 U.S. 564, 80 S. Ct. 1343, 4 L. Ed.2d 1403 (1960); <span class="Italic">United Steelworkers v. Warrior &#x0026; Gulf Navigation Co</span>., 363 U.S. 574, 80 S. Ct. 1347, 4 L. Ed.2d 1409 (1960); <span class="Italic">United Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel &#x0026; Car Corp</span>., 363 U.S. 593, 80 S. Ct. 1358, 4 L. Ed.2d 1424 (1960). <span class="Italic">See also Devine v. White</span>, 697 F.2d 421, 435 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (extolling virtues of arbitration). Moreover, the policies underlying judicial deference to arbitral decisions are as important for public as for private employment. <span class="Italic">United States Department of Justice</span>, 792 F.2d at 29; <span class="Italic">United States Marshals Service v. FLRA</span>, 708 F.2d 1417, 1420 (9th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Carter v. Kurzejeski</span>, 706 F.2d 835 (8th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Devine</span>, 697 F.2d at 439-40. A general power of review in the federal district courts would obviously undermine the speed, thrift and informality that Congress sought in establishing the arbitration/FLRA scheme.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the specific language of &#x00A7; 7123, the structure of the CSRA arbitration and review provisions, and the relevant legislative history all provide clear and convincing evidence that Congress intended to cut off judicial review of FLRA decisions regarding arbitral awards of the sort involved in this case. Congress could hardly have made its view on the matter clearer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The </span>Leedom v. Kyne<span class="Italic"> Exception.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even where Congress is understood generally to have precluded review, the Supreme Court has found an implicit but narrow exception, closely paralleling the historic origins of judicial review for agency actions in excess of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> L. Jaffe, <span class="Italic">Judicial Control of Administrative Action</span> 327-36 (1965). The leading case is <span class="Italic">Leedom v. Kyne</span>, 358 U.S. 184, 79 S. Ct. 180, 3 L. Ed.2d 210 (1958), in which the Court found district court review proper, despite an express finality provision, where the National Labor Relations Board had acted "in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition in the [National Labor Relations] Act." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 188, 79 S. Ct. at 184. The Board had issued an order certifying a bargaining unit that included both professional and nonprofessional employees without polling the members, despite a provision in the Act providing that "the Board shall not (1) decide that any unit is appropriate for such purposes...unless a majority of such professional employees vote for inclusion in such unit." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 185, 79 S. Ct. at 182. The Court characterized the NLRB's order as "an attempted exercise of power that had been specifically withheld." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 189, 79 S. Ct. at 184.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">Leedom v. Kyne</span> exception is intended to be of extremely limited scope. <span class="Italic">See Boire v. Greyhound Corp</span>., 376 U.S. 473, 480-81, 84 S. Ct. 894, 898, 11 L. Ed.2d 849 (1964); <span class="Italic">Council of Prison Locals v. Brewer</span>, 735 F.2d 1497, 1501 (D.C. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Hartz Mountain Corp. v. Dotson</span>, 727 F.2d 1308, 1311-12 (D.C. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Physicians National House Staff Association v. Fanning</span>, 642 F.2d 492, 496 (D.C. Cir. 1980), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 450 U.S. 917, 101 S. Ct. 1360, 67 L. Ed.2d 342 (1981); R. Gorman, <span class="Italic">Basic Text on Labor Law</span> 61-62 (1976). The Supreme Court and others have sought to confine it to <span id="page_2513"></span>agency error so extreme that one may view it as jurisdictional or nearly so. In <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> itself, the Court noted that the suit was "not one to 'review,' in the sense of that term as used in the Act, a decision of the Board made within its jurisdiction. Rather it is one to strike down an order of the Board made in excess of its delegated powers." <span class="Italic">Kyne</span>, 358 U.S. at 188, 79 S. Ct. at 184. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Oestereich v. Selective Service System Local Board No. 11</span>, 393 U.S. 233, 89 S. Ct. 414, 21 L. Ed.2d 402 (1968), the Court followed <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> to permit review of a final decision of a Selective Service Board that, solely in order to punish a registrant, had refused to give him a draft exemption for which he met all the statutory prerequisites. Without judicial intervention, the Court said, the Boards could deteriorate into "freewheeling agencies meting out their brand of justice in a vindictive manner." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 237, 89 S. Ct. at 416. <span class="Italic">See also United Food and Commercial Workers, Local 400 v. NLRB</span>, 694 F.2d 276, 279 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (district court held to be without jurisdiction to review claim that an NLRB agent had violated a longstanding NLRB rule, as the rule did "not appear specifically in the National Labor Relations Act"); <span class="Italic">Physicians National House Staff v. Fanning</span>, 642 F.2d 492, 496 (D.C. Cir. 1980) ("an error of fact or law is insufficient; the Board must have acted without statutory authority"); <span class="Italic">Local 130, IUERMW v.

Cir. 1965) ("For [<span class="Italic">Kyne</span>] jurisdiction to exist, the Board must have stepped so plainly beyond the bounds of the Act, or acted so clearly in defiance of it, as to warrant the immediate intervention of an equity court").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> itself the Court stressed that the Board had acted "contrary to a specific prohibition in the Act" that was "clear and mandatory." 358 U.S. at 188, 79 S. Ct. at 184. We have said that review may be had only when the agency's error is "patently a misconstruction of the Act," <span class="Italic">Hartz Mountain</span>, 727 F.2d at 1311 (quoting 2 <span class="Italic">The Developing Labor Law</span> 1716 (C. Morris ed., 2d ed. 1983)), or when the agency has "disregarded a specific and unambiguous statutory directive," <span class="Italic">United Food and Commercial Workers</span>, 694 F.2d at 278, or when the agency has "violated some specific command" of a statute, <span class="Italic">Physicians National House Staff</span>, 642 F.2d at 496. <span class="Italic">See also Council of Prison Locals</span>, 735 F.2d at 1501; <span class="Italic">McCulloch v.

Ed.2d 560 (1969); <span class="Italic">Gorman</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 64. Garden-variety errors of law or fact are not enough.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The error asserted by Griffith--if error it be--is plainly not judicially correctable under <span class="Italic">Leedom v. Kyne</span>. At stake in the FLRA proceeding was the proper test to be applied where review uncovers a procedural error in the personnel decision under review. The statute in question, the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1), does not address the matter expressly. It merely provides, in relevant part, that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">An employee who...is found by appropriate authority under applicable law, rule, regulation, or collective bargaining agreement, to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the pay, allowances, or differentials of the employee--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(a)&#x2003;is entitled...to receive...</p>
<p class="noindent-4">(i) an amount equal to...the pay...which the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA applied a so-called "but for" test, to wit, that the complaining employee can secure back pay under the Act only if she can show that "but for the unwarranted violation [the procedural error], [she] would have received the within-grade increase." <span class="Italic">NTEU v. IRS</span>, 17 FLRA at 1059. Griffith claims that this construction is "clearly wrong and...egregiously out of step with settled law under the Back Pay Act."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is readily apparent that the alleged error in the Authority's "but for" test differs both in kind and in severity from the essentially jurisdictional error asserted in <span class="Italic">Kyne</span>. Though not the only possible construction of the statutory language, it is surely a colorable one. Indeed, in <span class="Italic">Professional Airways Systems v. FLRA</span>, 809 F.2d 855 (D.C. Cir. 1987), we noted that the "FLRA's `but for' formulation appropriately effects the causal nexus mandated by the statute itself." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 858. Thus, even assuming that the <span class="Italic">Leedom</span> exception can be triggered by an error in interpreting a statute other than the agency's organic act, the FLRA's interpretation is not the sort of plain error the doctrine requires.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Griffith also suggests that because 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122 provides that the Authority may only act in a manner "consistent with applicable laws," the FLRA's allegedly erroneous construction of the Back Pay Act placed it beyond the pale of its statutory authority. This, of course, seeks effectively to incorporate the Back Pay Act into the FLRA's organic statute. Whatever support this might have in some circumstances, it has none where the legal error, if any, is at most one of failing to capture some marginal nuance of the Back Pay Act. Accepting such a claim would turn <span class="Italic">every</span> error of law into a basis for review, effectively repealing hundreds of finality provisions. We do not believe that Congress desired such a result. Accordingly, the district court correctly concluded that it was without jurisdiction to review the appellant's non-constitutional claims.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Griffith</span> was followed in another decision from the D.C. Circuit. The case arose from an arbitrator's award, sustained by FLRA, directing management to discipline a supervisor. The court had no jurisdiction to review FLRA's decision, <span class="Italic">DOJ v. FLRA</span>, 981 F.2d 1339, 1342-44 (D.C. Cir. 1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our jurisdiction to review orders of the FLRA is prescribed in section 7123(a) of the FSLMRS, which provides that "[any person aggrieved by any final order of the Authority other than an order under (1) section 7122 of this title (<span class="Italic">involving an award by an arbitrator</span>), unless the order involves an unfair labor practice...may...institute an action for judicial review of the Authority's order." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a) (1988). Not surprisingly, the courts have applied section 7123(a)(1) as written, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, to preclude judicial review of an FLRA decision concerning an arbitral award, except when the award involves an unfair labor practice....&#8197;Because the instant dispute does not involve an unfair labor practice, our jurisdiction is flatly foreclosed by section 7123(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The only possible basis for jurisdiction for this court to entertain the DOJ's petition for review would be pursuant to the <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> exception. In <span class="Italic">Leedom v. Kyne</span>, the Supreme Court held that a district court had jurisdiction to strike down a certification decision of the National Labor Relations Board ("NLRB" or "Board"), despite a provision in the National Labor Relations Act ("NLRA" or "Act") precluding review, because the Board had acted "in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition in the Act." 358 U.S. at 188, 79 S. Ct. at 184. The Court in <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> carefully delineated the extraordinary circumstances that warranted its finding of jurisdiction, noting that the Board's decision violated a "clear and mandatory" provision of the Act, and characterizing the Board's action as "an attempted exercise of power that had been specifically withheld." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 188, 189, 79 S. Ct. at 184, 184. Subsequent decisions from the Supreme Court and from this circuit have emphasized the very limited scope of the <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> exception. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Boire v. Greyhound Corp.</span>, 376 U.S. 473, 479, 481, 84 S. Ct. 894, 897, 898, 11 L. Ed.2d 849 (1964) (describing <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> as a case "characterized by extraordinary circumstances," and the exception as "a narrow one"); <span class="Italic">Hartz Mountain Corp. v. Dotson</span>, 727 F.2d 1308, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (describing the <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> exception as "extraordinarily narrow").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is thus clear under established case law that, to establish jurisdiction under the <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> exception, a petitioner must be able to "identify a specific provision of the Act which, although it is 'clear and mandatory,'...has nevertheless been violated by the Board."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This court has declined to extend the <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> exception to cases in which the FLRA may have made an error of fact or law in an order that is otherwise unreviewable under the Statute. In <span class="Italic">Griffith</span>, for example, the FLRA's order had set aside an arbitral award of a retroactive pay increase, ruling that the grievant had failed to establish his claim under the Back Pay Act because he had failed to establish "but for" causation. The grievant petitioned this court for review, claiming that the FLRA erred as a matter of law in its construction of the Back Pay Act. 842 F.2d at 489-90. We found that the alleged error in the FLRA's interpretation of the elements of a Back Pay Act claim "differ[ed] both in kind and in severity from the essentially jurisdictional error asserted in <span class="Italic">Kyne</span>." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 494. At the most, the Authority may have "fail[ed] to capture some marginal nuance of the Back Pay Act<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. The court held that this type of "garden-variety" error of law is not sufficient to bring the Authority's order within the narrow boundaries of the <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> exception, which is designed to address agency error "so extreme that one may view it as jurisdictional or nearly so." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 493. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Physicians Nat'l House Staff Assn.</span>, 642 F.2d at 496 (noting that "an error of fact or law is insufficient; the Board must have acted without statutory authority").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite the nearly insurmountable limitations on <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> jurisdiction, the DOJ asks us to review the FLRA's order affirming the arbitral award. The DOJ asserts that the arbitrator exceeded his authority when he ordered the agency to put a letter of reprimand in Lieutenant Klopf's file, and that the FLRA erred in upholding an arbitral award that is inconsistent with the FSLMRS, that fails to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement, and that abrogates the due process rights of supervisors. According to the DOJ, the FLRA's error was so extreme that it can be viewed as the type of jurisdictional or facial error that falls with the narrow bounds of the <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with the agency's characterization of the Authority's alleged error. There is no <span class="Italic">specific provision</span> in the FSLMRS that, in <span class="Italic">clear and mandatory</span> terms, prohibits an arbitrator from ordering an agency to discipline a supervisor, or that prohibits the Authority from affirming an arbitral award that mandates supervisory discipline. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Physicians Nat'l House Staff Ass'n</span>, 642 F.2d at 496; <span class="Italic">Council of Prison Locals</span>, 735 F.2d at 1501. Nor is there a <span class="Italic">specific provision</span> in the Statute that unambiguously reserves matters of supervisory discipline solely to the agency's prerogative, and specifically <span class="Italic">withholds</span> those matters from an arbitrator's jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Kyne</span>, 358 U.S. at 189, 79 S. Ct. at 184. Without such specific, clear and mandatory provisions in the FSLMRS, we cannot say that the Authority's order was a facial violation or a patent misconstruction of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The DOJ would also have us find that the Authority erred as a matter of <span id="page_2514"></span>law when it found that the arbitrator's award failed to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. To find that the Authority committed such an error would require us to enter the fray of arbitral review provided by section 7122(a) of the Statute. This we may not do because of the statutory preclusion found in section 7123(a)(1). As we noted in <span class="Italic">Griffith</span>, this preclusion includes even those cases in which the FLRA has made garden-variety errors of law or fact when reviewing an arbitral award under section 7122(a). <span class="Italic">See</span> 842 F.2d at 493-94. In short, it is not the business of the courts to second-guess arbitral judgments that fall within the compass of section 7123(a)(1).</p>

The Tenth Circuit declined to permit review, rejecting authority to review FLRA's decision under the Supreme Court's <span class="Italic">Leedom v. Kyne</span> decision:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...It is undisputed that the FLRA order challenged here does not involve an unfair labor practice. Thus, the plain language of the statute specifically precludes our review. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice v. FLRA</span>, 981 F.2d 1339, 1342 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (collecting cases).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Bureau acknowledges that section 7123 ordinarily bars judicial review of an FLRA order such as the one at issue here, but nonetheless argues that jurisdiction is proper under the exception recognized in <span class="Italic">Leedom v. Kyne</span> [358 U.S. 184 (1958)]. In <span class="Italic">Kyne</span>, the Supreme Court upheld judicial review, despite a statutory provision intended to preclude such review, "where the National Labor Relations Board had acted 'in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition in the [National Labor Relations] Act.'" <span class="Italic">Griffith v. FLRA</span>, 842 F.2d 487, 492 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (quoting <span class="Italic">Kyne</span>, 358 U.S. at 188, 79 S. Ct. at 183). In considering whether to proceed under <span class="Italic">Kyne</span>, courts have emphasized that the case provides an exception of "very limited scope," <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice</span>, 981 F.2d at 1342, to be "invoked only in exceptional circumstances," <span class="Italic">Greater Detroit Resource Recovery Auth. v. Envtl. Protection Agency</span>, 916 F.2d 317, 323 (6th Cir. 1990). As one court has pointed out, the language used in <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> "carefully and clearly delineated the narrow scope of its holding." <span class="Italic">Physicians Nat'l House Staff Ass'n. v. Fanning</span>, 642 F.2d 492, 495 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 450 U.S. 917, 10, S. Ct. 1360, 67 L. Ed.2d 342 (1981). Under the Court's description of the order at issue in <span class="Italic">Kyne</span>, agency action will only fall within the exception created by <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> when the agency's determination is "made in excess of its powers," 358 U.S. at 185, 79 S. Ct. at 182, when the agency "disobeyed the express command of [its organic act]...and in doing so...acted in excess of its powers," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 186-87, 79 S. Ct. at 183, when the agency order is "an attempted exercise of power that had been specifically withheld," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 189, 79 S. Ct. at 184, and when it is "agency action taken in excess of delegated powers," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 190, 79 S. Ct. at 185.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The particular circumstances in <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> help to clarify the quasi-jurisdictional nature of the exception. At issue was a National Labor Relations Board order in a representation proceeding. The National Labor Relations Act authorizes the Board to certify a bargaining unit made up of both professional and non-professional employees <span class="Italic">only</span> when a majority of the professional employees vote for inclusion in the unit. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 159(b)(1) (1988). Despite this explicit limitation on the extent of the Board's delegated authority, the Board certified a unit including both professional and non-professional employees without taking a vote to determine whether a majority of the professional employees wished to be included in the unit. The Supreme Court concluded that it had jurisdiction in these circumstances to "strike down an order of the Board made in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition in the Act." <span class="Italic">Kyne</span>, 358 U.S. at 188, 79 S. Ct. at 184; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Oestereich v. Selective Serv. System</span>, 393 U.S. 233, 89 S. Ct. 414, 21 L. Ed.2d 402 (1968) (review granted; Selective Service Board without authority to deny exemption).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Bureau contends here that the FLRA order is reviewable under <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> because the FLRA committed plain legal error in construing section 704(b) of the Civil Service Reform Act. In so doing, the Bureau makes two interrelated arguments. First, the Bureau asserts that our jurisdiction turns on whether the FLRA committed plain error. However, the Court in <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> cautioned that the suit there was "not one to 'review,' in the sense of that term as used in the [NLRA], a decision of the Board made within its jurisdiction." 358 U.S. at 188, 79 S. Ct. at 184. It is clear that <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> does not confer jurisdiction merely because the FLRA made an error of law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Boire v. Greyhound Corp.</span>, 376 U.S. 473, 481, 84 S. Ct. 894, 899, 11 L. Ed.2d 849 (1964) ("The <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> exception is a narrow one, not to be extended to permit plenary district court review of [NLRB] orders in certification proceedings whenever it can be said that an erroneous assessment of the particular facts before the Board has led it to a conclusion which does not comport with the law.") "That the Board may have made an error of fact or law is insufficient; the Board must have acted without statutory authority." <span class="Italic">Physicians Nat'l House Staff Ass'n</span>, 642 F.2d at 496; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice</span>, 981 F.2d at 1343.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Bureau contends that <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> jurisdiction is present because, by plainly misconstruing the Civil Service Reform Act, the FLRA has acted contrary to a specific statutory prohibition that is clear and mandatory. As we have discussed above, the clear and mandatory statutory prohibition the Board violated in <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> was contained in its enabling act. When the Board acted in violation of that statute, it exceeded its delegated authority and used a power that Congress had expressly denied it. Here, to the contrary, we are not concerned with a violation of the agency's enabling act. The FLRA clearly had the statutorily conferred authority to make a decision based on its construction of the Civil Service Reform Act. The Bureau thus asks us to undertake judicial review of an agency decision which the agency had the authority to make simply because that decision was allegedly plainly wrong. To rest <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> jurisdiction on the basis that the FLRA has erred in reviewing an arbitration award is to "turn every error of law into a basis for review, effectively repealing hundreds of finality provisions." <span class="Italic">Griffith</span>, 842 F.2d at 494. Congress has explicitly mandated otherwise in section 7123(a) by precluding judicial review unless the order involves an unfair labor practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, even if we were to assume that <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> jurisdiction could be based on the FLRA's violation of a statute other than its enabling act, the type of inquiry the Bureau asks us to undertake here is nonetheless outside the narrow perimeters of <span class="Italic">Kyne</span>. The provision of the Civil Service Reform Act at issue does not provide a facially clear and mandatory directive on the issue of the negotiability of Sunday premium pay. Resolution of that issue necessarily depends upon applying the law to the facts. The Supreme Court has expressly stated that <span class="Italic">Kyne</span> jurisdiction is not available to address an allegation that the agency's erroneous assessment of the facts has led it to an improper legal conclusion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Boire</span>, 376 U.S. at 481, 84 S. Ct. at 898....</p>
<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit denied review of an FLRA decision affirming an arbitrator's overtime award, <span class="Italic">DHS v. FLRA</span>, 784 F.3d 821, 822-24 (D.C. Cir. 2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the amount of money at issue in this dispute about overtime pay is small, the amount of energy that the parties have expended fighting over it is not. It has been the subject of arbitration, three Federal Labor Relations Authority decisions, and now this petition for review. It has taken three years and, according to the government, implicates the august constitutional principle of sovereign immunity. Notwithstanding all this time and effort, our task is easy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7123 of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute vests this court with jurisdiction to review the Authority's final orders "other than an order...involving an award by an arbitrator." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a)(1). As we explained in <span class="Italic">Griffith v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 842 F.2d 487 (D.C. Cir. 1988), Congress imposed this limitation in order to protect "the features of the arbitral process that...Congress had in mind when it set up the scheme: finality, speed and economy." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 491. We have nonetheless exercised jurisdiction in a narrow category of arbitral cases. In <span class="Italic">Griffith</span>, we held that though there was "unusually clear congressional intent generally to foreclose review" of "nonconstitutional claims...Congress's language was not specific enough to foreclose review" of "constitutional challenges." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 490. Then, in <span class="Italic">United States Department of Treasury, United States Customs Service v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 43 F.3d 682 (D.C. Cir. 1994), we added a second exception for cases where "the Authority exceeds its jurisdiction," explaining that the Authority has jurisdiction only over statutes that were "fashioned for the purpose of regulating the working conditions of employees." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 691.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case implicates neither exception.&#x2003;The Authority applied a statute within its purview, the Back Pay Act, <span class="Italic">see Treasury</span>, 43 F.3d at 689 (explaining that the Back Pay Act "undisputedly was designed to deal directly with employee working conditions"), and the case presents no constitutional question, as that statute waives sovereign immunity, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596. Recognizing as much, Customs argues that when "the Authority has awarded back pay in violation of the Back Pay Act," it "violat[es]...sovereign immunity" and the "order exceeds its jurisdiction and is thus reviewable under this Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Treasury</span>." Petitioner's Br. 15 (internal quotation marks omitted); <span class="Italic">see also id.</span> at 24 (grounding the same argument in the Appropriations Clause, U.S. Const. Art. I, &#x00A7; 9, cl. 7). This is incorrect. Routine statutory and regulatory questions--in this case, the meaning of the "shall not exceed" clause in the Back Pay <span id="page_2515"></span>Act and "administrative error" in Customs' assignment policy--are not transformed into constitutional or jurisdictional issues merely because a statute waives sovereign immunity. Otherwise, Congress's creation of a mostly unreviewable system of arbitration would be eviscerated, as every Authority decision involving an arbitral award arguably in excess of what the Back Pay Act authorizes would be reviewable. To make matters worse, as Customs concedes, this evisceration would be distinctly asymmetrical: when the Authority awards back pay, the government could the employee would have no recourse because only decisions adverse to the government could implicate sovereign immunity. As we said of a similar argument in <span class="Italic">Treasury</span>, "[t]hat seems to us to be a labored, even silly, construction of the statute." <span class="Italic">Treasury</span>, 43 F.3d at 688.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Customs insists that this conclusion "has to be wrong, as it would mean that there could be no review over the Authority's interpretation of the Back Pay Act no matter how extreme that application was and no matter how gigantic the liability imposed on the Treasury." We have two responses. First, this is exactly what Congress intended. Section 7123's plain language "removes [Authority] decisions reviewing arbitral awards from judicial review" unless "the [Authority's] order 'involves an unfair labor practice.'" <span class="Italic">Overseas Education Association v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 824 F.2d 61, 63 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a)); <span class="Italic">see also</span> H.R. CONF. REP. NO. 1717, 95th Cong., 2d sess. 153 (1978), U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978 at 2887 ("[T]here will be no judicial review of the Authority's action on those arbitrators [sic] awards in grievance cases which are appealable to the Authority."). Congress obviously believed that protecting the beneficial "features" of arbitration, <span class="Italic">supra</span> at 3, was more important than providing for judicial review of every arbitral decision. <span class="Italic">See City of Arlington, Texas v. FCC</span>, 133 S. Ct. 1863, 1868 (2013) ("Congress has the power (within limits) to tell the courts what classes of cases they may decide"). Second, this case does not come close to raising the specter Customs fears. Involving just a night's worth of overtime pay, the case turns on either "some marginal nuance of the Back Pay Act," <span class="Italic">Griffith</span>, 842 F.2d at 494, or a phrase in Customs' assignment policy. We thus have no need to decide whether any alternative avenues of review might exist in the event the Authority egregiously misinterprets the Act.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2986 v. FLRA</span>, 130 F.3d 450, 451 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (court declined to exercise jurisdiction under <span class="Italic">Leedom v. Kyne</span> as to FLRA's review of exceptions to award pertaining to severance pay for National Guard civilian technicians); <span class="Italic">AFGE v. Calhoun</span>, 659 F. Supp. 191, 194 (E.D. Mo. 1987) (declining to review denial of exceptions to an award: "This Court...may not assert jurisdiction over plaintiffs' complaint on the basis of an error in legal interpretation by the Authority in its exercise of statutorily-defined power.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Without mentioning precedent seemingly barring judicial review of FLRA decisions on exceptions to arbitrators' awards, in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA,</span> 466 F.3d 1079, 1081 (D.C. Cir. 2006), the D.C. Circuit provided its basis for reviewing FLRA's decision in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chapters 22, 34 &#x0026; 60</span>, 61 FLRA 168, 170-71 (2005):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c), we must set aside a FLRA decision that is "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law." <span class="Italic">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms v. FLRA</span>, 464 U.S. 89, 97 n.7 (1983). We will uphold the Authority's decision "if, but only if, we can discern a reasoned path from the facts and considerations before the [agency] to the decision it reached." <span class="Italic">U.S. Information Agency v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 165, 169 (D.C. Cir. 1992). The FLRA's findings of fact are "conclusive" if supported by substantial evidence on the record, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c), and its "reasonable inferences" receive deference on review. <span class="Italic">American Fed'n of Government Employees, Local 2441 v. FLRA</span>, 864 F.2d 178, 184 (D.C. Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the MOUs themselves, courts interpret labor agreements in light of the "practice, usage and custom" of the parties. <span class="Italic">Transportation-Communication Employees Union v. Union Pac. Ry. Co.</span>, 385 U.S. 157, 161 (1966). In particular, where the terms of a bargaining agreement are ambiguous, we look to evidence of the parties' contemporaneous understanding.<span class="Italic"> See Commonwealth Communications, Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 312 F.3d 465, 468 (D.C. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">American Postal Workers Union v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 940 F.2d 704, 707-08 (D.C. Cir. 1991). We see no reason to suppose that either the arbitrator or the FLRA could disregard those principles of interpretation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">BATF</span> Supreme Court decision, cited by the D.C. Circuit in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span> was an official time dispute that went through a ULP process to the point of a final FLRA decision--a decision that was indisputably subject to judicial review. The FLRA's decision in the <span class="Italic">NTEU Chapters 22, 34 &#x0026; 60 </span>decision was not explicitly predicated upon resolution of a ULP dispute, although the decision does suggest that one of the bases that was argued to the arbitrator was an unfair labor practice theory of unilateral repudiation by the agency of a memorandum of understanding. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury v. FLRA</span>, 43 F.3d 682, 687-88 (D.C.
