<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-18"><span class="space">e.</span> Internal, Policy Disagreement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Until 2012, what appellants characterized as disclosures were normally not protected if they reflected disagreement with management policy decisions. The 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act amendments substantially, but not totally, changed preexisting law through a couple sections that were added to 5 USC 2302:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)(2)(D)&#x2003;"disclosure" means a formal or informal communication or transmission, but does not include a communication concerning policy decisions that lawfully exercise discretionary authority unless the employee or applicant providing the disclosure reasonably believes that the disclosure evidences--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003; any violation of any law, rule, or regulation; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003; gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)(1) A disclosure shall not be excluded from subsection (b)(8) because--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; the disclosure was made to a supervisor or to a person who participated in an activity that the employee or applicant reasonably believed to be covered by subsection (b)(8)(A)(i) and (ii);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B) the disclosure revealed information that had been previously disclosed;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003; of the employee's or applicant's motive for making the disclosure;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(D)&#x2003; the disclosure was not made in writing;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(E)&#x2003; the disclosure was made while the employee was off duty; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(F)&#x2003; the disclosure was made before the date on which the individual was appointed or applied for appointment to a position; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(G)&#x2003; of the amount of time which has passed since the occurrence of the events described in the disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;If a disclosure is made during the normal course of duties of an employee, the principal job function of whom is to regularly investigate and disclose wrongdoing (referred to in this paragraph as the "disclosing employee"), the disclosure shall not be excluded from subsection (b)(8) if the disclosing employee demonstrates that an employee who has the authority to take, direct other individuals to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action with respect to the disclosing employee took, failed to take, or threatened to take or fail to take a personnel action with respect to the disclosing employee in reprisal for the disclosure made by the disclosing employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Day v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/DAY_THOMAS_F_DC_1221_12_0528_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_WITH_CONCURRING_AND_DISSENTING_OPINION_836324.pdf">119 MSPR 589</a>, 2013 MSPB 49 (2013) (Member Robbins concurring in part and dissenting in part), determined that the expanded definition of the term "disclosure" in (f)(1) and (2) could properly be applied retroactively to cases pending at the time of the WPEA's enactment. [Refer to Chapter 17, "<a href="0100-2023-24-061.html#sec17-59">Retroactivity,</a>" for <span class="Italic">Day</span>.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Interpreting the WPEA, <span class="Italic">Webb v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 122 MSPR 248, 252-54 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-12, 2015 MSPB 6 (2015), determined that most disagreements will not ordinarily rise to the level of protected disclosures. To qualify for protection, "the employee has a reasonable belief that the disclosed information evidences the kinds of misconduct listed in section 2302(b)(8), rather than a policy disagreement":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's position paper does not constitute a protected disclosure under section 2302(b)(8) but rather embodies the appellant's policy disagreement with the agency's restructuring of the MMS and creation of the BOEM. The Board has held that the statutory protection for whistleblowers is not a weapon in arguments over policy or a shield for insubordinate conduct. <span class="Italic">See O'Donnell v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 94, &#x00B6; 14 (2013), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 561 Fed. Appx. 926 (Fed. Cir. 2014). Even under the expanded protections afforded to whistleblowers under the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (WPEA), general philosophical or policy disagreements with agency decisions or actions are not protected unless they separately constitute a protected disclosure of one of the categories of wrongdoing listed in section 2302(b)(8)(A). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(D); <span class="Italic">see also O'Donnell</span>, 561 Fed. Appx. at 930 (citing the legislative history of the WPEA).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that, in <span class="Italic">O'Donnell</span>, the Board, citing <span class="Italic">White v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 391 F.3d 1377, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2004), indicated that for a lawful policy decision to constitute gross mismanagement, its impropriety must not be "debatable among reasonable people." <span class="Italic">O'Donnell</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 94, &#x00B6; 14. The legislative history of the WPEA criticizes White, however, stating that "[t]he requirement that the disclosure must lead to 'a conclusion that agency erred (that) is not debatable among reasonable people' <span id="Page_3641"></span>could [cause confusion because] it could be read to require proof that the alleged misconduct actually occurred." S. Rep. No. 112-155 at 10 n.37 (2012). The Senate Committee Report thus emphasized that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]here should be no additional burdens imposed on the employee beyond those provided by the statute, and that this test--that the disclosure is protected if the employee had a reasonable belief it evidenced misconduct--must be applied consistently to each kind of misconduct and each kind of speech covered under section 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Committee notes that the requirement that the employee need show only reasonable belief applies, as well, in determining whether the narrow exception for policy disputes, added by S. 743, applies. <span class="Italic">In other words, if an employee has a reasonable belief that the disclosed information evidences the kinds of misconduct listed in section 2302(b)(8), rather than a policy disagreement, the disclosure is protected.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 112-115 at 10-11 (emphasis added). Based on the foregoing, consistent with congressional intent, we clarify <span class="Italic">O'Donnell</span> here to emphasize that if an employee has a reasonable belief that the disclosed information evidences the kinds of misconduct listed in section 2302(b)(8), rather than a policy disagreement, it is protected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying this standard, we concur with the administrative judge that the appellant's position paper is a policy disagreement with the agency's lawful decision to restructure the former MMS pursuant to the Secretary of the Interior's directive, and we find that the appellant has otherwise failed to establish that he had a reasonable belief that the disclosed information evidenced the kinds of misconduct listed in section 2302(b)(8).[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;A disclosure of gross mismanagement excludes management decisions which are merely debatable. <span class="Italic">See Ormond v. Department of Justice</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 337, &#x00B6; 11 (2012). An employee discloses an abuse of authority when he alleges that a federal official has arbitrarily or capriciously exercised power which has adversely affected the rights of any person or has resulted in personal gain or advantage to himself or to preferred other persons, <span class="Italic">see McCollum v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 449, 455-56 (1997), and an employee discloses a gross waste of funds when he alleges that a more than debatable expenditure is significantly out of proportion to the benefit reasonably expected to accrue to the government, <span class="Italic">see Embree v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 79, 85 (1996). The appellant's policy paper contains no such disclosures because it fails to allege that the decision to restructure the MMS, as proposed, would result in personal gain to any person or would involve any expenditure of federal funds; rather, the recommendations advanced therein only reflect the appellant's opinion of the best way to restructure the MMS and constituted his disagreements with debatable management decisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the appellant failed to establish by preponderant evidence that he had a reasonable belief that he disclosed a violation of law, rule, or regulation when he engaged in an email exchange with several agency officials in July 2013 about proposed changes to permitting fees.[4] The record reflects that the appellant initially expressed uncertainty over a proposed change in the way the agency charged for certain drilling permits. After receiving an email from the agency's Unit 2 Supervisor of the Environmental Operations Section concerning the proposed change, the appellant emailed a response, which stated, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that, "I still have a problem with this proposed policy and am unclear about it. How can you...change the requirements of the regulations...when the reg[ulations] state for the fee for EPs is per surface location and for DOCDs per well[?]" The Supervisor clarified in an email response sent shortly thereafter that "[T]here is no change from the regulations." The appellant thereafter responded, "I have no problem with the policy now that it has been clearly explained."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The record demonstrates that this email communication took place over the course of approximately 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant's statements occurred in the context of a general discussion over a <span class="Italic">proposed</span> policy, we conclude that the email was part of a policy discussion, the matters discussed therein were merely debatable, and a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the appellant could not reasonably conclude that they evidenced any of the situations specified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See Chavez</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 285, &#x00B6; 18. That is, the appellant's email did not disclose an alleged violation of law, rule, or regulation; rather, it merely requested clarification about the proposed policy in light of his concerns that, if adopted, it could run afoul of the agency's regulations.[5] Accordingly, the appellant failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he reasonably believed he disclosed a violation of law, rule, or regulation in his July 2013 email.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Although an appellant need not establish an actual violation of a law, rule, or regulation in order to demonstrate that he had a reasonable belief that the disclosure evidenced one of the categories of wrongdoing listed in section 2302(b)(8), an appellant's involvement and understanding of the subject matter at issue may be considered in determining whether he established that he had a reasonable belief that he disclosed a violation of law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Stiles v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 263, &#x00B6; 17 (2011) (an appellant does not have to establish an actual violation in order to have a reasonable belief that he disclosed one of the categories of wrongdoing under section 2302(b)(8)); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of the Army</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 311, &#x00B6; 10 (1998) (an appellant's involvement with the subject matter may go to whether the appellant had a reasonable belief).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;In so ruling, we do not hold that statements occurring in the context of a policy discussion can never constitute a protected disclosure. As the WPEA amendments make clear, a communication concerning policy decisions that lawfully exercise discretionary authority is not a disclosure <span class="Italic">unless</span> the employee reasonably believes that the disclosure evidences any violation of any law, rule, or regulation; or gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(D). Rather, we hold only that, under the circumstances of this case, the appellant's comments in his July 2013 email were communications concerning policy and that, in making them, he failed to establish that he reasonably believed that he was disclosing one of the categories of wrongdoing under section 2302(b)(8).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Standley's allegations amount to a policy dispute, and the record demonstrates that a disinterested observer could not reasonably believe Mr. Standley's disclosures evidenced either a violation of law or a danger to public health and safety. As an initial matter, decisions related to the development of the nuclear detonation program in space fit within the exception to disclosures for "policy decisions that lawfully exercise discretionary authority." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(D); <span class="Italic">see O'Donnell</span>, 561 Fed. Appx. at 930 ("[a]n exercise of discretionary authority is not a 'violation of the law.'"). As the MSPB found, the record shows that decisions related to SABRS3 were committed to an interagency discretionary review process and not to any particular individual acting alone, let alone an employee of the DOE. <span class="Italic">See Standley</span>, 2017 WL 56181, at &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11, 13 (describing the interagency process of decision making).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, for many of the same reasons expressed above, we find that a disinterested observer could not reasonably believe that Mr. Standley's report to his supervisor regarding funding for SABRS3 evidences a danger to public health or safety. "[t]he disclosure of a danger only potentially arising in the future is not a protected disclosure" if it is not "substantial and specific." <span class="Italic">Chambers v.

The MSPB weighed these factors and found that, while degradation in <span id="Page_3642"></span>capability to detect nuclear blasts in space could affect public health and safety, Mr. Standley had not alleged quantifiable potential harm or likelihood of harm and, therefore, did not meet his burden to show "that such an occurrence is more than a possibility occurring at an undefined point in the future." <span class="Italic">Standley</span>, 2017 WL 56181, at &#x00B6; 12 (footnote omitted). Mr. Standley has not challenged these findings on appeal. We see no error in the MSPB's analysis.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue on appeal is whether the MSPB erred in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to consider Dr. Hansen's IRA appeal due to failure to non-frivolously allege violations of the WPEA. In dismissing Dr. Hansen's appeal as to Disclosures 1-7 for failure to allege a protected disclosure under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), the MSPB analyzed each disclosure separately and found the disclosures as alleged were either lacking specificity, conclusory, debatable policy disputes with the Army's staffing decisions, outside of the IRA appeal context, or a combination of the above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Hansen argues his disclosures were protected under the WPEA because he reasonably believed the disclosed conduct, "on their own and in the aggregate[,] were inappropriate and constitute[d] gross mismanagement," and that the disclosed conduct relating to "staff restructuring, threatening to transfer Dr. Hansen, and [Col. Tate] placing herself in a position for which she is not qualified" constituted an abuse of authority, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 25; <span class="Italic">see</span> Oral Arg. at 29:10-11, <a href="http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx?fl=20 17-2025.mp3">http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx?fl=20 17-2025.mp3</a> (clarifying by counsel for Dr. Hansen that "[Disclosure 4] was only pled as an abuse of authority"). We agree in a limited manner with Dr. Hansen regarding Disclosure 4, and to the extent the facts alleged in Disclosure 4 impact Disclosure 5, but otherwise disagree. We discuss the disclosures in turn below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Disclosures 1-4 and 6-7</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB did not err in finding Dr. Hansen failed to make non-frivolous allegations with regard to Disclosures 1-3 and 6-7 that he reasonably believed his disclosures are protected under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A) relating to Col. Tate's management based on staffing assignments. Decisions related to staffing responsibilities and assignments are not protected disclosures because they, instead, relate to "policy decisions that lawfully exercise discretionary authority." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(D); <span class="Italic">see O'Donnell</span>, 561 Fed. Appx. at 930 ("[a]n exercise of discretionary authority is not a violation of the law." (internal quotation marks omitted)). We have held that "[d]iscussion and even disagreement with supervisors over job-related activities is a normal part of most occupations." <span class="Italic">Willis v. Dep't of Agric</span>., 141 F.3d 1139, 1143 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">see id</span>. (affirming the MSPB's lack of jurisdiction because an employee's disclosures objecting to the criticisms of his supervisor were not protected disclosures within the purview of the WPA).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr.&#x2003;Hansen's allegations regarding Disclosures 1-3 and 6-7 are conclusory and, at most, amount to a dispute with a supervisor's discretionary authority that a disinterested observer could not reasonably believe evidence wrongdoing listed in &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A). For example, in Disclosure 1, Dr. Hansen critiques Col. Tate's management decisions to relocate a colonel to a new infantry unit, and reassign various contractors, lieutenant colonels and majors to her support staff. Yet, Dr. Hansen neither specifies nor cites evidence of the parameters of the Army "health care mission" of which he asserts Col. Tate ran afoul, nor specifies any authority that she violated or identifies a quantifiable harm. In Disclosure 3, Dr. Hansen alleges a supervisor refused to allow him to relocate his desk, and verbally accosted him. While harassment may constitute an abuse of authority under certain circumstances, Dr. Hansen has not alleged any facts that would suggest that Lt. Col. Ruwe acted in a manner that would satisfy the definition of abuse of authority. Disclosures 6 and 7 concern disagreement with a potential transfer to NKC, and are likewise vague and conclusory as to why that discretionary decision was a "threat[]" or would on its own constitute "mismanagement and abuse of power." J.A. 124; <span class="Italic">cf</span>. Pet'r's Br. 24 (summarizing Dr. Hansen's argument on appeal that mismanagement by Col. Tate "culminated in her undermining [the CJMED's medical] mission...in the most substantial way possible, by seeking to remove Dr. Hansen"). It is clear that Dr. Hansen personally disagreed with Col. Tate's staffing "desire" to transfer him. <span class="Italic">See</span> J.A. 81 (providing email from Col. Tate to Dr. Hansen stating "I assume that if you are extended then you will transfer to NKC as that is where I...need your skills as a physician advisor.... [W]ith the loss of the physician from the team at NKC this move is critical for the long-term advising effort"); J.A. 80 (responding in an email to Col. Tate that "I have no inten[t]ion to move to NKC. There are other options to cover the lack of [a] physician at NKC [and] I still can cover the clinical aspect of NKC team...as I'm doing now"). However, without evidence as to how such a transfer request to fill a vacant position was either a "threat[]" to the employee or could constitute "mismanagement and abuse of power," the MSPB properly found these conclusory allegations to be frivolous, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., White v. Dep't of Air Force</span>, 391 F.3d 1377, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2004) ("Mere differences of opinion between an employee and his agency superiors as to the proper approach to a particular problem or the most appropriate course of action do not rise to the level of gross mismanagement.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Disclosure 2, while pled with more specificity than the previously discussed disclosures, amounts to conclusory allegations of, at best, a policy dispute under &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(D). Specifically, Disclosure 2 alleges that Col. Tate abused her authority, in violation of Army Regulation 690-400, by assigning a lower ranking official, Lt. Col. Ruwe, to supervise Dr. Hansen, causing "delayed payments" to Dr. Hansen. However, while Dr. Hansen cites a general Army regulation in passing, as the AJ aptly noted, Army Reg. 690-400 sets forth the Army's voluminous "Performance Evaluation System" for civilian employees, <span class="Italic">see</span> Army Reg. 690-400, Total Army Performance Evaluation System, Ch. 4302. Dr. Hansen cites no specific section or even subsection in Army Reg. 690-400, nor could we find one, addressing military personnel supervising civilian personnel, or how to evaluate ranking requirements for supervisors. Further, Dr. Hansen makes conclusory statements and points to no evidence of record that would allow a disinterested person to come to the conclusion that assignment of Lt. Col. Ruwe was an abuse of authority or gross mismanagement on the part of Col. Tate because Dr. Hansen does not discuss with requisite specificity how his rights were "adversely affect[ed]" by the delay he alleges occurred with his paycheck, as is required to make a non-frivolous allegation of a protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">Doyle</span>, 273 Fed. Appx. at 964.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Disclosure 4 similarly criticizes Col. Tate's staffing decision during a particular event, specifically, Col. Tate's substitution of a "well-trained" physician's assistant for herself, a "not qualified" individual only trained as "a midwife," to serve on Dr. Hansen's medical team attending to the President of Afghanistan. According to Dr. Hansen, this constitutes a protected disclosure evincing how Col. Tate abused her authority because Col. Tate was "disregard[ing] medical ethics in appointing herself to a nursing position for which she was not qualified" and "jeopardizing the entire mission and calling into question Dr. Hansen's credibility." We note that Dr. Hansen provides no further explanation of what workplace duties or responsibilities the visit required, no details concerning minimum physician assistant-trained qualifications, and ultimately no discussion of <span class="Italic">how</span> "medical care afforded to the President of Afghanistan" was at risk to support this disclosure being nonfrivolous. Although close, accepting as true Dr. Hansen's allegations that Colonel Tate was only a <span id="Page_3643"></span>midwife and was not qualified to serve as a nurse to assist in treating the President suffices at this stage to meet the non-frivolous allegation standard regarding an abuse of authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that Dr. Hansen argues this incident constitutes gross mismanagement, his claims amount to a debatable dispute with management. Dr. Hansen further alleges that Colonel Tate contaminated a sterile area while treating the president of Afghanistan. Assuming this is true, it still does not establish gross mismanagement, which requires "such serious errors by the agency that a conclusion the agency erred is not debatable among reasonable people." <span class="Italic">White</span>, 391 F.3d at 1381-82. Col. Tate, like Dr. Hansen, was also responsible for modernizing the Afghanistan healthcare system, and was also responsible for supervising Dr. Hansen. Even if she made a mistake in the course of performing her duties by contaminating a sterile area, that alone is not sufficient to constitute gross mismanagement. Dr. Hansen does not explain the role of the physician's assistant or why the physician's assistant was a necessary part of the treatment team. Indeed, given that Col. Tate served as Dr. Hansen's supervisor, it seems reasonable for Col. Tate to be present during the treatment of Afghanistan's leaders.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Disclosure 5</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Hansen avers that "[the AJ] erred by failing to analyze Disclosure 5 as a separate and distinct disclosure" because the disclosure of "the <span class="Italic">aggregate effect</span> of [Col.] Tate's numerous abuses of authority" constitutes a protected disclosure. Having considered each of the allegations found in Disclosures 1-3 as separately constituting unreviewable policy concerns, we hold that Dr. Hansen's "aggregate theory," even if it might be a valid legal theory, fails as a matter of fact. The one potential surviving issue (Disclosure 4) has no other claim with which to aggregate. Because, however, it is barely conceivable that Dr. Hansen is arguing that the alleged facts of Disclosure 4 stand alone as a claim in Disclosure 5, we also remand solely for a determination whether the allegations of Disclosure 4, if factually accurate, would justify a claim under Disclosure 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Dr. Hansen's Aggregate Theory</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Hansen's "aggregate affect" theory relating generally to Disclosures 1-7 fares no better. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pet'r's Br. 25 ("[Col.] Tate's numerous decisions, including staff restructuring, threatening to transfer Dr. Hansen, and placing herself in a position for which she is not qualified...jeopardized the [Army's] mission...in the Afghanistan healthcare system."). Dr. Hansen fails to cite any precedent, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. at 25-30, nor do we find any, supporting his theory that aggregating several disclosures related to policy disputes somehow transforms the individual disclosures into something protected under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), <span class="Italic">see Lachance</span>, 174 F.3d at 1381 ("[t]he proper test is...could a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee reasonably conclude that the actions of the [G]overnment evidence [a &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) violation].").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered Dr. Hansen's remaining arguments and find them unpersuasive. We affirm the Final Decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board as to all disclosures except for Disclosures 4 and 5. We reverse and remand Disclosures 4 and 5 solely on the issue of Dr. Hansen's alleged abuse of authority premised on whether Col. Tate is a registered nurse....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In concluding that Dr. Hessami's disclosures were not entitled to protection, the Board found that the substance of the disclosures constituted "disagreement over questions of policy" and "evidence of robust debate on how effectiveness of the Hep[atitis] C care should be measured and how disputes concerning such treatment should be managed." However, in enacting the WPEA in 2012, Congress made clear that policy decisions and disclosable misconduct under the WPA are not mutually exclusive. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. REP. NO. 112-155, at 7-8 (2012), <span class="Italic">as reprinted in</span> 2012 U.S.C.C.A.N. 589, 595-96. The fact that there was an ongoing debate about the most effective and efficient means for providing HCV care to patients does not exclude allegations of misconduct about such care from whistleblower protection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the substance of Dr. Hessami's allegations could not amount to misconduct, the Board assumed, based on the testimony of agency witnesses as cited in the opinion, that Dr. Nichols's prescribing choices were clinically justified, and that this should have been known to Dr. Hessami. That assumption was impermissible at the stage of the proceedings, where the question is the sufficiency of Dr. Hessami's allegations to invoke the Board's jurisdiction. Regardless of whether the agency may ultimately prove on the merits that Dr. Nichols's prescribing decisions were discernibly reasonable, Dr. Hessami has adequately alleged a reasonable belief that they were not. The issue should therefore be resolved at a hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">O'Donnell v. USDA</span>, 120 MSPR 94, 99-100 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15, 2013 MSPB 69 (2013) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">O'Donnell v. MSPB</span>, 561 Fed. Appx. 926 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>), declined to upset a suspension for insubordination imposed when the appellant disagreed, and voiced to others his disagreement, about an agency contracting decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well-settled that statutory protection for whistleblowers "is not a weapon in arguments over policy or a shield for insubordinate conduct. Policymakers and administrators have every right to expect loyal professional service from subordinates...." <span class="Italic">LaChance v. White</span>, 174 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999). In this case, the appellant repeatedly and vaguely objects to NRCS's ineligibility ruling as "contrary to policy," "not supported by official program policy," inconsistent with "NRCS civil rights policy," and so forth. This is exactly the type of fairly debatable policy dispute that does not constitute gross mismanagement. <span class="Italic">See White v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 391 F.3d 1377, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (for a lawful policy decision to constitute gross mismanagement, its impropriety must not be "debatable among reasonable people"). Nor has the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that the eligibility determination at issue was unlawful. The appellant has submitted materials describing the agency's Conservation Reserve Program, but none of those materials limit the agency's discretion in making eligibility determinations; nor do they require the agency to extend the program's benefits to every property that meets the eligibility criteria.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the Federal Circuit has found that an employee's disagreement with an agency ruling or adjudication does not constitute a protected disclosure even if that ruling was legally incorrect. <span class="Italic">Meuwissen v. Department of the Interior</span>, 234 F.3d 9, 13-14 (Fed. Cir. 2000).[5] An erroneous agency ruling is not a "violation of law." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 13. Such rulings are corrected through the appeals process--not through insubordination and policy battles between employees and their supervisors. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 14. There are a large number of federal agencies, from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of Veterans Affairs to the Social Security Administration to the Merit Systems Protection Board, that rule on citizens' applications for benefits or redress every day. The orderly administration of these agencies requires that, for better or for worse, supervisors and managers have the final say in such rulings. A subordinate's refusal to abide his supervisor's instructions in this regard supplants the orderly appeals process with chaotic agency in-fighting. Such insubordination is not protected by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span>, 234 F.3d at 12-13, was legislatively overruled by the WPEA to the extent that the court found that the appellant did not make a "disclosure" because the administrative ruling with which he disagreed was already publically known. Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012, &#x00A7; 101(b)(2)(C) (codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(1)(B) (2012)). Nevertheless, the WPEA did not disturb the court's more general finding that erroneous administrative rulings are not the type of danger or wrongdoing that whistleblower protections were meant to address. We remain bound by the court's finding in that regard, and we believe that it was correct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">O'Donnell</span> was affirmed on review, <span class="Italic">O'Donnell v. MSPB</span>, 561 Fed. Appx. 926, 927-30 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. O'Donnell's allegations of retaliation by the National Resource Conservation Service stem from his role as a soil conservationist overseeing agency programs and helping private landowners apply conservation practices to their land. This role includes determining whether customers and their land meet the Department of Agriculture's ("the agency's") eligibility criteria for government assistance. In spring of 2005, Mr. O'Donnell inspected a landowner's property and determined that it was eligible under the agency's Conservation Reserve Program. The landowner's application to the Farm Service Agency ("FSA") was approved on November 21, 2005, and the landowner began work on the project shortly thereafter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. O'Donnell's supervisor disagreed with the eligibility determination and had the FSA terminate the contract with the landowner. The landowner appealed the revocation of the contract within the FSA. At the hearing on the landowner's appeal, Mr. O'Donnell ignored his supervisor's assessment and testified that the landowner should prevail in his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency thereafter proposed a 5-day suspension for Mr. O'Donnell based on his failure to respect his supervisor's decision. After considering Mr. O'Donnell's response to the proposed suspension, the agency reduced the suspension to 3 days....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that Mr. O'Donnell failed to demonstrate that he made disclosures that he could have "reasonably believed" evidenced a violation of a law, rule, or regulation. The WPA defines protected disclosures as:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a formal or informal communication or transmission, but <span class="Italic">does not include a communication concerning policy decisions that lawfully exercise discretionary authority</span> unless the employee or applicant providing the disclosure <span class="Italic">reasonably</span> believes that the disclosure evidences--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3"><span id="Page_3644"></span>(i)&#x2003;any violation of any law, rule, or regulation; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(D) (emphasis added). This court recognizes that "[t]he WPA is not a weapon in arguments over policy or a shield for insubordinate conduct. Policymakers and administrators have every right to expect loyal, professional service from subordinates who do not bear the burden of responsibility." <span class="Italic">Lachance v. White</span>, 174 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, Mr. O'Donnell's supervisor was allowed to lawfully exercise discretionary authority to determine whether property is eligible for the Conservation Reserve Program. <span class="Italic">See</span> 16 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3831b(a)(2) ("The Secretary [of Agriculture] shall ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that owners and operators in each State have an equitable opportunity to participate in the program established under this section."). Even assuming Mr. O'Donnell's supervisor's eligibility determination was subject to disagreement, an exercise of discretionary authority is not a "violation of the law." <span class="Italic">Accord</span> S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 7 (2012), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 2012 U.S.C.C.A.N. 589, 595 ("[a]n employee who discloses general philosophical or policy disagreements with agency decisions or actions should not be protected as a whistleblower.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. O'Donnell's argument that he reasonably believed that his supervisor's eligibility determination was a violation of the law is unpersuasive. The Conservation Reserve Program law grants discretionary authority to the agency, and Mr. O'Donnell's supervisor was in charge of exercising that discretion. <span class="Italic">See</span> 16 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3831b(a)(2). No reasonable person could think exercising that discretion is a violation of the law. Mr. O'Donnell's supervisor even took the time to explain his rationale in writing. <span class="Italic">See</span> Appellee's App'x at 21. As the Board explained in its decision, "[t]he orderly administration of [the Board] requires that, for better or for worse, supervisors and managers have the final say in such rulings. A subordinate's refusal to abide by his supervisor's instructions in this regard supplants the orderly appeals process with chaotic agency in-fighting." <span class="Italic">O'Donnell,</span> No. CH-1221-12-0436-W-1, slip op. 7-8. Although the Board did not explicitly say it was performing a "reasonable belief" analysis, we see no basis on which to overturn the Board's decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. O'Donnell's argument that the Board improperly relied on <span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span> is also unpersuasive. The legislature's only objection to the holding in <span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span> was the idea that "disclosures of information already known are not protected." S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 5. The legislature included language to overrule this holding in the revised statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(1) ("A disclosure shall not be excluded from subsection (b)(8) because...(B) the disclosure revealed information that had been previously disclosed...."). The same Senate Report cited by Mr. O'Donnell goes on to state that "an employee who discloses general philosophical or policy disagreements with agency decisions or actions should not be protected as a whistleblower." S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 7. Indeed, the legislature also included language to make sure a supervisor's discretionary decisions are not challenged by subordinates. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(D) ("'[D]isclosure' means a formal or informal communication or transmission, but <span class="Italic">does not include policy decisions that lawfully exercise discretionary authority</span>....") (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, although Mr. O'Donnell may have subjectively believed that his supervisor's eligibility determination was erroneous, he could not have reasonably believed that it constituted a violation of law. Mr. O'Donnell has therefore failed to make a non-frivolous argument that his statements are protected by the WPA, and the Board properly dismissed his appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Daniels v. MSPB</span>, 832 F.3d 1049, 1054-56 (9th Cir. 2016), addressing disagreements with policy decisions, added:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Daniels's disclosure of ALJ Kays's decision is not a disclosure protected under the WPA. For WPA protections to apply, the employee must reasonably believe that the disclosed information evidences either (1) a "violation of any law, rule, or regulation" or (2) "gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A). An agency ruling or adjudication, even if erroneous, cannot reasonably suffice under either prong.[9] An ALJ, who makes an erroneous decision, does not violate the law (or engage in gross mismanagement) any more than does a district judge who is subsequently reversed on appeal.[10]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;Daniels also faults the Board for failing to conduct a "reasonable belief" analysis concerning his disclosures. However, the initial decision of the administrative judge concluded that "a reasonable person with facts readily ascertainable to him would not find that a violation of law or regulation occurred or that the ALJ authorized a gross waste of funds." Further, the Board's conclusion that Daniels's claims were frivolous necessarily incorporates the conclusion that Daniels's claims were objectively unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;We distinguish statements that disclose malfeasance, fraud, or the like by adjudicators. Such disclosures may indeed be subject to WPA protections. <span class="Italic">See Cassidy v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 2012 M.S.P.B. 60, 118 M.S.P.R. 74, 78 (2012) (finding that petitioner made a non-frivolous allegation when he complained that an immigration judge's "conduct and unnecessary delays violated the due process rights of detained aliens"). Daniels has not made any such disclosure here. Instead, he has merely expressed his disagreement with an ALJ's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Daniels is correct that Congress (in passing the WPEA) explicitly superseded <span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span>. S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 5, 2012 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 593. However, Congress's contention with <span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span> was its holding that "disclosures of information already known are not protected."[12] <span class="Italic">Id</span>., 2012 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 593. As the Board later recognized in <span class="Italic">O'Donnell</span>, "the WPEA did not disturb [<span class="Italic">Meuwissen's</span>] more general finding that erroneous administrative rulings are not the type of danger or wrongdoing that whistleblower protections were meant to address." 120 M.S.P.R. at 99 n.5. Thus, we do not undermine congressional intent nor do we improperly limit the definition of "disclosure" by concluding that an erroneous agency ruling or adjudication is not a violation of law for purposes of the WPA. Indeed, in enacting the WPEA, Congress explicitly stated that it only intended to protect disclosures "of certain types of wrongdoing."[13] S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 5, 2012 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 593. An agency ruling or adjudication, even if erroneous, is not the type of "wrongdoing" contemplated by the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;As a result, the WPEA established 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(1)(B) to make clear that a disclosure does not lose its protected status when "the disclosure revealed information that had been previously disclosed."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13]&#x2003;The types of wrongdoing contemplated by Congress are "the kinds of misconduct listed in section 2302(b)(8)." S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 10-11, 2012 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 598-99. The WPEA did not amend section 2302(b)(8) and, therefore, did not change....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ALJ King's directive to use micro-purchase cards (instead of OF-347) to order the services of interpreters was not a violation of the law for purposes of the WPA. Instead, ALJ King's directive represents a policy decision. The WPA explicitly excludes "communication[s] concerning policy decisions" from its definition of "disclosure."[14] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(D). Thus, Daniels's communications concerning procedures for ordering interpreter services do not qualify as disclosures under the plain text of the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[14]&#x2003;Under the WPA, communications concerning policy decisions do not qualify as protected disclosures unless the employee "reasonably believes that the disclosure evidences (i) any violation of any law, rule, or regulation; or (ii) gross management, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(D). We agree with the Board's conclusion that "there is no evidence in the record that would support a reasonable belief that the directive...amounts to a violation of any law, rule, or regulation."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Traced below is the law predating and modified by the 2012 legislation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Willis v. USDA</span>, 141 F.3d 1139, 1143-44 (Fed. Cir. 1998), the employee's job was to report farmers who did not abide by conservation requirements. Some of the employee's findings were appealed by farmers who prevailed in those appeals. The employee argued the correctness of his original findings to his supervisors. The reviewing court determined that the employee's advocacy was unprotected:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The purpose of the WPA is to encourage government personnel to disclose government wrongdoing to persons who may be in a position to remedy the problem without fearing retaliatory action by their supervisors or those who might be harmed by the disclosures. <span class="Italic">See Marano</span>, 2 F.3d at 1142. However, "[c]riticism directed to the wrongdoers themselves is not normally viewable as whistleblowing." <span class="Italic">Horton v. Department of Navy,</span> 66 F.3d 279, 282 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Willis's complaints to supervisors are not disclosures of the type the WPA was designed to encourage and protect. Discussion and even disagreement with supervisors over job-related activities is a normal part of most occupations. It is entirely ordinary for an employee to fairly and reasonably disagree with a supervisor who overturns the employee's decision. In complaining to his supervisors, Willis has done no more than voice his dissatisfaction with his superiors' decision. He has taken no action to bring an issue to the attention of authorities in a position to correct fraudulent or illegal activity. Further, <span id="Page_3645"></span>there is no evidence that Willis made disclosures that would lead his supervisors to rationally believe that they might be subjected to discipline. Willis did not contact or complain to a higher authority until after he had already retired in 1993. The WPA is designed to protect employees who risk their own personal job security for the benefit of the public. <span class="Italic">Horton</span>, 66 F.3d at 282. Willis took no such risk. Because Willis's disclosures were not made to persons in a position to correct the alleged abuse, and because the disclosures did not evidence an intent to raise the issue with higher authorities who were in a position to correct the alleged wrongdoing, Willis's disclosures to his immediate supervisors are not protected disclosures for the purposes of the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Willis next argues that the mere finding that seven farms were out of compliance, by itself, constitutes a protected disclosure under the WPA. To this end, Willis cites this court's opinion in <span class="Italic">Marano v. Department of Justice,</span> which states that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[t]he WPA, however, also applies to the situation where a government employee discloses information that is closely related to the employee's day-to-day responsibilities, such that structuring a remedy to the situation revealed in the disclosure could foreseeably affect the whistleblower.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2 F.3d at 1142. This argument hangs by a weak thread which breaks at the first pull. The <span class="Italic">Marano</span> case involved a government employee, who upon making a protected disclosure of mismanagement by his supervisors, was reassigned to another office as a result of a personnel reorganization undertaken to remedy the mismanagement brought to light by Marano's disclosure. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1141. This court held in <span class="Italic">Marano</span> that, regardless of whether the adverse personnel action was taken in retaliation for the protected disclosure, or was merely an administrative result of the disclosure, the whistleblower need only demonstrate that the protected disclosure was one of the factors that affected the personnel action in order to maintain an IRA with the Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1143. The <span class="Italic">Marano</span> court was concerned with the possibility that allowing agencies to reason "that the personnel action was grounded in bases 'independent' of the actual protected disclosure could easily be used as a ruse to eviscerate the WPA's protection." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1142. Contrary to Willis's assertion, the <span class="Italic">Marano</span> court did not announce a blanket rule entitling employees to assert that the required performance of their day-to-day responsibilities could in any way constitute a protected disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Willis would have this court hold that nearly every report by a government employee concerning the possible breach of law or regulation by a private party is a protected disclosure. This is surely not the goal of the WPA. As we have stated previously and reiterate, the WPA is intended to protect government employees who risk their own personal job security for the advancement of the public good by disclosing abuses by government personnel. Part of Willis's job duties as a DC was to review the conservation compliance of farms within his area. In reporting some of them as being out of compliance, he did no more than carry out his required everyday job responsibilities. This is expected of all government employees pursuant to the fiduciary obligation which every employee owes to his employer. Willis cannot be said to have risked his personal job security by merely performing his required duties. Determining whether or not farms were out of compliance was part of his job performance and in no way did it place Willis at personal risk for the benefit of the public good and cannot itself constitute a protected disclosure under the WPA.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">At times analysis of what constitutes an internal debate over policy became rather attenuated in the decisions of the Federal Circuit. A nonprecedential decision, <span class="Italic">Schutte v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 203 Fed. Appx. 338, 341 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP), said of an allegation that the agency improperly employed appointing authority: "Further Ms. Schutte alleges violations under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 315.401 and 300.603, which are both permissive in nature, and thus a dispute under these sections cannot, as a matter of law, constitute a protected disclosure under the WPA. For these reasons, this court affirms the Board's decision."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A difference in analysis of the "normal" disagreements that occur among staff members was applied by the Ninth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Coons v. Sec'y of Treasury</span>, 383 F.3d 879, 389-90 (9th Cir. 2004), involving a case that included a whistleblowing reprisal allegation, that traveled from the Board as a mixed case and then onto the regional circuit court of appeals. The Ninth Circuit returned the appeal to the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;Taxpayer D</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Coons also alleges he made a protected disclosure regarding a possible fraudulent refund for Taxpayer D. The Merit Systems Protection Board held that even if Coons made the statements he alleges he made to Ah Nee, the disclosures are not protected. The Board held that the event</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">amounted to a normal disagreement between managers over a debatable matter of internal policy, and that a disinterested observer, with knowledge of the essential fact known to and readily ascertainable by the appellant, could not reasonably have concluded that it evidenced government wrong doing of the type contemplated by the [Whistleblower Protection Act].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Coons made disclosures regarding the manual processing of a large refund that he believed to be fraudulent for Taxpayer D under highly irregular circumstances. Coons's disclosure cannot reasonably be characterized as a "normal disagreement between managers over a debatable matter of internal policy." A "disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts...reasonably [would] conclude" that a disclosure alleging that the IRS, whose mission is to collect taxes, improperly processed a large, fraudulent refund for a wealthy taxpayer is an allegation of "gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, [or] an abuse of authority." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8); <span class="Italic">Lachance</span>, 174 F.3d at 1381. Therefore, we hold that the Merit Systems Protection Board's interpretation of this allegation as a policy disagreement, rather than a protected disclosure, is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">D.&#x2003;Remarks to Office of Inspector General</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Coons disclosed to investigators from the Office of the Inspector General ("OIG") that "IRS senior officials interfered in some cases of wealthy or influential taxpayers resulting in preferential treatment." Coons admits that "he did not tell the agents who was giving or receiving the alleged preference" or any other details. He also admits that he (is pursue the matter further with the of Inspector General.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, these statements, though unspecific, do satisfy the requirements of the Whistleblower Protection Act. A disclosure is protected by the Act if "a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainably by the employee [could] reasonably conclude that the actions of the government evidence gross mismanagement," a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a violation of any law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Lachance</span>, 174 F.3d at 1381.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">IRS senior officials interfering in the tax cases of certain wealthy individuals is certainly an abuse of authority and a violation of law.

If Congress intended such a significant intrusion into the settled law governing federal employment relationships, we believe it would have spoken more clearly.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It could be difficult to define what is and what is not a routine, or unprotected but spirited, disagreement among an appellant and a supervisor, as the Board suggested in <span class="Italic">Ingram v.
