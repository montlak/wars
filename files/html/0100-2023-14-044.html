<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-45"><span class="space">8.</span> Beepers and Standby Time</h4>
<p class="noindent">To beep or not to beep? (What were beepers, anyway?) <span class="Italic">AFGE Council of Marine Corps Locals and Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps, Washington</span>, 39 FLRA 773, 777-82 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Marine Corps</span>), <span class="Italic">enforced</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy v. FLRA</span>, 962 F.2d 1066, 1067 (D.C. Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">post</span>, considered the proposal: "Employees will not be required to carry or respond to 'beepers' unless they are in a duty and pay status." The proposal was negotiable. At issue was standby pay entitlement for employees who were beeped to action during what otherwise would be their free time:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons that follow, we find that the proposal does not conflict with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431 or with the Agency's rights under: (1) section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute to direct and discipline employees; (2) section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute to assign work; or (3) section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute to determine the technology, methods and means of performing work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As indicated by the Union, the bargaining unit includes both GS and WG employees. Non-supervisory WG employees are covered by the FLSA.... Non-supervisory GS employees, however, may be excluded from coverage of the FLSA based on the nature of the duties of their positions.... Nothing in the record before us indicates whether the proposal applies to employees covered by the FLSA, employees excluded from coverage under the FLSA, or both. We note, however, that the Agency relied solely on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431 to support its claim that the proposal is inconsistent with an applicable government-wide regulation. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431 applies only to employees covered by the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.101. Consequently, as the Agency relies on a Government-wide regulation that applies only to employees covered by the FLSA, we assume for the purposes of this decision that the employees involved are WG and GS employees covered by the FLSA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Proposal Does Not Conflict With 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">For WG and GS employees who are covered by the FLSA, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431 establishes criteria for determining when time spent in standby or in an on-call status is considered hours of work under the FLSA as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">&#x00A7; 551.431 <span class="Italic">Time spent on standby duty or in an on-call status.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-3">(a)&#x2003;An employee will be considered on duty and time spent on standby duty shall be considered hours of work if:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(1)&#x2003;The employee is restricted to an agency's premises, or so close thereto that the employee cannot use the time effectively for his or her own purposes; or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(2)&#x2003;The employee, although not restricted to the agency's premises:</p>
<p class="noindent-4">(i)&#x2003;Is restricted to his or her living quarters or designated post of duty;</p>
<p class="noindent-4">(ii)&#x2003;Has his or her activities substantially limited; and</p>
<p class="noindent-4">(iii)&#x2003;Is required to remain in a state of readiness to perform work.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(b)&#x2003;An employee will be considered off duty and time spent in an on-call status shall not be considered hours of work if:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(1)&#x2003;The employee is allowed to leave a telephone number or to carry an electronic device for the purpose of being contacted, even though the employee is required to remain within a reasonable call-back radius; or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(2)&#x2003;The employee is allowed to make arrangements such that any work which may arise during the on-call period will be performed by another person.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431 distinguishes standby status (paid) from on-call status (non-paid) based on the extent to which an employee's freedom of movement and activity are restricted and not on whether the employee is required or permitted to carry an electronic paging device or beeper. It is also clear, however, that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431 prohibits payment to an employee who is placed in an on-call status even if the employee is required to carry a beeper and remain within a reasonable call-back mileage radius from the activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In other words, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431 an agency has discretion to place employees in a standby (paid) or on-call (non-paid) status. In order to be in a standby (paid) status under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431, an employee must either be restricted to an agency's premises (or close thereto) or, as relevant here, be restricted to his or her living quarters or designated post of duty, have his or her activities substantially limited, and be in a state of readiness to perform work. We also note, however, that nothing in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431 precludes an agency from requiring employees to carry beepers during their regular duty hours or while they are in a standby status within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431. Thus, if an employee is placed in a standby status, as defined by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431, the fact that the employee is permitted or required to carry and respond to a beeper does not thereby change the employee's status from standby (paid) to on-call (non-paid). On the other hand, if an employee is placed in an on-call (non-paid) status within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431, that is, where the employee's freedom of movement and activity are not substantially restricted, and the employee is not expected to remain in a state of readiness to perform work, the fact that the employee is required to carry a beeper and remain within a reasonable call-back mileage radius from the activity does not thereby change the employee's status from on-call (non-paid) to standby (paid). In fact, as stated previously, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431 an employee in an on-call status may not be paid regardless of whether the employee must carry and respond to a beeper.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency's claim, we find that nothing in the Union's proposal requires the Agency to pay employees merely for carrying and responding to beepers. Instead, the proposal concerns only the circumstances in which the Agency may require the use of beepers. Moreover, even assuming that this proposal obligates the Agency to exercise its discretion to place an employee in a standby status whenever the Agency requires the employee to carry and respond to a beeper, that obligation is not inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431. That is, an employee placed in standby status within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431 is entitled to be paid for such standby duty because the employee's activities are substantially limited, and because the employee must remain in a state of readiness to perform work, not because the employee is required to carry and respond to a beeper.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, as nothing in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431 precludes an agency from exercising its discretion to place employees required to carry and respond to beepers in a standby instead of an on-call status, we reject the Agency's contention that the proposal requires the Agency to pay employees solely for carrying and responding to beepers. Consequently, we conclude that the Agency has not established that the proposal is inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Proposal Does Not Interfere With the Agency's Rights to Direct and Discipline Employees, to Assign Work, or to Determine the Technology, Methods and Means of Performing Work</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to direct employees means the right to supervise and guide employees in the performance of their duties on the job.... The proposal, however, does not concern the supervision and guidance of employees in the performance of their duties on the job. Instead, the proposal concerns the pay status of employees who are required to carry beepers. Consequently, the proposal does not directly interfere with management's right under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute to supervise and guide employees in the performance of their duties on the job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, nothing in this proposal prohibits the Agency from directing employees to carry and respond to beepers. As we concluded previously, nothing in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431 precludes the use of beepers by employees who are in a paid status. In fact, if an agency's facilities are widely dispersed geographically, the use of beepers may be the only effective way an agency can communicate with employees when they are on the job. Similarly, if an employee on standby lacks a phone or the employee's phone is inoperative or constantly in use by other family members, the use of a beeper may be the only effective way to notify that employee of a recall order. Although the proposal precludes the use of beepers by <span id="page_651"></span>employees who are off duty in a non-paid status, the Agency retains the discretion under this proposal to place employees in a paid status, and to require those employees to carry and respond to beepers. Consequently, the proposal does not directly interfere with the Agency's right under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute to direct employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal also does not directly interfere with the Agency's rights to assign work and discipline employees. We note first that the Agency's claim that the proposal interferes with its right to assign work is based on its view that the proposal would prevent it from augmenting its workforce by recalling employees to work. Contrary to the Agency's position, however, the proposal does not prevent the Agency from recalling employees to work. The proposal concerns only the pay status of employees who are required to carry beepers. In other words, if the Agency chooses to require employees to carry beepers, the requirement to carry and respond to beepers is conditioned on placing the employee in a paid status. The Agency has not demonstrated, and it is not otherwise apparent, that its rights to assign work and discipline employees encompass the right to require employees who are in an on-call (non-duty, non-pay) status, to carry and respond to beepers....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Agency's argument that "[t]he net effect of the proposal is that employees can only be recalled to work if they are already at work." Even assuming, as claimed by the Agency, that the proposal requires the Agency to place employees in a standby status, we note that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431 provides that employees may serve in a standby status in their residences so long as their activities and freedom of movement are substantially restricted and so long as the employee remains in a state of readiness to perform work. Obviously, employees serving standby in their residences are not already at work. Moreover, we note that nothing in the proposal permits an employee to fail or refuse to respond to a recall order regardless of whether the employee is notified by telephone or by use of a beeper. Thus, as the proposal does not insulate employees from the obligation to return to work pursuant to a recall order, the proposal does not prevent the Agency from disciplining employees who fail or refuse to respond to a recall order however received.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we reject the Agency's claim that the proposal interferes with its right to determine the technology, methods and means of performing work within the meaning of section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. Even assuming that the requirement to carry and respond to a beeper bears a technological relationship to accomplishing or furthering the performance of the Agency's work, nothing in the proposal precludes the Agency from using beepers to recall employees to work. Rather, as stated previously, the proposal concerns only the pay status of employees who are required to carry beepers....</p>
<p class="noindent">Affirming FLRA, the D.C. Circuit said of the beeper dispute, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy v. FLRA</span>, 962 F.2d 1066, 1068-69 (D.C. Cir. 1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The union is not asking to bargain about whether employees should be required to carry beepers; it wants to negotiate about whether employees carrying beepers at the Marine Corps' behest ought to get paid. The &#x00A7; 7106(a) right "to assign" work does not generally include ordering those who are not on paid status to perform tasks for their employer. This is the gist of the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">United States Department of Agriculture, Animal &#x0026; Plant Health Inspection Service</span>, 38 FLRA (No. 102) 1291 (1991), on which it relied in this case.... It is undisputed that the Corps alone may decide who to recall to work and when.... But the union's proposal, if accepted or imposed, would not deprive the Marine Corps of its options in this respect: the Corps could still require beepers and decide which employees among those carrying the devices (and being paid for doing so) it wished to recall. What the union's proposal affects here is the cost to the Corps of implementing its prerogatives through these means....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As far as compensation is concerned, the Corps argues that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431 precludes it from agreeing to pay employees for carrying beepers. This is partly true. The regulation distinguishes between off-duty employees who are on standby status and those who are on-call. Standby employees are entitled to compensation; on-call employees are not. To be considered on standby status, there must be significant restrictions placed on the employee's activities. The Corps' beepers, to be effective, do restrict employees. Signals, broadcast from radio transmitters mounted on towers, have a range of only 20 miles or so. But requiring employees carrying beepers to stay within the range of the transmitters apparently is not enough of a restriction to place them into the standby category. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431(b)(1). So, the argument continues, the Corps could not compensate employees for carrying beepers and responding to pages--if that were all the Corps required of them. If incorporated in a collective bargaining agreement, the union's proposal would present the Corps with but two options: place more restrictions on these employees, such as requiring them "to remain in a state of readiness" while they are at home (<span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 551.431(a)(2)(iii)), thereby qualifying them for standby pay status; or drop the beeper plan altogether.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's response is that under the regulation the Corps has rather wide discretion to designate which employees it wishes to place in standby status, a point the Corps does not deny.... There is thus no impediment to the Corps' imposing on employees carrying beepers whatever additional restrictions are needed to qualify them for compensation. Those restrictions would presumably enhance, rather than detract from, the Corps' ability to get workers back to the job in short order. As the Authority concluded, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431 does not bar the Corps from agreeing to the union's proposal. It simply makes the beeper program more costly for the Corps and more onerous, but more lucrative, for the Corps' employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the effect of increasing the cost of the beeper program, one sentence in the Corps' brief asserts that the economic burden would be "substantial."... Even if this were a valid point,...the Corps has not backed it up with any supporting data. The Authority explains why. The Corps never raised this objection in the administrative proceedings. We therefore would not consider it in any event. <span class="Italic">EEOC v. FLRA</span>, 476 U.S. 19, 23-24, 106 S. Ct. 1678, 1680-1681, 90 L. Ed.2d 19 (1986) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">Beeper disputes resurfaced with <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 644 and Dept. of Labor, OSHA, Norfolk</span>, 40 FLRA 831, 831-32 (1991), resolving to be nonnegotiable proposal sections (2), that "[t]he use of beepers will be on a voluntary basis only," and (3) that "[i]f the employee chooses to utilize the paging device, the requirement for calling in, unless paged, will be removed." The agency established that the use of beepers enhanced its ability to respond in emergencies; accordingly, precluding their use interfered with the agency's methods and means of performing its work. The proposals were not appropriate arrangements because their implementation would seriously impair the agency's ability to respond during emergencies. <span class="Italic">Marine Corps</span> was distinguished because the dispute in that case involved pay status rather than the issue of whether employees would be required to use beepers.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NFFE Forest Serv. Council and USDA, Forest Serv.</span>, 45 FLRA 1204, 1210-12 (1992), presented the question of whether the union could compel negotiations over a proposal for standby pay for employees assigned to closed fire camps. The OPM regulations governing standby pay require that employees who receive it be in a state of "readiness." It seemed agreed that, although the employees might be confined to the fire camps, there were periods of time that were their own for purposes of rest and recuperation. Since the employees were not then in a state of readiness, the regulatory conditions were not met and the proposal was inconsistent with government-wide regulations.
