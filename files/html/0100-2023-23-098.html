<p class="Body-Text">An agency calculating back pay must deduct any payments, including payments from the federal retirement system, that an employee received from the government in error. <span class="Italic">Niday v. Dept. of Army</span>, 42 MSPR 673, 678 (1990) (considering a petition to enforce a settlement agreement); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hudson v. DHUD</span> (Fed. Cir. 1994 NP No. 94-3302) (debt to the retirement fund can exceed the back pay due to the employee); <span class="Italic">Seybold v. OPM</span>, 63 MSPR 465, 470 (1994) (when separation from the federal service is reversed, the lump sum payment for a retirement credit received by the separated employee becomes a debt due to the retirement fund; the agency's obligation to use a back pay offset to return the debt does not preclude the employee from seeking a waiver of the repayment); <span class="Italic">Okonski v. OPM</span>, 63 MSPR 446, 451 (1994) (discussion of deduction from back pay of retirement contributions employee would have made, status of deficiency as a debt subject to collection by agency, and consideration by OPM of an employee's request for a waiver of erroneous lump sum payment from OPM). A lump sum back pay award is not included in its totality in the calculation of annual average pay for retirement annuity purposes. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gremillion v. OPM</span>, 34 Fed. Appx. 793, 795 (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The statutory requirements concerning recoupment of withdrawn retirement contributions were explained, to a degree, in <span class="Italic">Cortez v. VA</span>, 27 MSPR 648, 650-53 (1985). A removal appeal was settled through substitution of a 180-day suspension. The settlement provided for reimbursement to the government of funds the appellant withdrew from his retirement account. The settlement agreement also provided for the parties to establish a repayment schedule. VA balked at implementing the settlement and required that, pursuant to its understanding of OPM regulations governing back pay, the appellant repay the proceeds of the settlement toward the retirement debt and then periodically repay the balance due to the government. The appellant argued that there should be no immediate offset for the retirement funds; instead, he should receive the back pay called for by the settlement and then periodically repay the retirement debt. The Board secured an advisory opinion from GAO, and a later protest from OPM, and then determined that the settlement agreement could be implemented in accordance with its terms and the appellant's interpretation of those terms:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We appreciate the assistance provided to the Board by the General Accounting Office. Based upon our review of its opinion and of the record in this proceeding, we specifically adopt the following reasoning contained in the GAO opinion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]n <span class="Italic">Angel F. Rivera</span>, B-213539, November 20, 1984, 64 Comp. Gen. __, [GAO decided that] an employee who has been separated and has withdrawn his retirement contributions must repay that amount when he is ordered retroactively reinstated. When reinstated under the Back Pay Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596, an employee is regarded as never having been separated and there is no break in service. Therefore, the earlier withdrawal of retirement contributions becomes an erroneous payment which must be repaid unless repayment is waived by OPM. 5 USC &#x00A7; 8346(b) and 5 CFR Subparts M and N of Part 831 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Thus, employees who are reinstated retroactively do not have the option available to employees who are voluntarily separated from the service and later reemployed under a new appointment. The latter have the option of keeping their refunded retirement contributions and forfeiting credit for the years of service upon which those contributions were based, or at any time they may pay back their contributions with interest, in lump sum or installments, and get credit for the years of service upon which those contributions are based. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 8334(d); and FPM Supplement 831-1, Subchapter 4, September 21, 1981. No such option is available to employees retroactively reinstated under the Back Pay Act. In this case it is not disputed that the retirement contributions must be paid back. The question is must the amount of refunded retirement contributions be offset against the amount of backpay owed Mr. Cortez, or may he receive his backpay award and repay the amount owed, plus interest, by installment payments? The issue of repaying refunded retirement contributions by payroll deductions rather than by offset from backpay awards was not specifically considered in our decision in <span class="Italic">Rivera.</span> As the facts in <span class="Italic">Rivera</span> suggest, repayment by installment would not have been a reasonable option in that case. Mr. Rivera owed the retirement fund in excess of $34,000 and owed the Government an additional amount [in] excess of $29,000 for refunds of other erroneous payments such as severance pay, lump sum leave, etc. His total indebtedness, therefore, exceeded $63,000. More importantly, shortly after his reinstatement, he suffered a series of heart attacks, used all of his leave, and in a matter of months retired on disability. Under such circumstances, repayment of erroneously refunded retirement contributions by installment payments rather than by offset from his backpay award would not have been consistent with the Government's interest in recovering the amount owed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The circumstances in this case are quite different. The retirement contributions refunded to Mr. Cortez were substantially less, amounting to only $11,775.19. Further, Mr. Cortez has been reinstated and is now paying back the amount owed through deductions of $100 per pay period. Unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">Rivera</span>, there is no reason to doubt the continuing ability of Mr. Cortez to pay the full amount due through payroll deductions. Where it is reasonable to assume that the Government will be able to recover the full amount due the retirement fund, plus interest, through payroll deductions, we believe it is consistent with the remedial purposes of the Back Pay Act to permit such an agreement. Employees who have been discharged because of an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action may undergo periods of unemployment or employment at <span id="Page_4904"></span>rates substantially lower than rates previously earned while their discharges are being litigated. By the time a final decision ordering their reinstatement has been rendered, they may be financially hard pressed and have an immediate need for the backpay awards due them. Since interest on the amount due is assessed against the employee and paid to the retirement fund, such an arrangement would also be consistent with 5 USC &#x00A7; 8334(d). As noted above, that section permits employees who have been separated from the service and are later reemployed to repay their refunded retirement contributions, plus interest, in installment payments. Where there is a reasonable basis for assuming the Government will be able to collect the full amount of the debt, plus interest, we see no reason to deny employees who have been wrongfully discharged the same option extended to employees who have left the Government service and are later reemployed. The Government's interest will not be harmed because it will recover the debt, plus interest, and the financial burdens imposed on the wrongfully discharged employee will be alleviated. This, in our view, would be consistent with the purposes of both the Back Pay Act and the Civil Service Retirement Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In view of the above, we would interpose no objection to implementing the settlement agreement in this case. Of course, the retirement contributions owing for the period covered by the backpay award ($608.78), as well as the amounts owing for the refund of a lump sum leave payment, tax withholding, and medicare should be offset from the backpay award. However, we would have no objection to permitting Mr. Cortez to receive the remaining amount of backpay due, and to continue the repayment of his refunded retirement contributions, plus interest, through regular payroll deductions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the Board received the foregoing advice from GAO, OPM filed a motion to intervene in this matter. It contended that its regulations had been misinterpreted by GAO and that 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.805(e)(2) was intended to preclude the periodic repayment of lump sum credits when a terminated employee is reinstated. OPM's motion to intervene is GRANTED.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the relief which OPM requests is DENIED. Although the regulation involved is generally intended to require a deduction from the back pay award of lump sum retirement credits previously paid to a reinstated employee, other provisions of Title 5 and of OPM's regulations make a periodic repayment schedule lawful in the instant case. OPM has the statutory authority to waive recovery totally if recovery would, as here, be against equity and good conscience. 5 USC &#x00A7; 8346(b). Moreover, OPM's regulatory definition of equity and good conscience specifically provides that a recovery violates those standards when the employee "has relinquished a valuable right or changed positions for the worse...." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.1403. In this case, in exchange for the agency agreements to reinstate him and to allow for a periodic repayment schedule, the discharged employee agreed to suffer a 180-day suspension and to waive his potential claims for full back pay and attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, a waiver of the repayment could lawfully be granted by OPM and, even if denied, an adjusted recovery schedule could be allowed. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.1401. Therefore, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.805(e)(2), while generally precluding repayment schedules, does not operate as a total bar against provisions like those contained in the instant settlement agreement. Moreover, in this case which contained a discrimination allegation, the agency was authorized to enter into this settlement agreement by the broad grant of settlement authority conferred upon agencies in such actions by 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.271(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a result, we find that such a settlement agreement is not contrary to law and may be enforced where an agency, as in this mixed case, agrees to a settlement which includes a repayment schedule for lump sum retirement benefits and the employee, in consideration for that agreement, relinquishes or waives certain of his rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">More clearly, at least as to FERS, when an appellant withdrew retirement contributions after being removed, and the removal is reversed, the agency must cooperate in restoring the FERS account through repayment of the withdrawn contributions, <span class="Italic">Moore v. VA</span>, 109 MSPR 386, 390-91 &#x00B6; 10, 2008 MSPB 160 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...When the Board reverses an agency removal action, it can order all the benefits provided by the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Moore v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 22 (1999). The Back Pay Act provides that an employee affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, "for all purposes, is deemed to have performed service for the agency during that period [for which the personnel action was in effect]." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1). Further, under OPM's regulations, a refund of retirement contributions paid to an employee based on a separation that is subsequently found erroneous and canceled must be offset from the gross back pay award and returned to the retirement system, thereby removing the legal basis for the refund and allowing the service credit to be restored. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(e)(2). Put another way, a Board order reversing the agency's action removing the appellant from the Police Officer position and ordering back pay under the Back Pay Act would render the refund of the appellant's retirement contributions erroneous and allow the service credit to be restored.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Moore</span> added, at 390 n.1:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By contrast, the statutes governing the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) provide that an employee under CSRS who has received a refund of retirement deductions covering service for which he may be allowed credit, and who becomes reemployed under CSRS, "may deposit the amount received, with interest." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(d)(1). The statutes governing FERS contain no analogous provision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rosario-Fabregas v. Dept. of Army</span>, NY-0752-10-0127-C-2 (NP 9/11/2014) (remanding for consideration by AJ of what remedy appellant should receive when agency allegedly misinformed him of his ability to restore TSP withdrawals).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Hardship withdrawals from the TSP are not remediable through the Back Pay Act or associated enforcement proceedings, <span class="Italic">Rittgers v. Dept. of Army</span>, 123 MSPR 31, 36-37 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10, 2015 MSPB 59 (2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second withdrawal occurred after the effective date of the first indefinite suspension. The negative consequences of this second withdrawal could be related to the appellant's indefinite suspension and could represent damages. <span class="Italic">See Giove v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 53, &#x00B6; 9 (2007). However, the instant appeal does not fall into one of the limited categories of cases in which the Board is authorized to award damages. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.202(b)-(d). The appellant has not identified any provision in the Back Pay Act or the FRTIB's regulations that would permit the Board to award this type of damages. Therefore, we find that he is not entitled to an order requiring contributions to his TSP account for the 6-month period following his second in-service hardship withdrawal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the administrative judge failed to address properly whether the agency was required to restore the funds he withdrew from his TSP account. The appellant cites 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.13(d) for the proposition that the agency was required to restore the $47,945.67 that he withdrew. In accordance with the FRTIB's regulations, employees who are separated from service are entitled to restore funds withdrawn from their TSP accounts at the time of their separations. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.13(d). The appellant's withdrawals were financial hardship in-service withdrawals. Because the appellant's withdrawals were in-service and not withdrawals upon separation, he was not entitled to restore the withdrawn funds. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.13(d). Even if this regulation was applicable, it allows an employee to restore withdrawn funds, but does not require any action by the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Crazy Thunder-Collier v. Department of the Interior</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 82, &#x00B6; 13 (2010).</p>
