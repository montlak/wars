<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-111"><span class="space">1.</span> Availability of Compensatory Damages</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The availability of compensatory damages was summarized by <span class="Italic">Wilson v. OPM</span>, DC-0831-13-0423-P-1 (NP 2/6/2015), denying damages in an appeal involving an annuity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An award of consequential damages is authorized in only two situations: where the Board orders corrective action in a whistleblower appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221, or where the Board orders corrective action in a Special Counsel complaint under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214. <span class="Italic">Seibel v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 260, &#x00B6; 15 n.3 (2000); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.201(c). An appellant may recover compensatory damages when he prevails in a Board appeal based on a finding of intentional discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a finding that the agency failed to make a reasonable accommodation for a qualified disabled person, a finding of illegal retaliation for the appellant's protected equal employment opportunity activity, or where the Board orders corrective action in a whistleblower appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221. <span class="Italic">See Rhee v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 19 (2012); <span class="Italic">see also Seibel</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 260, &#x00B6; 15; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.201(d), 1201.202(c). Because the Board did not order corrective action in a whistleblower appeal or a Special Counsel complaint, and it did not make a finding of discrimination or retaliation in his retirement appeal, the appellant is not entitled to compensatory and/or consequential damages.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board does not seem strictly to enforce a regulatory provision that a request for compensatory damages be made no later than a prehearing conference, <span class="Italic">King v. USDA</span>, AT-0752-18-0079-I-1 (NP 10/20/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an appellant prevails in an appeal before the Board based on a finding of discrimination, he may recover compensatory damages from the agency pursuant to the Civil Rights Act of 1991. <span class="Italic">Hess v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 124 M.S.P.R. 40, &#x00B6; 19 (2016). Thus, reversal of an agency action when an appellant has raised the affirmative defense of discrimination or retaliation for filing a complaint of discrimination does not afford the appellant all possible relief available to him, and the administrative judge must adjudicate the affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">See Morey v. Department of the Navy</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 14, 17 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the Board's regulations require that a claim for compensatory damages be raised before the close of the prehearing conference and must be set forth in writing, specifying the amount sought and the reasons why the appellant believes that he is entitled to an award of compensatory damages. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.204(a)-(b). The agency contends that, even though the appellant alleged retaliation for filing EEO complaints, because he did not raise a claim for compensatory damages as provided by section 1201.204, he is precluded from establishing entitlement to such damages, and the administrative judge should not have adjudicated his affirmative defense of retaliation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we need not reach the issue of whether a failure to raise a claim for compensatory damages pursuant to section 1201.204 could allow an administrative judge, after reversing an agency action, to dismiss the affirmative defense of discrimination or retaliation without adjudicating it. Although the appellant did not clearly raise a claim for compensatory damages below, there is no indication in the record that he received the appropriate information with respect to how to raise any such damages claim. Board regulations do not require administrative judges or the Board to provide notice of the right to request compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">Hawkes v.

USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 263, 265-67 (1998), avoided <span class="Italic">Gibson</span>'s applicability and concluded that the Board has authority to award those damages through its administrative procedures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he administrative judge directed the parties' attention to the decision that had just been issued in the case of <span class="Italic">Gibson v. Brown</span>, 137 F.3d 992 (7th Cir. 1998).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge ordered the parties to file briefs on the Board's authority to grant the appellant the relief he requests here, in light of <span class="Italic">Gibson</span>, pointing, as well, to the decision issued by another court which held to the contrary, <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Secretary, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 121 F.3d 203 (5th Cir. 1997)...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without addressing the reason on which the administrative judge relied in finding that the Board retains the authority to consider and rule on the appellant's request for compensatory damages, and also without addressing the merits of the split of authority in the circuits,[2] we agree with him that we have jurisdiction to proceed on the appellant's claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Because this case does not arise within the Seventh Circuit, in which <span class="Italic">Gibson</span> sets the rule, we also decline to address more directly the question of whether the Board should reach a different result in a case that is appealable there. <span class="Italic">Cf. Afifi</span> <span class="Italic">v. Department of the Interior,</span> 33 MSPR 282, 285 (1987) (overruling cases standing for the proposition that the Board will apply the law of the circuit in mixed cases involving denials of within grade salary increases). We note, too, that in <span class="Italic">Gibson,</span> the United States has filed a petition for rehearing with a suggestion for rehearing <span class="Italic">en banc.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant's cases concern actions that are appealable to the Board and allegations of discrimination prohibited by section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16), they are mixed cases subject to the provisions of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702. Pursuant to that section of the law governing the Board's authority over mixed appeals, any such decision is reviewable by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) upon the appellant's petition. The statute sets out the chain of review and procedures to be followed in resolving any disputes which may arise between the two agencies. The Special Panel established pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(d) long ago interpreted this process as giving primacy to the Board over matters of civil service law, and to the EEOC over <span id="Page_4929"></span>matters grounded in discrimination law. Indeed, after determining the extent of its own authority under the law, the Panel held that "[u]nless an EEOC decision depends upon civil service law for its support, or is so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law, it does not rise to the level of conflict with civil service law contemplated in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(c)(2)(A) and will not be disturbed by the Panel." <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 30 MSPR 471, 486 (Spec. Pan. 1986). In reaching that determination, the Special Panel found that it would be "an abuse of the appellate procedures outlined in &#x00A7; 7702" for the Board to attempt to force review on the merits of EEOC decisions based on discrimination law with which it disagrees by categorizing them as grounded in civil service law. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EEOC has spoken on the certified issue, albeit prior to the <span class="Italic">Gibson</span> decision. In <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Runyon</span>, EEOC No. 01923399, 93 FEOR 3062 (Nov. 12, 1992), <span class="Italic">request to reconsider denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930306 (Feb. 1, 1993), it held that compensatory damages are available for alleged discriminatory conduct occurring on or after November 21, 1991, the effective date of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, and that they are properly recoverable in the administrative process. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, slip op. at 4-8. That decision, we note, which was based on a lengthy explication and analysis of the statute, included specific consideration of the provisions of the law on which the Seventh Circuit also based its decision. The rule in <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> has been adhered to by the EEOC since its issuance, and the Board has also long since adopted and followed it. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hocker v. Department of Transportation</span>, 63 MSPR 497 (1994). We are unaware of any change in EEOC rulings or policy since <span class="Italic">Gibson</span> was decided.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although it may reasonably be argued that the question of whether compensatory damages are available in the administrative process involves the Board's jurisdiction, and therefore a matter of civil service law, we find that, at base, the issue is one of discrimination law, inasmuch as the authority from which it derives is quite clearly discrimination law, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, and implicates not just the Board's authority, but that of EEOC and other administrative agencies to award relief under the various antidiscrimination statutes cited in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(B). As such, we may not disagree with the EEOC on the issue. We see no principled distinction in the statutory scheme upon which to base a conclusion as to Board authority as contrasted with that of the EEOC on this specific issue. We therefore conclude that we continue to have the authority to consider requests for compensatory damages and to award such relief in mixed cases coming before us. Should the EEOC reach a conclusion to the contrary, of course, the issue as it pertains to the Board's authority will be ripe for reconsideration.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">West v. Gibson</span>, 119 S. Ct. 1906, 1908-11 (1999), the Supreme Court validated the authority of the EEOC (and, implicitly, MSPB), to award compensatory damages based on findings of covered discrimination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbids employment discrimination. In 1972 Congress extended Title VII so that it applies not only to employment in the private sector, but to employment in the Federal Government as well. <span class="Italic">See</span> Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 111, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16. This 1972 Title VII extension, found in &#x00A7; 717 of Title VII, has three relevant subsections.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first subsection, &#x00A7; 717(a), sets forth the basic Federal Government employment anti-discrimination standard. It says that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"[a]ll personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment [of specified Government agencies and departments]...shall be made free from any discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second subsection, &#x00A7; 717(b), provides the EEOC with the power to enforce the standard. It says (among other things) that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shall have authority to enforce the provisions of subsection (a)...through appropriate remedies, including reinstatement or hiring of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of this section...." 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The third subsection, &#x00A7; 717(c), concerns a court's authority to enforce the standard. It says that, after an agency or the EEOC takes final action on a complaint (or fails to take action within a certain time),</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"an employee or applicant...[who is still] aggrieved may file a civil action as provided in section [706, dealing with discrimination by private employers]..., in which civil action the head of the department, agency, or unit, as appropriate, shall be the defendant." 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1991 Congress again amended Title VII. The amendment relevant here permits victims of intentional employment discrimination (whether within the private sector or the Federal Government) to recover compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">See</span> Civil Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat. 1072, 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(1). The relevant portion of that amendment, which we shall call the Compensatory Damages Amendment (CDA), says:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"In an action brought by a complaining party under section 706 [dealing with discrimination by private employers] or 717 [dealing with discrimination by the Federal Government] against a respondent who engaged in unlawful intentional discrimination..., the complaining party may recover compensatory damages...." 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CDA also sets forth certain conditions and exceptions. It imposes, for example, a cap on compensatory damages (of up to $300,000 for large employers, &#x00A7; 1981a(b)(3)(D)). And it adds: "If a complaining party seeks compensatory damages under this section.... any party may demand a trial by jury...." &#x00A7; 1981a(c). Once the CDA became law, the EEOC began to grant compensatory damages awards in Federal Government employment discrimination cases. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 29 CFR pt. 1613, App. A (1990) (no reference to compensatory damages in preamendment list of EEOC remedies), with, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Runyon</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01923399, p. 3 (Nov. 12, 1992) ("[t]he Civil Rights Act of 1991...makes compensatory damages available to federal sector complainants in the administrative process").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The language, purposes, and history of the 1972 Title VII extension and the 1991 CDA convince us that Congress has authorized the EEOC to award compensatory damages in Federal Government employment discrimination cases. Read literally, the language of the statutes is consistent with a grant of that authority. The relevant portion of the Title VII extension, namely, &#x00A7; 717(b), says that the EEOC "shall have authority" to enforce &#x00A7; 717(a) "through appropriate remedies, including reinstatement or hiring of employees with or without back pay." 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(b). After enactment of the 1991 CDA, an award of compensatory damages is a "remedy" that is "appropriate."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that subsection 717(b) explicitly mentions certain equitable remedies, namely, reinstatement, hiring, and back pay, and it does not explicitly refer to compensatory damages. But the preceding word "including" makes clear that the authorization is not limited to the specified remedies there mentioned; and the 1972 Title VII extension's choice of examples is not surprising, for in 1972 (and until 1991) Title VII itself authorized only equitable remedies. <span class="Italic">See</span> Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 261, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)) (private sector discrimination); Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 111, 42 USC 2000e-16 (federal sector discrimination).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 717's language, however, does not freeze the scope of the word "appropriate" as of 1972. Words in statutes can enlarge or contract their scope as other changes, in law or in the world, require their application to new instances or make old applications anachronistic....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The meaning of the word "appropriate" permits its scope to expand to include Title VII remedies that were not appropriate before 1991, but in light of legal change are appropriate now. The word "including" makes clear that "appropriate remedies" are not limited to the examples that follow that word<span class="Italic">. See Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 313 U.S. 177, 189 (1941). And in context the word "appropriate" most naturally refers to forms of relief that Title VII itself authorizes at least where that relief is of a kind that agencies typically can provide. Thus, Congress' decision in the 1991 CDA to permit a "complaining party" to "recover compensatory damages" in "an action brought under section...717," by adding compensatory damages to Title VII's arsenal of remedies, could make that form of relief "appropriate" under &#x00A7; 717(b) as well.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An examination of the purposes of the 1972 Title VII extension shows that this permissible reading of the language is also the correct reading. Section 717's general purpose is to remedy discrimination in federal employment. It does so in part by creating a dispute resolution system that requires a complaining party to pursue administrative relief prior to court action, thereby encouraging quicker, less formal, and less expensive resolution of disputes within the Federal Government and outside of court. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(c) (court action permitted only where complainant disagrees with final agency disposition or, if complainant pursued discretionary appeal to EEOC, with EEOC disposition; or if either agency or EEOC disposition is delayed); <span class="Italic">Brown v. GSA</span>, 425 U.S. 820, 833 (1976) (discussing &#x00A7; 717's "rigorous administrative exhaustion requirements"); <span class="Italic">see</span> also 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.105(a) (1998) (requiring complainant initially to notify agency and make effort to resolve matter informally); &#x00A7; 1614.106(d)(2) (requiring agency investigation prior to EEOC consideration).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To deny that an EEOC compensatory damages award is, statutorily speaking, "appropriate" would undermine this remedial scheme. It would force into court matters that the EEOC might otherwise have resolved. And by preventing earlier resolution of a dispute, it would increase the burdens of both time and expense that accompany efforts to resolve hundreds, if not thousands, of such disputes each year. <span class="Italic">See</span> Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Federal Sector Report on EEO Complaints Processing and Appeals by Federal Agencies for Fiscal Year 1997, pp. 19, 61 (1998) (28,947 Federal Government employment discrimination claims filed in 1997; 7,112 claims appealed to EEOC)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Compensatory damages are not available for claims of sex discrimination <span id="Page_4930"></span>based on a disparate impact theory. 42 USC 1981a(a)(1).

Disparate impact involves employment practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified by business necessity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Calhoon v.

In an action brought by a complaining party under the powers, remedies, and procedures set forth in section 706 or 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (as provided in section 107(a) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 USC &#x00A7; 12117(a)) and section 794a(a)(1) of title 29, respectively) against a respondent who engaged in unlawful intentional discrimination (not an employment practice that is unlawful because of its disparate impact) under section 791 of title 29 and the regulations implementing section 791 of title 29, or who violated the requirements of section 791 of title 29 or the regulations implementing section 791 of title 29 concerning the provision of a reasonable accommodation...against an individual, the complaining party may recover compensatory and punitive damages...in addition to any relief authorized by section 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, from the respondent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Reasonable accommodation and good faith effort. In cases where a discriminatory practice involves the provision of a reasonable accommodation pursuant to section 102(b)(5) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 or regulations implementing section 791 of title 29, damages may not be awarded under this section where the covered entity demonstrates good faith efforts, in consultation with the person with the disability who has informed the covered entity that accommodation is needed, to identify and make a reasonable accommodation that would provide such individual with an equally effective opportunity and would not cause an undue hardship on the operation of the business.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(2)-(3) (Supp. IV 1992). Compensatory damages contemplated by Congress in enacting the CRA include "future pecuniary losses, emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and other nonpecuniary losses...." 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(b)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has ruled that the CRA permits an award of compensatory damages to federal sector complainants in the administrative process. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. United States Postal Service</span>, EEOC No. 01923399, slip op. at 2-3 (Nov. 12, 1992).[3] Under the principles established in <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. United States Postal Service</span>, 30 MSPR 471, 486 (Spec. Pan. 1986), the Board defers to the EEOC's interpretation of discrimination laws. Accordingly, we hold that an appellant who prevails in an appeal before the Board based on a finding of discrimination may recover compensatory damages from an agency pursuant to the CRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The CRA does not provide for an award of punitive damages against a government agency. 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(b)(1) (Supp. IV 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the Board should apply the CRA retroactively to permit an award of compensatory damages in a proceeding that was pending on the effective date of the CRA, November 21, 1991. However, the Supreme Court has held that compensatory damages may not be awarded under the CRA in actions that were pending on the effective date of the CRA. <span class="Italic">Landgraf v. USI Film Products</span>, __U.S.__, __, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 1505, 128 L. Ed.2d 229 (1994). Therefore, the appellant's request for retroactive application of the CRA is denied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge properly required the appellant to establish a separate incident of discrimination after the initial decision in order to recover damages in his petition for enforcement. The Board will not reconsider the merits of an appeal in an enforcement proceeding. <span class="Italic">See Armstrong v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 37 MSPR 129, 131 (1988) (a compliance proceeding is an addendum to the decision on the merits, not a reconsideration of the evidence in a new light). Accordingly, where the Board has found discrimination in a final decision on the merits of an appeal, an appellant may not seek compensatory damages based on that finding of discrimination for the first time in a petition for enforcement. The appellant must seek such damages from the administrative judge during the appeal on the merits. However, an appellant may raise handicap discrimination for the first time in a petition for enforcement where the issue is relevant to a specific compliance issue. <span class="Italic">Bergman v. Department of Justice</span>, 56 MSPR 42, 45 (1992). Thus, in a petition for enforcement, an appellant may obtain compensatory damages if the agency's failure to comply with the Board's final order constitutes a separate act of discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency's failure to comply with the Board's final order constituted a separate act of discrimination from that found in the initial decision. In the final decision on the merits, the administrative judge reversed the appellant's removal based on a finding of handicap discrimination, both by intentional discrimination and by its failure to provide reasonable accommodation. The administrative judge found that the agency failed to reasonably accommodate the appellant's handicapping condition because the agency did not follow its own procedures for seeking a waiver of the medical certificate, and it did not consider any method of accommodating the appellant's condition. The administrative judge ordered the agency to reverse the removal, reinstate the appellant, and conduct the feasibility study to determine whether the appellant could be reasonably accommodated in the APPM position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the Recommendation, the administrative judge found that the agency's feasibility study, which concluded that the appellant could not be reasonably accommodated in the position, was insufficient. He found that the deficient feasibility study represented a failure to reasonably accommodate the appellant's handicapping condition principally because it did not distinguish the appellant's case from those of similarly situated employees whom the agency had accommodated without undue difficulty. This failure is separate from the failure to reasonably accommodate that served as part of the basis for the administrative judge's finding of discrimination in the appeal on the merits. Accordingly, we reverse the administrative judge's finding to the contrary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge erred in requiring the appellant to prove intentional discrimination by the agency in order to prove entitlement to compensatory damages after he found that the agency failed to provide reasonable accommodation for the appellant's handicapping condition. The CRA provides that in</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an action brought...against a respondent who engaged in unlawful intentional discrimination...<span class="Italic">or who violated the requirements of section 791 of title 29 or the regulations implementing section 791 of title 29 concerning the provision of a reasonable accommodation</span>...the complaining party may recover compensatory.... damages....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(2) (emphasis added). Thus, the plain language of the CRA permits an appellant to recover compensatory damages upon a showing of either intentional handicap discrimination or a failure to provide reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the statute further provides that in cases involving a failure to reasonably accommodate an employee's handicapping condition,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">damages may not be awarded under this section where the covered entity demonstrates good faith efforts, in consultation with the person with the disability who has informed the covered entity that accommodation is needed, to identify and make a reasonable accommodation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(3). Thus, once an appellant has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the agency has committed handicap discrimination by failing to provide reasonable accommodation, the agency may avoid liability for compensatory damages by demonstrating that it made a good faith effort to accommodate the appellant's handicapping condition. The agency's good faith effort claim is akin to an affirmative defense, and the agency bears the ultimate burden of persuasion on the issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e(m) (Supp. V 1993) (in Title VII actions, the term "demonstrates" means "meets the burdens of production and persuasion"); <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228, 242, 109 S. Ct. 1775, 1786, 104 L. Ed.2d 268 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the agency failed to reasonably accommodate his condition. Therefore, the appellant made out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of entitlement to compensatory damages under the CRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(2). The burden of proof shifted to the agency to show that it made a good faith effort to reasonably accommodate the appellant's handicapping condition in a manner that "would provide [the appellant] with an equally effective opportunity and would not cause an undue hardship on the operation of the [agency]." 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(3). The administrative judge erred by requiring the appellant to demonstrate that the agency committed intentional discrimination and by failing to require the agency to demonstrate that it made a good faith effort to accommodate the appellant's condition. Accordingly, remand is necessary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4931"></span>Accordingly, we REMAND this petition for enforcement to the San Francisco Regional Office for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion and Order. If the administrative judge finds that the agency did not make a good faith effort to reasonably accommodate the appellant's handicapping condition, he shall afford the parties an opportunity to present additional evidence and argument concerning the amount of compensatory damages due the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hocker</span> settled on remand, and the settlement produced additional litigation over compensatory damages. The Federal Circuit, however, determined that the settlement agreement precluded a further claim for damages because of the scope of the waiver clause included in that agreement<span class="Italic">. Hocker v. Dept. of Transp.</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 95-3155), recited the waiver:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, Hocker seeks review of the July opinion, specifically with respect to the reprisal and compensatory damages issues addressed there. In fact, in his reply brief, Hocker asserts that "[t]he issue of this petition <span class="Italic">is not</span> that the Board abused its discretion in dismissing the petitioner's petition for enforcement but that the Board's July opinion is insufficient." (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hocker, however, ignores the effect of the settlement agreement he entered into with the agency. "Settlement agreements, like all contracts, should be interpreted to carry out the parties' collective intent. Here the intent was to end the dispute." <span class="Italic">Greco</span>, 852 F.2d at 561. Indeed the settlement agreement at issue states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Appellant agrees to withdraw the above-captioned appeal in its entirety and hereby waives all claims, all rights to further administrative proceedings, and all rights to file a civil action against the United States Department of Transportation which arise out of Appellant's Motion for Enforcement of Board's Order, dated January 7, 1993, except as may be necessary to enforce the terms of this agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The July Opinion was a direct result of Hocker's January 7, 1993 Motion for Enforcement of Board's Order. The very terms of the settlement agreement therefore explicitly preclude any further claim Hocker may have had with respect to the July opinion. Additionally, Hocker does not allege that the settlement agreement "is tainted with invalidity, either by fraud practiced upon him or by mutual mistake under which both parties acted." <span class="Italic">Callen v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co.</span>, 332 U.S. 625, 630 (1948). Absent such proof, the settlement agreement is binding on the parties. Accordingly, the Board's dismissal of Hocker's appeal based on the settlement agreement must be affirmed.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the direct threat defense involves the issue of reasonable accommodation, the AJ was correct to apply 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(3) when considering the appellant's motion for compensatory damages. In referring to compensatory damages, that section of the statute provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In cases where a discriminatory practice involves the provision of a reasonable accommodation pursuant to section 102(b)(5) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 or regulations implementing section 791 of Title 29, damages may not be awarded under this section where the covered entity demonstrates good faith efforts, in consultation with the person with the disability who has informed the covered entity that accommodation is needed, to identify and make a reasonable accommodation that would provide such individual with an equally effective opportunity and would not cause an undue hardship on the operation of the business.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the AJ noted, the EEOC has referred to good faith efforts when discussing compensatory damages in two cases involving a direct threat defense virtually identical to the instant case: <span class="Italic">Masteller v. Potter</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01994458, 2004 WL 321028 (Feb. 12, 2004) (tractor-trailer operator with multiple sclerosis reassigned to light-duty position without driving duties although he had successfully and safely driven commercial motor vehicles for 5 years), and <span class="Italic">Suprenant v. Potter</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01996186, 2001 WL 885325 (July 26, 2001), <span class="Italic">recons. denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A11071, 2004 WL 321030 (Feb. 12, 2004) (tractor-trailer operator with insulin dependent diabetes reassigned to the Mailhandler Craft although he had no record of accidents or unsafe driving and had not experienced a hypoglycemic episode for four years). In <span class="Italic">Masteller</span> and <span class="Italic">Suprenant,</span> complainants suffered from medical conditions that, under DOT safety-based qualification standards, disqualified them from maintaining a license necessary to drive a tractor trailer. In each case, the EEOC found that complainant was a qualified individual with a disability who had successfully and safely driven commercial motor vehicles for years and who had been removed from his position because his medical condition triggered the restrictions of the DOT safety standard. In each case, the EEOC found that the agency should have conducted an individualized assessment of complainant to determine whether he posed a direct threat which could not be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation, rather than rely on the DOT regulations. Finding in each case, that the agency had not established that complainant posed a significant risk of substantial harm, the EEOC found that the agency discriminated against the complainant on the basis of his disability when it reassigned him from his driving position. Finally, in each case the EEOC, citing <span class="Italic">Teshima v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961997, 1998 WL 236476, found that the agency was not relieved of its obligation to award appropriate compensatory damages because there was no showing that the agency made a "good faith effort" to reasonably accommodate the complainant. <span class="Italic">Masteller</span>, 2004 WL 321028, at *5; <span class="Italic">Suprenant</span>, 2001 WL 885325, at *6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the principles established in <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 471, 486 (Spec. Pan. 1986), the Board defers to the EEOC's interpretation of discrimination laws. Given the procedural history of this appeal and its similarity to <span class="Italic">Masteller</span> and <span class="Italic">Suprenant</span>, we are compelled to follow the EEOC's interpretation and find, in agreement with the AJ, that this case involves the provisions of a reasonable accommodation under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(3), which provides that damages may not be awarded where the covered entity demonstrates good faith efforts to make a reasonable accommodation. However, we disagree with the AJ's conclusion that the agency made such a demonstration here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of his conclusion, the AJ cited record evidence showing that the agency's Reassignment/Reasonable Accommodation Committee had identified positions within the appellant's commuting area in the Mailhandler Craft and advised him of his responsibility to request a craft change. The appellant acknowledged this was the case, though he complained that the committee did not invite him to participate in or contribute to its activities. Additionally, the AJ noted that the agency's medical officer proposed a scheme, modeled upon the DOT Medical Advisory Criteria, wherein the appellant could establish definitively his fitness to drive by foregoing anti-seizure medication for a period of time, and thus retain his position. The AJ reasoned that, even if these efforts fell short of what the EEOC and the Special Panel required, the agency had acted in good faith and was thus within the "safe-harbor" provision set forth in section 1981a(a)(3) and not liable for compensatory damages. As support for his finding that compensatory damages were not recoverable here, the AJ cited <span class="Italic">Teshima v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961997, 1998 WL 236476. ID at 3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's Reassignment/Reasonable Accommodation Committee identified alternative employment in the Mailhander Craft within the appellant's commuting area, and advised the appellant of his responsibility to request a craft change if he desired the position. This offer, which is outside of the appellant's craft, does not constitute a good faith effort to make a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Teshima</span>, on which the AJ relied, does not persuade us otherwise. In <span class="Italic">Teshima</span>, the EEOC found that the agency was not liable for compensatory damages to the appellant because, while it had not considered the accommodations he suggested, the agency had made a good faith effort by offering him a light-duty position in another location as an accommodation for his disability--paranoid schizophrenia. <span class="Italic">Teshima</span>, 1998 WL 236476, at *1, 5. Unlike the appellant in the instant case, the appellant in <span class="Italic">Teshima</span> received an offer of light-duty work in his craft but in a different location. For this reason, <span class="Italic">Teshima</span> is significantly distinguishable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only other evidence of the agency's efforts is that the agency's examining physician proposed a scheme by which the appellant's fitness to drive and keep his position could be authoritatively ascertained. This scheme, modeled on the Department of Transportation Medical Advisory Criteria, required that the appellant cease taking seizure medication. It was not an effort to accommodate the appellant; it was, instead, a means for him to show that he could meet the DOT standards without accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4932"></span>For these reasons, we find that the agency is not relieved of its obligation to award appropriate compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Compensatory damages are unavailable for age discrimination cases, <span class="Italic">Lee v. Sullivan</span>, 787 F. Supp. 921, 930 (N.D. Cal. 1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the 1991 Act does not authorize compensatory damages for age discrimination. Section 102(a)(1) only authorizes compensatory damages against persons "who engaged in unlawful intentional discrimination...prohibited under section 703, 704, or 717 of the [Civil Rights Act of 1964]." Those sections only prohibit discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, or in reprisal for former EEOC activity. 42 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e-2, 2000e-3, 2000e-16. Section 102(a)(2) only authorizes compensatory damages against persons "who engaged in unlawful intentional discrimination under section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973...or section 102 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990." Those sections only address discrimination based on disability. 29 USC &#x00A7; 791; 42 USC &#x00A7; 12112.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]n accord with the trend in recent decisions from the majority of circuit courts of appeal, we decline to erect an absolute procedural bar via judicial estoppel to prevent a recipient of CSRS or FERS disability benefits from claiming disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act. Rather, the Board will employ a case-by-case approach in determining the effect of an appellant's application for or receipt of a disability retirement award upon a claim of disability discrimination. That approach will entail a consideration of the relevant factors which the EEOC advises a fact-finder to examine when determining whether a disability benefits award is inconsistent with a subsequent ADA claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, although this list is not exhaustive, the EEOC advises that the fact-finder should consider: (1) The manner in which disability is defined on a disability benefits application; (2) the manner in which the disability benefits application permits the applicant to describe his condition (i.e., in writing and in a narrative format or by merely checking boxes, or verbally over the telephone); (3) the applicant's representations versus relevant documents including disability reports, and doctors' reports regarding his medical condition; (4) the circumstances under which the application for disability benefits was made, including whether the applicant was denied reasonable accommodation, or applied for benefits at the employer's insistence, or on a doctor's advice; and (5) the applicant's health condition at the time of his application for disability benefits versus his condition at the time of the alleged disability discrimination.

<p class="Body-Text">The availability of damages is not defeated by internal agency procedures allowing aggrieved employees to complain of sexual (or other invidious) harassment or discrimination if the harassment results in a tangible employment action, e.g., demotion or dismissal. The Supreme Court explained in <span class="Italic">Faragher v. City of Boca Raton</span>, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 2292-93 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee. When no tangible employment action is taken, a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence, <span class="Italic">see</span> Fed. Rule. Civ. Proc. 8(c). The defense comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise. While proof that an employer had promulgated an antiharassment policy with complaint procedure is not necessary in every instance as a matter of law, the need for a stated policy suitable to the employment circumstances may appropriately be addressed in any case when litigating the first element of the defense. And while proof that an employee failed to fulfill the corresponding obligation of reasonable care to avoid harm is not limited to showing an unreasonable failure to use any complaint procedure provided by the employer, a demonstration of such failure will normally suffice to satisfy the employer's burden under the second element of the defense. No affirmative defense is available, however, when the supervisor's harassment culminates in a tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment. <span class="Italic">See Burlington,</span> <span class="Italic">ante</span>, [524 U.S. 742], 118 S.
