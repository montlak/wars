<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-173"><span class="space">g.</span> Overriding Interest</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Denial of restoration of law enforcement duties was justified in <span class="Italic">Revak v. Dept. of Interior</span>, DE-0752-12-0265-C-1 (NP 9/24/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant contests the administrative judge's finding that the agency complied with the Board's order to cancel the appellant's demotion and restore him to his permanent position. The purpose of a Board order cancelling an adverse action is to restore the appellant as nearly as possible to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984). This principle applies not only where the Board has ordered an action cancelled but also where, as here, the Board has mitigated the penalty. <span class="Italic">Payne v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 97, 101 (1997). Return to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> requires that the appellant be placed back in his former position or in a position substantially equivalent in scope and status to his former position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may not base a finding of compliance with a reinstatement order solely upon a restoration to title and grade. <span class="Italic">Doe v. Department of Justice</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 198, &#x00B6; 7 (2003). Rather, the Board must conduct an assessment of the scope and responsibilities of the new position compared with the appellant's former position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant's duties and responsibilities may be changed only if the agency has demonstrated a compelling reason for doing so. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. For example, the Board has held that where an individual loses a security clearance required for the position he held prior to a reversed removal action, the agency may comply with a reinstatement order by assigning the employee to a position with similar duties that does not require a security clearance. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., LaBatte v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 586, 594 (1993). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Marren v. Department of Justice</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 285 (1987), the Board found the agency in compliance where a border patrol agent was not restored to his former position because he lacked a government driver's license. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 287. In <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, the agency reassigned the appellant, a criminal investigator with the Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Service, to duties that would not require him to testify in any criminal prosecution, based on letters from the U.S. Attorneys Offices expressing their concern that the appellant had perjured himself during a suppression hearing and therefore could not be called as a witness absent exceptional circumstances. <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 198, &#x00B6; 9. The Board concluded that these concerns were similar to the denial of a security clearance and the failure to maintain a driver's license, as in the cases cited above, and constituted a compelling reason for not returning the appellant to the exact duties he had performed prior to his removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15, 17. The common thread in such cases is that an outside event or determination rendered the appellant incapable of performing the duties of his former position and that as long as that incapacity exists, the agency is not obligated to restore the appellant to his prior position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may reach a different conclusion, however, where the agency exercises its own discretion in altering the appellant's duties. For example, in <span class="Italic">Black v. Department of Justice</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 650 (2000), the agency argued that it was not required to restore the appellant's special agent badge and credentials because granting those items was discretionary with the District Director, but the agency cited no external determination, such as failure to obtain a security clearance, as a basis for the District Director's position. The Board ruled the agency was not in compliance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 653-54. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Clemons v. Smithsonian Institution</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 74 (1991), where the Board reversed a removal for theft of a can of soda, the Board rejected the agency's contention that it had a compelling reason not to restore the appellant to the night shift on its belief that the appellant was not sufficiently trustworthy to work nights when close supervision was not available. <span class="Italic">Id.; see also Briggs v. National Council on Disability</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 296, 302 (1995) (an agency cannot refuse to comply with a Board reinstatement order based on reasons that were rejected by the Board in the decision reversing the action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that the agency complied with the Board's order to the extent it canceled the appellant's demotion and restored the appellant to his permanent Zone Officer position. However, it is also undisputed that following the appellant's 14-day suspension, the agency immediately detailed him to a Park Ranger position which, unlike his permanent Zone Officer position, does not include law enforcement duties. The appellant does not assert that the duties of the Zone Officer and Park Ranger positions are otherwise dissimilar. The matter in dispute is whether the agency had a compelling reason for not returning the appellant to law enforcement duty despite his lack of a current, favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that similarly situated Federal Wildlife Officers (FWOs) were permitted to retain law enforcement duties despite having expired SSBIs. In his petition for enforcement, he identified 43 agency law enforcement officers whom he alleged were exercising law enforcement duties despite having expired SSBIs, and 16 more whom he alleged were exercising law enforcement duties despite having SSBIs that had either expired or were due to expire "within a few months." According to the appellant, the agency improperly singled him out by not permitting him to perform law enforcement duties. <span class="Italic">Id</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge noted in the initial decision, the unsworn statements of a party's representative in a pleading do not constitute evidence. <span class="Italic">Hendricks v. Department of the Navy</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 163, 168 (1995). However, the appellant correctly observes that the October 12, 2012 declaration by James Hall, Chief of Law Enforcement, National Wildlife, does constitute evidence. In his declaration, Hall averred that of the first 59 people or positions listed in the appellant's petition, 35 were FWOs within the National Wildlife Refuge System, of whom 27 had current, favorably adjudicated SSBIs, 6 were undergoing the investigative process, and 2 were no longer employed with the FWS. Hall further declared that the remaining 24 individuals were not law enforcement officers, but supervisors, of whom 15 had a current favorably adjudicated SSBI, 8 were in the investigative process, and one was "currently arranging for an investigation." The record therefore shows that at least six FWOs were permitted to perform law enforcement duties without having a current, favorably adjudicated SSBI.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we do not agree that these FWOs were similarly situated to the appellant. It is the practice of the agency that, if an SSBI reinvestigation is initiated before the current SSBI is due to be renewed, the FWO will be allowed to maintain law enforcement authority until the new SSBI is completed and favorably adjudicated. There is nothing in the record to suggest that reinvestigations for the six FWOs in question were not timely initiated prior to the expiration of their current SSBIs. By contrast, it is undisputed that a reinvestigation of the appellant had not been initiated before his SSBI expired. Consequently, the agency was neither required nor permitted to delegate law enforcement authority to the appellant prior to the completion of a new, favorably adjudicated SSBI.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the agency was responsible for failing to timely initiate a reinvestigation prior to the expiration of his SSBI. In that respect, he argues, this case differs from <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, in which the assignment <span id="Page_5024"></span>of the appellant to different duties was entirely the result of an outside event or determination. This distinction does not warrant a different result. Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the agency improperly failed to initiate a reinvestigation before the appellant's SSBI expired, that error occurred before the demotion action for which <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief was ordered, and therefore is not relevant to the issue of compliance. We further note that, while the appellant did not have a current, favorably adjudicated SSBI at the time of his reinstatement, and therefore could not be given law enforcement duties at that time, the agency has since initiated the process of obtaining a new SSBI for the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the facts of this case are akin to those in <span class="Italic">Doe, LaBatte</span>, and <span class="Italic">Marren</span>, and that the agency had a compelling reason not to return the appellant to law enforcement duties upon his reinstatement. Moreover, as noted above, the Zone Officer and Park Ranger positions are not substantially different except insofar as the latter position does not involve law enforcement duties. We therefore affirm the finding of the administrative judge that the agency is compliance with the reinstatement order. <span class="Italic">See Doe</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 198, &#x00B6; 19.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Coan v. VA</span>, NY-0752-14-0300-C-1 (NP 7/27/2022) (the agency breached a settlement effectively calling for the return of Mr. Coan to a police officer position, over the agency's defense that it could not do so because Mr. Coan's agency-granted law enforcement officer credentials were no longer in effect).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Doe v. DOJ</span>, 95 MSPR 198, 202-05 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-16 (2003), presented the situation of assignment of duties to a reinstated criminal investigator based on concerns of prosecutors that the appellant's testimony could not be reliably presented in court by reason of a concern that the appellant testified falsely in a prior proceeding. The Board declined to become involved in the disagreement concerning the appellant's veracity. Instead the Board permitted the assignment of duties that presumably would not take the appellant into court as a witness based on prosecutors' concerns:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a further justification of the appellant's assignment, the agency points to letters from the Chiefs of the Criminal Divisions of the United States Attorneys Offices for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York. Those letters state that the offices would not call the appellant as a witness absent exceptional circumstances. The basis for that position is the belief by those offices that the appellant perjured himself during a suppression hearing prior to his criminal trial. The Chiefs of the Criminal Divisions explained that they would be obligated to disclose their concerns about the appellant's truthfulness to the criminal defendant in any case in which the appellant was going to testify. Such a disclosure would presumably make the government's criminal case more difficult. The agency argues that, based on the limitations raised by the chief law enforcement officers of the two districts in which the appellant would routinely operate, it has assigned the appellant a law enforcement position that will not jeopardize any criminal prosecutions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast to the agency's arguments, the appellant contends that the duties he has been assigned are administrative in nature and are not substantially similar to those he performed prior to his removal. He asserts that he should be assigned the criminal investigator duties he previously performed. The appellant also objects to the agency's reliance on the letters from the United States Attorneys Offices. He contends that the concerns expressed in those letters are unwarranted because the District Court found his testimony at the suppression hearing worthy of belief. He notes that the government could have requested reconsideration, filed an appeal, or brought a perjury charge. The appellant also notes that both the administrative judge and the Board determined that the agency failed to prove its charge that he made false statements. Based on these facts, the appellant argues that it has been conclusively established that he did not lie at the suppression hearing and the agency should not be allowed to continue to rely on that contention to harm his career.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We turn now to the central issue presented by this case, the effect of the appellant's duty assignment on the question of compliance with the Board's final order. The Board has held that, where an individual loses the security clearance required for the position he held prior to a reversed removal action, the agency properly assigned the employee to a different position with similar duties that did not require a security clearance. <span class="Italic">LaBatte v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 586, 594 (1993); <span class="Italic">Gray v. Department of the Navy,</span> 29 M.S.P.R. 281, 283-84 (1985). Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Marren v. Department of Justice,</span> 32 M.S.P.R. 285, 287 (1987), the agency was found in compliance where a border patrol agent was not restored to his former position because he lacked a government drivers' license. In that case, the agency would not reissue a license upon the appellant's reinstatement because he was serving probation following a conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol. <span class="Italic">See also Burrell v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy,</span> 43 M.S.P.R. 174, 176 (1990) (agency justified in assigning a motor vehicle operator to other duties because his poor driving record caused the agency to withhold certification for him to transport explosives).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The common thread in these cases is that an outside event or determination rendered the appellant incapable of performing the duties of his prior position. Thus, the Board found that, as long as that incapacity existed, the agency was not obligated to restore the appellant to his prior position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast to the cases cited above, in <span class="Italic">Black v. Department of Justice</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 650, 653-54 (2000), INS argued that it was not required to restore Ms. Black's special agent badge, and credentials because granting those items was discretionary with the District Director. The agency in <span class="Italic">Black</span> cited no external determination, such as a failure to obtain a security clearance, as a basis for the District Director's position. The Board ruled that the agency was not in compliance. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Clemons v. Smithsonian Institution,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 74, 79-80 (1991), the agency argued that it had a compelling reason not to restore the appellant to the night shift after the Board reversed a removal for theft of a can of soda. The agency in that case opined that Mr. Clemons was not sufficiently trustworthy to work nights when close supervision was not available. The Board, however, found that the agency's argument regarding the appellant's trustworthiness did not justify failing to restore him to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. In <span class="Italic">Briggs v. National Council on Disability,</span> 68 M.S.P.R. 296, 302 (1995), the Board summarized this area of the law by stating that "[i]t is well established that an agency cannot refuse to comply with a Board reinstatement order based on reasons that were rejected by the Board in the decision reversing the action."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the concerns of the United States Attorneys Offices regarding the appellant are similar to the denial of a security clearance and the failure to obtain a drivers' license in the cases discussed above. The agency's decision regarding the appellant's duties, while related to the matters addressed in the removal appeal, is based on concerns of the United States Attorneys Offices and not the matters that were adjudicated before the Board. In other words, the agency does not rely on the charges that the Board did not sustain, but on an independent event--the concerns of the United States Attorneys Offices.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the appellant essentially wants the Board to order the United States Attorneys Offices to allow him to testify, the Board lacks the authority to do so. Nor does DHS have any authority over the United States Attorneys Offices. Because INS has been moved to DHS, the appellant's employing agency and the United States Attorneys Offices are now part of two separate cabinet level departments. Thus, the Justice Department, although still listed in the case caption, is no longer a party to this dispute. The Board, therefore, can not address the limitations that have been placed on the appellant by a component of the Justice Department, and the relevant inquiry in this case is the agency's compliance obligations in light of the limitations imposed by the United States Attorneys Offices.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Prior to INS becoming part of DHS, the common supervisor of the United States Attorneys Offices and INS was the Deputy Attorney General of the United States. There is no hint that such a high level official was involved in this dispute. Nor is there any suggestion that INS officials pressured the United States Attorneys Offices into making the statements they made. In fact, the record reflects that the United States Attorneys Offices were concerned about the appellant testifying before the Board appeal arose.</p>

Dept. of Labor,</span> PH-0752-09-0652-C-2 (NP 11/23/2011) ("The agency's decision not to return the appellant to the duties of a GS-1811-13 criminal investigator are based on concerns of the United States Attorney that the appellant could not be a witness in court proceedings and the United States Attorney's decision to sever ties with the appellant as a possible witness. The agency relied on an independent event, the United States Attorney's concerns not to return the appellant to the full duties of his former position. Thus, an outside determination rendered the appellant incapable of performing the duties of his prior Criminal Investigator position. We find that, as long as that incapacity existed, the agency was not obligated to restore the appellant to his prior position and that the agency had a compelling reason not to return the appellant to the full duties of a GS-1811-13 Criminal Investigator.")

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">House v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/HOUSE_BOBBY_L_DA_0752_02_0385_X_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_246512.pdf">98 MSPR 530</a>, 536-39 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-23 (2005), an air conditioning mechanic was demoted based on his failure to properly maintain records of freon use and for refusal to cooperate in an investigation of discrepancies in freon use records. The AJ mitigated the demotion to a suspension. Enforcement proceedings ensued when the agency detailed the employee to a similar position that did not involve refrigeration. The agency's action was acceptable:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency bases this decision on the fact that the Board sustained the first charge, which stated that the appellant's conduct in handling freon (a refrigerant) showed a "<span class="Italic">continued</span> failure, after <span class="Italic">specific</span> training and <span class="Italic">repeated</span> verbal instruction from [his] supervisor, to follow instructions and maintain an accurate freon inventory [which] placed the Pine Bluff Arsenal (PBA) out of compliance with EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] regulations and thereby subject to <span class="Italic">substantial</span> penalties." (quoting <span id="Page_5025"></span>from the agency's proposal notice) (emphasis added). The administrative judge went into detail to discuss the evidence supporting that charge. For example, she noted that the appellant was responsible for controlling 28 containers of freon in Shop Two, that the appellant's supervisor stressed to him the importance of maintaining accurate records on the amount of freon under his control, and that the appellant's performance evaluation showed that he "needs improvement" in "responsibility and dependability" because of problems with his freon inventory. The administrative judge noted that an EPA inspection "revealed that Shop Two's freon records were not being maintained properly and that the EPA fined the Arsenal $21,000.00."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge credited the testimony of the appellant's supervisor that he counseled the appellant several times after the EPA fine was levied and told him to keep accurate freon records, but that "audits continued to reveal problems with the appellant's freon inventory." She noted that the appellant was given "ample time" to learn the protocol for keeping the freon inventory, and that the appellant's supervisor worked with him "on a daily basis" to assist him in doing so. The administrative judge found that eventually an audit of the appellant's freon inventory was conducted by an employee from the Arsenal's Internal Review and Compliance Office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the continuing training and counseling given to the appellant, the audit "revealed discrepancies with the appellant's freon inventory." The auditor concluded that the appellant's records were "poor," and that there was a "big disparity sometimes between the [the appellant's] inventory sheets and what was entered into the computer program." According to the administrative judge's factual findings, the audit report "pointed out <span class="Italic">multiple</span> instances where the quantity of freon input by the appellant [into the computer program] differed from his inventory sheets." (emphasis added). The administrative judge found that the agency proved that "the appellant failed to properly maintain the records regarding his freon inventory." She gave several examples of discrepancies in the appellant's records with respect to the freon for which he was responsible. The administrative judge therefore sustained the charge that the appellant failed to carry out his duties as a Air Conditioning Equipment Mechanic when it came to handling the refrigerants under his control. Although the administrative judge mitigated the penalty, she nonetheless concluded that the appellant was "placed on notice of the importance of maintaining proper records concerning his freon supply," and that his failure to do so posed a "serious risk to the agency of being found in violation of EPA regulations."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review from the administrative judge's initial decision on the merits, the appellant disputed the administrative judge's findings regarding the sustained charge. The Board denied the appellant's petition by Final Order, thus leaving undisturbed the administrative judge's factual findings and her conclusion that the agency proved the first charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency did not reassign the appellant to a new position. Rather, the agency returned him to his former position as ordered by the Board. The agency decided, based on the sustained charge, that it is best at this time not to assign the appellant to refrigerant duties. Thus, it detailed him to a position without refrigerant duties in the same shop, under the same supervisor, and at the same grade level as his Air Conditioning Equipment Mechanic position. For the following reasons, we find that the agency's action does not place it in noncompliance with the Board's Final Order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Doe v. Department of Justice</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 198 (2003), the Board considered the effect of a change in duties on the question of compliance with a Board final order. In that case, the appellant, a criminal investigator for the Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Service, was assigned duties that he alleged were inconsistent with his pre-removal duties and which would not involve testifying in court. The agency argued that it changed the appellant's duties because two United States Attorneys Offices had informed the agency that they would not call Mr. <span class="Italic">Doe</span> as a witness absent exceptional circumstances because of a belief that he had committed perjury. Based on these facts, the Board found that the agency had a compelling reason for the reassignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, the Board reiterated its precedent that "[i]t is well established that an agency cannot refuse to comply with a Board reinstatement order based on reasons that were <span class="Italic">rejected</span> by the Board in the decision <span class="Italic">reversing</span> the action." <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 198 &#x00B6; 14 (emphasis added), <span class="Italic">quoting Briggs v. National Council on Disability</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 296, 302 (1995); <span class="Italic">see also Payne v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 317 (1992) (an agency may not contest a Board decision on the merits in the context of a compliance proceeding), <span class="Italic">vacated on other grounds</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 503 (1996). The Board discussed a number of cases where it found that an agency had shown a compelling reason for not restoring an individual to his former position and identified the common element that existed in the cases as "an outside event or determination [that] rendered the appellant incapable of performing the duties of his prior position." <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 198 &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is the reverse of <span class="Italic">Doe</span>. Here, the agency has not given the appellant refrigerant duties based on reasons that were <span class="Italic">accepted</span> by the Board in its final decision. The Board found that the appellant committed serious misconduct in not keeping accurate records of the freon inventories entrusted to him. It found that the appellant's shortcomings resulted in a $21,000.00 fine from the EPA and possible future fines as well if he were to continue handling refrigerants, as implied in the initial decision's conclusion that the appellant's failure to maintain proper records of his freon inventory posed a "serious risk to the agency of <span class="Italic">being</span> found in violation of EPA regulations." Before the Board, the agency avers that "'[i]n the interest of maintaining a safe environment,' avoiding substantial and foreseeable regulatory penalties, and fulfilling the agencies [sic] obligations to the local community, appellant cannot be authorized to perform refrigerant duties." In his response, the appellant does not dispute this statement, arguing only the back pay issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances, we find that the agency has articulated compelling reasons, unrebutted by the appellant, for detailing the appellant to a position where he does not have refrigerant duties. Indeed, the "outside event or determination [that] rendered the appellant incapable of performing the duties of his prior position," <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 198 &#x00B6; 13, was the Board's final determination that the agency proved the charge that the appellant had continually, and after repeated counseling and ongoing training and supervision, failed to maintain proper and correct records of the freon inventories for which he was responsible. The fact that the agency did not file a petition for review of the initial decision is of no consequence since the charge at issue was sustained. The only thing that happened was that the administrative judge mitigated the demotion penalty to a 14-day suspension. The mitigation does not change the fact that charge one was sustained. Thus, the agency exercised its management discretion in assigning the appellant to duties in his shop other than duties involving refrigerants. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">D'Leo v. Department of the Navy</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 44, 48 (1992) (the Board does not have independent jurisdiction over matters concerning an agency's authority to make decisions to assign duties to its employees); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 106, 111 ("the agency has discretion to assign personnel and use its staff in the most efficient manner"), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 891 F.2d 299 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When a penalty was mitigated although charges of inappropriate personal conduct were sustained, the agency could reassign the employee out of a position with the OIG office that required a high level of personal deportment, but the agency had to insure that the employee's assigned job was substantially similar to the job she held prior to the reassignment, <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of Army</span>, 109 MSPR 41, 45-46 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-15, 2008 MSPB 104 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency next argues that the appellant is unfit for her prior position based on the misconduct for which she has been disciplined. According to the agency, such misconduct precludes the appellant from contributing to the OIG's mission, which involves "constantly look[ing] over everyone else's shoulder" and "remain[ing] above reproach in their own deportment." The agency's position is consistent with the administrative judge's findings in the initial decision. The administrative judge found as credible the agency's testimony and documentary evidence reflecting its view that OIG personnel are held to the highest personal standards. The administrative judge determined that the appellant's conduct was unsuitable, tended to detract from her character, and reflected a betrayal of trust. The agency's reason for reassigning the appellant out of OIG was accepted by the Board in what became the final decision. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., House v. Department of the Army</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 530, &#x00B6; 22 (2005) (The agency's reasons for not restoring the appellant to his former position were accepted by the Board in its final decision). The "outside event or determination [that] rendered the appellant incapable of performing the duties of [her] prior position," <span class="Italic">Doe v. Department of Justice</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 198, &#x00B6; 13 (2003), was the Board's determination that, by her actions, the agency proved the charge that she committed conduct unbecoming a federal employee. That the penalty was mitigated does not change the fact that the first charge was sustained. Under the circumstances, the record reflects that the agency has articulated an overriding interest or compelling reason for not returning the appellant to her position in the OIG.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, to be in compliance with the Board's order, the agency must also show that it has reassigned the appellant to a position which is substantially similar to her former position. Here, the responsibilities of the appellant's new position are not substantially similar to those of her former position. <span class="Italic">See Kerr,</span> 726 F.2d at 733 (the Board must determine whether the actual duties and responsibilities to which the employee was returned are either the same as or substantially equivalent in scope and status to the duties and responsibilities held prior to the wrongful discharge); <span class="Italic">Mann</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. at 274-75 (where the Board finds that the interests of the agency are so compelling that they override the appellant's entitlement to return to his former position, the Board must address the question of whether the position to which the appellant has been reassigned is in fact substantially similar to the former position).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Support Specialist position appears to include a diverse list of duties, the appellant alleges that there was no work available that <span id="Page_5026"></span>pertained to the position and that she was instead asked to clean, shred documents, and run errands. The appellant attached an e-mail in which she requested more work and a reply to her e-mail indicating there was simply not enough work for the position. The agency concedes that the two positions are not similar and states that "it is illogical to expect similar tasking duties in a non-IG office." Based on these submissions, we conclude that the agency did not reassign the appellant to a position which is substantially similar to her former OIG position. In order to be in compliance with the Board's order, the agency must return the appellant to her former position of Inspector General Investigative Specialist or reassign her to a substantially similar position.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">When the Board finds a personnel action unwarranted, the aim is to place the appellant, as nearly as possible, in the situation he would have been in had the wrongful personnel action not occurred. <span class="Italic">See House v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, it is undisputed that the agency has not placed the appellant in the position he occupied at the time of his termination. As discussed above, however, the administrative judge found that the agency had placed the appellant in a position similar in responsibility and required expertise to the position he occupied at the time of his termination. Nevertheless, the administrative judge concluded that the agency was in noncompliance because it had failed to show a strong overriding interest or compelling reasons justifying its assignment of the appellant to a different position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its submission to the Board, the agency explains that it accomplishes its mission by, among other things, assigning agency employees to work with the various state public health departments. Prior to his termination, the appellant was assigned to work with the Louisiana Public Health Department. According to the agency, assignees work in state public health departments at the request of the state government, and a state public health department can request that an agency assignee be reassigned out the state. With regard to the appellant, the agency provided a copy of a letter from Dr. M. Rony Francois, Assistant Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, specifically stating that the State of Louisiana "elects not to accept [the appellant]" as an assignee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question before us is whether the agency has now shown a strong overriding interest or compelling reasons for not restoring the appellant to his public health advisor position in Louisiana. In <span class="Italic">Doe v. Department of Justice,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 198, VII 9, 16-17 (2003), the Board found that there was a compelling reason for reassigning a criminal investigator because the offices of two United States Attorneys indicated that they would not allow him to testify in criminal proceedings absent exceptional circumstances. In that case, the Board discussed a number of other cases where it had found that an agency had shown a compelling reason for not restoring an individual to his former position and identified the common element that existed in those cases as "an outside event or determination [that] rendered the appellant incapable of performing the duties of his prior position." <span class="Italic">Doe,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 198, &#x00B6; 13. For example, the Board noted that it had held that where an individual loses the security clearance required for the position he held prior to a reversed removal action, the agency may properly reassign the employee to a different position with similar duties that does not require a security clearance. <span class="Italic">LaBatte v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 58 M.S.P.R. 586, 594 (1993); <span class="Italic">Gray v. Department of the Navy,</span> 29 M.S.P.R. 281, 283-84 (1985). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Marren v. Department of Justice,</span> 32 M.S.P.R. 285, 287 (1987), the Board found that an agency was in compliance where a border patrol agent was not restored to his former position because he lacked a government drivers' license.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We discern little difference between the circumstances in <span class="Italic">Doe</span> and the other cases discussed above and the facts of the instant case. As in those cases, an outside event or determination has rendered the appellant incapable of performing the duties of his prior position. Accordingly, based on Dr. Francois's letter, we find that the agency has shown a compelling reason for reassigning the appellant and is in compliance in that regard.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In his submission to the Board, the appellant argues that, because Dr. Francois lacked personal knowledge of his work performance with the State of Louisiana, the letter was not sworn nor made under penalty of perjury, and it does not cite any evidence, Dr. Francois's letter was insufficient to establish a strong overriding interest or compelling reason for not restoring the appellant to his position in Louisiana. The appellant's argument is misplaced. Dr. Francois's letter establishes that the State of Louisiana did not want the appellant to serve as an agency assignee. The appellant has provided nothing questioning the agency's assertion that public health advisors serve in a particular state only with the consent of the state government.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where a compelling reason exists for reassigning the appellant to a position other than the one he encumbered at the separation, the agency must establish that the duties and responsibilities of the position the employee has been assigned to are substantially equivalent in scope and status to those of the position the employee previously held. <span class="Italic">Miller,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 41, &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">Walker</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 136, &#x00B6; 16; <span class="Italic">Bullock,</span> 80 M.S.P.R. 361, &#x00B6; 5. In analyzing such an issue, the Board must look beyond the title and grade of the positions involved and must conduct an assessment of the scope of the duties and responsibilities of the new position compared with the scope of the duties and responsibilities of the appellant's former position. <span class="Italic">See Doe,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 198, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Joos v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 342, 347 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As mentioned above, the administrative judge reviewed the position descriptions of the public health advisor position occupied by the appellant at the time of his termination and the public health analyst position he currently occupies and found that they were similar in responsibility and expertise. Before the Board, the appellant objects to the administrative judge's determination and asserts that the position he has been placed in is a "sham teleworking" position. In a statement made under penalty of perjury submitted with his objections, the appellant essentially states that he has been placed in a full-time involuntary telework status, he has not been to his assigned duty station nor met face-to-face with an agency employee for a year and a half, and on an average day he speaks with his supervisor for about five minutes and does little or no work commensurate with his grade and position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, the agency bears the burden of proof regarding compliance with the Board's final order. <span class="Italic">See New,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 217, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">Donovan,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 628, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's statement made under penalty of perjury regarding the purported nature of his position and duties constitutes the required specific, nonconclusory, and supported assertions of continued noncompliance. The agency has offered nothing to rebut the appellant's assertions. Thus, we conclude that the agency has failed to demonstrate compliance with the Board's final order.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After remand the Board again considered the compliance proceedings involving Mr. Tubesing's reinstatement in <span class="Italic">Tubesing v.

The agency was noncompliant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]here a compelling reason exists for reassigning an employee to a position other than the one he encumbered at the time of his separation, the agency must establish that the duties and responsibilities of the position to which the employee has been assigned are substantially equivalent in scope and status to those of the position the employee previously held. <span class="Italic">Tubesing</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 393, &#x00B6; 11 (citing <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 41, &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">Walker</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 136, &#x00B6; 16; and <span class="Italic">Bullock</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 361, &#x00B6; 5). In determining whether the duties and responsibilities of the position to which the employee has been assigned are substantially equivalent in scope and status to those of the position the employee previously held, the Board looks beyond the title and grade of the positions involved and conducts an assessment of the scope of the duties and responsibilities of the post-reinstatement position compared with the scope of the duties and responsibilities of the employee's pre-separation position. <span class="Italic">Doe v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the agency offered nothing to rebut the appellant's assertions regarding the duties and nature of the position to which he had been assigned following his reinstatement, the Board found that the agency failed to demonstrate compliance with the Board's prior order. <span class="Italic">Tubesing</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 393, &#x00B6; 14. Accordingly, the Board ordered the agency to "provide evidence that it has assigned the appellant duties and responsibilities commensurate with his position as a GS-13 public health analyst." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 23. The Board also ordered the agency to "provide evidence showing that any telework arrangement involving the appellant is consistent with the arrangements afforded to other similarly situated GS-13 public health analysts." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the September 30, 2009 Opinion and Order, the agency explained that the appellant was placed in a position commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of his previous position. In support of this assertion, the agency quoted a portion of the Opinion and Order where the Board stated that "the administrative judge reviewed the position descriptions of the public health advisor position occupied by the appellant at the time of his termination and the public health analyst position he currently occupies and found that they were similar in responsibility and expertise." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 2 (quoting <span class="Italic">Tubesing</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 393, &#x00B6; 12).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's argument does not show compliance. While the agency is correct that the administrative judge found, in her compliance recommendation, that the position description of the appellant's new position was similar to the position description of his position at the time of his separation, the Board, on review of the administrative judge's compliance recommendation, found that the appellant's unrebutted assertions regarding his actual duties and working conditions established that the agency was in noncompliance in this regard. <span class="Italic">Tubesing</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 393, &#x00B6; 14. Accordingly, the Board ordered the agency to, among other things, "provide evidence that it has assigned the appellant duties and responsibilities commensurate with his position as a GS-13 public health analyst." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 23.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be in compliance, the agency must show that the actual duties and responsibilities assigned to and performed by the appellant in his post-reinstatement position are commensurate with the duties and responsibilities assigned to and performed by the appellant in his pre-separation position. As part of its showing, the agency must "provide evidence showing that any telework arrangement involving the appellant is consistent with the arrangements afforded to other similarly situated GS-13 public health analysts." <span class="Italic">See Tubesing,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 393, &#x00B6; 23.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The employee performance plan submitted by the agency fails to meet this requirement because it does not identify the <span class="Italic">actual</span> tasks assigned to the appellant; rather, it states in general terms that the appellant must disseminate information and maintain key relationships in order to support the effective accomplishment of public health initiatives, manage complex projects to further the mission of the organization, and serve as emergency response coordinator. In contrast, the appellant submitted an affidavit stating that "[s]ince [his] return to the CDC's payroll [his] duties have, in effect, been nonexistent." The appellant further stated that most of his tasks consisted of updating the Branch calendar, an "uncomplicated clerical task" and that he can finish the tasks in a few minutes about once a week. He also stated that on the occasion when he has been given documents to edit, the task takes only a few hours. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The agency has not rebutted the appellant's affidavit. For these reasons, the agency is still in noncompliance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Concerns about inappropriate post-reinstatement actions permitted reassignment of a Customs Service airline pilot in <span class="Italic">Galliart v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 84 MSPR 15, 20-21 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-16 (1999), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Galliart v. Dept. of Treasury</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 00-3063). The pilot, who needed access to a military installation to perform his work, was barred by the base commander for inappropriate behavior. The Board considered the bar order, the evidence relating to the bar, and the continuing effect of the bar, and concluded the agency properly reassigned the appellant to another facility:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of its assertion, the agency presented the sworn statement of William M. Cecil, Chief of the San Diego Aviation Branch. Concerning the incidents leading to the barring order, Cecil averred that the appellant had entered NASNI with his weapon exposed in an unusual manner and wearing a U.S. Postal Service hat; that the incident occurred after the Base Commander received an anonymous letter (written by the appellant) advising of an extremely hostile and dangerous work environment in the Aviation Branch; that the Base Commander's decision to bar the appellant was based on concerns about the potential for workplace violence, and that the barring order still stands. Cecil further stated that he shared the Base Commander's concerns because he had learned that the appellant, after being advised that he would be barred, secreted a stiletto-type knife in such a manner that NASNI security officers did not discover it, despite frisking him. He stated that, after getting past NASNI security, the appellant proudly displayed the knife to Aviation Branch employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record below further supports the agency's assertion....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the agency submitted the April 29, 1996 order barring the appellant from NASNI. Under 18 USC &#x00A7; 1382, the Base Commander has the authority to order any person not to reenter the base. As previously noted, Cecil's affidavit indicated that the barring order was not issued as a result of the appellant's subsequently mitigated removal. Instead, the barring order was based upon the appellant's actions in sending the letter advising of an extremely hostile and dangerous work environment in the Aviation Branch, and his actions in entering NASNI with his weapon exposed in an unusual manner and wearing a U.S. Postal Service hat.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we find that the agency has established that the appellant's actions as described above, and the resulting barring order, constitute overriding circumstances for not placing him in a GS-12 Aircraft Pilot position in the San Diego Aviation Branch. Accordingly, we find that the agency is in compliance with the Board's July 8, 1987 final Order.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-107.html#sec6-106">Bar Order Preventing Entry into Workplace</a>."] A poor driving record after the incident that led to an appellant's demotion provided a compelling reason for the agency's assignment of the appellant to a position that no longer required him to transport explosives after the demotion was reversed. <span class="Italic">Burrell v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 174, 176 (1990) (also justifying the failure of the agency to pay the overtime that would have accrued had he been assigned to his predemotion work location); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dalton v. DOJ</span>, 66 MSPR 429, 434 (1995) (involving an agency's concerns about returning to the worksite a corrections officer who was alleged to have had sexual contacts with inmates and an ongoing investigation clearly established "compelling reasons" for placing the appellant in a home duty status);<span class="Italic"> cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Rose v. DOD,</span> AT-0752-12-0063-B-2 (NP 8/10/2015) (considering a due process issue as to a removal based on AWOL following the appellant's bar from the base for alleged misconduct).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Placement of an appellant on administrative leave following his criminal conviction was justified in <span class="Italic">Payne v. USPS</span>, 55 MSPR 317, 319-21 (1992). A city letter carrier challenged his placement on administrative leave after his removal (for mishandling mail and accepting money in exchange for mail delivery) was reversed. The AJ issued a compliance recommendation ordering the agency to reinstate the appellant to active duty in his letter carrier job. The agency asserted that, shortly after the compliance recommendation was issued, the appellant was convicted on three charges involving the obstruction and desertion of the mails. The agency argued that its interest in protecting the mails "is so strong and overriding that it should be found to have returned appellant, as near as possible to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>." The Board agreed with the agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board possesses broad powers of enforcement of its orders, and it is intended that this power be far-reaching.... An agency, upon the reversal of a removal, is required to place an employee "as nearly as possible in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>." This requirement, however, does not always compel the return of the employee to his or her former position. Where the agency shows a strong, overriding interest in not returning the employee to the identical former position, the Board will analyze the legitimacy of the agency's rationale, and determine whether it justifies a failure to return the employee to the former position. <span class="Italic">Hill v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 49 MSPR 271, 273-74 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency argues that appellant's conviction on criminal charges related to his official duties constitutes such an overriding interest in not returning him to his former position. The Board has held that, notwithstanding an agency's failure to sustain charges of misconduct upon which it based a removal, the introduction of a criminal conviction based on the same or similar misconduct could establish compelling reasons for not returning an employee to his or her exact former position. <span class="Italic">Burrell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 174 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Burrell</span> involved the demotion of a motor vehicle operator for reporting for work "with alcohol present in the body." The charge was not sustained, the demotion was reversed, and the appellant was ordered reinstated to <span id="Page_5028"></span>his former position. The agency did not, however, return the appellant to his identical former position, placing him instead in a similar position that did not involve the transportation of explosives. The agency cited as its compelling reasons three convictions for reckless driving, and one for driving under the influence. These convictions, it argued, rendered the appellant unfit to transport explosives.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board held that these convictions constituted an overriding interest on the part of the agency in not returning appellant to his exact former position. The Board noted that Mr. Burrell's most recent conviction was of particular significance as it occurred after the conduct for which he was demoted, rendering his overall driving record worse than it was at the time of the conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, as in <span class="Italic">Burrell</span>, the agency proffers as a compelling reason for not returning appellant to active duty status a criminal conviction that occurred after the conduct for which appellant was removed. The conviction, the agency argues, is directly related to appellant's official duties. In fact, two of the charges for which appellant was convicted are identical to those upon which the agency based its removal of appellant. We note, however, that only the conviction has relevance to our finding in this case. As the indictments were in effect before the issuance of the initial decision, the agency may not cite it as a compelling reason for its noncompliance. In fact, the agency has offered no plausible explanation for its failure, during the period of time between the indictment and the conviction, to return appellant to his former position. While this failure has been eclipsed by appellant's subsequent conviction, and the agency's evidence that it has proposed his removal, our holding might have been different in the absence of evidence of appellant's conviction. In this instance, however, appellant's conviction constitutes new and material evidence that was not available at the time the Recommendation issued....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that our holding in <span class="Italic">Mann v. Veterans Administration</span>, 29 MSPR 271 (1985), requires an evaluation of the degree to which the duties of the position to which an employee is reinstated differ from those of the position he or she encumbered prior to a wrongful removal. In this case, the agency implies by its argument that it has so compelling an interest in protecting the mails that there is no position to which appellant could be assigned in lieu of that from which he was removed. Appellant has not, in his reply, pointed to any other position to which he could be assigned that does not involve the mails. In addition, although appellant argues that he has not violated any agency regulations, the agency submitted a copy of its April 22, 1992, notice of proposed removal based on the charge of conviction of a crime. The notice also lists sections of the agency's Code of Ethical Conduct and the Employee and Labor Relations Manual that it alleges appellant has violated. Appellant did not respond to these allegations in his reply to the agency's brief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, therefore, that while the agency has not returned appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, it has established compelling reasons for not yet so doing. In view of these compelling reasons, we find that the agency has returned appellant as nearly as possible to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we noted above, appellant argues in his reply to the agency's brief that the agency should have filed a petition for review of the initial decision on the merits because it knew of his indictment at the time the initial decision issued. While an agency may not challenge the merits of a final Board decision in the context of a compliance proceeding, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 37 MSPR 129, 131 (1988), the agency here is not challenging the merits. Rather, the agency has, pursuant to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.183(a)(iii), made a showing of good cause for its failure to comply completely with the Board's decision in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Inappropriate actions by the appellant following his restoration to the workplace may justify inquiry by the agency into the propriety of restoration of his prior duties, as with an appellant with law enforcement responsibilities, <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 70 MSPR 182, 186-87 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant eventually completed the necessary training, the agency did not return his law enforcement commission to him, because of its concerns about his psychological condition. These concerns were based on the appellant's comments to Supervisory Park Ranger Hollis Provins that he wanted to kill his supervisor, would have used an edged weapon to do so, and would have mounted heads on stakes by the Liberty Bell. Additionally, on a questionnaire the appellant had stated that he had experienced problems on or off the job because of emotional or mental conditions, and that he had seen a health care professional for these types of problems. Accordingly, the agency sought to send the appellant for a psychological evaluation. The administrative judge found that this was reasonable, and that the agency had demonstrated a compelling interest in not immediately restoring the appellant to his former law enforcement duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant continues to argue that he should not have been required to undergo a background check, that the agency should not have taken his remarks seriously, and that he should not be sent for psychological evaluation. As the administrative judge found, however, the agency had the right to ensure that the appellant was fit to perform law enforcement duties, which include tasks such as carrying a firearm and making arrests. <span class="Italic">Cf. LaBatte v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force</span>, 58 MSPR 586, 594 (1993) (agency had a strong overriding interest in not returning appellant to his former position which required a security clearance, where appellant lacked such a clearance). We note that the agency has not found the appellant to be unfit for law enforcement duties, but has asked only for an evaluation of his fitness. In our view, the administrative judge correctly found that the agency could reasonably ask for such an evaluation before restoring the appellant to law enforcement duties<span class="Italic">. See Coffey v. US Postal Service</span>, 60 MSPR 533, 538, <span class="Italic">dismissed</span>, 22 F.3d 1106 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table) (addressing psychological fitness of former clerk).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further argues that the agency is not in compliance with the Board's order because it has assigned him janitorial and maintenance work, rather than duties that would be more consistent with his park ranger position. He contends that even if the agency were justified in denying him his law enforcement commission, there are park ranger duties, such as conducting tours, and giving lectures, that he could perform without such a commission. In an affidavit, the agency stated that while the appellant was on the roster, but unable to perform law enforcement duties, he agreed to perform work that had gotten backlogged, which included cleaning out an office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Previously, we have found that when an agency has shown a compelling reason for reassigning an appellant rather than returning him to his old duties, we will examine the new duties to see whether they place the appellant as closely as possible in the position he was in before the adverse action (<span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mann v. Veterans Administration</span>, 29 MSPR 271, 275 (1985). Although the administrative judge correctly concluded that the agency had a compelling reason for not immediately restoring the appellant to his former duties, she did not address the propriety of the appellant's assignment to maintenance duties while awaiting restoration of his law enforcement commission. The record on this point is not well-developed, and we are unable to decide it here. Accordingly, it is necessary to remand this issue to the administrative judge for development of the record and further consideration of whether the appellant's assignment to maintenance duties pending restoration of his commission constituted noncompliance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency may not avoid restoration of the employee to her prior job because she filed an EEO complaint identifying discriminatory practices by her prior managers, <span class="Italic">Duffrin v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 70 MSPR 557, 561-62 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contended that it reassigned the appellant to a different area because her EEO complaint alleged discrimination and harassment and contained strong and specific allegations that management in Area 6 was responsible for creating a hostile work environment. The agency also stated that it assigned the appellant to Area 2 because its "most recent staffing analysis" showed that Area 6 was overstaffed by two new Developmental ATCs, while Area 2 was understaffed by three new Developmental ATCs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Irrespective of the agency's asserted staffing needs, it nonetheless categorically stated below that "it would not have assigned [the appellant] to Area 6, even if there had been a vacancy." And, although the agency again asserts in its response to the petition for review that the appellant's reassignment was made through a reasonable process addressed to staffing needs, that process is for assigning new Developmental ATCs. The appellant was not a new developmental, but rather was being recycled through the training process, and the undisputed record evidence shows that the normal practice was to return a recycled trainee to her prior air traffic area. Hence, we find that the only reason the agency reassigned the appellant to Area 2 was that she had a pending EEO complaint against certain personnel in Area 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our governing statute prohibits the taking or failure to take a personnel action, such as a reinstatement or reassignment, because of the filing of an EEO complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9). Thus, we find that an EEO complaint cannot constitute an "overriding interest" justifying an agency's failure to return an appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. There may be some instances, supported by specific evidence, where <span class="Italic">circumstances arising from</span> the EEO complaint (as opposed to the EEO complaint <span class="Italic">per se</span>) might override the interest in having the employee returned to her former position. The mere fact that the reinstated employee has filed an EEO complaint, however, cannot be accepted as a compelling reason for failing to return her to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>.

If the agency does not return the employee to his former position, it must show that: 1) it has a strong overriding interest or compelling reason requiring reassignment to a different position, and 2) it has reassigned the employee to a position which is substantially similar to the former position. <span class="Italic">Id.; Mann v.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The agency has not demonstrated an overriding interest or compelling reason requiring the appellant's reassignment.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has not returned the appellant to his previous shop but instead has reassigned him to a newly-created position in a different division, the Medium Range Surveillance (MRS) division. According to the agency, the reassignment was necessary because the appellant's "working relationship with his colleagues has been an on-going source of interpersonal conflict." As examples of the appellant's "continuing behavioral issues," the Executive Officer of the Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) states that the appellant has a vanity license plate that reads "Blo me ALC" and that he has worn a t-shirt stating "Did I mention I am a winner," which the agency believes is a reference to his successful Board appeal. The agency's allegations are not sufficient to show that the appellant will cause disruption if he is reinstated to his former position. <span class="Italic">See Saal v. Department of the Navy</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 670, 675 (1988) (although the appellant may have reacted strongly to the agency's actions, the agency's conclusions about his future behavior are speculative). As the administrative judge observed, "it merely appears that agency officials want to disregard a Board order just because they do not like the appellant's audacious behavior concerning the events in this case."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency additionally asserts "a strong business case" for reassigning the appellant to the newly-created position in the MRS Division. Specifically, the agency discusses the advantages of "introducing a skilled Plastic Fabricator into the MRS Division at this time" due to the division's emerging composite needs. The agency does not explain, however, why its business reasons require the reassignment of the appellant, in particular, as opposed to another competent Plastic Fabricator. In the absence of such an explanation, it is understandable that the appellant believes the reassignment is retaliatory. In sum, the agency simply has not presented a compelling reason or an overriding interest requiring the appellant's reassignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant was not placed in a substantially similar position.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant retained the same title and grade in his reassignment. To fully evaluate whether a position is substantially similar, however, the Board must look beyond the title and grade of a position and examine the scope of the duties of the new position. <span class="Italic">Vincent v. Department of Justice</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 263, 267 (1987). Here, the appellant's duties vary from those he had been previously assigned. The agency states that the appellant has been assigned "janitor duties" because he "was limited in the composite work he could do, and was assigned to clean up the shop space in the interim." The agency further concedes that, in his new position, the appellant does not have access to the same equipment that he had in his previous position. Despite the agency's contention that his workspace is now, or will soon be, in working order, the facility still will not have the same equipment as his ALC colleagues. For example, the appellant's new position does not involve the same freezer and oven access as his old position, rendering him unable to perform the type of work that requires this equipment. The appellant also contends, and the agency does not dispute, that the lack of coworkers at the MRS hangar affects his ability to earn overtime. Given the differences in facilities, scope of duties, and actual work opportunities, the agency has failed to show that it has reinstated the appellant to the same or substantially similar position.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">But when an agency demoted and reassigned a supervisor for inappropriate comments to female employees, and on appeal the action was mitigated to a suspension, the Board left open the possibility that reassignment was appropriate when the agency pointed out during compliance proceedings that the female employees who complained about the appellant's conduct, and who were previously supervised by the appellant, were still employed at the office where the appellant desired to return, <span class="Italic">Spates v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 438, 442-43 (1996):</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, in determining whether an agency has returned an appellant as nearly as possible to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, the Board does not require the agency to return him to a specific location. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rubeck</span>, 66 MSPR at 529-30, citing <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v.

<p class="Body-Text">Concerns about minor theft did not permit an agency to avoid assignment of a security guard to a night shift, <span class="Italic">Clemons v. Smithsonian Inst</span>., 50 MSPR 74, 78-81 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the agency did not meet the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> standard when it failed to reinstate the appellant to a night shift position, the remaining question is whether the agency had a legitimate management reason for reassigning the appellant to a day shift position. Although the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> principle generally requires that the employee be reinstated to the same position (or a substantially equivalent one) from which he was removed, Kerr does not require that an employee always be returned to his or her former position. In such cases, if the Board finds that the interests of the agency are compelling, those reasons may be sufficient to override the appellant's entitlement to his former position. <span class="Italic">Nielson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 32 MSPR 332, 337 (1987), appeal after remand, 37 MSPR 324 (1988). Where the agency has a strong overriding interest in not placing the employee in the same position, the Board will analyze the legitimacy of the agency's proffered rationale to determine if it is sufficient to justify the agency's action. <span class="Italic">Mann v. Veterans Administration</span>, 29 MSPR 271 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency alleges that the appellant's reassignment to the day shift <span id="Page_5030"></span>was necessary for security at the agency. It argues that the night shift does not afford the necessary supervision provided during the day shift and, consequently, that the night shift security guards must be beyond reproach in regard to integrity and honesty. The agency further asserts that the appellant does not meet this standard because he committed a theft, and argues that it should be permitted to reassign him to another shift.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found, and we concur, that although the appellant did in fact take the property, the seriousness of the offense was mitigated by several factors: (1) the value of the item was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>: (2) the appellant reported the break-in to his supervisor; (3) the appellant did not take more valuable property which was available; (4) the appellant admitted the misconduct; and (5) the appellant did not attempt to deceive agency investigators. In other Board cases involving more egregious conduct by security guards, the Board has found employees sufficiently trustworthy to be returned to their former positions.... While the theft of a soda from an agency cafeteria cannot be condoned, it is hardly on a scale of larcenous conduct that warrants close and continuing supervision. The factors outlined above as well as the fact that the record does not show any prior instances of misconduct all indicate that the appellant is sufficiently trustworthy to be placed on the night shift. Consequently, we reject the agency's arguments regarding the appellant's trustworthiness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts that it made a legitimate, nondiscriminatory management decision in not reinstating the appellant to his former night shift position. It asserts that the reassignment was not done to circumvent compliance because the appellant was placed in the same position at the same grade and base pay as his former position. In support of its argument that the Board may not review its failure to return the appellant to the night shift, the agency cites to <span class="Italic">Spinks v. United States Postal Service</span>, 621 F.2d 987 (9th Cir. 1980). In that decision, the court held that reduction of an employee's night differential pay due to a shift change does not constitute a reduction in pay necessitating the application of grievance procedures reserved for adverse actions. However, the agency's reliance on this decision is misplaced. Spinks involved an alleged adverse action in which the appellant specifically brought the case to appeal his loss of shift differential pay. In contrast, the issue in this case concerns compliance with a previous Board order in an enforcement proceeding brought under 5 USCA &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2) (West. Supp. 1990). While the appellant's reassignment and resulting loss of pay differential would generally not have been appealable as adverse actions, they are within this Board's jurisdiction to consider in a compliance case....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also cites to <span class="Italic">Gray v. Department of Navy</span>, 29 MSPR 281 (1985), in support of its position. In that case, the Board found that reassignment of the appellant to a position that did not require a security clearance restored him as nearly as possible to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> where the appellant's security clearance had been revoked. In that case, however, the Board held that it had no authority to order reinstatement of a security clearance. It further held that because the appellant required a security clearance to perform his former job, the agency's reassignment of the appellant to an equivalent position not requiring a security clearance was sufficient to comply with the Board's order. This is not the case here. The agency does not assert that the appellant's alleged unsuitability for night shift work is in any way related to security clearance considerations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In its response to the appellant's motion for compliance dated September 24, 1990, the agency alleged that there were no positions available for the appellant on the night shift. This issue was not addressed by the administrative judge, and the agency did not subsequently raise it in its brief supporting its disagreement with the administrative judge's recommendation. The agency may therefore be deemed to have abandoned this claim. In any event, the agency's claim that no night shift positions were available is not dispositive in this case. The fact that the agency filled the appellant's former position does not establish a compelling reason for failing to reinstate the appellant to a position on the night shift. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 32 MSPR 259, 262 (1987), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Mann</span>, 29 MSPR at 275.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agency justifications for changing jobs or duties of an appellant who is ordered restored to the position may fail for lack of proof supporting the justification offered. In <span class="Italic">Vincent v. DOJ</span>, 32 MSPR 263, 267-68 (1987), an appellant's removal from the position of correctional officer was mitigated to a suspension. The charges were that he had an inappropriate relationship with an inmate, failed to report contact with a former inmate's friend, breached security, concealed a fact during an investigation, and provided a false statement during an agency investigation. On his return to duty, he was reassigned from the low-security installation he worked at prior to removal, the Allenwood prison camp, to a nearby maximum-security installation, Lewisburg Penitentiary. The agency did not comply with its reinstatement order, i.e., the agency did not present sufficient reasons for the reassignment. The pre- and post-reassignment positions were compared in detail. The positions at Allenwood and Lewisburg were the same, but the duties were somewhat different, and the type of inmate was different at the two institutions: the risk of working at the maximum security installation was greater. The agency sought to justify its decision by arguing that the employees at the prior location would not trust the appellant. The Board responded: "We note that the agency's argument that it could no longer trust appellant in his position is identical to its argument for removing appellant from his position. This argument was rejected by the administrative judge in the initial decision." In <span class="Italic">Williams v. DHHS</span>, 32 MSPR 259, 262 (1987), it was noted--with significance as to proof in compliance proceedings--that the agency's reasons for its actions were stated only in its response to the petition for enforcement. Statements made in the response are not evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gamel v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 168, 172 (1989) (discounting allegations of untrustworthiness and rejecting as speculative agency concerns about the possibility of future violations of security regulations); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Nielson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 32 MSPR 332, 336-37 (1987) (remanding for regional determination whether agency had a strong, overriding interest for placing the appellant in a policymaking position with limited supervisory responsibility rather than returning him to his original operational position with extensive operational and budgetary responsibilities).
