<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-16"><span class="space">a.</span> Nondispositive EEO, Prohibited Personnel Practice Issue</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">When the Board determines that it does not have jurisdiction over an action, e.g., an unsuccessful constructive adverse action appeal, the Board may avoid adjudicating EEO issues by deciding the case on a jurisdictional or timeliness issue. In <span class="Italic">Tyler v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 10 MSPR 439, 440 n.2 (1982), the AJ erred by making factual findings regarding an alleged forced retirement because of age discrimination. Instead, the AJ should have confined his discussion to jurisdiction, the same issue as voluntariness. If the AJ determines that a resignation to be voluntary, the AJ should not enter alternative findings concerning allegations of discrimination or concerning the merits of a removal action mooted by the earlier resignation. <span class="Italic">Schumert v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 350, 352 (1989).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board reiterated its position in <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 683, 687 (1989): an AJ need not adjudicate an allegation that a resignation is caused by an adverse action proposal motivated by reprisal for prior EEO complaints if the agency demonstrates another arguable basis for the proposal. <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> was initially reversed by the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 906 F.2d 689 (Fed. Cir. 1990). On rehearing, however, the court adhered to the Board's view, <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240, 1243-46, 1248 (Fed. Cir. 1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the AJ and the Board recognized, the sole issue in this case is whether the Board had jurisdiction over Cruz' appeal to it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has only that jurisdiction conferred on it by Congress.... The Board's limited jurisdiction as here applicable is set by a Statute, 5 USC 7512, which grants the Board jurisdiction to hear and determine challenges to specific adverse actions of agencies, including removals and four other adverse actions not here involved. The <span class="Italic">sole</span> agency action in this case is its January 28, 1988 notification to Cruz of its tentative proposal to remove him on charges specifying numerous acts of insubordination and unacceptable performance of one critical element of his position....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Cruz' February 16, 1988 letter announcing his resignation effective March 1, 1988, and his disregard of two written warnings that failure to withdraw his resignation would forfeit his appeal rights, forestalled all agency procedures and resulted in the agency's taking no action at all, much less an appealable action, on the proposed removal. There being no appealable action, the Board was without jurisdiction and there was nothing with which Cruz' reprisal assertion could be "mixed."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the Board lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine an appeal from an employee who has voluntarily resigned. The courts, however, have recognized a corollary proposition, i.e., that the Board does have jurisdiction to hear and determine an appeal by an employee whose resignation was not voluntary, an involuntary resignation being deemed a "constructive removal." The Board has jurisdiction to determine whether a resignation was voluntary or involuntary because it has jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction.... A resignation is either voluntary or involuntary on the date it is submitted and jurisdiction must be determined as of that date. Cruz, who has the burden of establishing jurisdiction, alleged before the Board that his resignation was involuntary because the agency knew that the charges it cited as the basis for proposing his removal could not be substantiated. That allegation was correctly found to be without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Resignations are presumed voluntary...and Cruz has submitted no evidence overcoming that presumption or indicating that his resignation was involuntary. On the contrary, the record establishes a textbook example of a voluntary resignation submitted in the face of serious charges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for Board review, Cruz recognized that his reprisal claim rested on the absence of reasonable grounds for proposing his removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In the absence of sustainable charges and substantive documentation, and in the presence of so many procedural violations, it can only be concluded that there was another reason for the agency's actions; and that reason is my prior EEO involvement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The opposite of Cruz' scenario is present here, where there was strong evidence that the charges constituted good cause, there was substantive documentation, and his resignation precluded all procedures on the proposal. We repeat that the only agency action here was the notification of intent to remove in view of serious charges. The AJ found and the Board affirmed the finding that the Navy fully believed the charges would be sustained. Under such objective circumstances the Navy would have been remiss if it had condoned Cruz' conduct by failing to bring the charges it brought. In cases properly before this court, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, those not involving discrimination, the Board's jurisdiction over an allegedly involuntary resignation has been determined by an evaluation of objective facts without exploration of the subjective motivation of either the employee or the agency....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It must be remembered that the asserted act of reprisal here is the Navy's bringing of the charges. The sole issue here is the Board's jurisdiction, and that issue resolves into whether Cruz' resignation was voluntary or involuntary because obtained by coercion, deception or the like. All evidence of involuntariness must be considered, but the reprisal assertion, if the Board had independent jurisdiction over it, would be subsumed by the findings of no coercion, or deception, or other improper agency act. Though we obviously do not here decide whether reprisal may or may not have been among the motives of Cruz' supervisors, we cannot hold <span id="Page_1615"></span>that the bringing of numerous, valid, serious and sustainable charges of conduct that destroys the efficiency of the service constitutes coercion to resign. To so hold would be contrary to precedent and to common sense. This court has repeatedly held that the imminence of a less desirable alternative does not render involuntary the choice made....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Cruz' primary assertion in his appeal here is that the Board should have decided his reprisal claim and notified him of a right to appeal that decision to the EEOC or a district court because the agency's January 29, 1988 letter was in reprisal for filing his 1987 EEOC complaint. But that mere assertion does not provide a basis for Board jurisdiction in this voluntary resignation case. First, a petitioner's mere assertion cannot create jurisdiction. Second, as above indicated, bringing charges, for whatever reason, is not in itself an agency action appealable to the Board. Nor are discriminatory acts in themselves agency actions appealable to the Board. A statute, 5 USC 2302(b), makes reprisal a prohibited personnel practice, but that statute is not an independent source of Board jurisdiction....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor would a source of jurisdiction be created by accepting, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, Cruz' label for his reprisal assertion: "Title VII claim of discrimination." The Board has not been granted jurisdiction over Title VII claims <span class="Italic">per se</span>, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, over "pure" or "naked" Title Vll claims unaccompanied by an appealable action over which the Board does have jurisdiction. Cruz on this appeal attempts to convert his attempted appeal under Title 5, USC to a suit for discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. As above indicated, when discrimination is asserted in an appeal from a removal or other appealable adverse agency action over which the Board <span class="Italic">has</span> jurisdiction, the case is a "mixed case" and the Board must decide the merits of the appealable action and whether it was a discriminatory act. 5 USC 7702. In such cases, the Board routinely notifies appellants of a right to EEOC review. Where, as here, it has been found that there never was an appealable adverse agency action, the case is not a "mixed case," sec. 7702 is not involved, and the Board correctly determined that it was without jurisdiction to consider Cruz' claim of procedural error or his reprisal assertion, or any other claim beyond the Board's jurisdiction. That holding and our affirmance break no new ground.... For the same reason, the Board correctly declined to refer to any right of EEOC review and Cruz' motion for transfer of this case to a district court must be denied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...It may be that a resignation case could arise in which the facts would compel a Board decision on a reprisal assertion. We hold only that in a case like the present, where the Board has determined that a resignation in the face of serious charges was voluntary, it never acquired jurisdiction to decide anything, including the question of whether there may also have been another reason--one outside the Board's statutorily assigned jurisdiction--for proposing those valid charges....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming jurisdiction, the Board must decide a discrimination issue even if the underlying action is overturned on due process grounds. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Givens v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 374, 380 (1991). <span class="Italic">Marchese v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 32 MSPR 461, 464 (1987), marking a departure from prior law, involved an appeal from a constructive suspension. The AJ reversed the suspension on procedural grounds, but did not reach the affirmative defense of discrimination. The Board remanded:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Congress has expressly mandated at 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(a) that the Board render a decision on discrimination allegations raised in connection with otherwise appealable actions.... Where the Board or its administrative judge finds that an appealable action has occurred, as in this case, he must offer the appellant the opportunity to develop and prove any discrimination claims made, regardless of whether the action may be overturned on procedural grounds alone.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching this conclusion, we recognize that the Board may have held or implied in other cases that allegations of discrimination need not be addressed where the appeal is decided on other issues.... To the extent that these cases may be deemed to hold that the Board and its administrative judges are not required to adjudicate allegations of discrimination raised in connection with certain appealable actions, they are hereby overruled.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Marchese</span> is followed as to allegations of prohibited personnel practices intermixed with procedural error claims. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Morey v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 34 MSPR 97, 100 (1987); <span class="Italic">on</span> <span class="Italic">appeal</span> <span class="Italic">following</span> <span class="Italic">remand</span>, 38 MSPR 14, 17 (1988) ("Even though we find that the constructive suspension action cannot be sustained because of the agency's harmful error, we conclude that the appellant's appeal must be remanded to the regional office to afford the appellant the opportunity to develop and prove his claim of disability discrimination, regardless of whether the action has been overturned on the procedural grounds."). Under <span class="Italic">Morey</span>, however, the appellant must first demonstrate that the procedural error (in that appeal a constructive suspension) is within the Board's jurisdiction before the collateral EEO or prohibited personnel practice claim will be considered. Once the appellant has demonstrated jurisdiction, the EEO allegations must be resolved, even if the agency's action is reversible on procedural error alone. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fontanilla v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 37 MSPR 516, 519 (1988) (disability claim had to be resolved despite the reversal of enforced leave (suspension) for the lack of procedural due process); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Polite v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 49 MSPR 653, 657-58 (1991) (removal of a VRA employee was reversed on procedural grounds; disability discrimination allegations were remanded for regional adjudication; an immediate remedy was ordered irrespective of the outcome of an analysis of the EEO allegations); <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. DHHS</span>, 49 MSPR 644, 652 (1991) (Chapter 43 removal was reversed for the lack of a proper performance standard; MSPB directed that the appellant be issued a remedy to effectuate the reversal of the removal; the appeal was remanded to the region to continue its consideration of prohibited personnel practice issues). The additional analysis of EEO issues when charges are reversed for procedural error may become important, for example, when a counsel fee determination must be made: the fee determinants for mixed cases differ from those for other appeals that result in reversal of removals. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 45 MSPR 475, 479 (1990). Resolution of the EEO issue is also significant if there is a claim for compensatory damages.

<p class="Body-Text">The necessity to decide affirmative defenses despite procedural reversals was explained, <span class="Italic">Lewis v. DHHS</span>, SF-0752-11-0517-I-1 (NP 6/17/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also contends on review that the administrative judge erred in determining that she failed to establish her affirmative defenses of reprisal for equal employment opportunity (EEO) and union activity. In <span class="Italic">Marchese v. Department of the Navy</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 461, 464 (1987), the Board held that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a) gives an appellant the right to a decision on a claim of discrimination even when the Board has already determined that the action must be reversed on other grounds. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Schibik v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 591, &#x00B6; 11 (2005). In <span class="Italic">Morey v. Department of the Navy</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 97, 100 (1987), the Board extended the rule in <span class="Italic">Marchese</span> to all cognizable claims of prohibited personnel practices. Moreover, the appellant's allegation of retaliation for EEO activity is an issue of discrimination, falling under both 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702 and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's regulations, that must be adjudicated even if the appellant has prevailed on other grounds. <span class="Italic">See White v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 475, 479 (1990), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Mitchell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 103, 114 n.5 (1991); <span class="Italic">Bartel v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 451, 457 (1986) (reprisal for engaging in an EEO complaint process is discrimination prohibited under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) and 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e). Thus, when an appealable action is reversed on procedural grounds the Board must still decide claims of retaliation for protected activity. <span class="Italic">See Crosby v.

Although the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant's claims of marital status discrimination and reprisal for whistleblowing do not fall under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702, the Board has held that it must address allegations of prohibited personnel practices even though the agency action cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">See Ginocchi v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 62, 73 (1992); <span class="Italic">Morey v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although some of the appellant's allegations, including his claims of prohibited personnel practices and retaliation for EEO activity, were not specifically identified by the administrative judge in the Order and Summary of Prehearing Conference, and although the appellant did not object to that Order, the appellant raised those allegations below and the administrative judge did not address them in the Order as required by <span class="Italic">Wynn v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 146, &#x00B6; 10 (2010). Thus, because the record does not establish that the appellant abandoned or withdrew the affirmative defenses not mentioned in the administrative judge's Order, we remand this appeal for adjudication of all of the appellant's <span id="Page_1616"></span>claims of prohibited personnel practices, including his claims of marital status discrimination, retaliation for whistleblowing and EEO activity, and other prohibited personnel practices. <span class="Italic">See Doran v.

<p class="Body-Text">The requirement that an AJ resolve EEO allegations follows the proper assertion of an EEO affirmative defense. If the defense is not properly raised and identified in the prehearing proceedings, the AJ will not be faulted for not deciding the issue, even though evidence apparently is taken on the EEO matter during the hearing and even though the AJ's initial decision may contain some discussion of the issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bratton v.
