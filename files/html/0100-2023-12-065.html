<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-65"><span class="space">16.</span> Authority to Reopen and Reconsider</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 1201.118 (2022), provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Board reopening of final decisions</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regardless of any other provision of this part, the Board may at any time reopen any appeal in which it has issued a final order or in which an initial decision has become the Board's final decision by operation of law. The Board will exercise its discretion to reopen an appeal only in unusual or extraordinary circumstances and generally within a short period of time after the decision becomes final.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In commentary accompanying the revised regulation on reopening, the Board commented, 77 Fed. Reg. 62349, 62359 (10/12/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board believes that reopening or reconsidering a final decision must be confined to rare and limited circumstances and that nothing in the proposed regulation conflicts with the grant of authority given to the MSPB under 5 U.S.C. 7701(e)(1).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Procedurally distinct from the PFR process, but serving a related purpose, is the Board's authority to reopen and reconsider initial decisions. The PFR procedure depends on one or the other party timely filing a review request and, at least in theory, the grounds for a PFR are quite narrow. The reopening procedure, defined at 5 CFR 1201.118 (2022), reserves to the Board the authority to "reopen an appeal and reconsider a decision of an AJ on its own motion at any time, regardless of any other provisions of [5 CFR Part 1201]." The authority is derived from 5 USC 7701(e)(1)(B), explaining that decisions on appeals become final if there is neither a timely PFR nor a decision by the Board to reopen and reconsider a case. If OPM is not a party or intervenor in an appeal, OPM is required to petition the Board for reconsideration of a decision that it seeks to have judicially reviewed. 5 USC 7703(d).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The statutory authority to reopen is reiterated by the Board's regulation, 5 CFR 1201.118 (2022), granting the Board authority to reopen and reconsider an AJ's decision at any time. The Board, like other administrative agencies, has inherent authority to reopen and reconsider its decisions on its own initiative provided that proper notice is given to the parties and the right is exercised within a reasonable time. <span class="Italic">Rysavy v. DHUD</span>, 28 MSPR 263, 264 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dawson v. MSPB</span>, 712 F.2d 264, 266-67 (7th Cir. 1983) ("Upon our examination of the enabling statute and the Board's interpretative regulation, we are <span id="Page_1646"></span>unable to find any language that places a time limit on the Board's authority to reopen a case on its own motion," citing <span class="Italic">Bookman v. United States</span>, 453 F.2d 1263 (Ct. Cl. 1972)); <span class="Italic">Sutcliff v. OPM,</span> 86 MSPR 101, 104-05 &#x00B6; 7 (2000) (reopening to avoid a manifest injustice arising out of an administrative error involving the appellant's military service deposit and annuity entitlement); <span class="Italic">Fields v. OPM</span>, 79 MSPR 659, 661 &#x00B6; 6 (1998) (reopening to prevent a manifest injustice to the appellant's substantive rights involving entitlement to survivor annuity benefits); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Bradford</span>, 69 MSPR 247, 248-49 (1995) (noting that the authority to reopen on the Board's own motion extends to its interlocutory decisions); <span class="Italic">Lary v. OPM</span>, 68 MSPR 206, 210 (1995) ("We are empowered to reopen an appeal, even after a final decision has been issued, to correct our own errors or to modify our previous decision."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Weaver v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 2 MSPR 129, 132, 2 MSPB 297 (1980) (AJ's authority is delegated and the Board retains residual authority to review the initial decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may reopen a case on its own volition. It may do so based on "unusual equitable or legal circumstances." <span class="Italic">Choco v. OPM</span>, 69 MSPR 638, 641 (1996); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Shannon v.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1647"></span>Here, Searcy has not identified any unusual or extraordinary circumstances that would warrant reopening or reconsidering any of the Board's decisions in the prior appeals. Instead, he simply disagrees with the Board and maintains that he should have "previously won on the merits."

We also rejected Searcy's attempt to overturn the Board's final decisions via a mandamus petition. The present appeal is yet another attempt to reverse the Board's final decision on his USERRA appeal.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency has presented evidence that the initial decision inadvertently ordered a remedy to which the appellant was not entitled, and that may result in the appellant receiving no remedy at all. The appellant has not challenged the substance of the agency's allegations. Moreover, the agency sought correction of the initial decision from the Board only 6 days after the agency's representative learned of the problem with the initial decision and only 15 days after the deadline for filing a petition for review. Under these circumstances, we reopen this appeal in the interests of justice to address the merits of the agency's petition and modify the order language in the initial decision</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's evidence includes a "Bid History" showing that in October 2010 the agency found the appellant ineligible only for job slot 70310619. This "Bid History" was submitted into the record below. The agency's evidence on review also indicates that "Position ID" 70310619 refers to a "Parcel Post Dist-Machine" position that requires qualifications for "SPBS Dexterity" and "SPBS Application." A declaration from the agency's attorney similarly indicates that the job identification number for the Machine Distribution Clerk position is 70310619, and a list of vacancy notices submitted by the appellant below shows that "Job ID: 70310619" refers to a "Parcel Post Dist-Machine" position. The record below also includes a November 9, 2010 letter from the appellant indicating that she had bid on, and had been approved by her doctor to perform, a "Parcel Post Dist-Machine" position, a "Sales, Svcs/Distribution Assoc" position, and a "Markup Clerk Automated" position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not challenged on review the substance of the agency's argument and evidence, which is consistent with the appellant's hearing exhibits. Although an Operations Support Specialist testified at the hearing that the appellant was designated as the senior bidder for an Automated Markup Clerk position, that witness did not testify that the appellant had been ruled ineligible for the Automated Markup Clerk position, and did not elaborate as to how she knew that the appellant was the senior bidder for that position or what time frame was involved. Moreover, it does not appear that the witness was relying on any documentation in support of that testimony. Thus, we find that a preponderance of the evidence of record shows that the agency arbitrarily and capriciously denied the appellant restoration when it found her ineligible for the Machine Distribution Clerk position.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Sullivan</span>, 7 MSPR 357, 7 MSPB 239 (1981), the Board was asked by OSC to reconsider its dismissal of the charges brought against the respondent. The Board recited its understanding of the law. The federal courts uniformly hold that administrative tribunals have inherent or implicit authority to reconsider for correction of clerical or inadvertent ministerial errors. Beyond that authority, however, factors considered include the nature of the agency mission, the specific agency action in issue, the need for finality, detrimental reliance on the decision, and the availability of judicial review. If jurisdiction to reconsider is present, its exercise is discretionary and required only in extraordinary circumstances. The only standard uniformly accepted for reconsideration or rehearing is clear and material legal error. Even that criterion is generally confined to conflicts between the holding of the decision and a controlling precedent or statute--conflicts that develop because of oversight by the court or because of a change in the controlling law between the date of the original decision and the rehearing request. Courts are rarely persuaded to reconsider or rehear on the basis of new facts, even if the proffered facts are material and there is a showing of prior unavailability, despite due diligence. To warrant reconsideration the new evidence must be likely to substantially change the posture of the case; it is not sufficient that it updates the record or that it provides some new insight into the matters in issue. In light of these consistently stringent limitations on reconsideration and rehearing, petitions cannot be granted for reargument of matters, either factual or legal, deliberated and decided upon by the tribunal. On this matter, "rules, cases, and justices speak with one voice." <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>, 7 MSPR at 360 (citing <span class="Italic">Louisell</span> and <span class="Italic">Degnan</span>, <span class="Italic">Rehearing in American Appellate Courts</span>, 44 Calif. L. Rev. 627, 635 (1956)). Getting down to specifics, the Board determined that OSC was essentially rearguing the weight that should be given to evidence in the case against Mr. Sullivan. Noting that 5 USC 1207(c) [now 5 USC 1215(a)(4)] precluded any administrative appeal in cases decided by the Board on OSC complaints, and determining that the OSC petition for reconsideration neither made any showing of clear legal error nor purported to present new evidence, the Board denied the petition.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Requests by parties for reconsideration of final Board decisions are not readily granted, as <span class="Italic">Mudrich v. USDA</span>, 93 MSPR 313, 314-15 &#x00B6; 2 (2003), implied:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Director of the Office of Personnel Management may petition for reconsideration of a Board final order within 35 days after the date of service, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.119, there is no similar rule permitting other parties or nonparties to do so.

There are, however, three exceptions to the doctrine: 1) the availability of new and substantially different evidence; 2) a contrary decision by controlling authority that is applicable to the question at issue; or 3) a showing that the prior decision in the same appeal was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Compared to the number of appeals annually decided through PFR, very few appeals are reopened under 5 CFR 1201.118. The Board may reach out and revisit an AJ's decision; more often, the Board receives a petition to reopen from a party after the initial decision has become final. The petition to reopen may constitute a belated PFR directly challenging an initial decision, or a party may seek to reopen not because of a defect in the AJ's analysis, but because of a new development in the law or because of evidence recently discovered that suggests the initial decision was the product of perjured testimony or fraudulent documentation. The Board may reopen if, during its review of a PFR, it finds a defect in the AJ's analysis not raised by a party but that Board decides to address. Since the Board's authority to reopen is broad, there are many reasons advanced for reopening, but few cases are actually reopened. Many of the reasons advanced in petitions for reopening and reconsideration are the same reasons relied on in petitions for review. The subsequent treatment in this chapter of the bases for PFRs also includes commentary on cases adjudicated by the Board following its receipt of petitions for reopening.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1648"></span>Requests for reopening or reconsideration are filed frequently in some tribunals, yet they are rarely successful in reversing a prior result. As to appellants and agencies, it can generally be said that a request for reconsideration is unlikely to succeed.

Rev. 1262, <span class="Italic">quoted with approval</span> in <span class="Italic">Civil Aeronautics Board v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.</span>, 367 U.S. 316, 321 (1961):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reexamination and reconsideration are among the normal processes of intelligent living. Admittedly no warranty of correctness or fitness attaches to a decision or an action simply because it is a thing of the past. Everyday experience teaches to the contrary: while the choice first made may well remain the course ultimately followed, often enough it is found on further consideration to require revision. On the other hand, constant reexamination and endless vacillation may become ludicrous, self-defeating and even oppressive. Whether for better or worse so far as the merits of the chosen course are concerned, a point may be reached at which the die needs to be cast with some "finality." An opposition may thus develop between the right result and the final one.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The decisions considering reconsideration requests by parties were summarized in <span class="Italic">Long v. USPS</span>, 46 MSPR 93, 94 (1990), denying reconsideration.

MSPB</span>, 126 Fed. Appx. 482, 484-86 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP) (requiring the Board to consider reopening to correct a manifest error in an annuity determination).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Occasionally the Board exercises its right to reopen on the merits of a charge, as in <span class="Italic">St. Clair v. VA</span>, 59 MSPR 634, 635 (1993), when the Board denied an agency PFR from an AJ's decision to mitigate a penalty to a reprimand. In <span class="Italic">St. Clair</span>, the appellant did not file a PFR, but the Board reopened the case to dismiss entirely the charge and the penalty. The Board's review authority extends to counsel fee awards. <span class="Italic">Kling v. DOJ</span>, 2 MSPR 464, 468, 2 MSPB 620 (1980). The Board reopened to modify one decision to square with another that was issued earlier. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Grover v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 59 MSPR 58, 60 (1993) (harmonizing one case, involving interim relief, with another case, involving a compliance issue). In <span class="Italic">Battle v. USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 509 (1994), the Board reopened on its own motion to correct an error by its AJ in the analysis of the appellant's veterans preference status. As a result of the Board's intervention, the appellant was able to pursue a Board appeal that was previously dismissed by the AJ. <span class="Italic">Battle</span> reconfirmed that the Board has authority to reopen and reconsider a case on its own motion. The Board explained that the "process is proper for the present appeal, in which the Board's jurisdiction is implicated." <span class="Italic">Battle</span>, 61 MSPR at 511. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">LaMotta v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 80 MSPR 225, 228 &#x00B6; 7 (1998) ("The Board may reopen an appeal on its own motion to correct its own error, modify its judgment, decree, or order, or when reopening would be in the interests of justice."); <span class="Italic">Rivard v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 30 MSPR 311, 312 n.* (1986) (reopening to determine jurisdiction when the parties were given proper notice and the appellant's PFR was pending before the Board).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One purpose of the reopening procedure, it was suggested, is to allow the Board a means to assure consistency between and among initial decisions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Azarkhish v. OPM</span>, 915 F.2d 675 (Fed. Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Ketchem v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 11 MSPR 9, 10 (1982) (initial decision decided key issues involved in the appeal of an air traffic controller fired for striking; the appeal was reopened so that interested persons could comment on the issues, decided in the appeal, that would affect pending appeals of 10,900 other ATC appellants). The Board may also reopen "when the evidence is of such weight as to warrant a different outcome," and "[a] finding of fraud on the part of a party to an appeal might justify reopening." <span class="Italic">Parkinson v. USPS</span>, 58 MSPR 393, 397 (1993); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Costin v. DHHS</span>, 72 MSPR 525, 534 (1996) ("[A]n important consideration in deciding whether to reopen an appeal is whether the Board has become aware of new evidence that would warrant a different outcome from that reached in the previous Board decision.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board announced that "[a] showing of circumstances casting doubt on the existence of a valid settlement...may form a basis for reopening a closed appeal without respect to the time limits of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.114." <span class="Italic">Panther v. USDA</span>, 52 MSPR 419, 422 (1992). <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Thompson v. NASA</span>, 68 MSPR 135 (1995) (treating as a request to reopen and reconsider an appellant's submission of a PFR challenging compliance with the settlement; declining to reopen the settlement agreement that the appellant claimed was coerced when the appellant waited months after the Board accepted the agreement to raise a coercion allegation; remanding for treatment as an enforcement petition); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Saunders v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 56 MSPR 671, 673-74 (1993) (party desiring to set aside an invalid settlement should file a PFR within the regulatory time limit, starting with discovery of the grounds for invalidating the agreement).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Cited in <span class="Italic">Panther</span> was <span class="Italic">Barker v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 34 MSPR 248, 252 (1987). Although not concerned with the same issue as <span class="Italic">Panther</span>, <span class="Italic">Barker</span> spoke of "special circumstances or strong equities in his favor" concerning the use of the reopening procedure in the place of an untimely PFR. Whatever its decisional rationale, both the statute and the regulations allow the Board to reopen and reconsider an AJ's decision at any time; this authority has been approved by reviewing courts. <span class="Italic">Knuckles v. Bolger</span>, 654 F.2d 25 (8th Cir. 1981). Although the Board may use the reopening procedure to circumvent the failure of a party to file a PFR, it may decline to do so if it would place itself in a position adverse to the appellant, as, for example, in a disability retirement case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. OPM</span>, 36 MSPR 37, 41 (1987). The Board is less inclined to use the reopening procedure when the delay by a party seeking reopening has been unreasonable and when "considerations of finality dictated that [the] case not be reopened." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Turner v. VA</span>, 59 MSPR 37, 39 n.2 (1993).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board used the reopening procedure to excuse the failure of an agency to describe adequately its interim relief efforts (initially resulting in the dismissal of its PFR). <span class="Italic">Stevenson v. DOD</span>, 55 MSPR 625, 629, 633 (1992). In <span class="Italic">Stevenson</span>, the Board majority opined that its use of the reopening procedure involved "balancing the desirability of finality and the public interest in reaching what ultimately appears to be the right result." Chairman Levinson dissented and noted in <span class="Italic">Stevenson</span> that the agency did not carry its burden of explaining its compliance position and that the Board "is neither required to figure out what the agency has done when it does not appear to comply with interim relief, nor is it required to overlook that which the agency does not make clear on its petition for review."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's refusal to reopen an appeal will not often be disturbed by the Federal Circuit. The court said that "it is not beyond question whether petitioner even has standing to contest the Board's declining to <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> reopen the appeal," but assuming that standing exists, a petitioner has a heavy burden to demonstrate that the Board abused its discretion by not reopening an appeal. <span class="Italic">Azarkhish v. OPM</span>, 915 F.2d 675, 679 (Fed. Cir. 1990). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. MSPB</span>, 809 F.3d 1365, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (judicial review may be sought from the Board's denial of an initial request to reopen an appeal based on an intervening change in law). The policy goal behind 5 CFR 1201.117 [currently 5 CFR 1201.118 (2022)] "presumably is aimed at assuring consistency between and among initial decisions." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The procedure is not meant to obtain a right result for an individual whose appeal has not otherwise been timely prosecuted. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nelson v. FDIC</span>, 83 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (assumes, without deciding, that the court may review the Board's decision not to reopen an appeal on its own motion under 5 CFR 1201.118 for an abuse of discretion; a dissent by Judge Newman suggested that if the Board discusses the merits of the case as it denies a motion to reopen, the decision not to reopen should be reviewable as would be a Board final decision).
