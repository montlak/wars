<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 119 MSPR 438, 2013 MSPB 35 (2013) (replacing the opinion at <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MILLER_MARY_A_SF_0752_11_0766_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_810082.pdf">119 MSPR 331</a>, 2013 MSPB 27 (2013)), discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-12-144.html#sec5-143">General Rule</a>," changed the preexisting analysis of the burdens of proof in an adverse action based on refusal to accept a reassignment. All the evidence is now considered. The Board concluded in <span class="Italic">Miller</span> that an agency must prove "that the reassignment was required because the agency had eliminated or had no need for the appellant's continued performance in her former position or because it needed to address the appellant's performance problems in her former position." <span class="Italic">Miller</span> did not exclude other reasons for reassignment. Under the facts of the appeal, the Board determined that "the record evidence simply does not support a finding that the agency directed the appellant's geographic reassignment due to <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> management considerations and that her ensuing removal promoted the efficiency of the service.&#8197;...it failed to provide a 'rational basis' for requiring the appellant to accept a geographic reassignment into the position." Before the 2013 <span class="Italic">Miller</span> decision, the Board applied a shifting burden of proof in reassignment-based adverse actions. <span class="Italic">Cobert v. Miller</span>, 800 F.3d 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (Judge Wallach concurring), reversed the analysis of <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, returning the law to the burden-shifting approach of <span class="Italic">Ketterer,</span> <span class="Italic">post,</span> and <span class="Italic">Frey,</span> <span class="Italic">post</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the Board's <span class="Italic">Miller</span> analysis, and following the Federal Circuit's 2015 reversal of the <span class="Italic">Miller</span> analysis, the evidentiary analysis for a refused reassignment was and now remains the same as that applied to issues involving motivation of reductions in force. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Losure v. ICC</span>, 2 MSPR 195, 201, 2 MSPB 361 (1980). <span class="Italic">Ketterer v. USDA</span>, 2 MSPR 294, 299, 2 MSPB 459 (1980), determined that in the reassignment cases, as part of its initial burden of establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the agency must provide evidence showing a legitimate management reason for the reassignment and showing that the employee had adequate notice of the reassignment and refused it. But if the appellant then presented credible evidence (in <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span>, that the agency's Kansas City Office was a dumping ground--a place the agency sent employees to encourage them to leave through retirement or resignation) to cast doubt on the existence of any legitimate management basis for the reassignment, the agency's burden was not sustained unless there was additional evidence demonstrating that the reassignment and discipline promote service efficiency. The Federal Circuit adopted the <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span> analysis, <span class="Italic">Frey v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 359 F.3d 1355, 1357-58, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reassignments of federal employees are authorized by regulation<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.102 (2000). In that regard, the Board has held that discipline is warranted for refusing to accept a legitimate directed reassignment and that removal is not an unreasonably harsh penalty for such a refusal<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Nalbandian v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, 25 M.S.P.R. 691, 695 (1985). However, where a removal action is based on a refusal to accept a directed geographical reassignment, the agency must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that its reassignment decision "was <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>, and based upon legitimate management considerations in the interest of the service." <span class="Italic">Umshler v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 628, 630 (1990) (citing <span class="Italic">Ketterer v. Dep't of Agric.</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 294, 298 (1980)).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board explained in <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span> that in the case of a removal for cause following a refusal to accept a reassignment, the agency must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that "the removal will promote the efficiency of the service"; that requires a showing that the agency's decision "was a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> determination based on legitimate management considerations in the interest of the service." 2 M.S.P.R. at <span id="Page_2506"></span>298; <span class="Italic">see also Umshler</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. at 630. In <span class="Italic">Umshler</span>, the Board stated that evidence of "a legitimate management reason for the reassignment," combined with evidence that the employee not only received adequate notice of the reassignment but also refused to accept it, is sufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case supporting the validity of the reassignment. 44 M.S.P.R. at 630; <span class="Italic">see also Ketterer</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 299.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Frey</span> was followed by <span class="Italic">Wieser v. Dept. of Army</span>, 280 Fed. Appx. 959, 961-62 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP), emphasizing that the ability of the agency to geographically reassign an employee did not depend on the employee's prior acceptance of a mobility agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to justify removing an employee based on a management directed reassignment, the agency must show that its decision to reassign the employee was based on legitimate management considerations, that the employee was given adequate notice of the reassignment, and that the employee refused to accept the reassignment. <span class="Italic">Frey v. Dep't of Labor</span>, 359 F.3d 1355, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Mr. Wieser plainly refused to accept the reassignment; he argues, however, that the reassignment was unlawful and that he was not given sufficient notice of the reassignment. We hold that neither argument has merit because substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that the agency's reassignment was lawful and that Mr. Wieser was given adequate notice of the reassignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence as to the reason for the reassignment showed that the agency was undergoing a restructuring of its operations and that it needed to realign its field offices to meet short and long term objectives. In particular, the evidence showed that the agency anticipated a shift in the volume of work from the Kansas City office to the office in Ft. Riley. As the government points out, Mr. Wieser has not challenged the agency's showing that it needed additional manpower at the Ft. Riley office; instead, he has focused principally on the contention that the agency should have met that need in some way other than transferring him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Wieser argues that the agency should have hired someone from outside the agency to fill the position in Ft. Riley or should have transferred an employee with less seniority or one of the employees who, unlike him, had signed a "mobility agreement." There is simply no legal requirement, however, that the agency limit its options in that manner. As stated by the administrative judge, the agency's authority to reassign its employees is based on regulations that do not make the agency's power to transfer an employee dependent on the employee's execution of a mobility agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 335.102, 335.103. Nor is there any legal requirement that the agency transfer those with less seniority before considering more senior employees for transfer. Moreover, as the administrative law judge explained, hiring someone from outside the agency to fill the position in Ft. Riley would not have served the purpose of reducing the staffing at the Kansas City office, which was one of the objectives of the transfer. The administrative judge thus found that the agency acted within its legal rights to direct Mr. Wieser's reassignment. In addition, the administrative judge rejected Mr. Wieser's contention that the agency's action was simply a ploy to force him to resign or retire. Because substantial evidence supports the findings on which the administrative judge based her conclusion that the agency's action was lawful, we sustain that conclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Wieser argues that he was not given sufficient notice of his reassignment. His claim, however, is not based on lack of notice of the reassignment, but instead is based on his contention that because the agency did not require him to sign a mobility agreement and did not otherwise advise him at the outset of his employment that he was subject to reassignment, the agency should be barred from reassigning him at all. That is not a claim of lack of notice as that term is used in cases such as <span class="Italic">Frey v. Department of Labor, supra</span>, dealing with management directed reassignments. The argument instead amounts to a contention that the agency is barred from transferring him because of its failure to advise him earlier that he might be transferred and to obtain his consent to such a transfer. As we noted above, however, the agency's right to transfer employees is a function of agency authority pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management; the agency does not obtain its right to transfer from a particular employee's consent, nor is it denied the right to transfer a particular employee because that employee has not previously given such consent or been specifically notified of the possibility of a transfer at some time in the future. There is therefore no force to Mr. Wieser's argument regarding the lack of notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we reject Mr. Wieser's argument that removal was an inappropriate penalty for his refusal to comply with the reassignment. To say that an agency must select a penalty other than removal when an employee unjustifiably refuses a reassignment is in effect to say that the agency cannot insist on compliance with a lawful reassignment order. Because the agency is entitled to insist that the employee accept the reassignment, the agency is not required to leave the employee in place if the employee refuses to move. <span class="Italic">See Frey</span>, 359 F.3d at 1360. We therefore uphold the Board's decision sustaining the removal action in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Ryan v. DHS,</span> AT-0752-11-0440-I-1 (NP 8/23/2012) ("The administrative judge found, however, that the absence of a mobility agreement does not detract from the <span class="Italic">bona fides</span> of the legitimate reasons for the appellant's reassignment. We see no reason to disturb this finding.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It was not enough for the agency to show that there was a rational basis for the reassignment, e.g., "job requirements." The agency must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the reassignment was based on a legitimate management reason. The Board would not probe behind a management decision once it was demonstrated to be <span class="Italic">bona fide.</span> <span class="Italic">Cooper v. Dept. of Army</span>, 10 MSPR 29, 31 (1982). The legitimacy of the reassignment required, however, an examination of its justification. If an agency relied on statistical imbalances in workloads of offices to justify a decision to reassign an employee, the validity of the reassignment became suspect if the agency failed to demonstrate the validity of its statistics. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schulman v. SBA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1993 NP No. 93-3297). But, if the reassignment is justified, despite some internal disagreement among agency managers, the Board does not second-guess the agency's decision, <span class="Italic">McVey v. Dept. of Army,</span> AT-0752-14-0683-I-1 (NP 4/8/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the burden-shifting framework in <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span>, the agency has the initial burden of showing that its decision to reassign the employee was based on legitimate management considerations in the interest of the service. 2 M.S.P.R. at 299. Such a showing, along with evidence that the employee had adequate notice of the decision to transfer and refused to accept the reassignment, is ordinarily sufficient to establish the agency's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Once the agency makes out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the burden shifts to the appellant to produce rebuttal evidence to demonstrate that the reassignment had no solid or substantial basis in personnel practice or principle, although the ultimate burden of persuasion never shifts from the agency. <span class="Italic">See Umshler v. Department of the Interior</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 628, 630 (1990); <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 299-300.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The agency established a prima facie case supporting the validity of the appellant's reassignment.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we find that the agency established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case supporting the validity of the appellant's reassignment. It is undisputed that the appellant had adequate notice of the decision to transfer and refused to accept the reassignment. We further find that the agency met its initial burden of showing that its decision to reassign the appellant was based on legitimate management considerations in the interest of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency abolished the appellant's position as part of an agency-wide redistribution of FRSA positions, which was conducted because the agency determined that the transformation of the ARC had resulted in a misalignment of FRSA positions. The ARC Family Programs Directorate determined that, pursuant to the redistribution, it would abolish a total of 22 existing FRSA positions aligned with smaller units and numbers of soldiers, including the appellant's position, and create new positions that better aligned with the intent of the 2009 order from agency headquarters. We agree with the administrative judge that the agency's plan to relocate FRSAs aligned with small numbers of soldiers to positions aligned with units with larger troop concentrations was a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> management consideration in the interest of promoting the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See Cooke v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. 401, 406 (finding that an agency's nationwide restructuring was a legitimate reason for effectuating an appellant's reassignment), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 73 F.3d 380 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also met its initial burden of demonstrating a legitimate management reason for selecting the appellant's particular position as one to be abolished pursuant to the redistribution. The appellant's position was assigned to the 844th Battalion, which had an authorized strength of only 778 soldiers, and did not satisfy the 1,200 or more soldier criteria in the November 2013 ARC memorandum, or the even higher ratio of soldiers per FRSA in the 2009 order from agency headquarters.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, as he did below, the appellant argues that his position should not have been abolished because, although he was assigned to the 844th Battalion, he actually supported a total of more than 1,200 soldiers across <span id="Page_2507"></span>three battalions. Specifically, he contends that, in addition to the 844th Battalion, he provided support to the 478th Battalion, headquartered in Fort Thomas, Kentucky, and the 391st Battalion, headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina. However, in response to the Board's show cause order, the agency submitted evidence, in the form of an affidavit from a Human Resources Specialist for the 412th Engineering Command, which stated that the appellant was a resource of the 844th Battalion, and supported the 478th and 391st Battalions as "a convenience" to those battalions. The Human Resources Specialist further averred that, because the appellant was a resource of the 844th Battalion, the Commander of that battalion could have withheld the appellant's support from the other battalions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, although the appellant may have provided support to a total of more than 1,200 soldiers across three battalions, his position was actually assigned to a single battalion with fewer than 1,200 soldiers, and accordingly, the abolishment of that position was consistent with both the November 2013 ARC memorandum and the 2009 order from agency headquarters.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having found that the agency proved its <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, we proceed to the issue of whether the appellant produced rebuttal evidence demonstrating that his reassignment had no solid or substantial basis in personnel practice or principle. <span class="Italic">See Frey</span>, 359 F.3d at 1360; <span class="Italic">Umshler</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. at 630. On review, the appellant notes that the Command Executive Officer of the 412th Engineer Command recommended that his reassignment be rescinded. The Command Executive Officer asserted that the appellant could support the 391st Battalion from Knoxville without the relocation and moving expenses associated with a directed reassignment, and argued that the directed reassignment would potentially result in the loss of a valued employee. We agree with the administrative judge that it is not the Board's role to weigh the relative merits of the agency's policy decision to redistribute its FRSA positions such that the positions would be aligned with units with larger troop concentrations. <span class="Italic">See Frey</span>, 359 F.3d at 1358 (finding that, once it is established that a reassignment was properly ordered in an exercise of agency discretion, the Board will not review the management considerations underlying that exercise of discretion); <span class="Italic">Ketterer,</span> 2 M.S.P.R. at 299 n.8 (same). Similarly, we find that it is not the Board's role to review the merits of the agency's policy decision to require that FRSAs be assigned to locations where the units with larger troop concentrations were headquartered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, although the Board will not review the merits of the agency's broader policy decision to redistribute FRSA positions, here, the appellant has alleged that his particular reassignment was the result of discrimination based on race and sex. The appellant's discrimination claims, if proven, relate to the issue of whether he demonstrated that his reassignment had no solid or substantial basis in personnel practice or principle. <span class="Italic">See Umshler,</span> 44 M.S.P.R. at 634 (vacating an initial decision sustaining an appellant's removal for failure to accept a management-directed reassignment, where, among other things, the administrative judge failed to address the appellant's assertions that his reassignment constituted a prohibited personnel practice). Accordingly, because we are remanding the appellant's affirmative defenses of discrimination for further adjudication, we vacate the administrative judge's findings regarding the charge, nexus, and penalty. <span class="Italic">See Viana v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 659, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 8 (2010) (vacating an administrative judge's findings that an agency proved the charge, nexus, and penalty where the appeal was remanded for further adjudication of the appellant's affirmative defense of discrimination).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rabourn v. DOJ</span>, 38 MSPR 103, 107-09 (1988), helped clarify the analytical components of a case challenging dismissal based on refusal to accept a reassignment. The agency experienced some managerial difficulties resulting from the misconduct of one employee at a two-person, remote field office. Although the appellant was not involved in the misconduct, the agency reassigned him to another station on the belief that placing a new team in the field office would improve its operations. The appellant was discharged when he refused to accept the reassignment. The evidence offered by the agency concerning the reasons for deciding that the appellant's reassignment would enhance operations was largely hearsay and speculative. The evidence was discredited by the AJ, who reversed the discharge. On petitions for review by the agency and OPM, the initial decision was sustained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Contrary to the agency's contention, the Board finds that the administrative judge did not require the agency to prove that its reasons were correct. He simply required, consistent with the case law, that the agency demonstrate that its stated reasons were <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>. That the agency articulated legitimate reasons for its action is insufficient to sustain its burden of proof. The Board must review the evidence submitted by the agency to assure that it supports a finding that the stated reasons were genuine and not arbitrary or pretextual.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...OPM's argument that the administrative judge substituted his judgment for that of the agency...rests solely on testimony discredited by the administrative judge....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to OPM's assertion, we conclude that the administrative judge did not substitute his judgment for the agency's. Rather, he required the agency to submit evidence in support of the genuineness of its reasons once the appellant called them into dispute. The evidence cited by the administrative judge and his analysis of it support a conclusion that the stated reasons not only demonstrated that the agency's decision was not "the best possible action under the circumstances,"...but also that it was so lacking in evidentiary support as to cast doubt on its <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>s. Under the circumstances, the administrative judge did not apply an improper test. The fault lay with the agency's proof.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Yet the agency may use a geographical reassignment to resolve office conflicts if the agency supports its action with proof of the underlying necessity, <span class="Italic">Woodward v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 40 MSPR 649, 650-53 (1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By memorandum dated February 4, 1988, Raymond W. Lowrie, Assistant Director, Western Field Operations, informed the appellant that she was being reassigned from her position as Regulatory Program Specialist, GS-0301-12, located in Casper, Wyoming, to the position of Mining Engineer, GS-880-12 in the TAD, Western Field Operations, in Denver, Colorado. Mr. Lowrie stated the reasons for the directed reassignment as: (1) The appellant's opposition to management and unwillingness to compromise, which the agency contended created conflicts in the Casper, Wyoming office; and (2) the need for the appellant's technical skills and abilities in the Western Field Operations located in Denver. Mr. Lowrie further stated that if the appellant refused the directed reassignment she could be involuntarily separated from her position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appealed the removal action to the Board's Denver Regional Office. In the initial decision issued on October 14, 1988, the administrative judge found that: (1) The agency established <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> reasons for directing the appellant's reassignment; (2) the appellant did not establish that the agency's stated reasons for the directed reassignment were pretextual; (3) the appellant failed to establish that the agency action was taken in reprisal for her exercise of any protected rights; (4) the agency was not required to use reduction-in-force procedures to reassign the appellant; (5) the appellant's removal based on the sustained charge promoted the efficiency of the service; and (6) the penalty of removal based on the sustained charge was within the tolerable limits of reasonableness. The administrative judge therefore sustained the removal action, and the appellant filed a petition for review of the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant challenges the administrative judge's findings that: (1) There was a need for mining engineers in Denver as was alleged by the agency; (2) the agency was justified in reassigning her to "alleviate discord between staff and management in the Casper Field Office"; and (3) she failed to establish that the agency's reassignment constituted retaliation against her for the exercise of her protected rights, that it was based on pretextual reasons, and that her removal based on her failure to accept the directed reassignment did not promote the efficiency of the service. However, contrary to the appellant's arguments, the record fully supports the administrative judge's factual findings and conclusions of law on which she based her findings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the agency correctly argues, the numerous cases cited by the appellant in support of her argument that those findings were improper are readily distinguishable from the facts of this case. For example, in <span class="Italic">Beardmore v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 761 F.2d 677, 680 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the court reversed an employee's removal for failure to accept a directed reassignment where it found that the agency did not follow the procedures mandated by its own directive concerning reassigning employees to solve problems such as overstaffing without the use of reduction-in-force procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Curran v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 714 F.2d 913 (9th Cir. 1983), the court reversed an agency's removal of an employee where it found that the Board's findings in support of its conclusion that legitimate reasons for a transfer existed (that employee exchanges between San Francisco and Seattle were needed to strengthen the Seattle office, that the employee's involuntary lateral transfer was necessary to develop his potential, and that the reassignment was not motivated by the agent's conflict with the new special agent in charge) were not supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Roskos v. United States</span>, 549 F.2d 1386, 1389 (Ct. Cl. 1977), the court reversed a decision of the Civil Service Commission that an employee's reassignment was proper and that his retirement was voluntary, where the court found that there was no reason to doubt that the involuntary reassignment would be hazardous to his health and a hardship to his family. The court found that the reassignment was either an improper effort to pressure the employee to retire or was at least an arbitrary and adverse action<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2508"></span>In this case, unlike in <span class="Italic">Beardmore</span>, <span class="Italic">Curran</span>, and <span class="Italic">Roskos</span> respectively, the appellant's reassignment was not shown to be in contradiction of any agency directive, an improper effort to pressure the appellant to resign, or to be based on stated reasons which could not be proven by the evidence. On the contrary, the record evidence supports the agency's stated reasons for the reassignment in this case, i.e., the appellant's opposition to management and unwillingness to compromise, which created conflicts in the Casper, Wyoming office, and the need for the appellant's technical skills and abilities in the Western Field Operations located in Denver. In addition, the appellant has failed to demonstrate that these reasons were pretextual.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Renville v. DHHS</span>, 26 MSPR 566, 568 (1985) (reassignment was justified to utilize employees' work strengths and avoid tension caused by perceived personality conflict).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Any error in considering the appellant for reassignment is part of the appellant's rebuttal to the agency's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case.

DHHS</span>, 40 MSPR 106, 111 (1989). If the reassignment was motivated by reprisal and the employee accepted the reassignment but was then dismissed for attendance problems collateral to the reassignment that the agency should have anticipated, the removal would be reversed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Richard v. DOD</span>, 66 MSPR 146, 157-59 (1995), remanded an appeal for further analysis by the AJ of the appellant's defense that her reassignment (and removal following her refusal to accept the reassignment) was based on EEO reprisal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted by the administrative judge, to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of failure to accept a management-directed reassignment, the agency must come forward with evidence showing: (1) A legitimate management reason for the reassignment; (2) that the employee had adequate notice of the decision to transfer; and (3) that the employee refused to accept the reassignment<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Ketterer v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 2 MSPR 294, 298-99 (1980). The administrative judge found that the agency had established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case in this appeal, and we discern no error in that finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, once the agency makes out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the burden of going forward with rebuttal evidence shifts to the employee, but the burden of persuasion never shifts from the agency<span class="Italic">. See Ketterer</span>, 2 MSPR at 299 (quoting <span class="Italic">Losure v. Interstate Commerce Commission</span>, 2 MSPR 195 (1980)). Where credible evidence, either in the employee's rebuttal presentation or in the agency's own admissions, is sufficient to cast doubt on the <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>s of the decision to reassign the employee, the agency may find it advisable to present additional evidence to meet its burden of persuading the Board by a preponderance of the evidence that the reassignment was based on a legitimate management reason<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. If the employee can demonstrate that the reassignment had no solid or substantial basis in personnel practice or principle, the Board may conclude that it was not a valid discretionary management determination, but was instead either an improper effort to pressure the appellant to resign, or was at least an arbitrary and capricious adverse action<span class="Italic">. See Umshler v. Department of the Interior</span>, 44 MSPR 628, 630 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision does not address the appellant's claim that the underlying performance-based action was pretextual because it was proposed by Jones in reprisal for discrimination complaints she allegedly filed against Jones in 1991 and 1992<span class="Italic">. See Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 1 MSPR 587, 589 (1980) (an initial decision must identify all material issues of fact and law, summarize the evidence, resolve issues of credibility, and include the administrative judge's conclusions of law and his legal reasoning, as well as the authorities on which that reasoning rests). The appellant testified that during her first three years of employment after obtaining her position as a result of the EEOC decision, she worked under a Mr. Lockwood, had no problems, and received an exceptional evaluation. She testified that Jones came to the school in 1990 and, without knowing anything about her other than the fact that she had gotten her job as a result of an EEO complaint, started harassing her. The appellant testified that she filed an EEOC complaint, and that Jones responded by engaging in acts of reprisal against her. The appellant testified that in 1992, she filed another complaint and "got reprisals" that ultimately resulted in Jones' June 11, 1993 notice of proposed removal. This second complaint appears to have been filed in October 1992. In addition, the appellant's union representative testified regarding numerous incidents in which Jones allegedly treated the appellant differently from other teachers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge made no finding regarding whether the appellant's evidence regarding her allegation of retaliation by Jones was credible and sufficient to cast doubt on the <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>s of the reassignment action. Resolving conflicts in the evidence and deciding issues of credibility is normally the province of the administrative judge, and we find that the record may not be sufficiently well-developed to address this issue<span class="Italic">. See Uske v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 MSPR 544, 557 (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The legitimacy of a geographic reassignment is not affected by the importance of the job held by the appellant before the reassignment. <span class="Italic">O'Connor v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 21 MSPR 687, 690 (1984). Placement of an individual in an "overhire" position did not excuse refusal to accept a reassignment. <span class="Italic">Robertson v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 85-2705). An appellant raised the defense that he was singled out for reassignment because of his bachelor status; a married coworker was not selected for the reassignment. The agency demonstrated that it had a legitimate basis for the reassignment by showing that the appellant was a more efficient employee and could more quickly complete the work needed during the reassignment. <span class="Italic">Craighead v. USDA</span>, 6 MSPR 159, 163, 6 MSPB 142 (1981). Reassignment was not improper because the agency first proposed (and then withdrew or reversed) a short suspension before reassigning the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Robb v. R.R. Retirement Bd.</span>, 12 MSPR 467, 470, 11 MSPB 103 (1982) (a reassignment was based on the alleged inability of the appellant to cooperate with his supervisors).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dejoy v. DHHS</span>, 2 MSPR 577, 581-82, 3 MSPB 96 (1980), provided another example of application of the Board's rules on removals for failure to accept reassignment. The agency furnished ample justification for the reassignment from one clerical position to another; the employee offered no <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> challenge to the agency motivation. The removal was sustained. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Camhi v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 13 MSPR 465, 466 (1982) (lack of work at an appellant's duty station was a valid reason for his reassignment). <span class="Italic">Hayden v. Bureau of Indian Affairs</span>, 5 MSPR 92, 94-95, 5 MSPB 162 (1981), declined to set aside a removal based on an employee's refusal to accept a reassignment when "petitioner's conduct in seeking to represent other teachers in reduction in force actions, in filing a large number of equal employment opportunity complaints, and in creating general discontent among students and peers, necessitated his transfer." The evidence demonstrated that the employee was aware that his own teaching performance suffered as a result of his activities. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sexton v. Kennedy</span>, 523 F.2d 1311 (6th Cir. 1975) (sustaining removal of an employee who refused to accept a geographical reassignment triggered by the appellant's failure to get along with his supervisors; the appellant did not prove that the reassignment was motivated by reprisal for his allegations concerning managerial incompetence); <span class="Italic">Scarpa v. Smith</span>, 294 F. Supp. 13, 15 (S.D.N.Y. 1968) (declining to enjoin the geographical reassignment of a meteorologist who also served as a union official: the reassignment was justified by "a series of unpleasant incidents involving him, his superiors and fellow employees...in the New York office, including disputes, loud language and lack of courtesy and mutual respect, creating strong emotional stresses on the part of those involved").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee should have the opportunity to show that an agency routinely uses reassignments for improper purposes. The AJ is obliged to receive this type of evidence in its direct form, e.g., from witnesses who know of agency reassignment habits, and in an indirect form, e.g., from witnesses familiar with agency budget, reorganization, work needs, and decisionmaking. Appellants will need to provide reasonably specific offers of proof if the Board is asked to overturn the decision of an AJ to refuse to accept testimony from witnesses with knowledge of such matters. <span class="Italic">Umshler v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 44 MSPR 628, 632-33 (1990), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, 55 MSPR 593, 597 (1992).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the employee is working in a job as a result of a reassignment but rejects a request to voluntarily assume the position, there is no apparent basis for removing the employee under Chapter 75. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Leija v. VA</span>, 530 Fed. Appx. 945, 953 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP) (a confusing series of events leading the court to remand to the Board for analysis of how the employee could be subject to adverse action for refusing reassignment to a position that the employee appeared to be performing: "Had Ms. Leija refused to perform her job, been absent without leave, or committed some egregious misconduct, then the impact on the efficiency of the VA would be much clearer.") (following remand, <span class="Italic">Leija v. VA</span>, DA-0752-11-0588-M-1 (NP 1/7/2015).
