<h5 class="h5" id="sec10-10"><span class="space">c.</span> Part-Time, Light Duty Status; Intermittent Appointment; Work Schedule Adjustment</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Schuck v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 624 (1986), involved a consolidated group of appellants placed in nonpay, nonduty status 16 times during a three-month period in 1984, for periods of up to four hours each time. The employees claimed that the actions of the agency were furloughs for less than thirty days and that, therefore, they had the right of appeal to the Board under 5 USC 7512(5). They asserted that the denial of procedural rights under 5 USC 7513 constituted harmful error. The agency responded that the employees were in light duty status due to disabling conditions and that under their collective bargaining agreement, they were not guaranteed an eight-hour day or a forty-hour week. The agency contended that the agreement provided that the appellants work when work was available within their restrictions, and that during the time they were off, work was unavailable. On an OPM petition for reconsideration of an earlier, summary Board decision against the agency, the Board acknowledged that actions taken consistent with the terms of an appointment cannot be considered adverse actions, but the Board observed that it had not been demonstrated that the occasional placement of the employees in nonduty, nonpay status was consistent with the terms of their appointments. The Board determined that the National Agreement did not state that employees give up full-time positions as a condition of obtaining light duty assignments. On an appeal analyzing principally jurisdictional issues and the Postal Service labor agreement, <span class="Italic">Schuck</span> was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Horner v. Schuck</span>, 843 F.2d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1988) [discussed in Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-130.html#sec1-129">Seasonal; On-Call</a>."]. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Perry v. USPS</span>, 46 MSPR 456 (1990) (an employee was not furloughed whose limited duty status was terminated and the employee then absented himself from work following the agency's request that he return); <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. USPS</span>, 27 MSPR 115 (1985) (RIF procedures were inapplicable to shift from a regular full-time position to a part-time position when the reassignment occurred in accordance with the settlement of a labor arbitration case). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">James v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 628, 630 (1986) ("[t]he collective bargaining agreement does not provide that employees give up their full-time positions as a condition of obtaining light duty assignments." (citing <span class="Italic">Leazenby v. USPS</span>, 8 MSPR 384, 390 n.4 (1981))). [Refer to Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-130.html#sec1-129">Seasonal; On-Call</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-08-135.html#sec1-134">Jurisdictional Effect of Lapse of Term or Temporary Appointment</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-08-124.html#sec1-123">Temporary and Term Appointments</a>," <span id="Page_3010"></span>and "<a href="0100-2023-08-131.html#sec1-130">Intermittent</a>," concerning Board jurisdiction over appeals by seasonal, term, temporary, and intermittent employees.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Schuck</span> was applied in <span class="Italic">Flowers v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 384, 386 (1988), affirming application of furlough procedures to discontinuation of light duty assignments for lack of work:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the agency furloughed him because it placed him in non-duty status due to the lack of light-duty work, and that he was in non-pay status after his annual leave was exhausted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Schuck v. United States Postal Service</span>, 30 MSPR 624 (1986), the Board affirmed the conclusion that, under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, the agency's placing of employees, who were performing light-duty assignments, due to medical disabilities in temporary non-duty and non-pay status because of lack of work, constituted appealable furloughs. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">James v. United States Postal Service</span>, 30 MSPR 628 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the appellant has presented a non-frivolous allegation that he was furloughed. The agency's Wage and Separation Information form, dated May 19, 1987, states that the appellant worked light-duty assignments until April 29, 1987, due to an on-the-job injury, and that he was currently in non-duty status. The record also establishes that the appellant requested light-duty assignments under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, but was denied such duty due to lack of work. Further, the appellant alleged, and the administrative judge found, that after exhausting his accrued leave, the appellant was in a leave without pay status. Thus, the appellant has presented evidence that, under the Board's interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement in the <span class="Italic">Schuck</span> and <span class="Italic">James</span> decisions[2], he was furloughed because he was placed in a non-duty, non-pay status due to lack of work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In his initial decision, the administrative judge distinguished the present case from <span class="Italic">Schuck</span>, finding that the appellant here was placed in leave status while the appellants in <span class="Italic">Schuck</span> were not. We do not find leave status a distinguishing factor. Both furloughs and suspensions require the placement of an employee in non-duty, non-pay status....&#8197;The Board has found on numerous occasions that the improper placement of employees on enforced leave status is a suspension, and thus, by definition, placement on non-duty, non-pay status....&#8197;Thus, placing an employee on leave status does not preclude a finding that the employee was furloughed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the release from light duty status for lack of work may constitute a furlough, <span class="Italic">Maltzman v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 239, 240-42 (1990), determined that a furlough does not encompass an agency's refusal to place an employee on light duty. The Board declined to say whether the agency's action might have constituted an adverse action, that is, enforced leave:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The pertinent facts in this case are undisputed. On May 11, 1988, for medical reasons, the appellant submitted a request for a light-duty assignment. The agency denied this request, citing a lack of available work. The appellant claimed on appeal, and the administrative judge found, that his consequent absence between May 11 and May 17, 1988, on approved leave, constituted a furlough of less than 30 days, which would be an action appealable to the Board. We find that this argument must fail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant maintains that the holding in the case of <span class="Italic">Horner v.</span> <span class="Italic">Schuck,</span> 843 F.2d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1988), is controlling here. In that case, regular, full-time, postal employees in light-duty assignments were placed in a nonduty status for short periods of time when the agency did not have sufficient light-duty work for them. The Board found that these actions constituted furloughs over which it had jurisdiction. The court upheld the Board's decision, finding that, even if the agency could place employees who held light-duty assignments in a nonpay, nonduty status, the Board had jurisdiction to determine whether those employees were properly "laid off" in accordance with federal regulations and the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1375.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The Postal Service and its employees are bound by the terms and conditions of employment set forth in a collective bargaining agreement that covers them. 39 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1206 and 1209. <span class="Italic">See Horner</span> at 1372.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant was not assigned to a light-duty position. Rather, pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement, he had requested a light-duty assignment for medical reasons for the period in question, but the agency, in its discretion, declined to grant him such an assignment. The appellant maintains that his consequent absence during that period constituted a furlough. We do not agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The pertinent provisions of the collective bargaining agreement are:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Article 13, Section 13.2.A:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Any full-time regular or part-time flexible employee recuperating from a serious illness or injury and temporarily unable to perform the assigned duties may voluntarily submit a written request to the installation head for temporary assignment to a light duty or other assignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Article 13, Section 13.2.C:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Installation heads shall show the greatest consideration for full-time regular or part-time flexible employees requiring light duty or other assignments, giving each request careful attention, and reassign such employees to the extent possible in the employee's office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Article 13, Section 13.3.B:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Light duty assignments may be established from part-time hours, to consist of 8 hours or less in a service day and 40 hours or less in a service week.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Article 13.3.C:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The light duty employee's tour hours, work location and basic work week shall be those of the light duty assignment and the needs of the service, whether or not the same as for the employee's previous duty assignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Schuck,</span> cited by the appellant as controlling here, is different from the instant case in that, in <span class="Italic">Schuck,</span> the agency had placed the employees in a light-duty status before it took the actions at issue. The agency's subsequent placement of the employees in a nonduty, nonpay status therefore was inconsistent with their employment as full-time employees in a light-duty status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, by contrast, the agency had not placed the appellant in a light-duty status. Instead, his request for a light-duty assignment was denied, pursuant to the discretion afforded the installation head in the agreement, due to a lack of work, and he failed to report to his assigned position due to his perceived medical problems. Under conditions such as these, placement of an employee in nonpay status is not "involuntary," and thus cannot be considered a furlough within the statutory definition<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(5); <span class="Italic">cf. Finn v. Veterans Administration,</span> 39 MSPR 658, 661-62 (1989) (a period of leave requested by employee does not constitute a constructive suspension).[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;To the extent that the appellant's argument may be construed as an allegation of a constructive suspension due to alleged enforced leave, such an action would not be appealable to the Board since the period in question is less than 15 days. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7501(2), 7511(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A reduction in hours of work from 60 to 50 per pay period did not constitute a furlough, or a separation or demotion through RIF, in <span class="Italic">Wolf v.

Instead, the change was a nonappealable "staff adjustment." The appellant retained his grade and rate of pay, but his hours were reduced.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the national arbitration award, we must find that the appellant's placement in an NTFT position did not violate either the MOU or the national contract. In other words, the appellant's placement was proper. The administrative judge found, and the parties do not appear to dispute, that NTFT positions by definition do not guarantee 8 hours of work per day or 40 hours of work per week. The appellant acknowledged below that the provisions of the MOU constitute the relevant terms and conditions of employment. Because the absence of any guarantee of full-time work hours is inherent in the nature of NTFT positions and is a condition of employment for the NTFT positions, the appellant was not furloughed when the agency provided him with less than a full-time work schedule. <span class="Italic">See Prior</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. at 567-68 (the agency's placement of the appellant into nonpay status in keeping with the terms of his employment does not constitute a furlough appealable to the Board); <span class="Italic">Tom v. Department of the Interior</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 126, 129-30 (1987) (the appellant's temporary placement in nonpay status for lack of work was not an adverse action requiring adherence to statutory procedures because it was in keeping with the terms of his seasonal employment and therefore did not constitute a suspension or a furlough). We find, therefore, that the appellant was not affected by a furlough and that the administrative judge correctly dismissed this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
