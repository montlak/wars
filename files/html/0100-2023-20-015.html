<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-16"><span class="space">c.</span> Disclosure to Someone Who Cannot Directly Remedy the Problem</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A protected disclosure may be made to another official even if that individual lacks the authority directly to correct the matter disclosed. According to <span class="Italic">Huffman v. OPM</span>, 263 F.3d 1341, 1350-51 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (order remanding case for further consideration, <span class="Italic">Huffman v. OPM</span>, 92 MSPR 429 (2002)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both parties agree that two of the reports involved complaints to McFarland about persons other than McFarland himself. First, the May 22, 1998, memorandum alleged that OIG employees had impermissibly hired certain auditors under the agency's Outstanding Scholars Program, rather than filling the positions through open competition. Second, the June 18, 1998, memorandum alleged that the Deputy Assistant Inspector General for Audits directed three OIG auditors who were "impermissibly" hired under the Outstanding Scholars Program to "falsify" their government employment applications.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge below and the government's brief both suggest that reports of wrongdoing are not protected if they are not made to persons in a position to correct the alleged wrongdoing. The administrative judge apparently concluded that petitioner's supervisor here somehow lacked the authority to correct wrongdoing by the other employees. In holding that complaints to a supervisor about the supervisor's own wrongdoing are not protected under the WPA, this court in <span class="Italic">Willis</span> and <span class="Italic">Horton</span> stated that reports must be made to persons in a position to act to remedy the alleged wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">Willis</span>, 141 F.3d at 1143 (noting that "[Willis] has taken no action to bring an issue to the attention of authorities in a position to correct fraudulent or illegal activities" and that "Willis's disclosures were not made to persons in a position to correct the alleged abuse"); <span class="Italic">Horton</span>, 66 F.3d at 282 ("The purpose of the Whistleblower Protection Act is to encourage disclosure of wrongdoing to persons who may be in a position to act to remedy it, either directly by management authority, or indirectly as in disclosure to the press."). These statements were read too broadly in the Board decision below and in other decisions of the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Langer v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, No. CH-1221-99-0540-W-1, slip op. at 7 (MSPB Oct. 12, 1999), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, No. 00-3388, 2001 WL 694555 (Fed. Cir. June 20, 2001) (nonprecedential opinion).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Willis</span> and <span class="Italic">Horton</span> do not require that the reports must be made to a person with actual authority to correct the wrong. Indeed, <span class="Italic">Horton</span> itself and the legislative history of the WPA recognize that disclosures to the press are protected. <span class="Italic">Horton</span>, 66 F.3d at 282 (noting that disclosures to the press may be protected disclosures); H.R. Rep. No. 100413, at 12-13 (1988) (listing the media as an independent entity, such as the inspector general and Congress, to which disclosures may be made). No requirement of actual authority is found in the language of the statute, and we think it is quite clear that reports do not need to be made to those with authority to correct the alleged wrongdoing in order to be protected by the WPA. Any government employee, in a supervisory position, other than the wrongdoer himself, is in a position to "correct" or "remedy" the abuse by bringing the matter to the attention of a higher authority. To be consistent with the statute and its purposes, complaints to supervisors concerning wrongdoing by other employees or other matters within the scope of the WPA should be encouraged and not discouraged, even if the supervisor himself lacks authority to directly correct the wrongdoing. Such complaints constitute disclosures under the WPA, if, of course, they also meet the other requirements of the statute.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Nasuti v. Dept. of State</span>, 120 MSPR 588, 592 &#x00B6; 6, 2014 MSPB 12 (2014), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even without the enactment of the WPEA, we note that, contrary to the Senate Report cited above, neither the Federal Circuit, nor the Board, had recently interpreted the WPA to preclude protection for a disclosure unless it was made to a person with actual authority to remedy the <span id="Page_3638"></span>wrongdoing. In <span class="Italic">Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 263 F.3d 1341, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the court stated that "<span class="Italic">Willis</span> [<span class="Italic">v.

"No requirement of actual authority is found in the language of the statute, and we think it is quite clear that reports do not need to be made to those with authority to correct the alleged wrongdoing in order to be protected by the WPA." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board has similarly ruled that complaints to supervisors concerning wrongdoing by other employees, or other matters within the scope of the WPA, may constitute "protected disclosures," even if the supervisor lacks authority to directly correct the wrongdoing, provided that the disclosure meets the other requirements of the statute. <span class="Italic">Dilorenzo v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 506, &#x00B6; 8 (2006). Whether the appellant's supervisor lacked authority to correct the alleged wrongdoing, or condoned it, does not preclude the appellant's disclosure from WPA protection. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 9. Accordingly, we conclude that the WPA, even prior to the enactment of section 101 of the WPEA, did not preclude the appellant's disclosure regarding alleged substandard and inadequate body armor from being protected.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">A covered disclosure may be made to a supervisor who has no earlier connection with the matter disclosed, as long as the supervisor is in a position to do something about the matter once it is disclosed, <span class="Italic">Reid v. MSPB</span>, 508 F.3d 674, 678 (Fed. Cir. 2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also erred in holding that alerting an innocent supervisor of an accused wrongdoer to a purported violation does not qualify as a protected disclosure. Alerting a supervisor who is not an alleged wrongdoer is sufficient to constitute "disclosure" under the WPA. While "the WPA does not apply where an employee makes complaints to the employee's supervisor about the supervisor's own conduct," we have stated that "[a]ny government employee, in a supervisory position, other than the wrongdoer himself, is in a position to 'correct' or 'remedy' the abuse by bringing the matter to the attention of a higher authority." <span class="Italic">Huffman v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 263 F.3d 1341, 1348, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2001). As noted above, the government concedes that Reid has alleged no wrongdoing on the part of Tucillo and that he is in a supervisory position. Furthermore, as the supervisor of Hynes-Cherin, one of the alleged wrongdoers, and the second level supervisor of Reid, Tucillo is one of the most logical people to whom Reid could have made her alleged disclosure. The Board therefore erred in concluding that Reid's disclosure could not be protected because it was made to Tucillo.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Reid</span> was echoed by <span class="Italic">Ingram v. Dept. of Army</span>, 114 MSPR 43, 49-50 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-15, 2010 MSPB 86 (2010) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Ingram v. Dept. of Army</span>, 116 MSPR 525, 2011 MSPB 71 (2011)), concluding that assessment of the status of the individuals to whom disclosures are made is without regard to how they are labeled in the underlying complaint filed with OSC but with regard to the role they played in the transactions reviewed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the outset, the administrative judge applied an incorrect legal standard in requiring the appellant to make his disclosure to someone with actual authority to correct the wrong. Complaints to any supervisor who is not an alleged wrongdoer are sufficient to constitute a disclosure under the WPA; the disclosure need not be made to an individual with actual authority to correct the wrong. <span class="Italic">Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 263 F.3d 1341, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Thus, the appellant could make a protected disclosure regarding LTC Thompson's intentions to his first and second level supervisors, given they were not participants in the challenged wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">See Reid v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 508 F.3d 674, 678 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also concluded that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation of a protected disclosure because his purported disclosures were made to the alleged wrongdoers, including LTC Thompson, Collins, and Miller. Under the WPA, when an employee reports or states that there has been misconduct by a wrongdoer to the wrongdoer, the employee is not making a "protected disclosure" of misconduct. <span class="Italic">Huffman</span>, 263 F.3d at 1350.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge is correct that Miller and Collins were listed as "wrongdoers" in the appellant's OSC complaint. But, <span class="Italic">pro se</span> pleadings are to be construed liberally. <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 119, &#x00B6; 19 (2008). The appellant did not claim that Collins and Miller were wrongdoers for purposes of the disclosure of LTC Thompson's intent to proceed with the event. Further, given that the appellant affirmatively alleged that Collins and Miller were helpful in getting the event cancelled, they could not reasonably be deemed wrongdoers regarding the event. The appellant only claimed Miller and Collins were "wrongdoers" in the context of the subsequent personnel actions that the appellant maintains were taken in reprisal (allegedly at LTC Thompson's behest) for his disclosure. Thus, the appellant could make a protected disclosure to his supervisors because they were not wrongdoers for purposes of the subject of the disclosure. <span class="Italic">See generally Reid</span>, 508 F.3d at 678.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant's WPA claim was not defeated because his complaints were directed, before the WPEA, to the wrongdoer, his supervisor, if a second-level supervisor, who was in a position to deal with the disclosure, learned of the disclosure directly from the appellant or even directly from the first-level supervisor, <span class="Italic">Murphy v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 86 MSPR 131, 137 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant disclosed to both his first and second-line supervisors his first-line supervisor's alleged abuse of authority. As noted above, the appellant's attorney also sent the appellant's second-level supervisor a letter that reiterated the allegations that the appellant made in the e-mail that he sent to his first-level supervisor. Where the disclosure is made to a person in a position to remedy the wrongdoing alleged, the fact that the same information was also communicated to an immediate supervisor who was the alleged wrongdoer does not deprive the disclosure of protected status. <span class="Italic">See Ellison v. Merit Systems</span> Protection Board, 7 F.3d 1031, 1035 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">see also Mitchell v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 68 MSPR 504, 509-11 (1995). Thus, when the appellant disclosed to his second-level supervisor the facts that constituted his first-level supervisor's alleged abuse of authority, he made a protected disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant's attorney's letter to the appellant's second-level supervisor was not a protected disclosure because the appellant's first-line supervisor had forwarded the e-mail with the information contained in the letter to the second-line supervisor. To permit a first-line supervisor's publication of the alleged abuse of authority leveled against him to defeat protection under the WPA to an employee who subsequently discloses that wrongdoing to an official other than the wrongdoer himself is inconsistent with the purpose of the WPA. Permitting such would interfere with the protection that the WPA provides to federal employees who disclose government wrongdoing identified in section 2302(b)(8), and would discourage employees who are subject to prohibited personnel practices from seeking redress through more than one means. <span class="Italic">Ellison</span>, 7 F.3d at 1035.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Wright v. DOJ</span>, NY-1221-17-0078-W-1 (NP 2/21/2023) ("appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that he made a protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A)(i) of a violation of the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA), as amended, by raising a whistleblower reprisal claim in his oral and written reply to the proposed demotion and suspension").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Addressing issues of personal risk and of the level of protected disclosures, <span class="Italic">Price v. NASA</span>, 83 MSPR 661, 662-65 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-10 (1999), determined that if an employee went beyond his normal job responsibilities and reported what appeared to be an unlawful practice to a person he reasonably believed would report the problem up the chain of command, the employee engaged in a career risk and made a protected disclosure:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a GS-13 Program Analyst, filed an IRA appeal, alleging that he received a minimally successful evaluation in 1995 and a fully successful evaluation with negative remarks in 1996 in retaliation for his whistleblowing activities in December 1994 (telling his supervisor and a coworker that he believed that an accounting method that was required to be used in his office was dishonest and illegal). He requested a hearing. The administrative judge informed the appellant in a jurisdictional order that disagreement with supervisors over job-related activities, especially disagreement voiced to supervisors and not to authorities in a position to correct the alleged fraudulent or illegal activities, is not a disclosure protected by the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant's disagreement with his supervisor, regarding whether the practice of moving obligations and costs between programs was dishonest or illegal, did not constitute whistleblowing. She found that criticism directed to the person who is allegedly violating the law or to co-workers who are without authority to act is not considered whistleblowing. Additionally, she found that the appellant had not raised before the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) the issue of the agency's alleged perception that he engaged <span id="Page_3639"></span>in whistleblowing and caused the IG audit, and thus the Board lacked jurisdiction over this allegation. She found that the appellant had failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction, and dismissed the appeal without holding a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An employee does not make a protected disclosure when his alleged disclosure is merely carrying out his job responsibilities. <span class="Italic">Willis v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Agriculture,</span> 141 F.3d 1139, 1143 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Additionally, an employee does not make a protected disclosure when his alleged protected disclosure is made to persons without authority to remedy the alleged wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Criticism of normal job-related activities directed at the wrongdoers themselves normally is not viewable as whistleblowing when the wrongdoer lacks authority to remedy the alleged violation. <span class="Italic">Horton v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Navy,</span> 66 F.3d 279, 282 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition, the appellant alleges that his disagreement with his supervisor is factually different from the underlying situations in <span class="Italic">Willis and Horton,</span> and that these cases do not preclude a finding that he made a protected disclosure under the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's disclosure was not to a person without authority to remedy the alleged wrongdoing. It is undisputed that the practice that the appellant alleged was dishonest and illegal was embedded in the agency's accounting practices, and there is no evidence that the appellant's supervisor had responsibility for those accounting practices. It was, therefore, appropriate for the appellant to first make his disclosure to his supervisor. She was in a position to forward his concerns to higher authorities who were in a position to act to remedy the alleged wrongdoing. By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Willis</span> and <span class="Italic">Horton</span>, the employees made their disclosures directly to the supervisors about whose behavior they complained<span class="Italic">. Willis,</span> 141 F.3d at 1142; <span class="Italic">Horton,</span> 66 F.3d at 281.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, here, the appellant could have performed his job duties with impunity without disclosing his belief that the accounting practices were illegal. The appellant, however, balked at using the accounting practices, and when ordered to do so, he disclosed his belief, placing his personal job security at risk. Thus, his disclosure, although closely related to his duties, was not merely carrying out his job responsibilities. <span class="Italic">See Marano v. Department of Justice,</span> 2 F.3d 1137, 1142 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (the WPA also applies to the situation where a government employee discloses information that is closely related to the employee's day-to-day responsibilities). By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Willis,</span> the court found that the employee did not make disclosures protected under the WPA when he made a finding that seven farms had failed to comply with conservation plans approved pursuant to a farm subsidy program, because to make such findings was part of the employee's required job responsibilities and did not risk his personal job security. <span class="Italic">Willis</span>, 141 F.3d at 1143-44. Thus, we find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation, i.e., an allegation of fact which, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, that he made a disclosure protected under the WPA. <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 60 MSPR 325, 329 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to making a nonfrivolous allegation that he made protected disclosures, the appellant established that: in giving the appellant a minimally successful evaluation in 1995 and a fully successful evaluation with negative remarks in 1996, the agency took a personnel action as defined by 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(viii); that this was a result of the appellant's delay in implementing the accounting procedures that he considered illegal; and, the appellant raised the issue of his disclosure before OSC, and, with regard to that issue, proceedings before OSC are exhausted. Thus, we find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal, entitling him to a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">Dumas v. Merit Systems Protection</span> <span class="Italic">Board,</span> 789 F.2d 892, 894 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A disclosure to coworkers lacked protection in <span class="Italic">Nasuti v. Dept. of State</span>, 112 MSPR 587, 596-97 &#x00B6; 21, 2009 MSPB 218 (2009) (vacated and remanded, <span class="Italic">Nasuti v. MSPB</span>, 376 Fed. Appx. 29 (Fed.

Dept. of State,</span> DC-1221-09-0356-M-1 (NP 12/16/2010), still dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction) when the appellant did not assert in his OSC complaint that he considered the his fellow trainees to be anything other than witnesses to his complaint to the alleged wrongdoer, the instructor of the class:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also contended that, at the same time he made his disclosure to Burk, he had also made a protected disclosure to the other trainees in the class about the dangerous noise levels. The record does not show, however, that the appellant ever met the exhaustion requirement regarding any disclosure he now alleges to have made to his fellow trainees. In his OSC complaint, the appellant simply stated that he asked Burk in the presence of his classmates if the "dangerous noise" would be repeated in the next phase of the training, and, if so, he wanted to "wear his own hearing protection." The appellant argued on appeal that some of the other trainees were persons in a position to correct the alleged wrongdoing. [<span class="Italic">S</span>] <span class="Italic">ee Huffman,</span> 263 F.3d at 1351 ("Any government employee, in a supervisory position, other than the wrongdoer himself, is in a position to 'correct' or 'remedy' the abuse by bringing the matter to the attention of a higher authority."). There is nothing in the record, however, to suggest that the appellant asserted in his OSC complaint that he considered the other trainees to be anything other than witnesses to his complaint to Burk or that he identified the trainees to OSC as supervisors or agency officials to whom he was making a protected disclosure. The Board may not consider the appellant's recharacterization of the charges in his OSC complaint. <span class="Italic">See Ward,</span> 981 F.2d at 526; <span class="Italic">Redschlag,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 589, &#x00B6; 94; <span class="Italic">Roach,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 464, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without addressing IRA coverage of a report of wrongdoing to an alleged wrongdoer, and without examining who, having heard the report from the appellant, was in a position to do anything about it, the Federal Circuit determined that protected activity occurred and reprisal resulted in <span class="Italic">Greenspan v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/20061761464f3d129711759">464 F.3d 1297</a>, 1305-06 (Fed. Cir. 2006), when a VA physician was reprimanded and received a reduced proficiency rating after he aired specific concerns about mismanagement at what amounted to a hospital staff meeting with a regional executive and at least some of those concerns were directed to alleged mismanagement by that executive:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The purpose of the WPA is to shield employees who are willing to speak out and criticize government management, to "freely encourage employees to disclose that which is wrong with our government." <span class="Italic">Marano v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 2 F.3d 1137, 1142 (Fed. Cir. 1993). The WPA by its terms includes and protects "any" disclosure that an employee "reasonably believes" evidences misconduct or mismanagement, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A). There was no evidence or allegation that Dr. Greenspan's statements were not "reasonably believed," and the record shows that several other physicians had similar concerns. Although wrongful or disruptive conduct is not shielded by the presence of a protected disclosure, <span class="Italic">see Watson v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 64 F.3d 1524, 1528 (Fed. Cir. 1995), and <span class="Italic">Marano,</span> 2 F.3d at 1142 n.5, when the disclosure is protected the burden is on the agency to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have disciplined the employee for reasons unrelated to the protected disclosure. In this case, the charges are anchored in the protected disclosures themselves. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Briley v. National Archives and Records Admin.</span>, 236 F.3d 1373, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (the agency must establish that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the protected disclosure).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When a disclosure is of protected subject matter, it is more likely than not to be critical of management, perhaps highly critical. The WPA protects those employees who are willing to speak out on subjects that could incur retaliation if unshielded. We have not been shown substantial evidence in support of the agency's burden to establish by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken these disciplinary actions absent the protected disclosures. The Board's contrary finding cannot be sustained. We reverse the Board's decision, and remand for further proceedings including determination of the remedy appropriate to the improper disciplinary actions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Greenspan</span> was distinguished in <span class="Italic">Kalil v. USDA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/20071300479f3d82111300">479 F.3d 821</a>, 825 (Fed. Cir. 2007), opining that a disclosure of an arguably improper agency position taken in litigation, made by an agency employee to a court handling litigation involving that litigation position but not related to that employee or that employee's duties, was not protected from the agency's charge that the employee improperly involved himself in the litigation process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lastly, at oral argument, counsel for Mr. Kalil argued that this court's <span class="Italic">Greenspan</span> decision means that once a disclosure qualifies as protected, the character or nature of that disclosure can never supply support for any disciplinary action. 464 F.3d at 1305 ("[w]hen the disclosure is protected the burden is on the agency to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have disciplined the employee for reasons unrelated to the protected disclosure."). <span class="Italic">Greenspan</span> does not stand for that expansive proposition. Indeed in this case, the administrative judge found, and this court agrees, that Mr. Kalil's <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contact with a court regarding an ongoing litigation was "an outrageous offense, especially for an attorney." Thus, the character of this disclosure itself supplies clear and convincing evidence that the Agency met its burden of proof.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Pre-<span class="Italic">Huffman</span> (and pre-WPEA) decisions determined that a disclosure was not protected unless it was made to an individual with the authority or ability to correct the problem disclosed. <span class="Italic">Luecht v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 87 MSPR 297, 303 &#x00B6; 11 (2000), emphasized the need to report wrongdoing to someone with the authority to remedy the problem:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant lists as an example of his whistleblowing a False Claims Act <span class="Italic">qui tam</span> questionnaire form that he completed and submitted to several attorneys. The form contains allegations that Navy personnel, including Commander J. H. Groden, Lieutenant J. H. Hagerty, and a Dr. Westbrook, entered into a fraudulent "Resource Sharing" agreement. This <span class="Italic">qui tam</span> form may contain an allegation of wrongdoing, but the appellant has not alleged that he disclosed it to anyone with any authority to act on it. Sending it to "several attorneys," presumably the individuals named at the top of the document, is not a disclosure under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) <span id="Page_3640"></span>because they had no authority to investigate or correct the wrongdoing and there is no evidence that they or anyone else filed a <span class="Italic">qui tam</span> action in court. <span class="Italic">See Price v.
