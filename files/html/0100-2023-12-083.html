<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 CFR 1201.111 (2022), if interim relief is ordered and the agency elects to place the employee on pay status but not return the employee to the job, the agency must make a determination that returning the appellant would be unduly disruptive:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Interim relief</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Under 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2), if the appellant is the prevailing party, the initial decision will provide appropriate interim relief to the appellant effective upon the date of the initial decision and remaining in effect until the date of the final order of the Board on any petition for review, unless the judge determines that the granting of interim relief is not appropriate. The agency may decline to return the appellant to his or her place of employment if it determines that the return or presence of the appellant will be unduly disruptive to the work environment. However, pay and benefits must be provided.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;An initial decision that orders interim relief shall include a section which will provide the appellant specific notice that the relief ordered in the decision must be provided by the agency effective as of the date of the decision if a party files a petition for review. If the relief ordered in the initial decision requires the agency to effect an appointment, the notice required by this section will so state, will specify the title and grade of the appointment, and will specifically advise the appellant of his right to receive pay and benefits while any petition for review is pending, even if the agency determines that the appellant's return to or presence in the workplace would be unduly disruptive.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When the agency declines to return the employee to work as a component of interim relief, under 5 CFR 1201.116 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Certification of compliance</span>. If the appellant was the prevailing party in the initial decision and the decision granted the appellant interim relief, any petition or cross petition for review filed by the agency must be accompanied by a certification that the agency has complied with the interim relief order either by providing the required interim relief or by satisfying the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A)(ii) and (B).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under regulations predating the 1999 revisions, the interim relief process was more complex. Under 5 CFR 1201.115 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1201.115 <span class="Italic">Contents of petition for review</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)(1)&#x2003;If the appellant was the prevailing party in the initial decision, and the decision granted the appellant interim relief, any petition for review or cross petition for review filed by the agency must be accompanied by evidence that the agency has provided the interim relief required, except when the agency has made a determination as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The agency may comply by submitting an SF 50 or SF 52, a letter from an agency official directing the appellant to return to work and informing the appellant of his or her reinstatement as of the date of the initial decision, or an affidavit or declaration specifying the manner of the agency's compliance. The interim relief must be effected retroactively to the date of the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Under 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2), if the initial decision provides interim relief which requires that the appellant be returned to his or her place of employment pending the outcome of any petition for review and the agency determines that the return or presence of the appellant will be unduly disruptive to the work environment, the agency must notify both the appellant and the judge in writing. The agency must also provide evidence of such notification to the Board at the time of filing a petition or cross petition for review. The evidence must show that the agency has provided that the appellant will receive appropriate pay, compensation, and all other benefits as terms and conditions of employment from the date of the initial decision until a final decision is issued.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">With the caveat that the interim relief structure was considerably eased for agencies by the Board in 1999, but recognizing that the agency must still make a statutory undue disruption determination and at least certify what it is doing to the Board when it files a PFR, we note here the many decisions, most involving appeals decided before the 1999 regulatory revisions, addressing implicit undue disruption notifications.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency placed an employee back to work in his original position as interim relief, but materially changed the duties, the agency was deemed to have acted properly and made an implicit undue disruption determination if it provided to the Board a "strong overriding interest" or "compelling reason" for assigning duties other than those assigned prior to the appellant's termination. Under <span class="Italic">Haebe v. DOJ</span>, 81 MSPR 167, 175-76 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15 (1999) (<span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Haebe v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well-established that when the Board reverses an unwarranted personnel action the appropriate final relief is for the appellant to be returned as nearly as possible to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante. See Sink v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 65 MSPR 628, 632 (1994). In appropriate circumstances, however, the Board has held that the right to be returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> is not unconditional and does not require perfect consistency between all aspects of the appellant's pre- and post-removal positions. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 633 n.4. While the law generally requires that an employee be reinstated to the position from which he or she was removed, the Board has held that an exception exists where the agency establishes that it had a "strong overriding interest" or "compelling" reason for placing the employee in a different position. <span class="Italic">See Spates v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 70 MSPR 438, 442 (1996); <span class="Italic">Briggs v. National Council on Disability</span>, 68 MSPR 296, 301 (1995); <span class="Italic">Coffey v.

Department of the Navy</span>, 32 MSPR 332, 337 (1987). We find that this standard for complying with a final Board order requiring reinstatement should apply in interim relief cases as well. Thus, an agency should be found in compliance if it can show that it had a strong overriding interest or compelling reason, for assigning duties other than those assigned prior to an appellant's termination. If an agency can make such a showing, we will find that it has made an implicit undue disruption determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we find that the agency has satisfied its burden of making an undue disruption determination by putting forward a strong overriding interest and compelling reason for assigning alternative duties to the appellant. Interpreting the agency's response to the show-cause order and the appellant's reply together, we find that the agency is not allowing the appellant to perform certain duties he previously performed because it does not want him to have to testify in a criminal proceeding, given that it charged him with an offense involving dishonesty.[2] Although this evidence was submitted after the agency filed its petition for review, we find that there was good cause for the lateness because, as in <span class="Italic">Pursycki v. General Services Administration</span>, 81 MSPR 188, 198-99 (1999), the agency did not have clear notice from the initial decision of its interim relief obligations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note in this regard that in <span class="Italic">United States v. Henthorn</span>, 931 F.2d 29, 30-31 (9th Cir. 1991), the court held that the district court erred in denying a criminal defendant's discovery request for impeachment material contained in the testifying officers' personnel files.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cobb v. Dept. of Army</span>, AT-0752-21-0258-I-1, n.2 (NP 7/7/2022), determined that interim relief requirements were met through a detail of the appellant, a police officer, to the position of emergency management specialist that did not require an Individual Reliability Program certification:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has also filed a motion to dismiss the agency's petition for review for failure to provide interim relief. Therein, he argues that, although the administrative judge ordered the agency to appoint him to his prior position of police officer, the agency issued a memorandum stating that he remained decertified from the Individual Reliability Program (IRP) and that he was detailed to the position of emergency management specialist. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has stated that, in providing interim relief, an agency may reassign an employee to a new position if it determines that returning the employee to his original position would unduly disrupt the work environment and pays the employee all the pay and benefits of the original position. <span class="Italic">Nadolski v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 105 F.3d 642, 644-45 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Here, although the agency did not explicitly state that it was making an undue disruption determination, the Board will infer such a determination if the agency can show that it had a strong overriding interest or compelling reason for assigning duties other than those <span id="Page_1673"></span>assigned prior to the appellant's separation. <span class="Italic">See Lednar v. Social Security Administration</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 364, &#x00B6; 9 (1999); <span class="Italic">see also Haebe v.

Here, the agency's reason for reassigning the appellant is his subsequent decertification from the IRP--a condition of employment required for police officers. Although the appellant takes issue with this IRP decertification, the Board lacks the authority to review whether the agency's decision to reassign the appellant on that basis was made in good faith, <span class="Italic">King v. Jerome</span>, 42 F.3d 1371, 1374-75 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Rather, the Board's authority is restricted to deciding whether an undue disruption determination was made when required, and whether the appellant is receiving the appropriate pay and benefits. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The record establishes that the agency made an implicit undue disruption determination, and the appellant has not alleged that he is not receiving all the pay and benefits of his original position. Accordingly, we find that the agency complied with the administrative judge's interim relief order, and we deny his motion to dismiss the agency's petition for review.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lednar v. SSA</span>, 82 MSPR 364, 369 &#x00B6; 10 (1999), provides an example of an implicit undue disruption determination. The agency placed appellant on interim relief, paid him, assigned him to administrative leave, but did not issue a letter to him or the Board making an explicit interim relief determination. The appellant was dismissed for rude behavior, misconduct aggravated by past discipline. The Board declined to dismiss the agency's PFR in <span class="Italic">Lednar,</span> instead finding that the undue disruption determination was implicit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We further find that the agency has satisfied its burden of making an undue disruption determination by putting forward a strong overriding interest and compelling reason for placing the appellant on administrative leave. Given the references in the record to the appellant's established pattern of exhibiting rude and discourteous behavior towards the public and management, and, in light of the AJ's finding that the appellant has a mental impairment that affects how he interacts with others, the agency's May 19, 1998 letter to the appellant's representative indicating its willingness to help the appellant apply for disability retirement provides sufficient explanation for its placing him on administrative leave. The letter shows not only the agency's willingness to support, and provide assistance for, the appellant's application for disability retirement but reflects its view that he should not be in the workplace.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Singletary v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 94 MSPR 553, 556-58 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-8 (2003), provides an example of an implicit undue disruption determination made after the agency certified that it returned the appellant to the position designated by the AJ's interim relief order:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an AJ has ordered interim relief under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A), an agency must submit evidence with its PFR that it has either complied with the interim relief order or that it has made a determination that the appellant's return to, or presence in, the workplace would be unduly disruptive. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(b); <span class="Italic">DeLaughter v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 3 F.3d 1522, 1524 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Along with its PFR, the agency provided a certification, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(b)(1), that it has complied with the interim relief order by affording the appellant the relief ordered in the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's motion to dismiss the agency's PFR asserts that the agency has not fully complied with the interim relief order because, although she has returned to work and is being paid, she has not been restored to the full range of the administrative and technical duties of her Management Assistant position since her return to duty, and the agency has not made and communicated to her an undue disruption determination. The agency's reply to the appellant's motion asserts that it has provided her with the interim relief to which she is entitled pursuant to the initial decision. The agency has submitted with its reply an SF-50 documenting that the appellant received an interim appointment to her former position effective as of the date of the initial decision. The agency has also submitted a declaration by Patricia Reynard, the deciding official and the appellant's second-level supervisor, acknowledging that the appellant has not been assigned to perform some of her former duties related to timekeeping, procurement, and drafting duty orders because of a loss of trust in the appellant to perform those duties. The agency also asserts that the initial decision allows the agency, at its option, to reassign the appellant to a different position at the same grade and pay. The agency relies on the Board's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Department of Justice,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 167 &#x00B6; 13 (1999), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds,</span> 288 F.3d 1288 (Fed. Cir. 2002), for its assertion that the appellant is entitled to no more in interim relief than she would be entitled to as final relief and, thus, it has provided her with the interim relief to which she is entitled. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the Board reverses an unwarranted personnel action, the appropriate final relief would generally be to return an appellant as nearly as possible to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">See Haebe</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 167 &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">Sink v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 628, 632 (1994). However, the Board has permitted an agency to place conditions upon an appellant's return to duty, to alter an appellant's duties or work schedule, or to place an appellant in a different position, where the agency can show a "strong overriding interest" or "compelling" reason for not returning an appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">See Haebe,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 167 &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">Sink,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. at 632-33 &#x0026; n.4. The Board has held that this standard for complying with a final order of reinstatement applies to an agency's compliance with an interim relief order as well<span class="Italic">. See Lednar v. Social Security</span> <span class="Italic">Administration,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 364 &#x00B6; 9 (1999); <span class="Italic">Purzycki v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that the appellant has performed tasks during the interim relief period that she has always performed at the close of the fiscal year. Further, the agency contends that it has a strong overriding interest or compelling reason for altering the appellant's fiduciary duties due to: (1) the nature of the appellant's serious misconduct and its resulting loss of trust in her; and (2) a major reorganization of several maintenance organizations (divisions) at the base, subsequent to the appellant's removal, that resulted in the realignment of the duties of several positions, including the appellant's position. The agency asserts that, based on these strong overriding interests or compelling reasons, it has shown that it made an implicit undue disruption determination and, thus, it was permitted to alter the appellant's duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the agency's acknowledgement that it restored the appellant to her "old position description," and has not yet assigned the appellant to another position or altered her duties as a result if its reorganization, we find that its reorganization has not caused, and thus does not provide a strong overriding interest or compelling reason for, its failure to fully restore her position duties. However, we agree with the agency that the nature of the appellant's serious misconduct, and the agency's justified loss of trust in her, provided the agency with a strong overriding interest or compelling reason for altering her duties<span class="Italic">. See Lednar,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 364 &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Haebe</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 167 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15.

Although the agency's evidence of its undue disruption determination is untimely, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(b)(1), we find that there is good cause for the agency's delayed evidentiary submission due to the confusing language in the initial decision's penalty determination regarding the relief to which the appellant is entitled. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Purzycki,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 188 &#x00B6; 13; <span class="Italic">Haebe</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 167 &#x00B6; 15. Thus, we find that the agency has shown that it has complied with the interim relief order.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Purzycki v. GSA</span>, 81 MSPR 188, 195 &#x00B6; 14 (1999) (implicit undue disruption determination through a manager's sworn statement: the agency "has shown that it had a strong overriding interest or compelling reason for assigning to the appellant duties other than those assigned him prior to his separation, i.e., the reassignment of another employee to the appellant's position").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before 1999, the Board insisted on greater formality by an agency when the employee was placed back in duty status pending an agency PFR but the agency changed the employee's duties. It was recognized that an agency "may detail, assign and even transfer employees to positions with altered or restricted duties in different commuting areas as interim relief, if such agencies have made a determination that it would be unduly disruptive to effect the relief ordered by the administrative judge." <span class="Italic">Luciano v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 74 MSPR 441, 448-49 (1997); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Picariello v. USPS</span>, 80 MSPR 126, 129 &#x00B6; 4 (1998) (Board lacked authority to consider the allegation that a reassignment as part of interim relief was punitive). But under regulations in effect through 1999, even a partial but significant modification of the appellant's position upon interim reinstatement required an undue disruption notice, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DOJ</span>, 67 MSPR 494, 497-99 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant contends that, although he has been appointed to his former position "on paper," the agency has not permitted him to perform the full range of duties of that position, nor has it determined that permitting him to perform all of the duties of the position would be unduly disruptive to the work environment. He alleges that the agency "replace[d]" him after his demotion, and that since his reinstatement to the position of Maintenance Mechanic General Foreman, his replacement is performing duties that he used to perform. He alleges that he now assists in research and the preparation of reports, which he did not do previously, and that he no longer directly supervises electricians, carpenters, and others engaged in ongoing work projects, as he used to do.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response, the agency asserts that the General Foreman position "is critical to the secure operation" of its facility (a correctional institution), and that it could not leave the position vacant while this appeal was pending. It states that it filled the vacancy left by the appellant's demotion before the initial decision was issued, and that after the administrative judge set aside the appellant's demotion, it decided to "divid[e]" the General Foreman duties "into operations and administration." It initially assigned the administrative duties to the appellant so that the other General Foreman could "become familiar with the institution"; the appellant and the other General Foreman would then perform the <span id="Page_1674"></span>operational and administrative duties "on a rotating basis." The agency also asserts that, although the appellant previously attended work programming committee meetings and sat on promotion boards, no such meetings have been held, and no such boards have convened, since his reinstatement. The agency concedes that it did not make an undue disruption determination, but argues that such a determination was not required because the appellant "has been returned to his former duties on a rotating basis," and is "expected to perform all the duties" of a General Foreman. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an administrative judge's interim relief order requires that the appellant "shall return or be present at the place of employment," an agency may "prevent" such return or presence only upon determining that the employee's return or presence would be unduly disruptive to the work environment, and communicating this determination to the employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A)(ii); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115(b)(2). "'Return,' in this context, means return to the employee's former position and duties...." <span class="Italic">Heath v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 60 MSPR 183, 185 (1993) (citation omitted).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Before his demotion, the appellant performed the full range of General Foreman duties, however categorized, by himself. Under the principles set forth above, and regardless of the management considerations that led the agency to decide to divide the General Foreman position into "operations" and "administration," the agency was required to do one of the following: Restore the appellant to his former General Foreman position, with the same duties that he previously performed; or make an undue disruption determination and timely communicate that determination to the appellant. <span class="Italic">Cf. Shay v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 67 MSPR 366 (1995) (the agency was required to make an undue disruption determination and expressly notify the appellant and the Board of this determination, even though its decision to place the appellant in a position other than her former position pursuant to an interim relief order was based on the fact that her former position no longer existed). The agency did not restore the appellant to his former position <span class="Italic">and</span> duties, nor did it make an undue disruption determination and communicate such determination to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Manning v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 62 MSPR 456, 458-59 (1994) (although an undue disruption determination need not take a particular form, the agency must at least inform the appellant that his or her return or presence in the workplace would excessively or in an unwarranted fashion cause disorder or turmoil to the normal course of the agency's operation).</p>

USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 633, 639 (1996) (only action not associated with an undue disruption determination was returning the employee to his former position and duties at his former duty station; the fact that the agency told the appellant he was to take a fitness examination, standing alone, did not constitute an undue disruption determination).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant...contends...that the agency has failed to provide him interim relief because it is treating him differently from his co-workers. He asserts that the agency has failed to reissue him "a weapon and related tactical police gear" and has ordered him to return the identification card that the U.S. Marshals Service issued to him, deputizing him as a law enforcement officer and authorizing him to carry weapons. He contends that "[w]ithout such a deputization card, weapon, and related equipment, [he] is unable to perform his duties successfully" as a law enforcement employee of the agency's Office of Inspector General (OIG). The appellant also asserts that the agency has prohibited him from using its office fax machine, has ordered him not to use the only office computer with an attached laser printer, and has prohibited him from contacting the agency's headquarters in relation to administrative matters. He claims that other employees are not so restricted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has responded in opposition to the appellant's motion to dismiss, contending that it has afforded the appellant interim relief because it returned him to the same location, position, grade, and pay that he had prior to his removal. The agency does not deny that it has not issued the appellant a firearm for the performance of his duties. Instead, it merely contends that its decision not to issue him a firearm is based on agency rules and regulations which provide authority to carry firearms only "to Special Agents having current status as Deputy United States Marshals." The agency maintains that the appellant "is not currently deputized as a Deputy U.S. Marshall [sic]," and, therefore, "cannot currently legally carry a firearm in connection with his RRB-OIG duties." The agency does nothing, however, to rebut the appellant's assertion that it required him to relinquish his deputy status upon returning to duty through interim relief. As to the appellant's remaining allegations of noncompliance with the interim relief order, the agency argues that the appellant has not shown that any such restrictions prevented him from fully performing his duties. It has provided no evidence to show that it has not subjected the appellant to such restrictions and has not treated him differently than other employees in the same GS-12 Criminal Investigator position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the evidence submitted on review, we find that the agency did not return the appellant to his former position and duties and that it was therefore required to make an undue disruption determination<span class="Italic">. See Barron</span>, 68 MSPR at 450; <span class="Italic">Hariss</span>, 68 MSPR at 431; <span class="Italic">Heath</span>, 60 MSPR at 185-86. The agency has made no such determination....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When the interim relief that was directed was restoration of the appellant to his prior position, the Board's policy appeared to be that placement in a similar position may not necessarily qualify as appropriate interim relief without an undue disruption determination, <span class="Italic">Davis v. DOJ</span>, 67 MSPR 316, 322 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of its argument that it was not required to create a GS-12 Supervisory Correctional Officer position for interim relief purposes, the agency cites 5 CFR &#x00A7; 772.102(d), which provides that an agency should place an employee entitled to interim relief "in the same or similar position previously occupied, unless the agency determines that the return or presence of the individual would be unduly disruptive to the work environment." This provision is at odds with our interpretation of the interim relief statute. As mentioned above, the "only action not associated with a determination of undue disruption is returning the employee to his or her former position and duties at his or her former duty station." <span class="Italic">Heath</span>, 60 MSPR at 185. We need not decide whether an agency that met the less stringent requirements of the regulation--by placing a prevailing employee in a position similar to the one he or she previously held as interim relief, without making an undue disruption determination--would suffer dismissal of its petition for review, although we note that we are not required to defer to OPM's regulations. <span class="Italic">See Smith</span>, 59 MSPR at 350 n.7. In this case, there is no evidence that the Employee Development Specialist position in which it placed the appellant is "similar" to the Supervisory Correctional Officer position. In other words, the agency has not shown that it has satisfied the requirements of the regulation it cites.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Yerger v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 102, 105-06 (1997), determined that an undue disruption determination was required if the agency placed the appellant in a different position because it filled the appellant's position during the pendency of adverse action litigation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that the agency filled the appellant's former position at some point while his appeal was pending before the Board does not constitute an undue disruption determination. <span class="Italic">Cf. Johnson v. Department of Justice,</span> 67 MSPR 494, 498-99 (1995) (in order to provide interim relief, the agency divided the duties of the appellant's former position, which the agency had filled, between the appellant and the employee who had replaced him; the Board found that the agency did not restore the appellant to his former position and duties, nor did it make an undue disruption determination); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of Justice,</span> 67 MSPR 316, 321-22 (1995) (the Board determined that whether the appellant's position had been filled by another employee was irrelevant and that the agency's petition for review should be dismissed because it failed to make an undue disruption determination). The agency did not restore the appellant to his former position and duties, nor did it make an undue disruption determination and communicate such determination to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Manning v. Department of Defense</span>, 62 MSPR 456, 458-59 (1994) (although an undue disruption determination need not take a particular form, the agency must at least inform the appellant that his or her return or presence in the workplace would excessively or in an unwarranted fashion cause disorder or turmoil to the normal course of the agency's operation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The necessity for an undue disruption determination before a substantial change in the duties held by the appellant in his permanent appointment was also explored in <span class="Italic">Barron v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 68 MSPR 446, 449-51 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant acknowledges the SF-50 showing his promotion to his former position of Supervisory ATCS, but he asserts that he was not returned to a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> supervisory position because the agency did not provide him with a crew of ATCSs to supervise. He contends that the "undefined" position to which he was reinstated does not carry the same prestige or level of responsibility as his former position of area supervisor, and that it consists of different duties. Specifically, the appellant asserts that he fills in for other supervisors and has been assigned to the Traffic Management Unit (TMU). Yet, the appellant argues, the agency has not determined that permitting him to perform the duties of his former position would be unduly disruptive to the work environment. The appellant also asserts that, at the same time he was reinstated, the agency temporarily promoted an ATCS to the position of area supervisor and that he is performing the duties the appellant previously performed with regard to supervising a crew of ATCSs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1675"></span>In response, the agency states that the TMU is responsible for the management of aircraft traffic flow at times of high density traffic, and that supervising the TMU is an important assignment. The agency also states that there is no separate position description for the TMU supervisor and no difference in grade or pay between that position and the other area supervisors, and that one area supervisor is always assigned to supervise the TMU. In addition, the agency asserts that the appellant had successfully performed the duties of supervisor of the TMU in the past, and that, when agency officials broached the subject of assigning him to those duties pending a final Board decision, he readily agreed to it. Further, the agency argues that the appellant has not shown that its decision to assign him duties as the supervisor of the TMU was made in bad faith. In addition, the agency asserts that the temporary promotion of the ATCS to the position of area supervisor and the appellant's restoration were completely unrelated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant counters that, since his assignment, he has not been given, nor has he performed, any specific duties in the TMU, that the Assistant Manager of the Providence Tower has been responsible for that unit, and that his title of TMU Supervisor is a "sham." Instead, the appellant asserts, he has functioned as a superfluous supervisor in Providence Tower. In any event, the appellant contends that the position of TMU supervisor differs from the area supervisor position because the latter supervises ATCSs, while the former supervises staff employees who do not, themselves, control air traffic. The appellant also states that he did not, by agreeing to the assignment, waive his rights to full interim relief. In addition, the appellant argues that the agency has misstated the law by asserting that the standard for its actions is bad faith. Finally, the appellant suggests that the agency has acknowledged that the TMU supervisor position is different than the area supervisor position because he was advised that, effective June 23, 1995, he would be reassigned to his previous position supervising a crew of ATCSs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an administrative judge's interim relief order requires that the appellant "shall return or be present at the place of employment," an agency may "prevent" such return or presence only upon determining that the employee's return or presence would be unduly disruptive to the work environment, and communicating this determination to the employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A)(ii); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115(b)(2).

The only action not associated with a determination of undue disruption is returning the employee to his former position and duties at his former duty station. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If an undue disruption determination is required, but not made, an agency's petition for review will be dismissed. <span class="Italic">See DeLaughter v. USPS</span>, 3 F.3d 1522, 1525 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Heath</span>, 60 MSPR at 186.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before his demotion, the appellant performed the duties of an area supervisor, supervising a team of ATCSs. As set forth above, and regardless of the management considerations that led the agency to assign the appellant the duties of TMU supervisor, the agency was required to either restore him to his area supervisor position, with the same duties he previously performed, or make an undue disruption determination and timely communicate that determination to him. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Shay v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 67 MSPR 366 (1995) (the agency was required to make an undue disruption determination and expressly notify the appellant and the Board of this determination, even though its decision to place the appellant in a position other than her former position pursuant to an interim relief order was based on the fact that her former position no longer existed). Here, the agency did not restore the appellant to his former position <span class="Italic">and</span> duties, nor did it make an undue disruption determination and communicate such determination to him.[2] <span class="Italic">See Johnson</span>, 67 MSPR at 499.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Moreover, in arguing that its decision to place the appellant as it did was not made in bad faith, the agency misinterprets the current law. In the past, the Board would review an agency's undue disruption determination to see if it was discriminatory, demeaning, or inherently unsafe, and if it were, it was deemed to be made in bad faith, resulting in dismissal of the agency's petition for review<span class="Italic">. Ginocchi v. Dept. of the Treasury</span>, 53 MSPR 62, 70 (1992). However, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has recently rejected such a bad faith review, and has limited the scope of the Board's review of an agency's undue disruption determination to determining whether the agency actually made an undue disruption determination and whether the employee has received appropriate pay and benefits. <span class="Italic">See King v. Jerome and MSPB</span>, 42 F.3d 1371, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 1994). In any event, this analysis is irrelevant to the instant case since the agency here did not make an undue disruption determination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant was required to demonstrate a substantial change in position before the Board would require an undue disruption determination or, alternatively, dismiss the agency's PFR for lack of the determination and certification, <span class="Italic">Harriss v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 68 MSPR 427, 431-33 (1995), considering evidentiary submissions of the parties on the nature of the appellant's position following her restoration through interim relief:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged in her motion to dismiss the petition for review that the agency had not returned her to her GS-5 Lead Medical Clerk position with all of its previous duties. As evidence of that allegation, she submitted copies of a June 13, 1994 memorandum reassigning to other employees her responsibilities for the Composite Health Care System (CHCS), the agency's computer data system, and her duties as Front Desk Supervisor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the agency made a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of compliance, we accept the further evidence of compliance that it filed after the deadline for filing a petition for review in response to our show cause order. In that response, the agency explained that the June 13, 1994 memorandum was in effect while the appellant was removed and the agency had not filled her vacant position. According to the affidavits of the appellant's supervisors, Dr. Mary Haluszka and Petty Officer in Charge Fausto Munoz, the appellant was placed back in her original position and given all of the duties that she had performed previously. Haluszka further stated that, contrary to the appellant's allegation, the appellant was given all of the supervisor's computer codes necessary to perform those duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant replied, stating that her duties were not the same and that she was effectively demoted because Munoz, who had been her subordinate employee, was now her supervisor. She also stated that the agency had changed her position description and elements and standards in her performance appraisal after she returned to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency explained that the chain of supervision in the Urology Department was the same and that Munoz is now the appellant's supervisor because he was promoted to replace Chief Frank Roycroft who had been the appellant's supervisor. The appellant's position description was changed to reflect the different title of her supervisor from Administrative Assistant to Petty Officer in Charge and to reflect the use of CHCS, a different system for entering data which the Urology Department instituted in 1993 before the appellant's removal. Her position description still indicates that she is the lead clerk among three civilian clerks and, at times, three enlisted personnel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of the evidence shows that the agency changed the appellant's performance standards to include a critical element that she would be required to enter telephone consults into CHCS and the log-book at the time of the telephone call and ensure that all telephone consults were entered into CHCS for input into the End of Day Report. Chief Roycroft testified at the hearing below that the procedure for handling and inputting telephone consults was changed during the period that the appellant was removed so that the procedure is fully automated. This element conforms with the change that was made and does not appear to have been directed specifically at the appellant. We find that this change is not a change in the appellant's duties requiring the agency to make an undue disruption determination. <span class="Italic">See Browning v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 61 MSPR 232, 235-36 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has submitted copies of handwritten notes regarding the agency's compliance with the interim relief order, the appellant's handwritten account of her workday from October 31 to November 8, 1994, the appellant's handwritten explanation of her understanding of her job elements and performance standards which she apparently prepared under the agency's direction, and the agency's reply clarifying her job elements and performance standards. After considering these documents in the light of the other evidence of compliance, we conclude that they do not show that the agency failed to place the appellant in the Lead Medical Clerk position with all of its previous duties.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If during the period of interim relief the agency decided to first restore and then remove the appellant from the workplace, the agency was to make an undue disruption determination and provide the required notice of the determination. This situation arose in <span class="Italic">Wilson v. DOJ</span>, 66 MSPR 287, 294-96 (1995), when a removal was reversed, the employer filed a PFR and returned the employee to the workplace during interim relief, and the employer subsequently (but during the interim relief period) placed the employee on "home duty" as it investigated a separate offense that led to a subsequent removal attempt:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is a case of first impression. Where an agency opts to comply with an administrative judge's interim relief order, not by returning the appellant to his former position and duty station, but by placing him on administrative leave or returning him to duty in some alternative position or duty station or with restricted duties, the agency must first make a determination that the appellant's return or presence in the workplace would be unduly disruptive.... That fact pattern is explicitly covered by the WPA. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, although an undue disruption determination need not take any particular form, the agency must at least inform the appellant that his return or presence in the workplace would excessively or in an unwarranted fashion cause disorder or turmoil to the normal course of the agency's operation. <span class="Italic">Manning</span>, 62 MSPR at 458-59. If an agency does not return the appellant to his former position and duty station but fails to make a determination that his return or presence would be unduly <span id="Page_1676"></span>disruptive to the workplace, the Board must dismiss the agency's petition for review for failure to provide interim relief. <span class="Italic">See DeLaughter v. USPS</span>, 3 F.3d 1522, 1524 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115(b)(4); <span class="Italic">Shaishaa</span>, 60 MSPR at 362; <span class="Italic">Heath</span>, 60 MSPR at 185-86.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is different from the above-cited cases. In those cases, the agency made an initial determination not to return the appellant to his former position and duties or duty station but to some other position or set of duties or duty station, or not to return him to the workplace at all. Here, the agency initially returned the appellant to his former position and duties, and only later decided to place him in home duty status with full pay, compensation, and benefits. However, we discern no reason under the facts and circumstances of this case to depart from the established rule that, unless the agency places and retains the appellant in his former position and duties, it must make an undue disruption determination. The Board has previously held that "the only action not associated with a determination of undue disruption is returning an employee to his or her former position and duties at his or her former duty station." <span class="Italic">Heath</span>, 60 MSPR at 185.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This holding is consistent with the analogous case law noted above concerning an agency's decision to detail or reassign or restrict the duties of an employee on interim relief. <span class="Italic">Storm</span>, 64 MSPR at 24-27; <span class="Italic">Manning</span>, 62 MSPR at 458-60; <span class="Italic">Shaishaa</span>, 60 MSPR at 361-63; <span class="Italic">Heath</span>, 60 MSPR at 184-86. The agency explicitly contends that home duty assignments are not disciplinary and refers to the agency's "reassignment" of the appellant to home duty status. It avers that home duty status is not leave, but full duty status. Thus, we discern no reason why the appellant's placement in home duty status in this appeal, two weeks after the agency had returned him to his former position and duties, should be treated differently from cases in which appellants are immediately, upon return to duty, detailed or reassigned out of their former positions or duty stations while on interim relief. In those cases, an agency is required to make an undue disruption determination before refraining from returning the appellant to the employee's former position or duty station. <span class="Italic">See Storm</span>, 64 MSPR at 26-27; <span class="Italic">Manning</span>, 62 MSPR at 459-60; <span class="Italic">Shaishaa</span>, 60 MSPR at 363-63; <span class="Italic">Heath</span>, 60 MSPR at 185-86.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the unique circumstances of this case, we find that the agency has failed to show that it made an undue disruption determination before placing the appellant in home duty status. There is no evidence showing that the agency made an explicit determination that it considered the appellant's return <span class="Italic">or presence</span> in the workplace to be unduly disruptive. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A). Likewise, there is insufficient evidence for us to find that the agency made a <span class="Italic">de facto</span>, implicit undue disruption determination. The agency's letter to the appellant informing him of his placement in home duty status does not set forth the reasons for its decision. In her sworn declaration, Loggins-Mitchell states that the appellant was placed in home duty status "pending an investigation concerning allegations of attempted incitement of an illegal strike which occurred subsequent to his return to duty...." The agency also submitted the December 9, 1993 sworn declaration of Warden R.E. Holt in which he explains the agency's policy concerning home duty status, and states that, although he was not the warden at the time the appellant was placed in home duty status, he would also have placed the appellant in home duty status had he been the warden. He further states that the appellant was placed in home duty status because he allegedly attempted "to incite a sick out by the correctional staff" which occurred after his return to duty on interim relief. There is no indication in Holt's declaration that the agency informed the appellant of the explicit reasons for its decision to place him in home duty status at the time that it made that decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is obvious from the appellant's pleadings that he was aware in June 1993 that he was placed in home duty status pending an investigation into allegations of new misconduct. It is also clear that the appellant later became aware that the investigation concerned his purported attempt to incite a sick out when the agency proposed his removal for that alleged misconduct in July 1993. However, we cannot assume, based solely on his statement in a pleading before the Board that the agency placed him in home duty status pending an investigation, that the agency informed him that it considered his continued presence at the workplace to be unduly disruptive or that the agency informed him of the specific reasons for its decision to place him in home duty status at the time that it made that decision. The agency bears the burden of proving that it made an undue disruption determination and that it communicated this to the appellant. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115(b)(2); <span class="Italic">Manning</span>, 62 MSPR at 459. There is no evidence showing that the agency met this obligation. Therefore, we are compelled to find that the agency has failed to show compliance with the administrative judge's interim relief order.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency was permitted some flexibility. An employee was placed on AWOL status for failing to comply with a detail to another office. The agency, having made an undue disruption determination predicating the detail, was not precluded by the AJ's interim relief order from placing the appellant in a nonpay AWOL status. <span class="Italic">Rutberg v. OSHRC</span>, 78 MSPR 130, 135-36 (1998).</p>
