<p class="Body-Text">Consideration of Stafford Act employees with temporary appointments was extended, and jurisdiction denied, in <span class="Italic">Coleman v. DHS</span>, DA-3443-17-0273-I-114 (NP 4/6/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has filed a petition for review of the initial decision, which dismissed her appeal of the agency action removing her from her Disaster Assistance Employee position because the authority under which she was appointed specified that that she was appointed "without regard to the provisions of Title 5."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_265"></span>Beginning June 8, 2008, the appellant was continuously employed with the agency as a Disaster Assistance Employee (DAE) under a series of temporary appointments. The legal authority identified on the appellant's Standard Form (SF) 50 for the appointment is Pub. L. No. 93-288, known as the Stafford Act.[4] By a letter dated February 13, 2017, the appellant was informed that she was terminated, effective immediately, based on one specification of failure to follow instructions and one specification of failure to follow a written agency policy. The termination letter informed the appellant that, because of the nature of her appointment under the Stafford Act, she was not entitled to Board appeal rights, but that she could appeal the final decision to the agency's Cadre Management and Training Branch Chief within 5 days. The letter also informed the appellant that, if she believed that her termination was the result of prohibited discrimination, she could file a complaint with the agency's Equal Employment Opportunity office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[4]&#x2003;The legal authority for the appellant's appointment was the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 (1974 Act), Pub. L. No. 93-288, 88 Stat 143, which was amended by the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Amendments of 1988 (1988 Act), Pub. L. No. 100-707, 102 Stat. 4689. Section 102(a) of the 1988 Act renamed the 1974 Act "The Robert T. Stafford Disaster and Emergency Assistance Act" (Stafford Act) (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5121 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>.).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 13, 2017, the appellant filed the instant appeal with the Board challenging her termination....The administrative judge determined that because the appellant's appointment was a temporary appointment made pursuant to the Stafford Act, her position was excluded from coverage under chapter 75 of Title 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching this decision, the administrative judge relied on an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(d)(12), which states that "[a]n employee whose agency or position has been excluded from the appointing provisions of Title 5, United States Code, by separate statutory authority" is excluded from coverage of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 unless there is a provision specifically placing that employee under the protections of chapter 75. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Citing similar language in the Stafford Act authorizing the agency to hire temporary personnel "without regard to the provisions of Title 5 of the United States Code," the administrative judge determined that the Board lacked jurisdiction to review the appellant's termination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5149(b)(1). The administrative judge also cited <span class="Italic">Thiess v. Witt</span>, 100 F.3d 915, 916-17 (Fed. Cir. 1996), in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit determined that similar language elsewhere in the Stafford Act excluded those appellants from coverage under certain provisions of 5 U.S.C. chapter 63 pertaining to leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the administrative judge based her decision that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the appellant's appeal on OPM regulation 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(d)(12), coupled with language in the Stafford Act stating that appointments were made under that hiring authority "without regard to the provisions of Title 5." However, in reaching this decision, the administrative judge did not consider the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Lal v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 821 F.3d 1376 (2016). The appellant in <span class="Italic">Lal</span> appealed her removal as a Distinguished Consultant at the Department of Health and Human Services, which was a position created under a statutory special appointment authority, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1377. The administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of Board jurisdiction, concluding that section 209(f) granted appointments "without regard to civil-service laws," and that, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(d)(12), this language deprived the Board of jurisdiction over the appellant's removal appeal. <span class="Italic">Lal v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, MSPB Docket No. DC-0752-14-0852-I-1, Final Order, &#x00B6; 2 (Mar. 25, 2015). The Board agreed, affirming the initial decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-14; <span class="Italic">Lal</span>, 821 F.3d at 1377-78. However, on appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed the Board, concluding that under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111, and the Civil Service Due Process Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-376, 104 Stat. 461 (codified in relevant part at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511), absent a specific exclusion of appeal rights or exemption from section 7511's definition of "employee," a statute broadly exempting an appointment from "the civil-service laws" did not strip the Board of jurisdiction to hear an appeal from an adverse action taken against that employee. <span class="Italic">Lal</span>, 821 F.3d at 1379-80. Instead, the Federal Circuit concluded, the Board must look to the language of the appointment authority to determine whether it included a specific exclusion of chapter 75 appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1380-81. The court also concluded that to the extent OPM's interpretation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.410(d)(12) called for a contrary result, it had "no force or effect." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1381. Concluding that nothing in the broad statutory language stating that appointments under section 209(f) were made "without regard to the civil-service laws" exempted the appellant's position from section 7511(a)'s definition of "employee," the Federal Circuit reversed and remanded the Board's decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequently, in <span class="Italic">Malloy v. Department of State</span>, 2022 MSPB 14, the Board applied the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Lal</span> for the first time, reversing and remanding the initial decision dismissing the appellant's adverse action appeal for lack of Board jurisdiction. In <span class="Italic">Malloy</span>, the Board concluded that the implementing language for the appointment authority at issue in that case only explicitly excluded "chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of Title 5," and made no reference to chapter 75 appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 12. Relying on <span class="Italic">Lal</span>, the Board concluded that because the appointing authority did not explicitly exclude appointees from the protections of chapter 75 (specifically, those relating to removal), as it did with chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53, the appellant was not precluded from pursuing her appeal rights pursuant to chapter 75. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the administrative judge observed that the Stafford Act authorized agencies to hire temporary personnel "without regard to the provisions of Title 5," and to "employ experts and consultants in accordance with [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3109], without regard to the provisions of chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 [of Title 5]...." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5149(b)(1). Relying on this language, as well as OPM's language in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(d)(12), the administrative judge concluded that the Board lacked the authority to review the termination of <span class="Italic">any</span> employee hired under the Stafford Act, including the appellant. Although not noted by the administrative judge, significantly, the language of the Stafford Act does not exclude such employees from the coverage of chapter 75.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Lal</span>, and the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Malloy</span>, the administrative judge's conclusion--that the "without regard to the provisions of Title 5" language in the Stafford Act appointing authority categorically precluded Board review of the termination of any employee hired under the Act--was in error. Instead, as the Board noted in <span class="Italic">Malloy</span>, to decide whether an agency action falls within the coverage of chapter 75, the statutory language authorizing the employee's appointment must be examined to discern whether the action is specifically excluded from the coverage of chapter 75. <span class="Italic">See Lal</span>, 821 F.3d at 1379-81; <span class="Italic">Malloy</span>, 2022 MSPB 14, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-13. We therefore vacate the administrative judge's finding in this regard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">We dismiss the appellant's appeal for lack of jurisdiction because she does not meet the statutory definition of Wemployeee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the holdings in <span class="Italic">Lal</span> and <span class="Italic">Malloy</span> instruct that the "without regard to the provisions of Title 5" language of the Stafford Act is insufficient to categorically exclude individuals appointed under that act from chapter 75 coverage, nothing in either decision altered the appellant's obligation to otherwise demonstrate that she meets the definition of an "employee" with chapter 75 appeal rights in order to prove that the Board has jurisdiction over her appeal. Specifically, the appellant still must show that she is an "employee" with Board appeal rights as defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1). <span class="Italic">See Lal</span>, 821 F.3d at 1379-81.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argued below that the she qualifies as an "employee" under section 7511(a)(1) because she was (1) an individual in the excepted service, who (2) was not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C), a nonpreference eligible in the excepted service only qualifies as an "employee" with Board appeal rights if she:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003;has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C). The Board has jurisdiction if either 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) or (ii) is satisfied. <span class="Italic">Van Wersch v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 197 F.3d 1144, 1151 (Fed. Cir. 1999). 
As the administrative judge correctly noted, the appellant did not provide any evidence demonstrating that she was serving in a probationary or trial period or that her position was one that was pending conversion to the competitive service. Instead, the administrative judge noted that the appointments each had a "not to exceed date" and thus were temporary appointments in the excepted service. Indeed, as the administrative judge noted, the condition-of-employment document signed by the appellant prior to the effective date of her first temporary appointment states that the appellant's appointment is a "temporary civil service excepted position," and that the appellant could be "terminated at any time, with cause...or without cause...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reviewing the SF-50s in the appellant's submitted personnel file, the administrative judge also observed that the SF-50 documenting the appellant's first temporary appointment identified her appointment as a "not to exceed" (NTE) appointment.[5] Additionally, box 34 of each of the SF-50s documenting the subsequent temporary appointment renewals identified the appointment type as within the excepted service, the appellant's tenure as "none," and her work schedule as "intermittent." Each of the appellant's temporary appointments also specified an NTE date that was less than 2 years in the future, and none of the appointments exceeded a 2-year period, disqualifying the appellant <span id="Page_266"></span>from coverage under section 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Roy v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 672 F.3d 1378, 1381 (2012) (noting that the language of section 7511(a)(1)(c)(ii) "leaves no room to doubt that the two-year continuity requirement must be satisfied by service in the same or similar <span class="Italic">permanent</span> positions") (emphasis in original); <span class="Italic">see also</span> OPM Guide to Processing Personnel Actions,[6] Ch. 35 at 15, <span class="Italic">available at</span> <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation/processing-personnel-actions/gppa35.pdf">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation/processing-personnel-actions/gppa35.pdf</a> (noting that a temporary appointment is one made for a limited period of time with a specific NTE date determined by the authority under which the appointment is made).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Although "the SF-50 is not a legally operative document controlling on its face an employee's status and rights," it still can be considered as evidence when determining the nature of an action. <span class="Italic">Grigsby v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;While OPM guides and handbooks lack the force of law, the Board has held that they are entitled to deference in proportion to their power to persuade. <span class="Italic">See Warren v.

Here, OPM's Guide is persuasive as to its definition of a temporary appointment).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, nothing in the language of the Stafford Act specifies that appointments made under the Act are subject to a probationary or trial period or that they are positions "pending conversion to the competitive service." <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5121 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> To the contrary, the statutory provisions of the Stafford Act grant agencies the authority to appoint "<span class="Italic">temporary</span> personnel, experts, and consultants" and to incur obligations "arising out of the <span class="Italic">temporary</span> employment of additional personnel...." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5149(b) (emphasis added). 
Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of Board jurisdiction because the appellant has failed to demonstrate that she meets the statutory definition of an "employee" with Board appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's assertion on review that she resigned, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the involuntary resignation claim of an appellant who otherwise lacks chapter 75 appeal rights, and thus the issue of whether the appellant was terminated or resigned is not dispositive. <span class="Italic">See Paige v.

Although it has been proposed to bring FEMA employees within title 5, this has not been done, presumably in recognition of the unpredictable demands of disasters.</p>
