<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 CFR 315.802(d) (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The probationary period for part-time employees is computed on the basis of calendar time, in the same manner as for full-time employees. For intermittent employees, i.e., those who do not have regularly scheduled tours of duty, each day or part of a day in pay status counts as 1 day of credit toward the 260 days in a pay status required for completion of probation. (However, the probationary period cannot be completed in less than 1 year of calendar time.)</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Moran v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 77 MSPR 532, 536-37 (1998) (reciting the 260-day rule).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 752.401(b)(14) (2022) excludes from adverse action coverage:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Placement of an employee serving on an intermittent or seasonal basis in a temporary nonduty, nonpay status in accordance with conditions established at the time of appointment;...</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Ordinary nonpay status aside, determination of appeal rights for intermittent employees may depend on whether their appointment is in the excepted or competitive service and whether one or more of the statutory conditions under 5 USC 7511 or OPM regulations have been met. An intermittent employee's status was characterized in <span class="Italic">Rison v. DOD</span>, 73 MSPR 390, 392 n.1 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An intermittent employee is one who works without a regularly scheduled tour of duty. 5 CFR 340.401(b). An intermittent work schedule is appropriate only when the nature of the work is sporadic and unpredictable so that a tour of duty cannot be regularly scheduled in advance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00A7; 340.403(a). An intermittent employee who has been in a pay status for 260 days is considered to have completed her probationary period, 5 CFR 315.802(d), and is, therefore, an "employee" with appeal rights to the Board under 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(A)(i)<span class="Italic">. See Gibson v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 36 MSPR 335, 337 (1988)</p>
<p class="Body-Text">According to <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, CH-4324-13-0112-I-1 n.4 (NP 4/22/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has held that an intermittent employee who has been in a pay status for 260 days is considered to have completed his probationary period and therefore is an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A). <span class="Italic">Jolivette v. Department of the Navy</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 216, &#x00B6; 8 n.2 (2005). However, the probationary period is not relevant in determining "employee" status for preference eligibles in the excepted service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B). Here, the appellant was a preference eligible in the excepted service; he was not subject to a probationary period; and he only served 204 days in a pay status during his Clerk appointment. Therefore, his 204 days in a pay status during his intermittent Clerk appointment do not qualify him as an "employee."</p>

The AJ here relied on <span class="Italic">Moran</span> to hold that the appellant was an "employee" with appeal rights because he was in a pay status for more than 260 days. However, section 315.802(d) and <span class="Italic">Moran</span> pertain solely to the definitional criteria under section 7511(a)(1)(A) for individuals in the competitive service, for which a 1-year probationary period applies; they do not necessarily apply to individuals in the excepted service, like the appellant, whose probationary period is not necessarily limited to 1 year. We therefore find that the AJ's reliance on <span class="Italic">Moran</span> is insufficient to establish that the appellant is an "employee" with Board appeal rights.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">[5] In <span class="Italic">Gibson</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. at 337, and <span class="Italic">Holt v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 8, 9 (1980), the Board held that periods of nonpay status do <span class="Italic">not</span> count toward "current continuous service." <span class="Italic">Gibson</span> and <span class="Italic">Holt</span> are typical of many cases issued prior to <span class="Italic">Van Wersch</span>, 197 F.3d 1144, and <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, 307 F.3d 1339, in that they commingle the "probationary or trial period" requirement and the "current continuous service" requirement, rather than separately and alternatively examining those requirements as <span class="Italic">Van Wersch</span> and <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> require. For the reasons discussed in the text above, we overrule <span class="Italic">Gibson</span> and <span class="Italic">Holt</span> to the extent that they are inconsistent with this decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board considered its jurisdiction over the appeal of a temporary employee with an intermittent appointment in <span class="Italic">Drake v. Dept. of Army</span>, 77 MSPR 424, 425-29 (1998), and determined that some circumstances would, in accordance with <span class="Italic">Rison</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, support its jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is a WG-7 Tire Repairer and Battery Servicer. On February 5, 1995, the agency converted him from a temporary appointment to a term appointment, not to exceed four years. The appellant accepted the appointment with the understanding that he was placed on an intermittent work schedule, but could be temporarily given a part-time or full-time schedule. On February 6, 1995, his schedule was temporarily changed to full-time. On August 29, 1996, the agency notified him that his full-time work schedule would be temporarily extended through August 31, 1997. The agency reminded the appellant that his work schedule could be changed back to intermittent at any time without notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In May 1997, the agency changed the appellant's schedule from full-time to intermittent. According to the appellant, the agency told the appellant not to come into work until called. The appellant then initiated the current appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the administrative judge's finding, the appellant is an "employee" under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1). He is in the competitive service, and is thus covered by 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A). He is not serving a probationary or trial period, and is therefore an "employee" under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Youngs v. Department of the Army</span>, 73 MSPR 551, 557 (1997) (the appeal rights of a competitive-service term employee are governed by 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i)). Nor does his status as an intermittent employee deprive him of appeal rights to the Board. An intermittent employee who has been in pay status for 260 days (one year), such as the appellant, is considered to have completed his probationary period, and is an "employee" with appeal rights to the Board under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i). <span class="Italic">See Rison v. Department of Defense</span>, 73 MSPR 390, 392 n.1 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge noted, when the appellant was given his term appointment, he was also placed on an intermittent schedule, with the understanding that he might temporarily work full-time. An intermittent employee is one who is employed "without a regularly scheduled tour of duty." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 340.401(b). Here, the appellant contends that the agency failed to give him any work since May of 1997.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, the placement of an intermittent employee in a nonduty, nonpay status in accordance with the conditions of his employment is neither an adverse action under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512 nor a reduction-in-force (RIF) action under 5 CFR &#x00A7;[351.201] <span class="Italic">. See Sommers v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 62 MSPR 519, 521 (1994) (addressing seasonal employees). Such an action is specifically excluded from coverage under adverse action procedures by 5 CFR &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(14) and from RIF regulations by 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.202(c)(6)<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. Thus, because he is an intermittent employee, the appellant's placement in a nonpay, nonduty status would most likely be insufficient to give rise to an action appealable to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If, however, the agency's failure to call the appellant into work is not in accordance with the terms and the conditions of the appellant's employment, then his appeal could fall within the Board's jurisdiction. Specifically, if the agency's action is a constructive suspension of more than 14 days or a constructive removal, then the appellant would have the right to adverse action procedures and the right to appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Youngs,</span> 73 MSPR at 560; <span class="Italic">Rison v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Defense,</span> 73 MSPR 390 (1997). To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of jurisdiction, the appellant would have to prove that his placement in a nonduty, nonpay status was not in accordance with the conditions of his employment, but was an appealable adverse action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Rison,</span> 73 MSPR at 394 (regarding a potential suspension of more than 14 days).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of such proof, the appellant's only other alternative would be to establish that he was subjected to an impermissible furlough. Because the period of time involved is more than 30 consecutive calendar days, the RIF regulations at 5 CFR Part 351 would be called into play. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.203 (defining "furlough"); <span class="Italic">Wik v. Small Business Administration</span>, 41 MSPR 97, 99 n.4 (1989). Again, as with a potential adverse action, the appellant would be able to establish that the agency's action was within the Board's jurisdiction as a RIF only if the action were not in accordance with the conditions of his employment. Because an intermittent employee by definition spends periods of time in a nonpay, nonduty status, the mere fact that the appellant was placed in such status would <span id="Page_207"></span>not entitle him to the protections of the RIF regulations. To establish jurisdiction under the RIF regulations, the appellant would have to have evidence, such as an employment agreement establishing a minimum number of weeks of work, that the agency's action was not in accordance with the conditions of his employment. <span class="Italic">Cf. Sommers</span>, 62 MSPR at 523 (no jurisdiction found over seasonal employee's appeal, where among other things, he made no nonfrivolous allegation that agency's action was inconsistent with provision of contract guaranteeing him the minimum of 18 pay periods of employment per year).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is currently no evidence in the record that would establish that the agency's action was not in accordance with the terms of the appellant's employment. We cannot dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, now, however, because although the appellant has the burden of proving the Board's jurisdiction over his appeal, he must have been adequately apprised of what proof is required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue.... In this regard, there is no indication that the appellant ever learned of the requirements for establishing the Board's jurisdiction, whether in a conversation with the administrative judge or through the agency's submission, and the appellant did not have an attorney. <span class="Italic">See id.; cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Fidler v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 53 MSPR 440, 444-45 (1992) (administrative judge's failure to properly inform appellant of jurisdictional requirements was not prejudicial where appellant, who was represented by counsel, was put on notice by the agency's motion to dismiss of what he had to allege to establish Board jurisdiction). Because the appellant was never informed of the potential basis for jurisdiction in his being an employee subjected to an adverse action, or given the opportunity to otherwise establish that the agency's action was not in accordance with the conditions of his employment, the appeal must be remanded to permit him an opportunity to submit evidence and argument regarding jurisdiction....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Conaway v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, CH-0752-16-0165-I-1 (NP 9/22/2022) ("As discussed above, the appellant held a part-time position on a mixed-tour work schedule with a minimum tour of duty of 2 hours per pay period. Additionally, she signed an employee agreement specifically indicating that her mixed-tour work schedule may include 'periods of full-time, part-time, and intermittent work, as well as periods in a nonpay status, depending on workload.' Thus, the agency did not violate the terms and conditions of the appellant's employment when it placed her in an intermittent work status and provided her paid administrative leave for 2 hours per pay period. Accordingly, we agree with the administrative judge's finding that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's appeal as an alleged constructive suspension of more than 14 days.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It may occur that an intermittent employee serves in an appointment that confers appeal rights by means other than through the 260-day rule. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jolivette v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 100 MSPR 216 (2005) (considering accumulation of service of an intermittent employee under a VRA appointment; also counting period of nonpay status toward current continuous service, overruling any inconsistency in <span class="Italic">Gibson v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> 36 MSPR 335 (1988), <span class="Italic">Holt v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> 3 MSPR 8 (1980)). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-139.html#sec1-138">Veterans Readjustment Act</a>," for discussion of <span class="Italic">Jolivette</span>.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An intermittent employee is not subject to an appealable adverse action if a period of unemployment occurs, apparently even for disciplinary reasons, if the lack of work is consistent with the terms of his intermittent employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Norris v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 15 MSPR 8, 11-12 (1983) (employee who was about to be removed for misconduct was not called to work during the notice period). Although <span class="Italic">Norris</span> was not clear on the demarcation in Board jurisdiction over periods of unemployment caused by lack of work or for disciplinary reasons:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Intermittent employees, in a manner analogous to seasonal employees, work in an other than full-time status without a prearranged regular tour of duty. The agency has authorized the use of intermittent employment respecting positions whose performance makes it infeasible to establish a tour of duty on a continuing basis. AFR 40-610, para 3(c). Pursuant to its authority, the agency designated a portion of its Sales Store Checker positions, one of which appellant encumbered, as "intermittent" in order to maintain staffing flexibility. Thus, we find that the agency impliedly established an "as needed" basis as a condition upon which the agency would make use of appellant's services at the time of appellant's appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency's utilization of an intermittent appointment, by its very nature, affords discretion to the agency to call or not call an employee serving under such an appointment in for work. Intermittent employees are non-full-time employees without a prearranged regular schedule. (Comptroller General Decision B-167804, November 15, 1977). Therefore, they have no expectation or entitlement to work except to the extent that it is in accordance with the conditions of their appointment. Because the conditions attaching to appellant's appointment were of an "as needed" character, and the agency clearly determined that appellant's services were not called for or needed, the presiding official erred in finding the agency to have effected suspension actions against appellant by its decision not to call her in for work during the periods of February 21, 1981 to April 13, 1981, and from April 3, 1981 to May 8, 1981. Accordingly, under 5 CFR 752.401(c)(9), we find that the agency had no obligation to apply adverse action procedures to its actions in not calling appellant in for work.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit confirmed that the Board lacks jurisdiction under statute or regulation to review agency decisions not to recall intermittent employees to work. <span class="Italic">Myrick v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1983 NP No. 83-1294).</p>
