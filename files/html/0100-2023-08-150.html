<p class="Body-Text">The FCIP began in 2000 and ended March 1, 2011. <span class="Italic">See</span> Exec. Order No. 13162, 65 Fed. Reg. 43211 (July 6, 2000); Exec. Order No. 13562, 75 Fed. Reg. 82585, 82588 (Dec. 27, 2010); <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 2455</span>, 67 FLRA 42, 42 n.1 (2012). The nature of an FCIP appointment was explained by <span class="Italic">Martinez v. DHS</span>, 118 MSPR 154, 157-58 &#x00B6; 7, 2012 MSPB 69 (2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As noted above, a nonpreference eligible in the excepted service qualifies as an employee under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) if he has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has clarified that appointments made under the FCIP are not temporary appointments:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Career intern appointments are made without the not-to-exceed (NTE) dates used with other temporary or time-limited appointments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The internship portion of the FCIP is generally made for 2 years, but because the appointment permits the noncompetitive conversion to a permanent job, the appointment is not treated as temporary or time-limited.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">70 Fed. Reg. 44,219 (Aug. 2, 2005). Consistent with that guidance, the Standard Form 50 recording the appellant's December 7, 2008 conversion to the excepted service under the FCIP does not include an NTE date, and bears the nature of action code "570," which OPM has reserved for non-temporary excepted service appointments of employees already on an agency's rolls. <span class="Italic">See Guide to Processing Personnel Actions</span>, Chapter 11, Table 11-A, <span class="Italic">available at</span> <a href="http://www.opm.gov/feddata/gppa/gppa11.pdf">http://www.opm.gov/feddata/gppa/gppa11.pdf</a> [now at <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation/processing-personnel-actions/gppa11.pdf">http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation/processing-personnel-actions/gppa11.pdf</a>].</p>
<p class="Body-Text">MSPB jurisdiction over FCIP terminations was limited; an ordinary adverse action appeal right appeared to exist only for someone with sufficient veterans preference and service time, <span class="Italic">Ramos v. MSPB</span>, 351 Fed. Appx. 435, 437-38 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction over appeals by "an employee." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a). With limited exceptions not involved here, only "employees" may appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">United States v. Connolly</span>, 716 F.2d 882, 886 (Fed. Cir. 1983). For purposes of this appeal, an "employee" is defined as "a preference eligible in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions" or "an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible)...who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B)-(C)(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ramos was an individual in the excepted service who had so served for approximately sixteen months. Therefore, for the Board to have had jurisdiction over his appeal, he must either not have been serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service, or he must have been a preference eligible. The Board correctly held that Ramos did not come within either category.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Ramos' Departmental appointment was not described as a probationary one, it was precisely that. Ramos was hired under the Federal Career Internship Program, which, as we have noted, provides for initial appointments for two years. Although individuals who successfully complete such internships "may be granted" "[c]ompetitive civil service status," such service "confers no rights to further Federal employment in either the competitive or excepted service upon the expiration of the internship period." Indeed, as the Board stated, "[i]n his initial appeal, the appellant noted that he was terminated during his probationary period." The Board thus correctly held that because Ramos was terminated during his probationary period, it had no jurisdiction over his appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only other statutory basis for Board jurisdiction would have been that Ramos was a "preference eligible" veteran as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3)(A). That provision provides that the term (which incorporates the definition of "veteran" in section 2108(1)(A)), "means an individual who...served on active duty in the armed forces during a war, in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized, or during the period beginning April 28, 1952, and ending July 1, 1955;...and who has been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions." Since Ramos did not serve in the Navy during a declared war or during the applicable time period, he could be classified as a preference eligible under this provision only if he had served in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ramos seeks such status on the ground that during his military service he was awarded the Kuwait Liberation Medal. This medal was not an "authorized" "campaign badge" under that statutory provision, however, because it was issued not by the United States, but by either Saudi Arabia or Kuwait. The statute "does not bestow veteran status upon those awarded a badge by a foreign country." <span class="Italic">See Perez v. Merit Systems Protection Bd.</span>, 85 F.3d 591, 594 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On this record, the Board correctly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over Ramos' appeal because (1) he was terminated during his probationary period and (2) he was not a preference eligible. For the latter reason, the Board necessarily had no jurisdiction over his appeal under the Veterans Employment Opportunity Act, which covers only preference eligibles. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a; <span class="Italic">Campion v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_232"></span>Similarly, <span class="Italic">Scull v. DHS</span>, 113 MSPR 287, 290-96 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-19, 2010 MSPB 40 (2010), determined that if an FCIP appointment lapsed, the separation of the employee was not an appealable adverse action unless that program participant had immediate prior service within the same agency as a career or career-conditional appointee and met the definition of "employee" under 5 USC 7511 at the time of the FCIP appointment. If the appellant had that status, she had an appeal right if the FCIP internship was ended for reasons unrelated to misconduct or suitability:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FCIP was established in 2000 by Executive Order 13,162, 65 Fed. Reg. 43,211 (July 6, 2000), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 5 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 3301 note (Supp. 2006) "to provide for the recruitment and selection of exceptional employees for careers in the public sector." The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has promulgated implementing regulations. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o); 65 Fed. Reg. 78,077 (Dec. 14, 2000); 70 Fed. Reg. 44,219 (Aug. 2, 2005). Appointments under the FCIP are to positions in Schedule B of the excepted service and are not to exceed 2 years, unless extended by the agency, with the concurrence of OPM, for up to 1 additional year. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(1)-(2). Upon successful completion of the internship, the agency may effect the intern's noncompetitive conversion to a career or career-conditional appointment in the competitive service. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6)(i). If the intern is not converted at the end of the internship period, his FCIP internship appointment generally terminates with no further right to federal employment. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6)-(7).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The termination of an appointment on the expiration date specified as a basic condition of employment at the time the appointment was made simply carries out the terms of the appointment; it does not constitute an adverse action appealable to the Board under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75. <span class="Italic">Berger v. Department of Commerce,</span> 3 M.S.P.R. 198, 199-200 (1980); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(11). OPM has explicitly stated that agencies should document FCIP internship appointments without the not-to-exceed dates used with other temporary or time-limited appointments because there is a potential for conversion to the competitive service upon the expiration of the internship period. 70 Fed. Reg. at 44,219. Nevertheless, the absence of such a date in the ministerial documentation of the appointment does not alter the actual time-limited nature of the appointment. <span class="Italic">See</span> Exec. Order No. 13,162 &#x00A7; 4(a); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(1)-(2). The FCIP regulations provide that, as a condition of employment, the appointment of an intern expires at the end of 2 years, plus any applicable extension. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(7). Although the regulations describe a number of ways that an FCIP appointment might end, i.e. conversion to the competitive service, return to a position equivalent in grade and pay to a formerly held career or career-conditional appointment, or termination of employment, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6)-(7), the regulations remain clear that the appointment will expire. The regulations are also clear that service as a career intern generally confers no rights to further federal employment upon the expiration of the internship period. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6). We therefore find that an FCIP intern's termination upon the expiration of his appointment is generally not an adverse action appealable to the Board because it merely carries out the terms of the appointment.[1] <span class="Italic">See Endermuhle v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 495, &#x00B6; 9 (2001).</p>

In that case, the appellant was separated during her internship--not pursuant to the expiration of her internship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">FCIP appointments are similar to appointments under the former Presidential Management Intern Program (PMIP).[2] PMIP appointments, which were limited to 2 years unless extended by OPM for up to 1 additional year, could result in the intern's noncompetitive conversion to the competitive service if the intern successfully completed the internship. Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), Chapter 362, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2-3, 2-7 (July 31, 1986). However, if the agency did not convert the intern upon the expiration of his internship, his federal employment terminated. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00A7; 2-8. The Board found, based on the official guidance governing PMIP appointments, that a PMIP intern's separation from service pursuant to the expiration of his appointment was not appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Soehngen v. Department of Justice,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. 169, 172, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 945 F.2d 418 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table). We find that the regulations governing the FCIP are relevantly similar to the official guidance governing the PMIP. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.2302(o)(1)-(2), (6)-(7) <span class="Italic">with</span> FPM, Chapter 362, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2-3a(1), 2-6, 27, 2-8.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We acknowledge that OPM's regulations contain some language suggesting that an FCIP appointment ends only if the intern's federal employment is terminated at the end of the internship period: "If an employee is not converted to a career or career-conditional appointment, the career intern appointment terminates, <span class="Italic">unless</span> the employee is specifically eligible for placement under paragraph (o)(6)(ii) of this section." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(7) (emphasis added). However, for the reasons explained above, we find that the regulation, read as a whole, provides that the appointment expires in any event at the end of 2 years, plus any applicable extension; any contrary indication in paragraph (o)(7) is inconsistent with the regulation as a whole and may best be attributed to imprecise language used in drafting that subsection. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Phipps v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 767 F.2d 895, 897 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (regulations must be read as a whole). To be read consistently with the rest of the regulation, the phrase "the career intern appointment terminates" in the language quoted above must be read as "the career intern's employment terminates." Although FCIP appointments serve functionally as competitive service probationary periods, the expiration of an FCIP appointment is unlike the expiration of a normal probationary period. Upon the expiration of a normal probationary period, the employee continues to serve in the same appointment to which he was initially appointed, albeit no longer as a probationer, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.801, but upon the expiration of an FCIP appointment, the employee must either receive a new appointment or be separated from service, <span class="Italic">see</span> OPM, Guide to Processing Personnel Actions, Chapter 11, at 3 (a conversion changes an employee from one appointment to another appointment), available at <a href="http://www.opm.gov/feddata/gppa/gppa.asp">http://www.opm.gov/feddata/gppa/gppa.asp</a> [now at <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation/processing-personnel-actions/gppa11.pdf">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation/processing-personnel-actions/gppa11.pdf</a>] . For all these reasons, we find that the termination of an FCIP intern's employment upon the expiration of his internship is generally not appealable to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that, at the time of his termination, the appellant was an employee with the right to appeal an adverse action to the Board under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75. The appellant was a preference eligible individual in the excepted service who had completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same position. <span class="Italic">[S]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">ee</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B)(i); <span class="Italic">Dade v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 43, &#x00B6; 12 (2005). Nevertheless, the appellant's status as an employee with adverse action appeal rights has no bearing on the question of whether he was actually subjected to an adverse action within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Schall v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 73 F.3d 341, 344 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Soehngen,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. at 172.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The agency took timely affirmative steps to terminate the appellant upon the expiration of his internship appointment.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the agency failed to take timely action to terminate him upon the April 14, 2009 expiration of his internship. In support of his argument, the appellant alleges that he did not actually receive the agency's termination letter until April 18, 2009, and that he remained on the agency's payroll in approved leave status from April 14 through 17, 2009. He argues that the agency's failure to take any action upon the expiration of his internship appointment resulted in his automatic conversion to a career or career-conditional appointment in the competitive service, and that his termination was therefore tantamount to a removal over which the Board has jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not consider the legal effect of an agency's failure to take any action upon the expiration of an FCIP internship because, even if the agency was required to take timely affirmative steps to prevent the appellant's automatic conversion,[3] there is no genuine dispute that it did so. In this regard, we find it appropriate to analogize to terminations of probationary employees. Although an agency must effect the termination of a probationer prior to the end of the probationer's tour of duty on the last day of probation, which is the day before the anniversary date, <span class="Italic">Burke v. Department of Justice,</span> 53 M.S.P.R. 372, 375 (1992), it is not a requirement that a probationary employee actually receive a termination notice prior to the effective date of the termination if the agency acted diligently and reasonably in attempting to afford the employee prior notification, <span class="Italic">Santillan v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 54 M.S.P.R. 21, 26 (1992). Likewise, we find that even if the appellant in this case did not receive actual notice of his termination until April 18, 2009, this does not mean that the agency's action was not effective before that date. Rather, the question is whether the agency acted diligently and reasonably in attempting to notify the appellant of his termination in a timely manner. For the following reasons, we conclude that the appellant has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency failed to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The Board has made no determination regarding whether an automatic conversion could ever occur, as it is unnecessary for the adjudication of this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant was on leave during the last day of his internship, and that the agency therefore sent copies of the termination notice to the appellant via e-mail and to the appellant's residence via overnight delivery and certified mail. It is also undisputed that, on April 14, 2009, the appellant's third-level supervisor, Assistant Field Office Director Raymond Kovacic, left voice mail messages on the appellant's <span id="Page_233"></span>personal and government cell phones "informing him that his position was not being converted and that he was terminated as of close of business on April 14, 2009."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant did not dispute that the agency took these steps to notify him of his termination, he argued below that the agency was also required to attempt personal delivery of the termination notice to his home on April 14, 2009. However, we are aware of no law, rule, or regulation requiring the agency to take this particular step in attempting to notify the appellant of his termination, and in light of the agency's other diligent efforts to notify the appellant, we find that the appellant has failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency did not act diligently under the circumstances to inform him of its decision to terminate him prior to the end of his tour of duty on April 14, 2009. <span class="Italic">See Burke,</span> 53 M.S.P.R. at 377 (under the circumstances of the case, the agency's telephone calls to the appellant's residence and to the appellant's girlfriend constituted a sufficiently diligent attempt to notify him of his termination). Likewise, the appellant's contention that he remained on the agency's payroll in approved leave status until April 17, 2009, is immaterial. Even if the appellant's first-line supervisor had granted him leave from April 14 through 17, 2009, this does not mean that the appellant could not have been terminated while he was on leave. <span class="Italic">[S]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">ee Cephas v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 27 M.S.P.R. 69, 71-72 (1985) (the agency properly terminated the appellant while she was on leave), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 785 F.2d 321 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table). We therefore find that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that he was not terminated upon the expiration of his FCIP internship appointment consistent with the documentation of that termination in the applicable SF-50.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">It is unclear whether the agency was required to reinstate the appellant upon his non-conversion.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although an FCIP intern's non-conversion upon the expiration of his internship generally terminates his federal employment with no right to further employment, OPM's regulations provide an exception:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee who held a career or career-conditional appointment in an agency immediately before entering the FCIP in the same agency, and who fails to complete the FCIP for reasons unrelated to misconduct or suitability, shall be placed in a career or career-conditional position in the current agency at no lower grade or pay than the one the employee left to accept the position in the FCIP. For purposes of this paragraph, "agency" means an Executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105. An Executive department may treat each of its bureaus or components (first major subdivision that is separately organized and clearly distinguished from other bureaus or components in work function and operation) as a separate agency or as part of one agency, but must do so by agency directive in establishing the Program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6)(ii); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Exec. Order No. 13,162 &#x00A7; 4(b)(5). The regulations explicitly state that an intern's employment will not terminate upon his non-conversion if he is eligible for placement under section 213.3202(o)(6)(ii). 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(7). According to OPM, this exception was included in the FCIP to ensure that current federal employees can participate in the program without fear of losing their jobs if they cannot successfully complete their internships. 70 Fed. Reg. at 44,220.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that, where an intern is eligible for placement under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6)(ii) and otherwise has Board appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, the termination of his employment upon the expiration of his FCIP internship constitutes an adverse action within the Board's jurisdiction. Because the terms of an FCIP appointment do not provide for the summary termination of such an employee upon his non-conversion, his termination under those circumstances does not simply carry out the terms of the appointment. <span class="Italic">Cf. Berger,</span> 3 M.S.P.R. at 199-200. Rather, it constitutes an appealable adverse action a removal of the employee from the rolls when he is entitled by regulation to continuing federal employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6)(ii), (7); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(1), 7513(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, where an FCIP intern is separated from service upon the expiration of his internship, he may establish Board jurisdiction over the action by establishing the following elements by preponderant evidence: (1) Immediately prior to his FCIP appointment, he held a career or career-conditional appointment in the same agency; (2) his failure to complete the internship successfully was for reasons unrelated to misconduct or suitability; and (3) he is an "employee" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6)(ii); <span class="Italic">see also Palmer v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 550 F.3d 1380, 1382 (Fed.

Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 77 F.3d 1378, 1380 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant satisfies the third jurisdictional element in this case. However, it is unclear whether the appellant satisfies the first jurisdictional element. The record shows that, immediately prior to his FCIP appointment in the agency's ICE division, the appellant held a career or career-conditional appointment in the agency's CBP division. Because both of these divisions are within the Department of Homeland Security, they would be considered part of the same agency unless the agency has issued an appropriate directive requiring their treatment as separate agencies for FCIP purposes. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6)(ii); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 101, 105. Although the appellant signed paperwork suggesting that such a directive exists, the evidence of record is inconclusive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is also unclear whether the appellant satisfies the second jurisdictional element. Although the agency's stated reason for not converting the appellant was apparently related to misconduct, i.e., the appellant's alleged lack of candor involving his accident in a government-owned vehicle, the appellant argued below that he could have provided an explanation for his actions that would have merited "a more favorable outcome" for his situation. Although this does not constitute a nonfrivolous allegation that his failure to complete the internship successfully was "unrelated to misconduct or suitability," 5 C.F.R. 213.3202(o)(6)(ii); <span class="Italic">see Marcino v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 344 F.3d 1199, 1204 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (mere conclusory allegations, unsupported by evidence or argument, do not constitute nonfrivolous allegations), the appellant was not informed of the proper jurisdictional standard below, and he should be given the opportunity to present his case with full knowledge of his jurisdictional burden, <span class="Italic">see Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (an appellant must receive explicit information on what is required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue). Accordingly, we find it appropriate to remand this appeal for the appellant to receive proper jurisdictional notice and an adequate opportunity to establish Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Department of Defense,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 493, &#x00B6; 16 (2008).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After remand, the Board still decided that it lacked jurisdiction of Mr. Scull's appeal. He did not demonstrate that his termination was unrelated to misconduct or suitability, <span class="Italic">Scull v. DHS</span>, SF-0752-09-0565-B-2 (NP 6/15/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we explained in <span class="Italic">Scull v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287 (2010), in order to establish jurisdiction over this appeal the appellant must establish the following elements by preponderant evidence: (1) immediately prior to his Federal Career Intern Program (FCIP) appointment, he held a career or career-conditional appointment in the same agency; (2) his failure to complete the internship successfully was for reasons unrelated to misconduct or suitability; and (3) he is an "employee" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 17. It is undisputed that conditions (1) and (3) are satisfied. The remaining question is whether the appellant has established the second element, i.e., that his failure to complete the internship successfully was for reasons unrelated to misconduct or suitability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The required showing is in some respects analogous to a showing of pretext in the Title VII context, in that the appellant must establish by preponderant evidence that the agency's proffered reason for his non-conversion, i.e., his alleged lack of candor in reporting an accident involving a government vehicle, was not the real reason for the agency's decision. The appellant may accomplish this task either directly, by persuading the Board that the agency's decision was more likely based on another reason, e.g., performance deficiencies, or indirectly by showing that the agency's explanation is unworthy of credence. <span class="Italic">Cf. Wickramasekera v. Veterans Administration</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. 707, 713 (1984) (citing <span class="Italic">Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 256 (1981)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant has not put forward an alternative explanation for the agency's non-conversion decision. He asserts that the reason for his termination was not misconduct, but rather the expiration of his 2-year FCIP term. However, as the administrative judge noted below, this argument misses the point. It is undisputed that the appellant was terminated upon the expiration of his 2-year FCIP term when the agency did not convert him to a career or career-conditional appointment pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6)(i). The issue to be decided is whether the agency's decision not to convert him was for reasons unrelated to misconduct or suitability, and the appellant has not identified any such reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor has the appellant demonstrated that the agency's explanation is unworthy of credence. He notes that the SF-50 recording his termination makes no reference to misconduct, but instead states that the reason for his termination was "DID NOT SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THE PROBATION PERIOD." However, the appellant cites no legal authority that would require the agency to explicitly state in the SF-50 that it is separating an intern upon the expiration of an FCIP internship due to misconduct. Moreover, an SF-50 is not a legally operative document controlling an employee's appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Scott v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 434, &#x00B6; 8 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also contends that the agency lacks sufficient evidence to <span id="Page_234"></span>support a lack of candor charge. However, the agency does not bear the burden of establishing by preponderant evidence that misconduct was the real reason for its decision; rather, the appellant bears the burden of establishing that misconduct was not the real reason. <span class="Italic">Cf. Carter v. Small Business Administration</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 656, 665 (1994) (finding, in context of a discrimination claim, that the administrative judge erred in requiring the agency to prove that poor performance was the real reason for the appellant's removal). Here, the record contains ample unrebutted evidence that the appellant displayed a lack of candor when he reported an accident involving a government vehicle, and that this was the reason for his non-conversion. <span class="Italic">See Friedrick v. Department of Justice</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 126, 135 (1991) (lack of candor is a form of misconduct), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 980 F.2d 742 (Fed.

Department of Justice</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 56, &#x00B6; 13 (2000) (lack of candor may involve failure to be forthcoming or the omission of material information rather than an affirmative misstatement of fact), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 278 F.3d 1280 (Fed. Cir. 2002). We therefore find that the appellant failed to establish by preponderant evidence that his failure to complete the FCIP was for reasons "unrelated to misconduct or suitability." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6)(ii); <span class="Italic">see Scull</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the brief period of time between the Board's issuance of <span class="Italic">Dean v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 157 (2010), and the close of the record below in the instant appeal, we have considered the appellant's arguments regarding the implications of that case. However, we find the arguments unavailing. First, we find that the appellant's veterans' preference rights are not implicated in this appeal. The only right implicated is the appellant's right to appeal an adverse action to the Board, and apart from meeting the definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511, which it is undisputed that the appellant satisfies notwithstanding the nature of his FCIP appointment, the appellant's veterans' preference status is immaterial to his right to appeal his separation. We also find that the fact that the FCIP appointment was in the excepted service is immaterial to the jurisdictional issue. The Board's lack of jurisdiction over this appeal is not due to the fact the appellant was serving in an excepted service appointment but is rather due to the fact that the appellant was serving under an FCIP appointment that expired according to its terms for reasons that were not "unrelated to misconduct or suitability." <span class="Italic">See Scull</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9, 17.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lee v. OPM,</span> DC-315H-10-0080-I-1 (NP 8/10/2010), qualified <span class="Italic">Scull</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on petition for review that the Board has jurisdiction over her appeal based on her claim of marital status discrimination. However, as the administrative judge correctly explained in his initial decision, only individuals in the competitive service have the right to appeal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(b) based on allegations of marital status discrimination. <span class="Italic">[S]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">ee Allen v. Department of the Navy</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 302, &#x00B6; 6 (2006). The appellant has no right of appeal under that section because she was in the excepted service--not the competitive service. Therefore, the only way for the appellant to establish jurisdiction over her appeal would be to show that she is an "employee" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a). <span class="Italic">See Allen</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 302, &#x00B6; 6. Because the appellant is not an "employee" within the meaning of that section, the administrative judge correctly dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the administrative judge issued the initial decision, the Board issued <span class="Italic">Scull v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287 (2010), explaining the limited appeal rights of Federal Career Intern Program (FCIP) appointees who are terminated upon the expiration of their internships. However, the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Scull</span> does not apply to the facts of the instant appeal because the appellant herein was terminated prior to the expiration of her internship. <span class="Italic">Scull</span> applies only to situations where FCIP interns are separated from service "upon the expiration" of their internships. 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-17.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following up on <span class="Italic">Scull,</span> <span class="Italic">Rivera v. DHS</span>, 116 MSPR 429, 431, 433-37 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3, 8-15, 2011 MSPB 57 (2011), determined that an agency did not take an appealable adverse action by allowing an FCIP appointment to terminate without affirmative and effective steps by the agency to notify the employee prior to the termination of the appointment that he would not be converted to the competitive service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective July 8, 2007, the agency appointed the appellant under the Federal Career Intern Program (FCIP) to the position of GS-09 Applications Adjudicator. The FCIP appointment was an excepted service appointment expected to continue for 2 years, with a potential for noncompetitive conversion to a career or career-conditional appointment in the competitive service upon satisfactory completion of the internship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency issued the appellant a letter, dated July 1, 2009, stating that it would not be converting his FCIP appointment to a competitive service appointment because the appellant's "performance was not at an acceptable level of competence." The letter stated that the appellant's FCIP appointment would expire on July 7, 2009, and that he would be separated from service upon its expiration. The letter was postmarked July 6, 2009, and mailed to the appellant's home address. The appellant, however, was on approved leave overseas beginning June 29, 2009, and did not return home until July 12, 2009. He alleged that he did not actually receive the agency's letter until July 13, 2009. The agency subsequently issued an SF-50 indicating that the appellant had been terminated effective July 7, 2009.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Shortly after the record on review closed, the Board issued a precedential decision regarding its jurisdiction over an appeal of a termination pursuant to the expiration of an FCIP appointment. <span class="Italic">Scull v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287 (2010). As the Board explained in <span class="Italic">Scull</span>, "an FCIP intern's termination upon the expiration of his appointment is generally not an adverse action appealable to the Board because it merely carries out the terms of the appointment." 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 7 (citing <span class="Italic">Endermuhle v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 495, &#x00B6; 9 (2001), <span class="Italic">Berger v.

However, the Board in <span class="Italic">Scull</span> declined to consider the legal effect of an agency's failure to take any action upon the expiration of an FCIP appointment because the agency in that case took timely, affirmative steps to terminate the appellant's employment upon the expiration of his FCIP appointment. <span class="Italic">Scull,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 12 &#x0026; n.3. Specifically, the Board declined to decide whether, in the absence of any agency action at the expiration of an FCIP appointment, the appointment automatically converts to a career or career-conditional appointment in the competitive service pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6)(i) or the intern's federal employment automatically terminates pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(7). <span class="Italic">See id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see generally Myles v. Social Security Administration</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 471, 473-74 (2008) (separate opinion of Chairman Neil A. G. McPhie).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties in the instant appeal appear to take opposing positions on the issue, and the administrative judge appears to have agreed with the agency that "the appointment of a FCIP intern simply expires at the end of the 2 year internship period." The appellant challenges the administrative judge's finding on review. After fully considering the submissions and the record in this appeal, we affirm the initial decision because we find that an FCIP appointment automatically terminates upon its expiration unless the agency takes affirmative steps to extend the appointment or convert it to the competitive service. In reaching this conclusion, we find OPM's advisory opinion persuasive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we noted in <span class="Italic">Scull,</span> an FCIP appointment expires at the end of the intern's tour of duty on the last day of the internship, which is, with exceptions not applicable here, the day before the 2-year anniversary date of the appointment. <span class="Italic">Scull</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 12; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(1). In this case, the last day of the appellant's FCIP internship was July 7, 2009, which was the day before the 2-year anniversary of his July 8, 2007 appointment.[1] Because we find that an FCIP appointment automatically terminates upon the expiration of its term unless the agency takes affirmative steps to extend the appointment or convert it to the competitive service, and the record here shows that the agency did not take any such steps to extend the appellant's FCIP appointment, we conclude that the appellant's termination upon expiration of his FCIP appointment was not an appealable adverse action. <span class="Italic">Endermuhle</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 495, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Berger</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. at 199-200; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(11)); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(1)-(2), (6)-(7).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The appellant argues that his internship expired on July 2, 2009, because the "2 years" of his internship period should have been measured in terms of pay periods rather than calendar years. The appellant's argument is without merit because it lacks legal support and is contrary to longstanding Board precedent and the ordinary meaning of the term "year." <span class="Italic">See Dean v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 16 (2005) (absent a distinct definition in a statute or regulation, the words therein are assumed to carry their "ordinary, contemporary, common meaning" (quoting <span class="Italic">Perrin v. United States</span>, 444 U.S. 37, 42 (1979))), <span class="Italic">aff'd on recons.</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 1 (2006); <span class="Italic">cf. Rzucidlo v. Department of the Army</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 7 (2006) (a competitive service probationary period is 1 calendar year).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, we note, in the alternative, that even if the agency was required to take affirmative steps to terminate the appellant in order to prevent his FCIP appointment from converting to a competitive service appointment, the agency was not required to actually afford the appellant prior notice of its intention to do so as long as it acted diligently and reasonably in attempting to afford him prior notice. <span class="Italic">See Scull</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">cf. Santillan v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 21, 26 (1992) (it is not a requirement that a probationary employee actually receive a termination notice prior to the effective date of the termination if the agency acted diligently and reasonably in attempting to afford the employee prior notification). In this case, it is undisputed that the appellant was overseas on July 7, 2009, when his FCIP appointment expired. The appellant does not claim that the agency should have attempted to notify him of its action while he was overseas, but argues instead that due diligence required the agency to notify him prior to his <span id="Page_235"></span>departure since he informed the agency well in advance that he would be out of the country on the date his appointment was set to expire.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We decline to establish a rule that would require an agency to make its termination decision in advance of the date that it would otherwise be required to do so merely because it is aware that the employee in question will be unavailable to receive the decision on that date. The regulations governing the FCIP are calculated to afford agencies a full 2 years to observe and consider an intern's performance and conduct before deciding whether to convert him to a competitive service appointment. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(1), (6)(i). If the agency had actually made its termination decision before the appellant went overseas, the agency's knowledge that he would be unavailable to receive the decision when the agency was required to deliver it might be relevant to whether the agency acted diligently under the circumstances. In this case, however, there is no indication that the agency made its decision until July 1, 2009, when it issued the termination letter. Moreover, the agency's decision appears to have been based on a performance evaluation that was not actually completed until June 30, 2009, the day after the appellant left the country. In addition, there is no indication in the record that the appellant informed the agency of how it might contact him while he was overseas. Under the particular circumstances of this case, we find that the agency made reasonable and diligent efforts to provide the appellant with notice of its decision by mailing the termination notice to his home address on July 6, 2009.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has also argued that the agency failed to provide him adequate training in his FCIP position, as required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(9), and that the agency should therefore be precluded from terminating him for failing to satisfactorily complete the internship. Specifically, the appellant argues that an agency must be required to comply with paragraph (o)(9) before terminating an FCIP intern for failing to complete the internship satisfactorily; otherwise, that paragraph will be rendered superfluous. However, we find that the appellant's argument is immaterial to the jurisdictional issue because it pertains only to the merits of his termination. <span class="Italic">See Weaver v. Department of the Army</span>, 14 M.S.P.R. 465, 466-67 (1983) (the appellant's argument that his termination was improper because of a lack of training pertained to the merits of the agency's action and was immaterial to the jurisdictional issue); <span class="Italic">see also Schmittling v. Department of the Army</span>, 219 F.3d 1332, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (the Board must first resolve the threshold issue of jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits of an appeal). We agree with the administrative judge that the agency's option to terminate an FCIP intern upon the expiration of his appointment is not predicated upon the agency having provided the training required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(9). Furthermore, we disagree with the appellant's argument that our interpretation of the regulation renders paragraph (o)(9) superfluous or violates any other rule of regulatory construction. The fact that an agency's alleged violation of law or regulation provides no basis for a Board appeal does not render that law or regulation superfluous. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 573, 577 (1995) (the Board does not have jurisdiction over all matters regarding a federal employee that are allegedly unfair or incorrect; rather, the Board's jurisdiction is limited to matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by statute or regulation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, although the Board generally lacks jurisdiction over the termination of an FCIP intern upon the expiration of his appointment, the FCIP regulations provide the Board with jurisdiction over such a termination under limited circumstances. <span class="Italic">Scull</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-17. Specifically, an appellant may establish Board jurisdiction over an appeal of such a termination by establishing the following elements by preponderant evidence: (1) Immediately prior to his FCIP appointment, he held a career or career-conditional appointment in the same agency; (2) his failure to complete the internship successfully was for reasons unrelated to misconduct or suitability; and (3) he is an "employee" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 17; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the undisputed documentary evidence shows that the appellant would be unable to establish the first jurisdictional element because he did not hold a career or career-conditional appointment with the agency immediately prior to his FCIP appointment. Rather, the appellant held a term appointment under tenure group III in the competitive service. <span class="Italic">[S]ee</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.501(b) (tenure group III is reserved for employees who lack career or career-conditional status, such as those on term appointments); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.201(a) (an individual employed in the competitive service for other than temporary, term, or indefinite employment is appointed as a career or career-conditional employee).[3] In addition, prior to the effective date of his FCIP appointment, the appellant executed a document acknowledging that his failure to complete the internship successfully would result in the termination of his federal employment upon the expiration of his appointment, rather than placement in a career or career-conditional position at no lower grade or pay than the one he left. Although this document in itself is insufficient to establish the nature of the appellant's prior appointment, it is consistent with the other record evidence showing that it was not a career or career-conditional appointment. Because the appellant did not hold a career or career-conditional appointment in the agency immediately prior to his FCIP appointment, he was not entitled to placement under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6)(ii) when the agency decided not to convert his appointment. <span class="Italic">See Scull</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-17; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(7). Therefore, the Board lacks jurisdiction over his termination appeal. <span class="Italic">See Scull</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We need not decide in the instant appeal whether the term "career or career-conditional appointment" as used in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6)(ii) refers only to competitive service appointments under 5 C.F.R. part 315, or whether it also encompasses "career-type" excepted service appointments with equivalent tenure. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 317.304(a)(2), 334.102 (definition of "employee"), 351.502(b)(2)(i)-(ii), 412.302(d)(5).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit also determined that the lapse of an FCIP appointment did not create a Board appeal right, <span class="Italic">Rocha v. MSPB</span>, 688 F.3d 1307, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the board correctly determined, moreover, it would have had no jurisdiction over Rocha's appeal even if his petition for review had been timely filed. "The jurisdiction of the MSPB is not plenary, but is limited to those areas specifically granted by statute or regulation." <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); <span class="Italic">Forest v. Merit Sys.

Not every personnel action is considered an "adverse action" that can be appealed to the board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. Under the FCIP program, interns were appointed for a term of two years, but their appointments could be extended for up to one year. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(7). In 2008, Rocha was appointed to a two-year term, which was extended for four months due to the fact that he was placed on leave without pay status during 2008 and 2009. When Rocha's appointment expired in July 2010, the State Department had the <span class="Italic">option</span> of converting his position to the competitive service. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Rocha, however, had no right to further federal employment when his FCIP appointment ended. Accordingly, the State Department's decision not to convert his appointment to a competitive service position was not an "adverse action" appealable to the board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(11) (providing that appealable adverse actions do not include the "[t]ermination of [an] appointment on the expiration date specified as a basic condition of employment at the time the appointment was made"); <span class="Italic">see also Scull v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287, 291 (2010) (emphasizing that "an FCIP intern's termination upon the expiration of his appointment is generally not an adverse action appealable to the Board because it merely carries out the terms of the appointment").</p>

However, the Board has recognized an exception to this general rule. An FCIP intern may establish jurisdiction over her termination upon the expiration of her FCIP appointment by showing by preponderant evidence that: (1) she held a career or career-conditional appointment in the same agency immediately prior to her FCIP appointment; (2) her failure to complete the internship successfully was for reasons unrelated to misconduct or suitability; and (3) she is an 'employee' within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_236"></span>The appellant is mistaken in his contention that it would be "impossible" to prove that the agency's non-conversion decision was for reasons unrelated to misconduct. The required showing is analogous to, and no more onerous than, a showing of pretext in the Title VII context, in that the appellant must establish by preponderant evidence that the agency's proffered reason for his non-conversion, i.e., his alleged assault on Hebreo, was not the real reason for the agency's decision. The appellant may accomplish this task in any number of ways, including, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, by proving that the agency's decision was more likely based on another reason, e.g., performance deficiencies, or by showing that the agency's explanation is unworthy of credence. <span class="Italic">Cf. Wickramasekera v. Veterans Administration,</span> 21 M.S.P.R. 707, 713 (1984) (citing <span class="Italic">Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 256 (1981)). In addition, an appellant will not always be required to disprove the agency's stated reasons for the non-conversion because sometimes those reasons are clearly unrelated to misconduct or suitability. Some FCIP non-conversions are simply the result of performance deficiencies and are explained as such in the non-conversion letters and accompanying SF-50s.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Locklear v. Dept. of Navy,</span> DC-0752-11-0165-I-1 (NP 6/30/2011), also explained that an FCIP appointment did not ripen into a career appointment when the agency failed to affirmatively make the conversion before expiration of the internship period:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge dismissed this appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding that although the agency acknowledged that the correct end date for the 120-day extension of the appellant's appointment under the Federal Career Intern Program (FCIP) was November 3, 2010, rather than November 4, 2010, the appellant's termination was not an appealable adverse action because he was separated upon the expiration of his 2-year internship plus the 120-day extension. The administrative judge held that the Board also lacked jurisdiction over the appeal because the appellant did not meet all of the criteria for jurisdiction set forth in <span class="Italic">Scull v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 17 (2010), including that immediately before his FCIP appointment he held a career or career-conditional appointment in the same agency. The administrative judge considered the fact that the agency erred by failing to separate the appellant until the day after the expiration of his FCIP internship but found that the agency's failure to officially separate the appellant until November 4, 2010, did not change the fact that the appellant's appointment expired as a condition of his employment on November 3, 2010. The administrative judge rejected the appellant's claim that he should have been converted automatically to a competitive service position, finding that service as a career intern confers no right to further employment upon expiration of the internship period, an FCIP appointment terminates as a condition of employment at the end of the internship period unless the intern satisfactorily completes the internship and meets all other requirements, and the agency did not find that the appellant satisfactorily completed the internship and did not convert him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts on review that he was noncompetitively converted when the agency failed to act at the end of the 2 years plus 120-day extended period because agency guidance "specifically provide[s] the appellant will be noncompetitively converted under 5 C.F.R. 315.712 effective on the date the two-year service requirement is met, or at the end of the extended period." The appellant contends that as of the 121st day of his extension, the only employment status he could have been in was that of a competitive service employee. The appellant further contends that, although the agency asserted that the appellant's performance was not acceptable, his official performance appraisal listed his rating of record as acceptable. Finally, the appellant claims that the agency improperly extended the appellant's FCIP appointment because its reason for doing so was not consistent with the established criteria in its guidance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the appellant's claim, the agency's guidance does not provide that conversions occur automatically if an agency fails to act at the end of the internship period. Rather, consistent with the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM's) regulations, the guidance clearly states that service as an intern shall confer no rights to further Federal employment in either the competitive or excepted service upon the expiration of the internship period, and that the appointment of a career intern expires at the end of the 2-year internship period, plus any extensions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6)-(7); <span class="Italic">see also Rivera v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 2011 MSPB 57, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (an FCIP appointment automatically terminates upon its expiration unless the agency takes affirmative steps to extend the appointment or convert it to the competitive service);<span class="Italic"> Scull</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 9 (the phrase "the career intern appointment terminates" in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(7) must be read as "the career intern's employment terminates"). The fact that the agency's guidance and OPM's regulations set forth the <span class="Italic">effective date</span> for conversions when the agency decides to convert an employee does not mean that they occur automatically upon the expiration of the internship period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant contends that the agency rated his performance as acceptable for the appraisal period from May 1, 2009, to April 30, 2010, the reason it did so was because it "lacked documentation" to rate him otherwise. In fact, the record includes evidence showing that the appellant's supervisor discussed his performance problems with him on several occasions before and after his performance appraisal rating. The FCIP regulations do not, in any event, tie conversion to an acceptable rating on a performance appraisal; rather, they provide that "[c]ompetitive civil service status may be granted to career interns who successfully complete their internships <span class="Italic">and</span> meet all qualification, suitability, and performance requirements." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6)(i) (emphasis added). Similarly, the appellant's claim that he must have been a competitive service employee on the 121st day of the extension period is not supported by the applicable law or regulations. As the Board held in <span class="Italic">Scull</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 14, the fact that an appellant may have remained on the agency's payroll in an approved leave status after the date of the expiration of the internship period "does not mean that the appellant could not have been terminated [due to expiration of the internship] while he was on leave." Although the appellant challenges the agency's decision to extend his internship period by 120 days in order to provide him with an additional opportunity to improve his performance, he has identified no law, rule, or regulation that authorizes the Board to adjudicate whether such an extension was appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (the Board's jurisdiction is not plenary; it is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule or regulation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(11), one of the actions excluded from coverage under 5 C.F.R. part 752, subpart D is the "[t]ermination of appointment on the expiration date specified as a basic condition of employment at the time the appointment was made." Similar language is used in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(7), which provides that "[a]s a condition of employment, the appointment of a career intern expires at the end of the 2-year internship period, plus any extension." Thus, even assuming that the appellant was an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C), the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal because no appealable adverse action was taken against him. <span class="Italic">See Scott v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 434, &#x00B6; 9 (2010);<span class="Italic"> Scull</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 10 ("[T]he appellant's status as an employee with adverse action appeal rights has no bearing on the question of whether he was actually subjected to an adverse action within the Board's jurisdiction."). Moreover, we note that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6)(i), which provides that competitive civil service status "may" be granted to career interns, implies that the agency has discretion to grant or deny competitive civil service status, not that such status will be granted automatically upon expiration of the internship period. <span class="Italic">See Contreras v. United States</span>, 64 Fed. Cl. 583, 593 (2005) (the proper inference drawn from the distinction between "may" and "shall" in the same statute strengthens the presumption that "may" is discretionary); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6)(ii) (using the mandatory "shall be placed" in a career or career-conditional position for those career interns who held such a position immediately before entering the FCIP in the same agency and who failed to complete the FCIP for reasons unrelated to misconduct or suitability).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That the appellant had sufficient service to be qualified as an employee with appeal rights did not give the Board jurisdiction over the appellant's termination at the end of a FCIP appointment when there was no conversion to the competitive service, <span class="Italic">Osgood v. DHS,</span> DE-3443-10-0155-I-1 (NP 5/4/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a preference eligible serving in an excepted service appointment under the Federal Career Intern Program (FCIP) as a Border Patrol Agent for the agency's Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, filed a Board appeal in which he asserted that the agency improperly removed him without affording him due process. The administrative judge correctly determined that, at the time of his termination, the appellant was an employee with the right to appeal an adverse action to the Board under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75. Nevertheless, the appellant's status as an employee with adverse action appeal rights has no bearing on the question of whether he was actually subjected to an adverse action within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Scull v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 10 (2010)<span class="Italic">.</span> The Board has consistently held that where, as here, an expiration date of an appointment is specified as a basic condition of employment, the expiration of the appointment is not an adverse action appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">Endermuhle v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 495, &#x00B6; 9 (2001); <span class="Italic">see Scull,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 7. Further, where an intern is not converted at the end of the internship period, his FCIP appointment generally terminates with no further right to federal employment. <span class="Italic">Scull,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 6; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6)-(7). The appellant's reliance on the "tour of duty rule" promulgated for the competitive service by the Office of Personnel Management at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.804(b) is misplaced, as that rule is inapplicable in the context of a term appointment, such as the FCIP appointment in this case. In the absence of an otherwise appealable action, the Board lacks jurisdiction to hear the appellant's claims that the agency's actions violated his due process rights or breached the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See <span id="Page_237"></span>Smith v. Department of Defense</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 228, &#x00B6; 13 (2007). Therefore, the Board lacks jurisdiction over his termination appeal. <span class="Italic">See Scull</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 17.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Penaflor v. DHS,</span> SF-0752-10-0653-I-1 (NP 4/27/2011), concluded that the appellant's termination upon the expiration of his FCIP appointment did not become an appealable adverse action because of alleged deficiencies in the FCIP program:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant reiterates his argument from below that the FCIP is an invalid hiring authority, and therefore his termination upon the expiration of his FCIP appointment must be treated as an adverse action appealable to the Board. Specifically, he contends that: absent the FCIP, he would have been hired as a CBPO in the competitive service; and, had he been hired in this fashion, he would have had a right to appeal his removal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board deals in facts, not speculation. The appellant's assertion that he would have received a competitive service appointment as a CBPO absent the FCIP is pure speculation. The facts are that: (1) the appellant was appointed to his position as a CBPO under the FCIP for a two-year period, upon the expiration of which he had the potential to be noncompetitively converted to a permanent appointee or terminated; and (2) the agency did not convert the appellant at the end of that period. The Board has held that where an intern is not converted at the end of the internship period, his FCIP appointment generally terminates with no further right to federal employment. <span class="Italic">Scull v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 6 (2010); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6)-(7). Therefore, we discern no error in the administrative judge's finding that the appellant was not subjected to an adverse action appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Scull</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Cowan v. Dept. of Interior,</span> DE-0752-10-0066-C-2 (NP 9/30/2011) ("The regulations are also clear that service as a career intern generally confers no rights to further federal employment upon the expiration of the internship period. <span class="Italic">Scull</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6) (2011).

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Garcia v. DHS,</span> DA-0752-10-0349-I-1 (NP 1/21/2011), provides an example of the return to a career appointment of an FCIP participant with prior federal service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The termination of a Federal Career Internship Program (FCIP) appointment on its expiration date, like the appellant's appointment herein, does not constitute an adverse action appealable to the Board under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75. <span class="Italic">Scull v.

Further, it is clear from the record that upon the appellant's termination from her FCIP appointment, the agency properly placed her in a career appointment that is not lower in grade or pay to the position she held immediately before entering the FCIP. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6)(ii). Moreover, the agency did not take any other action against the appellant. Lastly, because the appellant alleged no other appealable action, the Board is without jurisdiction to consider her claims of discrimination and retaliation for using leave pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Lua v.
