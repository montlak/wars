<p class="Body-Text">Assuming an impaired employee and a connection between the impairment and the events leading to adverse action, the next issue is whether the employee is a "qualified" disabled employee entitled to accommodation. The term "qualified" refers to the nature of the misconduct. If the misconduct is serious or repugnant to the essential mission of the agency, the Board may conclude the employee is unsuitable for employment, disqualified for accommodation, and subject to discipline up to and including removal. Even a qualified disabled employee may be disciplined short of removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The interplay among misconduct, the definition of a qualified disabled employee, and an alcoholism defense was considered in <span class="Italic">Hougens v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 135, 140-51 (1988). Appellant, a postal inspector, was charged with an off-duty incident involving misuse of a firearm. Appellant appealed his demotion to a position that did not require him to carry a firearm. Reconsidering some of its earlier decisions, the Board concluded that accommodation is inappropriate for a serious or "disqualifying" offense and that some discipline is appropriate for a lesser offense committed by an employee who is given the opportunity to undergo rehabilitation. The type of misconduct that, standing alone, disqualifies a federal employee from his position is that "which, by its very nature, strikes at the core of the job or the agency's mission, or is so egregious or notorious that an employee's ability to perform his duties or to represent the agency is hampered." Where criminal or other serious misconduct relates directly to a fundamental requirement of his position, the employee is no longer otherwise qualified, and the discipline imposed cannot reasonably be regarded as disability discrimination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Introduction</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of Federal court decisions interpreting and applying the Rehabilitation Act to Federal employees,[2] the issuance of Executive Order 12564, 51 Fed. Reg. 32889-91 (1986),[3] and the Board's obligation to provide guidance in applying <span class="Italic">Ruzek v. General Services</span> <span class="Italic">Administration,</span> 7 MSPB 307, 7 MSPR 437 (1981), to misconduct cases where Federal employees raise the affirmative defense of discrimination based on drug addiction or alcoholism, the Board has deemed it appropriate to examine and reconsider its existing precedents.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., Richardson v. United States Postal Service,</span> 613 F. Supp. 1213 (D.D.C. 1985); <span class="Italic">Swann v. Walters</span>, 620 F. Supp. 741 (D.D.C. 1984); <span class="Italic">Wimbley v. Bolger</span>, 642 F. Supp. 481 (W.D. Tenn. 1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd without opinion,</span> 831 F.2d 298 (6th Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Section 5(b) of Executive Order 12564 provides that "[a] gencies shall initiate action to discipline any employees found to use illegal drugs." Section 5(d) further provides that discipline is not required if the employee voluntarily identifies his drug use, obtains counseling, and thereafter refrains from using illegal drugs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Appellant's Burden to Prove Handicap Condition</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We began in <span class="Italic">McCaffrey v. United States Postal Service,</span> 36 MSPR 224 (1988), where we considered the type of drug or alcohol use covered by the Rehabilitation Act[4] or the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Acts.[5] These statutes require that agencies offer accommodation and rehabilitation to alcoholics rather than casual drinkers, and drug addicts rather than users.[6] Because the Board cannot assume that a person who has used drugs is an addict any more than we can assume that a person who has used liquor is an alcoholic, we set forth a minimum evidentiary standard of drug addiction or alcoholism that must be met before an appellant can claim entitlement to accommodation. Thus, we made clear in <span class="Italic">McCaffrey</span> that isolated or casual use of drugs or alcohol by appellants claiming handicap discrimination would be insufficient alone to overturn otherwise warranted agency discipline for failure to accommodate alleged drug addiction or alcoholism. 36 MSPR at 228-30.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;29 USC &#x00A7; 791 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span></p>

Reg. 22686 (May 4, 1977). The Abuse Acts refer to "alcohol abuse and alcoholism," 42 USC &#x00A7; 290dd-1(a)(1), (b)(1), and to "drug abuse," 42 USC &#x00A7; 290ee-1(a)(1), (b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Causal Connection Between Basis for Agency Action and Handicap Condition</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Brinkley v. Veterans Administration,</span> 37 MSPR 682 (1988), we found the Rehabilitation Act's proscription of discrimination against a "handicapped individual...solely by reason of his handicap" to be inapplicable to employee misconduct that is not itself the concurrent product of mental or physical impairment caused by drug addiction or alcoholism. Absent any connection between the alleged handicap and the employee's misconduct, the agency's discipline is imposed because of the independent acts of misconduct, not solely because the agency regarded the employee as an addict or an alcoholic, providing, of course, that the rules of conduct or performance apply to and are enforced against all employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Acts Which May Disqualify a Handicapped Individual</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case we consider whether, even though the appellant meets the <span class="Italic">McCaffrey</span> evidentiary standard of alcoholism to claim entitlement to accommodation and shows, as required by <span class="Italic">Brinkley</span>, that his misconduct is the concurrent product of mental or physical impairment caused by alcoholism, serious misconduct committed under the direct influence of drug abuse or alcoholism can nonetheless disqualify a handicapped employee from being able to perform the essential functions of the position in question and thereby obviate an agency's duty to offer accommodation. Before we reach this question, we first assume, without deciding, that the appellant has met his burden of proof under <span class="Italic">McCaffrey,</span> and that the appellant was sufficiently under the influence of alcohol at the time of the firearms incident for which he was demoted to establish the causal connection required by our <span class="Italic">Brinkley</span> decision.[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;The administrative judge did not make findings on the causal connection between the appellant's alcoholism and the firearms incident. The appellant testified he had no recollection of firing the weapon, and that he had 6 to 12 drinks during the 12-hour period prior to this incident. He admitted owning the weapon without a state or local firearms permit, and did not deny taking it to the bar. On this record, we find that the appellant was intoxicated at the time of the shooting incident. However, the agency's sustained charges include the appellant's unlicensed possession of the Beretta automatic, as well as the actual firing of the weapon. There is no evidence that the appellant's alcoholism caused him to obtain and carry the weapon in violation of state gun registration laws. Hence, the appellant's misconduct may not satisfy the <span class="Italic">Brinkley</span> standard <span class="Italic">in toto.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Applicability of the Rehabilitation and Abuse Acts in Cases of Serious Misconduct</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board holds that there are certain acts of misconduct which, when committed by an employee who is an alcoholic or drug addict, take that employee outside the scope of the protecting legislation because the misconduct renders that person not a "qualified" handicapped individual.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Richardson v. United States Postal Service,</span> 613 F. Supp. 1213 (D.D.C. 1985), the court ruled that the Rehabilitation Act does not insulate Federal employees from discipline when their misconduct "disqualifies" them from Federal service. There, a Postal Service employee was terminated after pleading guilty to a criminal assault and weapons charge. The Postal Service Code of Ethical Conduct specified that a criminal conviction may be grounds for disciplinary action. Richardson asserted he had been an alcoholic for years, that he had been drinking heavily prior to the assault incident, that the Postal Service knew of his alcohol problem, and that his termination constituted discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act. The court rejected Richardson's claim, stating at 1216:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The [Rehabilitation] Act does not create a duty to accommodate an alcoholic who is not "otherwise qualified" <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, commits an act which standing alone disqualifies him from service and is not entirely a manifestation of alcohol abuse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An "otherwise qualified" individual with a handicap is one who, despite his handicap, is technically, physically, mentally, emotionally, and morally fit to perform the duties of his position. When the agency proves that the appellant's misconduct, standing alone, disqualifies the appellant from his position because it impacts on one of these elements of performance, the Board will sustain the action even in the absence of an opportunity to rehabilitate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Copeland v. Philadelphia Police Department</span>, 840 F.2d 1139 (3d Cir. 1988), the circuit court considered whether the phrase "otherwise qualified" in &#x00A7; 504 of the Rehabilitation Act applies to all aspects of an employee's job, including "moral" qualifications, or merely to the physical requirements.[9] The circuit court agreed with the district court that Copeland's termination for marijuana use did not violate the Rehabilitation Act. Although the appellant could perform the physical aspects of his policeman position, the police department owed no duty of reasonable accommodation to a police officer who tested positive for drug use and whose retention "would cast doubt upon the integrity of the police force." 840 F.2d at 1149.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;Section 504 provides in relevant part as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">No otherwise qualified individual with handicaps...shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">29 USC &#x00A7; 794.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Spragg v. Campbell,</span> 466 F. Supp. 658 (D.S.D. 1979), the court held that an electrician, whose job required driving and who was terminated for driving a government vehicle while intoxicated resulting in a serious accident, was not removed solely because of alcohol abuse, but rather <span id="Page_3544"></span>because the incident showed that he was unable to perform all of the essential duties of his electrician position. Because the electrician's behavior endangered the health and safety of himself and others, the court agreed with the agency that he "was unable to properly perform the duties of his position." 466 F. Supp. at 661.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Qualification for Federal service includes all aspects of one's ability to act consistently with the public trust and in a manner that promotes the efficiency of the public service. For this reason, we hold that the affirmative action requirement of &#x00A7; 501 of the Rehabilitation Act does not shield Federal employees from uniformly applied discipline for breaches of the public trust of sufficient severity and type to disqualify them from Federal public service or service in their position and that this result is fully consistent with the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Acts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The type of misconduct that, standing alone, disqualifies a Federal employee from his position is that which, by its very nature, strikes at the core of the job or the agency's mission, or is so egregious or notorious that an employee's ability to perform his duties or to represent the agency is hampered.[10] <span class="Italic">Cf.

<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Section 504</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 protects any "otherwise qualified" individual from discrimination because of a major life inhibiting handicap in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance or conducted by an executive agency including the Postal Service. During the debates over the 1978 amendments to the Rehabilitation Act, Senator Williams, the floor manager of the bill in the Senate, stated that "individuals with handicaps can be held to the same performance standards that an employer demands of all employees." 124 Cong. Rec. 30323 (Sept. 20, 1978).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This view had been the uniform interpretation of the original 1973 Rehabilitation Act by the Justice Department and the former Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW). The Attorney General Opinion, concluding that alcoholics and drug addicts were "individuals with handicaps" within the Rehabilitation Act, also stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Nor do we read the Act to prevent the application to persons suffering from alcoholism or drug addiction of reasonable rules of conduct, such as prohibition against the possession or use of alcohol or drugs on the location of the federally assisted project.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">43 Op.Atty.Gen. 12 (Apr. 12, 1977). Similarly the HEW regulations promulgated after enactment of the Rehabilitation Act provide as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[E]mployers may enforce rules prohibiting the possession or use of alcohol or drugs in the work-place, provided such rules are enforced against all employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">42 Fed. Reg. 22686 (1977).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The foregoing legislative and regulatory histories demonstrate that &#x00A7; 504 does not override any employer's obligation to apply disciplinary rules uniformly to employees whose misconduct renders them unsuitable to continue the performance of all of their essential job elements.[11] To be "otherwise qualified," an employee must be able to meet all of his job's requirements "in spite of" his handicap. <span class="Italic">Southeastern Community College v. Davis,</span> 442 U.S. 397, 406, 99 S. Ct. 2361, 2367, 60 L. Ed.2d 980 (1979). Where criminal or other serious misconduct relates directly to a fundamental requirement of his position, the employee is no longer otherwise qualified, and the discipline imposed cannot reasonably be regarded as handicap discrimination because the protection of &#x00A7; 504 extends only to otherwise qualified employees. As the Fourth Circuit has observed under &#x00A7; 504, "[t]he case law is clear that, if a handicapped employee cannot do his job, he can be fired...." <span class="Italic">Carter v. Tisch</span>, 822 F.2d 465, 466 (4th Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;For example, Federal agencies have applied and enforced with uniform judicial approval rules prohibiting employee possession or use of drugs whether on or off duty. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Sanders v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Section 501</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant is not a handicapped employee under &#x00A7; 504 because he was a current alcohol abuser and a Federal employee at the time of his misconduct, the policies underlying &#x00A7; 504 and the case law developed under &#x00A7; 504 discussed above, are directly relevant to &#x00A7; 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. As we show below, the same result obtains under &#x00A7; 501.[12] The requirement that a Federal employee be a "qualified handicapped person" before being entitled to the protection afforded by statute is found in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations. Section 1613.703, captioned "General Policy," provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Agencies shall give full consideration to the hiring, placement, and advancement of <span class="Italic">qualified</span> mentally and physically handicapped persons....&#8197;An agency shall not discriminate against a <span class="Italic">qualified</span> physically or mentally handicapped person.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.703 (emphasis supplied). The EEOC has defined a "qualified handicapped person" as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[A]&#x2003;handicapped person who, with or without reasonable accommodation can perform the essential functions of the position in question without endangering the health and safety of the individual or others....[13]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.703(f). These regulations impose at least minimum qualification requirements upon the &#x00A7; 501 affirmative action obligation. The term "qualified" in the foregoing EEOC regulations defines the reach of an agency's affirmative action program to ensure that individuals with handicaps are not excluded from positions whose essential performance requirements they can meet. Thus, an agency is not required to allow handicaps to be used as a means of exempting Federal employees and applicants from meeting essential job elements. Neither the text of &#x00A7; 501 nor the EEOC regulations require Federal agencies to extend affirmative action to unqualified handicapped job applicants or current employees. We conclude, then, that the absence of the word "otherwise" before "qualified" in the foregoing EEOC regulations does not render job and performance qualifications irrelevant in defining the scope of reasonable accommodation under the &#x00A7; 501 affirmative action obligation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;This provision obliges Federal employers to develop "an affirmative action program plan for the hiring, placement, and advancement of handicapped individuals...." 29 USC &#x00A7; 791(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13]&#x2003;29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.704(a) limits an agency's reasonable accommodation obligation to a "qualified handicapped applicant or employee," and 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.705(a) authorizes agencies to use job related selection criteria to screen "qualified handicapped persons."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is also well settled in Federal cases litigated under &#x00A7; 501 that Federal employees must establish their ability to perform all essential job functions, notwithstanding their handicap. <span class="Italic">Swann v. Walters,</span> 620 F. Supp. 741, 747 (D.D.C. 1984); <span class="Italic">Boyd v. United States</span> <span class="Italic">Postal Service,</span> 32 FEP Cases 1217, 1221 (W.D. Wash. 1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd on other grounds</span>, 752 F.2d 410 (9th Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the EEOC regulations also authorize Federal agencies to consider job qualification in light of the risk of "endangering the health and safety of the individual or others...." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.703(f). This regulatory provision is particularly relevant to our analysis in this case where the proven misconduct is of a nature that creates such a risk. In these circumstances, such an employee can no longer be considered "qualified" for service in his position under the regulation; and, a claim of handicap discrimination must fail since the employee now falls outside the scope of &#x00A7; 501. <span class="Italic">Swann v. Walters,</span> 620 F. Supp. at 747.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Alcohol and Drug Abuse Acts</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Alcohol Abuse Act of 1970 and the Drug Abuse Act of 1972 prohibit denial or deprivation of Federal civilian employment "solely on the ground of prior alcohol abuse or prior alcoholism or drug abuse." 42 USC &#x00A7; 290dd-1(b)(1), &#x00A7; 290ee-1(b)(1). Both Acts further provide that these prohibitions "[s]hall not be construed to prohibit the dismissal from employment of a Federal civilian employee who cannot properly function in his employment." 42 USC &#x00A7; 290dd-1(c), &#x00A7; 290ee-1(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The literal language of both Acts expressly authorizes dismissal of Federal employees "who cannot properly function in [their] employment." The legislative history indicates that agencies are specifically authorized to terminate employees who are current abusers and who refuse treatment.[14] The statutory prohibition of the Abuse Acts is narrow and specific. Only employment denials based "solely on the ground" of prior alcohol or drug abuse are statutorily prohibited. Thus, agency terminations of Federal employees alleging current drug or alcohol handicaps for serious misconduct are not <span class="Italic">per se</span> precluded by the Abuse Acts.[15]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[14]&#x2003;The legislative history of &#x00A7; 290dd-1(c) states as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This section will not prohibit the dismissal of a Federal civilian employee who refuses to accept appropriate treatment offered <span id="Page_3545"></span>to him and subsequently does not function properly in his employment.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Discipline As a Means of or In Connection With Reasonable Accommodation</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, the Board finds that a permanent demotion or downgrade to a position for which the employee is qualified, at the highest grade available, may constitute reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act. For example, an agency may demonstrate by medical or other expert evidence that retaining an alcoholic or drug addict in his current job, during rehabilitation, may not be reasonable or may impose an undue hardship on the agency under the circumstances of a particular case. Similarly, an agency may demonstrate that detailing such an employee on a temporary basis during rehabilitation, while retaining him in his current grade and pay level,[16] may not be reasonable or may constitute undue hardship to the agency under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See</span> FPM Letter 792-6 (Nov. 28, 1986). The Rehabilitation Act does not preclude such demotions or downgrades.[17]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[16]&#x2003;Whether the agency must provide pay and benefit equivalency is to be determined by agency regulation, cost, and other practical factors. An agency is not required to provide pay protection if it can show that to do so would be contrary to regulation or is otherwise unreasonable. 5 USC &#x00A7; 5363; 5 CFR Part 536.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[17]&#x2003;The Board infers from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's decision in <span class="Italic">Swank v. General Services Administration,</span> Petition No. 03870050 (June 11, 1987), that under some circumstances the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission may find that disciplinary action can constitute reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the Board herein makes a major departure from its previous precedent and now holds that an agency may impose reasonable discipline for any act of misconduct, short of removal, while at the same time affording the abusing employee an opportunity to rehabilitate. To the extent that <span class="Italic">Ruzek v. General Services Administration</span>, 7 MSPB 307, 7 MSPR 437 (1981), <span class="Italic">Booth v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services,</span> 23 MSPR 353 (1984), and similar cases prohibit an agency from imposing discipline on an employee while he engages in rehabilitative efforts, they are hereby overruled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Alcohol and Drug Abuse Acts and applicable regulations do not prohibit all discipline short of removal from being instituted while the agency affords an employee the opportunity to rehabilitate. The source of the "no-discipline" rule, FPM 792-2, Subchapter 1-2, has now been contradicted by the more recently promulgated FPM Letter 792-16, which interprets the President's Exec. Order No. 12564 (1986) (entitled "Drug Free Workplace"), and which does permit some discipline short of removal for abusers (other than those who voluntarily identify themselves as abusers), even while they are being rehabilitated. In overruling the "no-discipline" rule, the Board adopts the medically-recognized principle that one of the ways to help alcohol and drug abusers overcome their problem is to make them take responsibility for the consequences of their own actions.[18]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Application of Legal Principles to Facts of This Case</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Appellant Has Engaged in "Disqualifying Misconduct"</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the foregoing analysis and conclusions to the instant case, we find that the appellant's misconduct is so serious, and is of such a nature, as to disqualify him for service in his position as a Postal Inspector. We conclude, therefore, that the agency has no statutory obligation under the 1973 Rehabilitation Act, and/or the 1970 and 1972 Abuse Acts, to offer the appellant any accommodation prior to the imposition of discipline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here the appellant was an armed law enforcement official, a position requiring that he be held to a high degree of sound judgment and a higher standard of conduct. <span class="Italic">Quander v. Department of Justice</span>, 22 MSPR 419 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 770 F.2d 180 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The agency established that the appellant's misconduct of recklessly endangering the lives of others by pointing his automatic pistol at four unarmed persons and firing it at a fleeing person, despite the appellant's firearms training, strikes at the core responsibility of the Postal Inspector position. Because of such conduct, which relates directly to an essential requirement of the appellant's position, we find that the agency was fully justified in concluding that it no longer had confidence that the appellant could meet the essential requirements of his job to exercise good judgment in the use of firearms and to act in consonance with the agency's concern for the safeguard of other postal employees, postal customers, and the general public. Moreover, the Postal Inspector position requires a willingness to abide by the rules. The appellant's misconduct of violating agency firearms policy by carrying a concealed automatic weapon not licensed by the state further violates the basic tenets of reliability required by one who performs the duties of this position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find, under the <span class="Italic">Richardson</span> standard, that the appellant's misconduct was "not entirely a manifestation of alcohol abuse." 613 F. Supp. at 1216. The appellant was fully able to walk out of the bar before the pistol firing incident and he walked home immediately thereafter. He also testified that he was aware he pulled out the automatic pistol, that he saw the four men run away when he did so, and that he recognized two of the four men outside the bar. On this record, we conclude that the appellant's cognitive and physical faculties were not so impaired by alcohol as to deprive him of all understanding of the risk of serious harm inherent in firing his automatic pistol at an unarmed person. Accordingly, we conclude that the agency properly held the appellant responsible for this reckless act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Demotion Is a Reasonable Accommodation</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, an absence of disqualifying misconduct and thus that the appellant is a qualified handicapped person entitled to reasonable accommodation, we also agree with the agency's claim that it is unreasonable to require placement of the appellant in his Postal Inspector position pending rehabilitation. The agency introduced medical opinion evidence advising that the appellant not encumber a position requiring him to carry a loaded firearm for 12 to 18 months, and that his chances of recovery would be greater if he were not placed in the Postal Inspector position because of its attendant stress, lack of supervision, and irregular hours. In reliance upon this uncontroverted testimony, we find the agency's attempt to accommodate the appellant in another less stressful, less critical position is reasonable and even advisable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency demoted the appellant so as to assure him an income while he underwent rehabilitation. Assuming, without finding, that the appellant is a qualified handicapped person and entitled to accommodation, the Board finds that some discipline, short of removal, is nonetheless appropriate. Additionally, the Board notes that agencies are not proscribed from affording accommodation even though the employee is not entitled to it under the Rehabilitation or Abuse Acts. In the circumstances here, the agency retained its managerial discretion to accommodate the appellant through demotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Agency Has Proven Undue Burden</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if we were to assume, for the sake of argument, that the appellant's demand for reinstatement to his former position satisfied his burden of articulating a reasonable accommodation, based on the same medical evidence discussed above, we conclude that the agency has met its burden of showing that the accommodation suggested would impose an undue burden upon it because of the risk to public safety.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Demotion Is a Reasonable Penalty</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, even assuming that the appellant is a qualified handicapped person, the agency was entitled to impose some discipline, and in this case the penalty of demotion is reasonable. Demotion of a law enforcement official for serious misconduct is clearly within the realm of reason, particularly when, as here, it results in life-threatening situations. Further, one of the sustained charges, carrying a concealed weapon, was not shown to have been caused by alcoholism. Some discipline, therefore, is warranted regardless of the other charge. Accordingly, we sustain the agency's action in demoting the appellant to an Investigative Program Analyst.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">CONCLUSION</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, based upon the above legal analysis and application to the facts of this case, the Board finds that: (1) Assuming that the appellant is handicapped by the condition of alcoholism, and that there was a causal connection between his condition and the misconduct which formed the basis of the agency's demotion action, the appellant is not a "qualified handicapped person"; (2) the appellant has disqualified himself for service in his position as a Postal Inspector by virtue of the seriousness and nature of his proven misconduct, discharging an unauthorized and unlicensed firearm in the direction of another person, which is directly related to the appellant's job responsibilities and negatively impacts <span id="Page_3546"></span>upon the agency's mission; (3) the agency has no statutory obligation under the Rehabilitation or Abuse Acts to offer the appellant reasonable accommodation and an opportunity to rehabilitate because the appellant is not a "qualified handicapped person"; (4) assuming that the appellant is a "qualified handicapped person," the agency has proven by medical evidence that it would be unreasonable to require it to maintain the appellant in his former position, in his current condition, while he undergoes rehabilitative efforts; (5) under the circumstances of this case, a permanent demotion does constitute a form of reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation and Abuse Acts; (6) the agency has proven that it would be an undue burden for it to maintain the appellant in his former position because of the risk to the safety of other employees, and the general public; (7) even assuming that the appellant is a "qualified handicapped person," the agency is, nonetheless, entitled to impose on him some discipline, short of removal; and (8) the demotion penalty selected by the agency in this case is well within the bounds of reasonableness and is sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The significance of <span class="Italic">Hougens</span> lies in the ability of the agency to show that some misconduct is so serious that the employee can be dismissed because he is not a qualified disabled employee. Less serious misconduct permits the employee to be considered a qualified disabled employee, but it also supports discipline short of removal. <span class="Italic">See Agnew v. USPS</span>, NY-0353-14-0337-I-1 (NP 12/22/2016) ("Even if the appellant were able to prove that he was disabled because of a drug problem, the disability would not have precluded the agency from removing him based upon his misconduct. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Burton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 115, &#x00B6; 16 (2009) (explaining that the Americans with Disabilities Act does not immunize disabled employees from discipline for misconduct, provided the agency would impose the same discipline on an employee without a disability); <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6; 4 (2000) (recognizing that an agency is never required to excuse a disabled employee's violation of a uniformly-applied, job-related rule of conduct, even if the employee's disability caused the misconduct).")</p>
