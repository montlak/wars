<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-256"><span class="space">4.</span> Method, Scope of MSPB Review</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The procedural device used to obtain review of an arbitrator's decision is a "request for review." <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">De Bow v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 97 MSPR 5 (2004). In cases involving agencies other than the Postal Service, the Board reviews an arbitrator's decision on the record. 5 CFR 1201.155 (2022), quoted earlier, states the procedures governing review of arbitration awards (other than those involving Postal Service employees) by the Board's central office staff. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ariza v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 36 MSPR 54, 55 n.1 (1988) ("Employee appeals from grievance decisions properly are reviewed by the full Board and not by administrative judges at the Board's regional offices."). If the appeal is docketed with a regional office, the case should be forwarded by the region to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brent v. DOJ</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/BRENT_DENISE_AT_0752_05_0514_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_250963.pdf">100 MSPR 586</a>, 589-90 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (2005) (noting that the appellant's erroneous filing with the regional office stops the clock as to the 30 days allowed to seek review under 5 CFR 1201.154(d) (2005));<span class="Italic"> see</span> <span class="Italic">Dobruck v. VA</span>, 102 MSPR 578, 583 &#x00B6; 8, 2006 MSPB 213 (2006) (request for review of an arbitrator's award that was filed with the regional Board office should have been forwarded to the MSPB Clerk and considered filed when it was filed with the region).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Review of an arbitration award does not involve a <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">novo</span> hearing, a result reached by the Board on the bases of statutory interpretation, consideration of the traditional functions of arbitration, and the statutory right for a <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">novo</span> hearing in federal district court on EEO issues. <span class="Italic">Robinson v. DHHS</span>, 30 MSPR 389, 392-95 (1986), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 31 MSPR 479, 481 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Army</span>, 57 MSPR 203, 209 n.5 (1993) (Board does not conduct <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of an arbitration decision; the Board declined to review evidence pertaining to disability discrimination that was not before the arbitrator); <span class="Italic">Fryc v. VA</span>, 38 MSPR 360, 362 (1988) (appellant's request for review presented reasons why the agency decision removing him was improper when the appellant essentially requested <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of his appeal by the Board). If the arbitrator supplies the wrong reasoning in support of his conclusion concerning an EEO claim, the Board examines the record to determine if the arbitrator reached the right result. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cloutterbuck v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 85 MSPR 684, 688-89 &#x00B6; 10 (2000). An exception occurs if the Board directs factfinding by one of its AJs on an issue of discrimination that was not adequately developed by the arbitrator. [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-12-252.html#sec5-251">Remand for Resolution of EEO Issue</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cockrell v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 58 MSPR 211, 214 n.2 (1993), explained as to hearing entitlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has requested a hearing on the issues raised in her request for review. However, the appellant has already been afforded a hearing, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the arbitration proceeding, to present documentary and testimonial evidence in support of her claims. In effect, the appellant is asking the Board to undertake a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of her appeal. Appellants are not entitled, however, to a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review by the Board of a final arbitration award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fryc v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board has jurisdiction to review an arbitrator's decision under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d) when the subject matter of the grievance is one over which the Board has jurisdiction, the appellant has alleged discrimination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) in connection with the underlying action, and a final decision has been issued. <span class="Italic">Sadiq v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board may rely on the <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> analysis to avoid extensive review. In <span class="Italic">Leamon v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 189, 192 (1986), the appellant requested Board review of an arbitrator's findings concerning a disability discrimination defense to an adverse action and the Board concluded that "the appellant has not submitted any new evidence or identified any evidence of record establishing error on the part of the arbitrator in reaching his decision," without any intermediate findings or analysis. Without analysis of the arbitration decision or underlying facts, an award was affirmed in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 31 MSPR 383, 385 (1986), that denied reinstatement to an employee who claimed disability discrimination resulting from alcoholism. The same result was reached in <span class="Italic">Bardill</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, with the Board affirming in a conclusory fashion the arbitrator's conclusion that the appellant failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case because she did not support the discrimination claim by evidence or documentation and because there was justification for taking the action against her. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bohannon v.

<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Appling v.

But under <span class="Italic">Appling,</span> for the Board to defer to an arbitrator's findings and conclusions, the award must include specific findings on the issues in question. Without these conclusions, the Board cannot determine either whether the arbitrator considered and decided a contention or whether the arbitrator failed to adjudicate essential elements of the case. If the arbitrator's findings on issues are insufficient, the case will not usually be remanded to the arbitrator (although there may be exceptions); instead, the Board will decide the issues on the basis of documents submitted with the request for review. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Moore v.

<p class="Body-Text">An arbitrator is presumed to consider evidence presented, <span class="Italic">Clayton v. VA</span>, CB-7121-18-0005-V-1 (NP 12/21/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Furthermore, even assuming that the appellant disputed the reasonableness of his performance standards before the arbitrator, the appellant is essentially arguing that the arbitrator ignored certain evidence in reaching his conclusion. However, the arbitrator's failure to mention all of the evidence of record does not mean that he did not consider it in reaching his decision, <span class="Italic">Gustave-Schmidt v. Department of Labor</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 667, &#x00B6; 10 (2001), and this omission does not mean that his decision is contrary to civil service law, rule, or regulation, <span class="Italic">Benson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 548, 554 (1994). The Board has found that an argument that an arbitrator ignored certain evidence relates only to the arbitrator's factual findings and conclusions and does not demonstrate legal error. <span class="Italic">Moore v. Department of Commerce</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 451, 458 (1992). Thus, we find the appellant's arguments regarding the agency's case in chief unpersuasive and we discern no basis to disturb the arbitrator's conclusion that the agency satisfied the above-articulated legal standard by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order for the Board to provide deference to an arbitrator's findings and conclusions, the award must include specific findings on the issues in question. <span class="Italic">Appling v. Social Security Administration,</span> 30 M.S.P.R. 375, 379 (1986). When an arbitrator fails to address all material issues, the Board will "examine the request for review, and the pertinent documents accompanying the request, to determine whether resolution of the material issues not addressed in the arbitration decision renders the award contrary to law, rule, or regulation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Further, resolution of these issues at the Board level may be preferable to remanding the case to the arbitrator, which may unnecessarily delay a final resolution of the case and may add to the cost of adjudication, contrary to the inherent advantages of arbitration. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Although the Board has recognized that "these considerations may be outweighed under circumstances and remand would then be appropriate," <span class="Italic">see id.,</span> the Board's general practice, which we follow here, has been to resolve discrimination and retaliation issues at the Board level, rather than remanding, when the arbitrator fails to address those issues. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Godesky,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 280, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-14; <span class="Italic">Butler v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit has not imposed on arbitrators the Board's regulatory requirements governing the content and format of decisions of AJs, <span class="Italic">Webb v. Federal Bureau of Prisons</span>, 269 Fed. Appx. 977, 979 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By choosing arbitration, Webb selected "a dispute resolution method that is generally faster, cheaper, and less formal than litigation." <span class="Italic">Wissman</span>, 848 F.2d at 177-78 (internal quotation omitted). With these advantages of arbitration, however, "also come some disadvantages associated with the alacrity and informality with which arbitration proceedings are conducted." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 178. In particular, although an arbitrator must follow the same substantive rules as the Board in reviewing an agency disciplinary action, an arbitrator is not bound by the Board's internal procedural regulations. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also Bloomer v. Dep't of Health and Human Servs.</span>, 966 F.2d 1436, 1439 (Fed. Cir. 1992) ("An arbitrator is not bound by rules of the Board which relate to the Board's own internal procedures.... However, an arbitrator is bound by Board procedures relating to conditions of an appeal.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, Webb argues that the Arbitrator's decision denying his grievance should be vacated for failure to comply with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.111(b)(1). Section 1201.111(b)(1) is a Board regulation which requires that an administrative judge's initial decision must contain "[f]indings of fact and conclusions of law upon all the material issues of fact and law presented on the record." Because &#x00A7; 1201.111(b)(1) only applies to the form of the initial decision, it is neither a substantive regulation nor a condition of an appeal, but rather an internal procedural regulation of the Board. Accordingly, the Arbitrator was not bound to comply with &#x00A7; 1201.111(b)(1). <span class="Italic">See Bloomer</span>, 966 F.2d at 1439; <span class="Italic">see also Wissman</span>, 848 F.2d at 178 (holding that, absent a contractual or statutory obligation, an arbitrator is not required to set forth an arbitration award in a specific form).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But if the arbitrator errs in applying Board standards of evidentiary analysis, the appellant's review request may succeed, <span class="Italic">Tatsis v. DHUD</span>, CB-7121-16-0003-V-1 (NP 6/16/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged that she orally requested a reasonable accommodation from her former supervisor, V.C., in January 2013, more than a year and a half before she was placed on the PIP. During <span id="Page_1842"></span>the arbitration hearing, the appellant apparently testified that, during a telephone conversation with V.C. (who was deceased at the time of the hearing), she informed V.C. of her medical issues. The arbitrator found that the appellant's testimony regarding the telephone conversation, "with no further follow up," was insufficient proof of a request for reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the arbitrator did not clearly articulate the factual or legal basis for this finding, it appears that he summarily discounted the appellant's testimony, which was seemingly uncontradicted, primarily on the basis that there was no documentary evidence to corroborate the testimony.

<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant contends that the arbitrator's conclusion on an issue of discrimination is incorrect, even though the analysis of the arbitrator is not extensive, it is the appellant's burden to point out evidence establishing the allegation of discrimination before the award will be disturbed. <span class="Italic">Denson v. VA</span>, 30 MSPR 383, 386 (1986). Disagreement with the arbitrator's factual findings and conclusions constitutes "mere disagreement" not meriting review. <span class="Italic">Sandoval v.

Dept. of Air Force</span>, 46 MSPR 6, 8 (1990), distinguishes deference to an arbitrator's factual determinations and review of his legal analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The scope of the Board's review of arbitration decisions is limited. Unlike initial decisions subject to Board review under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115, arbitration decisions are entitled to deference, and will be modified or set aside only where the arbitrator has erred as a matter of law in interpreting civil service law, rules, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Robinson v.

The arbitrator's finding of handicap discrimination <span class="Italic">vel non</span> in this case is thus a factual determination entitled to deference, unless the arbitrator erred in his legal analysis, e.g., by misallocating burdens of proof or employing the wrong analytical framework.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of her assertion that her removal resulted from the agency's failure to accommodate her handicap, the appellant makes two objections to the arbitrator's decision. First, she contends that the arbitrator failed to consider psychiatric evaluations contrary to those relied upon by the agency. Second, she contends that the arbitrator erred in finding that the appellant's physical impairment (hip injury) was unrelated to the agency's charges of misconduct. Since both of these objections relate only to the arbitrator's factual findings and conclusions, which are entitled to deference, the appellant's assignments of error provide no basis on which to set aside or modify the arbitrator's decision. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Army,</span> 31 MSPR 383, 385 (1986).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">An appellant's complaint that the arbitrator did not understand the significance of certain evidence is the fault of the appellant for not adequately establishing the importance of the exhibit, not a circumstance warranting reopening of the hearing or reversal of the award. <span class="Italic">Macias v. SSA</span>, 31 MSPR 239, 241-42 (1986). The Board has not explained what it will do if the arbitrator's decision cannot be understood well enough to warrant deference. The Board acknowledged that one award was "murky," but then provided different readings of the award, each reading justifying the Board's conclusion that the award was not erroneous as to the conclusions on the appellant's EEO allegations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Beach v. DHHS</span>, 32 MSPR 409, 410-11 (1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cook v. EEOC</span>, 50 MSPR 660, 661-62 (1991), analyzed a challenge to an arbitrator's award:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency demoted the appellant from the position of Investigator, GS-9, to the position of Clerk Typist, GS-4, based upon charges of unacceptable performance. The appellant challenged the propriety of this action by filing a grievance under the collective bargaining agreement. Following a hearing, an arbitrator denied the appellant's grievance and sustained the demotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her request for review of the arbitration decision, the appellant asserts that her performance standards were vague and subjective, that the agency did not communicate the standards to her and did not provide her with proper assistance, and that the agency discriminated against her on the basis of her race by treating her differently than a white employee. She also indicates that any demotion should have been to the GS-7 level, rather than the GS-4 level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d), the Board has authority to review an arbitrator's decision, if the employee has been affected by a prohibited personnel practice under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1), and if the action is otherwise appealable to the Board under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702. In the present case, the appellant satisfies these jurisdictional requirements because she has alleged that the agency action was based upon discrimination and her demotion under 5 USC Chapter 43 is otherwise appealable to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 30 MSPR 389, <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 31 MSPR 479 (1986), the Board held that its scope of review of arbitration decisions is limited, and that such a decision will be modified or set aside only if the appellant establishes that the arbitrator has erred in interpreting civil service law, rule or regulation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 392-95.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant asserts that her performance standards were vague and subjective, that the agency did not communicate the standards to her and did not provide her with proper assistance, she has not specifically referred to record evidence supporting these assertions, as required under 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.154(d)(2) and (d)(3). Further, we find that, rather than establishing that the arbitrator erred with respect to these issues, her bare assertions, unsupported by references to the record or even by argument, constitute mere disagreement with the arbitrator and do not provide a basis for modifying or setting aside the arbitration decision. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 31 MSPR 383, 385 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, with respect to the appellant's allegation of discrimination due to disparate treatment, we note that, although the arbitrator did not cite applicable case law, he specifically found that the appellant's assertion of disparate treatment was unpersuasive. In essence this is an implicit finding that the appellant failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and that the agency had a nondiscriminatory reason, poor performance, for taking the action. <span class="Italic">See Bardill v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 41 MSPR 599, 601-02 (1989). Moreover, insofar as the appellant argues the degree of her demotion, she presents no basis for review because neither the Board nor an arbitrator may mitigate an action taken under 5 USC Chapter 43....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gomez v. SSA</span>, 70 MSPR 257, 261-66 (1996), demonstrates the level of review that the Board may provide in a challenge to an award:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Arbitration awards are entitled to a greater degree of deference than initial decisions by the Board's administrative judges. <span class="Italic">Benson v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 548, 554 (1994); <span class="Italic">Bean</span>, 55 MSPR at 612. Thus, the Board will modify or set aside an arbitration award only where the arbitrator has erred as a matter of law in interpreting civil service law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Benson</span>, 65 MSPR at 554; <span class="Italic">Hayes</span>, 65 MSPR at 217; <span class="Italic">Bean</span>, 55 MSPR at 612. Even if, after reviewing the facts of a case, the Board would disagree with the arbitrator's decision, the Board cannot, absent legal error, substitute its conclusions for the arbitrator's. <span class="Italic">Benson</span>, 65 MSPR at 554.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the arbitrator's specific findings on the merits of the charges are not in conflict with Board substantive law. We note the appellant's contention that the arbitrator admitted into the record photocopied documents, rather than originals, and allowed hearsay testimony in lieu of missing documents. Hearsay evidence, however, is admissible in administrative proceedings before the Board, but the assessment of the probative value of such evidence depends on the circumstances of each case. <span class="Italic">Reniere v. Dept. of Agric.</span>, 62 MSPR 648, 652 (1994). Moreover, the arbitrator found that the destroyed documents would likely not have exonerated the appellant in view of the weight of the remaining evidence in support of the charges. Thus, he implicitly weighed the alleged hearsay evidence in reaching his findings on the charges and did not err in applying civil service law, rule, or regulation regarding hearsay evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, an arbitrator's failure to mention all of the evidence of record does not mean that he did not consider it in reaching his decision. <span class="Italic">See Hayes</span>, 65 MSPR at 218; <span class="Italic">Cockrell v. Dept. of</span> <span class="Italic">the Air Force</span>, 58 MSPR 211, 216 (1993). It also does not mean that his omission was contrary to civil service law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Benson</span>, 65 MSPR at 554. As to the arbitrator's remaining findings on the merits in this case, the arbitrator was not required to make explicit findings or give his reasons for the award. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Nevertheless, as indicated above, the arbitrator fully explained his findings on the merits of the charges, and we defer to those findings. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 555.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the appellant's discrimination claims, the arbitrator set forth the allocation of proof in discrimination cases, as well as the order of producing evidence, citing <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed.2d 407 (1993); <span class="Italic">Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L.

He found that, even if the appellant arguably established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination by showing that he is a member of <span id="Page_1843"></span>a protected class and that he was subjected to an adverse action, the agency articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the removal because the appellant committed the offenses charged and removal was a proper penalty for those offenses. The arbitrator further found that, even if the appellant had shown that the agency's reasons were pretextual for prohibited discrimination, the appellant failed to meet his ultimate burden under <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> of proving that the agency removed him for discriminatory reasons. In this regard, the arbitrator examined the testimonies presented and concluded that there was "simply no credible evidence of discrimination in this case."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the arbitrator erred by failing to find that the appellant did not establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, and he challenges the arbitrator's assessment of the credibility of agency witnesses who testified regarding the discrimination claims. He contends that the arbitrator failed to properly assess EEO laws and regulations and allowed the agency's failure to investigate his discrimination complaint "to go unchallenged."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the appellant contends that the arbitrator erred by misinterpreting EEO laws and regulations, the appellant's arguments essentially relate to his disagreement with the arbitrator's fact findings on the discrimination issues. An arbitrator's findings on discrimination are factual determinations that are entitled to deference unless he erred in his legal analysis. <span class="Italic">Benson</span>, 65 MSPR at 555. Further, we have held that, where the arbitrator has found the agency's charges supported and found no evidence to support a discrimination claim, the arbitrator implicitly utilized the correct legal analysis. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. In any event, there is no indication here that the arbitrator erred in his legal analysis by misapplying or misallocating the burdens of proof or employing the incorrect analytical framework. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Hayes</span>, 65 MSPR at 217; <span class="Italic">Lisboa v.

He claims that the arbitrator rejected the following mitigating factors: (1) The appellant's prior 19 years of unblemished service, during which he received outstanding ratings and performance awards; (2) his unemployment for 2 years at the date of the arbitration award; (3) his filing for bankruptcy; (4) his 9 months of psychological care and his failure to recover from the agency's allegedly improper conduct; (5) the agency's failure to provide reasons why the appellant could not be rehabilitated; and (6) the practice of progressive discipline established by the agency and the union in their negotiated agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 11-12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The arbitrator found that the appellant's conduct was serious, that it violated agency trust, and that it jeopardized the livelihood of the most vulnerable in society, i.e., the permanently disabled (by unjustly denying them benefits). Contrary to the appellant's contentions, the arbitrator, in examining the penalty factors in determining whether mitigation of the penalty was warranted, specifically considered the appellant's unblemished record from 1980, when he began his employment with the agency, until 1993, and his outstanding performance ratings, cash awards, and within-grade increases during that period. The arbitrator also considered, however, that the appellant's performance had since deteriorated, ultimately resulting in his placement on a PIP. The arbitrator specifically determined that the removal penalty is consistent with the agency's table of penalties for violation of the agency's Standards of Conduct and also agreed with the agency's determination that the appellant lacked rehabilitation potential, noting the requirements of the appellant's position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 49-51.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the arbitrator applied the same penalty standard set forth by the Board in <span class="Italic">Douglas. See id.</span> at 48-51. Therefore, we find no basis for disturbing his findings on the issue of the appropriateness of the penalty. <span class="Italic">See Benson</span>, 65 MSPR at 555.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board examined an award for implicit EEO determinations, <span class="Italic">Benson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 548, 555 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are unable to determine from the record whether the appellants raised the issue of discrimination before the arbitrator. They did not mention discrimination in their opening statements at arbitration, and the arbitrator did not include discrimination in his list of agreed-upon issues in the case. The arbitrator nonetheless noted in his award that there was no direct evidence of discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If discrimination was before the arbitrator, then his findings on discrimination are factual determinations entitled to deference, unless he erred in his legal analysis. <span class="Italic">See Bean</span>, 55 MSPR at 612. In addressing the issue, the arbitrator noted only that there was no direct evidence of discrimination. In situations where the arbitrator has found that the charges were supported, and found no evidence to support a discrimination claim, the Board has held that the arbitrator implicitly performed the correct legal analysis<span class="Italic">. See Bean; Bardill v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 41 MSPR 599, 601-02 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We apply that holding here, but note that to the extent the arbitrator found that direct evidence was necessary to establish discrimination, his finding might be deemed incorrect. In any event, whether the arbitrator should have addressed discrimination, or did not need to address it, because it was not raised before him, we find that the appellants did not establish discrimination. <span class="Italic">See St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 113 S. Ct. 2742 (1993). The appellants' assertions in support of their discrimination claim all relate to the officers involved in the arrest and altercation. These assertions, even if true, do not establish that the agency's proposing and deciding officials took the removal actions based on race discrimination. Therefore, they do not establish a relationship between the appellants' membership in a protected class and the adverse action, which would be required to establish discrimination.</p>
