<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-114"><span class="space">a.</span> Indictment; Filing of Information; Referral for Prosecution</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the existence of an administrative investigation, without more, may be insufficient to support an indefinite suspension, the details of that investigation, with reliance on evidence developed from it, may support the suspension, particularly if there is ongoing consideration of the matter under investigation by criminal justice authorities. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bell v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 54 MSPR 619 (1992). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-13-116.html#sec6-115">Investigation Accompanied by Other Circumstances</a>," for <span class="Italic">Bell</span>.]<span class="Italic"> See</span> <span class="Italic">Hobbs v. DHHS</span>, 12 MSPR 679, 680 n.2, 11 MSPB 278 (1982) ("The rationale in <span class="Italic">Martin</span>...was that the requisite 'probable cause' for a Grand Jury indictment was virtually synonymous with 'reasonable cause' upon which an indefinite suspension may be based."). The Board's determination that an indictment is sufficient to support an indefinite suspension was reaffirmed in <span class="Italic">Frazier v. Dept. of Army</span>, 22 MSPR 252, 254 (1984) (involving an employee already disciplined for much of the conduct described in the indictment)<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Giambalvo v. DHHS</span>, 31 MSPR 675, 676 n.2 (1986) ("An indictment on its face is sufficient to support an indefinite suspension.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Crespo v. USPS</span>, 53 MSPR 125, 129 (1992), observed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has long recognized that a charge based on a criminal indictment differs from a charge based on the conduct underlying the indictment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Drake v. Veterans Administration</span>, 26 MSPR 34, 36 n.1 (1985); <span class="Italic">Martin v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 10 MSPB 568, 12 MSPR 12, 20 (1982). Moreover, an agency may properly indefinitely suspend an employee pending the outcome of an indictment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Johnson v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 37 MSPR 388, 393 (1988)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">McCulloch v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SF-0752-15-0353-I-1 (NP 9/25/2015) ("As the administrative judge correctly explained, the Board has never held that an agency must independently evaluate the strength of the underlying evidence against the appellant in an indefinite suspension case based on a criminal indictment; instead, the agency may rely solely on a grand jury indictment to prove that there is reasonable cause to believe that the employee is guilty of a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed. <span class="Italic">Dalton v. Department of Justice</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 429, 436 (1995).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That an indictment is later dismissed does not invalidate the indefinite suspension based on the indictment, <span class="Italic">Alguire v. USDA</span>, SF-0752-14-0343-I-2 (NP 11/20/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that the indictments against the appellant were eventually dismissed is irrelevant in determining whether the agency had reasonable cause to believe, at the time that it indefinitely suspended him, that the appellant committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment could be imposed. <span class="Italic">See Harding v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 284, &#x00B6; 17 (2010) (the resolution of the criminal proceedings that are the grounds for an indefinite suspension triggers the end of the indefinite suspension), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 451 F. App'x 947 (Fed. Cir. 2011). The indictments were sufficient reasonable cause for the agency to indefinitely suspend the appellant, even though they were eventually dismissed. <span class="Italic">See Hernandez v. Department of the Navy</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 14, &#x00B6; 7 (2013) (the Board has held that "reasonable cause" in the context of an indefinite suspension based on possible criminal misconduct is virtually synonymous with "probable cause," which is necessary to support an indictment)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An indefinite suspension may validly be imposed based on information supplied to a grand jury, <span class="Italic">Henderson v. VA</span>, 123 MSPR 536, 540-41 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9, 2016 MSPB 29 (2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...On review, the appellant challenges only the administrative judge's finding that the agency had the requisite reasonable cause to impose the indefinite suspension. Specifically, he argues that an indictment alone is insufficient to establish reasonable cause when, as here, the agency "made the criminal accusations against Appellant" and provided "the only evidence presented to the grand jury." In such a case, he argues, there must be a "third party review, law enforcement investigation, or evidence corroborating the criminal charges," in addition to the indictment, to support a finding of reasonable cause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that "reasonable cause" in the context of an indefinite suspension based on possible criminal misconduct is virtually synonymous with "probable cause," which is necessary to support a grand <span id="Page_2129"></span>jury indictment, i.e., probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that the accused has probably committed it. <span class="Italic">Hernandez</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 14, &#x00B6; 7. The issuance of an arrest warrant, or the actual arrest of an employee, is insufficient to meet this standard. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Dunnington v. Department of Justice</span>, 956 F.2d 1151, 1157 (Fed. Cir. 1992)). However, absent special circumstances, a formal judicial determination following a preliminary hearing or an indictment following an investigation and grand jury proceeding provides "more than enough evidence of possible misconduct to meet the threshold requirement of reasonable cause." <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1157; <span class="Italic">see Hernandez</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 14, &#x00B6; 7. An agency may rely solely on a grand jury indictment to prove that there is reasonable cause to believe that the employee is guilty of a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed. <span class="Italic">Dalton v. Department of Justice</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 429, 436 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as noted above, a Federal grand jury indicted the appellant on 50 counts of making false statements relating to health care matters in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1035, an offense punishable by fines, imprisonment of up to 5 years, or both. As discussed above, it is well settled that such evidence is sufficient to satisfy the agency's "reasonable cause" requirement. <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1157; <span class="Italic">Hernandez</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 14, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's contention on review that the indictment was based entirely on evidence and testimony provided by the agency, even if true, does not negate the fact that a grand jury indictment establishes reasonable cause to believe that a crime has been committed. This is true because a grand jury indictment is a conclusive determination of the issue of probable cause, and there is no requirement that the agency look into the judgment of the grand jury to determine whether the indictment was founded upon sufficient proof. <span class="Italic">Dalton</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 436. Therefore, we discern no basis to disturb the administrative judge's finding that, in light of the grand jury indictment, the agency had reasonable cause to believe that the appellant had committed a crime punishable by imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf. Holsey v. DOJ</span>, AT-0752-13-0291-I-1 (NP 1/22/2014) ("as for the appellant's contention that the indictment was not sufficient to establish reasonable cause because it was based on the false statements of an inmate, the Board has made clear that it lacks authority to review the merits of the indictment," citing <span class="Italic">Dalton v. DOJ</span>, 66 MSPR 429 (1995)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dalton v. DOJ</span>, 66 MSPR 429, 435-36 (1995), considered an appellant whose removal for misconduct was reversed by the Board and who was subsequently indicted and suspended for the same misconduct. The AJ reasoned that the Board could not sustain the indefinite suspension because the agency could not prove the misconduct by preponderant evidence; a higher standard--proof beyond a reasonable doubt--governed the criminal proceedings. On review, the Board sustained the indefinite suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court stated in <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span> that "a formal judicial determination made following a preliminary hearing, or an indictment following an investigation and grand jury proceedings, would provide, absent special circumstances, more than enough evidence of possible misconduct to meet the threshold requirement of reasonable cause to suspend." <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1157. Here, there is no question that both indefinite suspensions were supported by indictments. The administrative judge, however, opined that special circumstances were present because the Board had reversed the agency's removal action based on essentially the same misconduct that supported the indictments, and thus the agency could not have reasonably believed that it could prevail on a criminal charge resulting from the misconduct as such charge required a higher standard of proof (reasonable doubt) than did the removal action brought before the Board (preponderant evidence).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the standard for the imposition of an indefinite suspension is not whether the agency could prevail on the criminal charge but, rather, whether it had reasonable cause to believe that the appellant committed a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment at the time it imposed the suspension.... Thus, the eventual resolution of the criminal charges is irrelevant to whether the indefinite suspension was properly imposed. In this vein, the Board has recognized that a charge based on a criminal indictment differs from a charge based on the conduct underlying the indictment and has held that an agency properly complied with the administrative judge's interim relief order when it effected an indefinite suspension of the appellant in lieu of placing him into a duty status, based upon an indictment on essentially the same charges as those underlying the original reversed removal action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Crespo v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 53 MSPR 125, 129 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its ruling in <span class="Italic">Crespo</span>, the Board implicitly recognized that criminal processes differ fundamentally from Board proceedings; namely, the Bureau of Prisons is not responsible for bringing criminal charges before the courts, rather, that is the province of the U.S. Attorney. The U.S. Attorney may have access to evidence which, in turn, was presented to the grand jury, and which was not presented in the Board proceedings. Because of the secrecy of grand jury proceedings, <span class="Italic">see</span> Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e), the agency would have no basis for determining independently whether the U.S. Attorney had sufficient evidence to obtain a conviction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we have never held that an agency must independently evaluate the strength of the underlying evidence against the appellant in an indefinite suspension case based on a criminal indictment; instead, the agency may rely solely on a grand jury indictment to prove that there is reasonable cause to believe that the employee is guilty of a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed. This is so because a grand jury indictment is a conclusive determination of the issue of probable cause. It has long been established that the courts have no authority to look into the judgment of the grand jury to determine whether or not its indictment was founded upon sufficient proof. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Reed,</span> 27 Fed. Cas. pages 727, 738, No. 16,134 (1852), cited with approval in <span class="Italic">Costello v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States,</span> 350 U.S. 359, 362-63, 76 S. Ct. 406, 408, 100 L. Ed. 397 (1956). <span class="Italic">See also United States v. Calandra</span>, 414 U.S. 338, 344-45, 94 S. Ct. 613, 618, 38 L. Ed.2d 561 (1974). We decline to assume that the Board has any greater authority than the courts might have to either look behind an indictment, or to require an agency to do so. Accordingly, in our view, the fact that the appellant prevailed before the Board is not a special circumstance vitiating the indictment supporting the indefinite suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although an indictment or an arraignment is ordinarily demonstrated through copies of court records, the Board accepts secondary evidence, including newspaper reports of the proceedings, to establish that the proceedings occurred. <span class="Italic">Wells v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 38 MSPR 499, 502 (1988). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Barresi v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 656, 663 (1994) ("It would not place an undue burden upon agency officials to require them to do more than read a newspaper before deciding to indefinitely suspend an employee. Accordingly, we find that in making a reasonable cause determination, an agency cannot rely on media reports alone, without some form of independent verification").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A criminal information is sufficient to support an indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smart v. MSPB</span>, 342 Fed. Appx. 595, 598 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP). In <span class="Italic">Rampado v. Customs Serv.</span>, 28 MSPR 189, 191 n.3 (1985), although no grand jury indictment was sought for unauthorized disclosure of official information, the United States Attorney accepted the case for prosecution and informed agency officials of the statutes supporting the planned prosecution. An ensuing suspension was proper. There was no evidence that the U.S. Attorney delayed bringing the case to a grand jury. The appellant admitted the misconduct, meaning that the agency had the required reasonable cause to believe a crime punishable by imprisonment had been committed. The Board expressly declined to decide whether there might be circumstances where an appellant whose suspension is based on referral for prosecution could bring an enforcement action alleging that the suspension should have ended unless there was an indictment or further action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But a California criminal complaint without a judicial determination was insufficient to support an indefinite suspension, <span class="Italic">Brown v. DOD</span>, SF-0752-13-0336-I-1 (NP 12/16/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we agree with the administrative judge that the filing of a criminal complaint charging the appellant with three felony violations, without more, is insufficient to sustain an indefinite suspension based upon reasonable cause to believe that the appellant has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed. There is no evidence in the record that some formal judicial determination followed the filing of the felony criminal complaint against the appellant, and we agree with the administrative judge that under California law, the filing of a felony criminal complaint is only a "preliminary accusation" which brings the defendant before a judicial officer for a probable cause determination and is therefore insufficient to establish reasonable cause to believe that the appellant has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed. <span class="Italic">See Hernandez</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 14, &#x00B6; 12 n.4. We further find <span class="Italic">Hernandez</span> distinguishable because the appellant in that case was charged with several criminal misdemeanor violations, and, under California law, when a defendant is charged with a criminal misdemeanor and is not in custody, no probable cause determination is made, thus making "a misdemeanor complaint [ ] comparable to an indictment." <span class="Italic">Hernandez</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 14, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14. Because the felony criminal complaint filed against the appellant in this case required some additional probable cause determination under California law, Hernandez does not support the agency's argument on petition for review. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (discussing California criminal law and procedure).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further disagree with the agency that the appellant's indefinite suspension should have been sustained based on the "overall circumstances" surrounding the filing of the felony criminal complaint. There is no evidence in the record that the agency undertook some internal agency investigation or action "to satisfy itself that there was reasonable cause to believe that a crime was committed for which imprisonment could be imposed," <span class="Italic">Barresi v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 656, 666 (1994), and we disagree with the agency's suggestion that "the [a]ppellant has never really denied the underlying facts of the criminal charges." To the contrary, the record shows that the appellant denied the criminal nature of his conduct, and because the agency did not conduct <span id="Page_2130"></span>its own investigation in an effort to satisfy itself that the "statutory test of reasonable cause" had been satisfied--i.e., probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that the appellant probably committed it--we find that the agency cannot demonstrate that a review of "all of the circumstances in this case" establishes that it had reasonable cause to believe that the appellant had committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment could be imposed, <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 12, 15; <span class="Italic">see Barresi</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 656, 666-67 (rejecting the agency's attempt to justify indefinite suspensions based on employees' arrests and arraignments "without investigating the underlying facts behind" those actions).</p>
