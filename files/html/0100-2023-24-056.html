<p class="Body-Text">The language of a statutory provision must be regarded as conclusive unless there is a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary. <span class="Italic">CPSC v. GTE Sylvania</span>, 447 U.S. 102 (1980). From <span class="Italic">DWA Holdings LLC v. United States</span>, 889 F.3d 1361, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2018):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"As in any case of statutory construction, our analysis begins with the language of the statute." <span class="Italic">Hughes Aircraft Co. v. Jacobson</span>, 525 U.S. 432, 438 (1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). "The first step 'is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.'" <span class="Italic">Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., Inc</span>., 534 U.S. 438, 450 (2002) (quoting <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Shell Oil Co</span>., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997)); <span class="Italic">see also Gross v. FBL Fin.

(citation omitted)). We also "must read the words 'in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.'" <span class="Italic">King v. Burwell</span>, --U.S.--, 135 S.

Council, Inc</span>., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984)).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The case thus comes down to this: On the one hand, we have statutory language that could not be clearer. An individual is an "employee," as defined in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511 (a)(1)(C), if he or she meets the requirements of either subsection (i) or (ii) of the statute. On the other hand, we are confronted with legislative history which supports the government's argument that Congress intended to exclude from the definition of "employee" in &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C) an individual who did not meet the requirements of subsection (i) of the statute, even if he or she did meet the requirements of subsection (ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Faced with this choice, we agree with Ms. Van Wersch's reading of the statute.

When Congress adopts a new law incorporating sections of a prior law, it normally can be presumed to have knowledge of the judicial or administrative interpretation given to the incorporated law, at least insofar as it affects the new statute. <span class="Italic">Lorillard v. Pons,</span> 434 U.S. 575, 581, 98 S. Ct. 866, 870, 55 L. Ed.2d 40 (1978). If Congress had intended to incorporate &#x00A7; 403, therefore, it presumably would have been aware of the need to make an exception in the statute.... &#8197;As a general rule of statutory construction, expression of one exception indicates that no other exceptions apply. Sutherland Stat. Const. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 47.11 and 47.23 (4th ed. rev. 1984). Moreover, the plain language of a statute controls absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary. <span class="Italic">Consumer Products Safety Commission v. GTE Sylvania</span>,<span class="Italic"> Inc</span>., 447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S. Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L. Ed.2d 766 (1980)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an effort to determine whether certain provisions of the WPEA could properly be applied to cases pending at the time of its enactment, <span class="Italic">Day v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/DAY_THOMAS_F_DC_1221_12_0528_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_WITH_CONCURRING_AND_DISSENTING_OPINION_836324.pdf">119 MSPR 589</a>, 596 &#x00B6; 12, 2013 MSPB 49 (2013) (Member Robbins concurring in part and dissenting in part), turned to the express statutory language to decide whether the at issue provisions clarified or effected substantive changes to existing law:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the statutory language of the WPEA does not contain any express language indicating congressional intent that the Act apply retroactively, it does explicitly provide that the purpose of the WPEA was to clarify the WPA. The preamble states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An Act</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">To amend chapter 23 of title 5, United States Code, <span class="Italic">to clarify the disclosures of information protected from prohibited personnel practices</span>, require a statement in non-disclosure policies, forms and agreements that such policies, forms, and agreements conform with certain disclosure protections, provide certain authority for the Special Counsel, and other purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">WPEA pmbl. (emphasis added). Furthermore, the pertinent provision in this appeal is section 101 of the statute, which is entitled: "Sec. 101. CLARIFICATION OF DISCLOSURES COVERED." WPEA &#x00A7; 101. As such, there can be no doubt that Congress clearly intended to enact the WPEA as a "clarification" of the term "disclosure" in the WPA. Moreover, we find this language to be sufficiently clear as to rebut the agency's argument that, because the WPEA includes a delayed effective date, Congress could not have intended that the Act be applied to pending cases.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of headings in a statute, <span class="Italic">Jonson v. FDIC</span>, 121 MSPR 56, 64-65 &#x00B6; 13, 2014 MSPB 22 (2014) (dissent by Member Robbins), observed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FDIC cites <span class="Italic">Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Baltimore &#x0026; Ohio Railroad Co</span>., 331 U.S. 519 (1947), for the principle that statutory section headings "do not alter the meaning of the accompanying text." IAF, Tab 10 at 7 n.12 (citing Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, 331 U.S. at 528-29). The Court went on to note, however, that headings may be used for interpretation when "they shed light on some ambiguous word or phrase." <span class="Italic">Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen</span>, 331 U.S. at 529; <span class="Italic">see</span> Singer, 2A Statutes and Statutory Construction &#x00A7; 47:14, at 257-58 (where the statute was enacted with the headings, "the headings may serve as an aid" in determining "legislative intent"). Given the use in the RTCCA of two separate subheadings, one for employees and one for contractors, we believe that the headings shed light on the purpose of each subsection and are appropriately used to clarify their purposes. The headings and the legislative history thus make clear that OGE's approval was required for the regulations at 12 C.F.R. Part 336, Subpart B.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There is no general rule or presumption that a parenthetical is always definitional. Instead, as in many areas of law (and life), context is crucial. Hence, to determine whether a particular parenthetical provides a definition or is "merely an illustrative example," <span class="Italic">Novacor Chems., Inc. v. United States</span>, 171 F.3d 1376, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999), we must consider the specific language at issue in the statutory or regulatory context in which it appears and then draw the most sensible conclusion about its meaning. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Becerra v. Empire Health Found</span>., 142 S. Ct. 2354, 2362 (2022) (construing parenthetical contained in Medicare payment provision by considering "[t]he text and context"); <span class="Italic">Boechler, P.C. v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue</span>, 142 S. Ct. 1493, 1498 (2022) (construing parenthetical in tax code by considering "the provision's text [and] structure" and "the broader statutory context"); <span class="Italic">Chickasaw Nation v. United States</span>, 534 U.S. 84, 90 (2001) (noting that tax exemptions are ordinarily enacted explicitly, not suggestively in parentheticals).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For the meaning of words, the Board and the courts often turn to the dictionary. Noted are the comments of Judge Rader of the Federal Circuit concerning that practice. His concurrence in <span class="Italic">Ferguson Beauregard/Logic Controls v. Mega Systems</span>, 350 F.3d 1327, 1347-48 (Fed. Cir. 2003), noted that language must be taken in context of the subject matter of the litigation:</p>
<p class="Body-Text">What of parentheticals? From majority opinion in <span class="Italic">Hanser v. McDonough</span>, 56 F.4th 967, 971 (Fed. Cir. 2022) (the decision's discussion is extensive, but in sum):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">... The word "normal" that appears in this case has a different "customary" meaning to a psychiatrist in a mental hospital (where "normal" refers to a sane mental state) than to a pharmacist seeking proper dosages (where "normal" doses would vary with body weight and other factors), than to a marriage counselor (here a "normal" marriage probably means an average marriage, i.e., one perpetually in danger of divorce), than to an oil well driller in a pump technology.</p>
