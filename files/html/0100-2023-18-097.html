<h4 class="h4" id="sec11-98"><span class="space">4.</span> Early Law From MSPB</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">With the court cases and a few Board cases in mind, we review the evolution of Board law concerning due process violations during the agency decisional process. [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-13-160.html#sec6-159">Performance Case,</a>" for proper and improper communications between the proposing and concurring official, and others, in a Chapter 43 performance action.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Early Board law implied that <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications to the decisionmaker were not a basis for overturning an action if the material offered to the deciding official was subject to reexamination during the Board hearing process and if there was no involvement of an undisclosed person with an interest strongly adverse to the appellant. <span class="Italic">Gilligan v. HUD</span>, 4 MSPR 236, 237-39 (1980), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing <span class="Italic">Camero v. U.S.,</span> 375 F.2d 777, 179 Ct. Cl. 520 (1967), <span class="Italic">Ryder</span> <span class="Italic">v. United States,</span> 585 F.2d 482, 218 Ct. Cl. 289 (1978), and other cases, the appellant alleges that the agency violated the appellant's due process rights since the memoranda furnished to the deciding official were <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications which were written with the intention of influencing the deciding official.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Camero</span> and <span class="Italic">Ryder</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, cited by the appellant in her petition, concerned the standard of fairness inherent in the concept of an adversary hearing. In <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. U.S.,</span> Court of Claims No. 26-79 (May 28, 1980), the court rejected a plaintiff's attempt to broaden the application of <span class="Italic">Camero</span> and <span class="Italic">Ryder</span> to cover a memorandum which was part of the administrative record. The court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Initially, we note plaintiff's argument that Dr. Haynes' <span class="Italic">"ex parte</span> memorandum" submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Administration, and thenceforth part of the administrative record, violated her due process rights under <span class="Italic">Camero v. United States,</span> 179 Ct. Cl. 520, 375 F.2d 777 (1967), and <span class="Italic">Ryder v. United States,</span> 218 Ct. Cl. [289], 585 F.2d 482 (1978). Plaintiff attempts to extend <span class="Italic">Camero</span> <span class="Italic">and Ryder</span> too far. In <span class="Italic">Camero,</span> the court found the discharge of an Army civilian employee unlawful because of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications by the Government's attorney to the base commanding officer who was reviewing the hearing officer's determination. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Ryder,</span> the plaintiff's supervisor who initiated an inefficiency removal communicated with the post commander while the commander was engaged in the review process. In both these cases, plaintiff's adversary communicated with an official charged with a quasi-judicial review role. In our case, however, Dr. Haynes' function was to analyze the medical evidence and present it to the Assistant Secretary for an initial decision. Dr. Haynes' role was entirely consonant with the appropriate procedures and not the type of communication at issue in Camero and <span class="Italic">Ryder.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, even if we were to consider the memoranda to be improper communications (and we are not convinced that they were), nevertheless during the hearing the appellant's attorney argued the issue of the alleged impropriety of the memoranda before the presiding official. All relevant persons were present and were questioned by the appellant's attorney at the hearing on the appeal. Based upon the arguments and testimony presented, the presiding official made credibility findings and concluded that the deciding official had not considered the memoranda in reaching her decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Other decisions examined the facts involving the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, information, conversations or other developments during the reply process under a generalized harmful error approach.<span class="Italic"> Appling v. SSA</span>, 30 MSPR 375, 381 (1986), decided that to prove harmful <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications during the agency decisional process, the appellant must show that (1) a new allegation or information that the appellant could not review or rebut was considered by the deciding official; (2) the deciding official was influenced by the new allegations or information in his decisional process; and (3) the procedural error of considering the new allegations or information likely had a harmful effect on the outcome of the agency's action. The Board looked for an adversarial situation similar to those described by <span class="Italic">Camero</span> or <span class="Italic">Ryder</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Holm v. DOJ</span>, 40 MSPR 630, 635 (1988) ("Mr. Kelly was, in effect, the appellant's 'adversary' because he had determined that the reprisal charge against the appellant was supported by the evidence and that Ms. Dumont had been treated unfairly. He communicated his beliefs to Mr. Bullard before the appellant had a full opportunity to reply to the charges. This put Mr. Bullard in the untenable position of trying to render an objective decision in the appellant's case when his superior had already expressed his view that the appellant was guilty of reprisal."). Otherwise, the harmful error rule applied and harm was hard to find. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kimm v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 64 MSPR 198, 208-09 (1994) (appellant did not show how the fact that ELRB drafted a notice of proposed adverse action, rather than a proposing official, likely caused a different result by the deciding official, and there was not showing that the deciding official considered new charges or information that was not listed in the proposal notice or that he was otherwise harmed by communications between the deciding official and ELRB);<span class="Italic"> Lizut v. Dept. of Army</span>, 30 MSPR 119, 127 (1986) (if <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications involved new information or allegations, a harmful effect on the deciding official's determination must be shown to establish harmful procedural error); <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of State</span>, 27 MSPR 344, 348 (1985) ("The Board will not place nonstatutory or nonregulatory encumbrances upon the agency decision making process involving the furnishing of advisory information which is of an investigative, nonadversarial nature.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Klippert v. DCAA</span>, 27 MSPR 339, 341-42 (1985), explained that communications between the proposing and deciding official were not <span class="Italic">per se</span> improper, with particular reference to the proposing official's comments to the deciding official concerning the employee's reply to the removal proposal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the agency's deciding official improperly considered an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication. The communication is a ten-page memorandum to Bernard Topf, the agency's deciding official, from Gregory Zagelow, the appellant's immediate supervisor. The memorandum consists of a rebuttal to the appellant's statements made in a reply to the deciding official, arguments as to why the appellant performed unacceptably, contentions regarding why the deciding official should not modify the removal to a demotion, and conclusory statements regarding the sufficiency of the appellant's allegations. Mr. Zagelow recommended removal "by sustaining the proposal in its entirety."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The memorandum in question also contains a discussion of the appellant's performance during an interim performance appraisal period, even though the appellant was charged with unacceptable performance only for the thirty-day period during which he was given an opportunity to improve. The appellant was not provided a copy of this memorandum until after Mr. Topf issued the removal decision letter on behalf of the agency. The presiding official who decided this appeal found that this was not improper because the agency provided the appellant with this memorandum prior to his filing the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The position of the appellant's supervisor as the proposing official does not <span class="Italic">per se</span> make him an adversarial party for purposes of determining whether a prohibited <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication occurred. There is no general prohibition that one involved in the agency's decision-making process (here the appellant's supervisor) be entirely removed from communicating with the deciding official once the process has begun. <span class="Italic">Farris v. Department of the Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force,</span> 26 MSPR 299 (1985), <span class="Italic">as clarified in Andersen v. Department of State,</span> 27 MSPR 344 at n.3 (1985). <span class="Italic">See Welcker v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States,</span> 752 F.2d 1577, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the appellant has not shown, nor are we aware of, any federal law, OPM or agency regulation which prohibits the communication involved in this case. <span class="Italic">See also Depte v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States,</span> 715 F.2d 1481, 1484 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (communication with an agency deciding official is not improper where no agency regulation requires an evidentiary hearing or prohibits <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications). The appellant has established that the deciding official considered allegations of unacceptable performance, in addition to those set forth in the notice of proposed removal, in reaching his decision to remove the appellant. Those allegations were contained in the memorandum from the appellant's supervisor to the agency's deciding official.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board held in <span class="Italic">Andersen, supra,</span> at 349, in order to support an allegation that <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications during the agency's decision-making process impaired an appellant's ability to defend against the agency's action, the appellant must show by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) new allegations or information was considered by the deciding official which the appellant has not had the benefit of reviewing and responding to; (2) the deciding official was influenced by the new allegations or information in his or her decision-making process; and (3) the procedural error of considering the new allegations or information likely had a harmful effect upon the outcome of the action before the agency. We find that the appellant failed to prove that these factors existed in this case. <span class="Italic">See Plath v. Department of Justice</span>, 11 MSPB 65, 12 MSPR 421 (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The discussion in the memorandum regarding deficient performance, which occurred prior to the period of time upon which the appellant's removal was based, was written by the appellant's immediate supervisor in response to the appellant's specific assertions of satisfactory performance during the earlier period. The appellant made these assertions in reply to the removal proposal. Moreover, a copy of the appellant's interim performance appraisal relating to the earlier period was attached to the removal proposal notice given to the appellant. In addition, the presiding official noted in her initial decision that, to the extent that these documents relate to performance deficiencies not specified in the removal proposal notice, the presiding official did not consider them in sustaining the agency's removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3257"></span>With regard to the appellant's allegations that the agency committed harmful procedural error, we find that he has failed to establish that any alleged errors would likely have affected the outcome of the action before the agency. <span class="Italic">See Parker v. Defense</span> <span class="Italic">Logistics Agency</span>, 1 MSPB 489, 492, 1 MSPR 505, 512 (1980)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under a pre-<span class="Italic">Stone</span> decision, <span class="Italic">Hairston v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 16 MSPR 440, 444 (1983), there was nothing inappropriate about an inquiry conducted by a deciding official that produced information that was investigatory rather than adversarial:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's claim that his removal was contrary to due process of law stems from his contention that the agency's deciding official interviewed several persons prior to making his decision. The appellant claimed these were prohibited <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications. Appellant cites <span class="Italic">Camero v. United States,</span> 375 F.2d 777 (Ct. Cl. 1976), and <span class="Italic">Ryder v. United States,</span> 585 F.2d 482 (Ct. Cl. 1978), as authority for this argument. As correctly pointed out by the presiding official, however, <span class="Italic">Camero</span> and <span class="Italic">Ryder</span> are distinguishable from the instant case in that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications in those cases were made in the context of an adversarial proceeding. The agency's representative to the adversarial proceeding actually participated in the decision making process of the action. In this case, however, the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were of an investigative nature. Thus, we find no error by the presiding official in this regard. <span class="Italic">Marketing Assistance Program, Inc. v. Bergland,</span> 562 F.2d 1305 (D.C. Cir. 1977).[**]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[**]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">In Sibert v. H.E.W.,</span> 4 MSPB 132, 133 (1980), this Board pointed out that <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications between the deciding official and other agency officials involved in the adverse action are not prohibited by the regulations implementing the Civil Service Reform Act, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (1978).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Oliver v. DHHS</span>, 34 MSPR 465, 469 (1987), repeated the theme:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant contends that the deciding official's admission that he had <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications with the proposing official and the Chairman of the EA Advisory Board renders the removal decision a nullity and voids the entire proceeding. In so arguing, she relies on <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Department of the Navy,</span> 720 F.2d 1266, 1274 (Fed. Cir. 1983). Appellant's reliance on <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> is misplaced. First, <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> neither prohibits nor even addresses the deciding official's right to communicate with the proposing official as part of the decision-making process. Such communications have been held by the Board to be proper. <span class="Italic">See Andersen v. Department of State,</span> 27 MSPR 344, 348 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 790 F.2d 91 (Fed. Cir. 1986)<span class="Italic">. Sullivan</span> is otherwise distinguishable because it concerned communications made by an adversary to the proceeding, whereas the comments in this case were made by the Chairman of the EA Advisory Board, who had a neutral stake in the outcome of appellant's case. Moreover, even where an appellant is able to show that <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications involved the transmission of new information or allegations to which she did not have the benefit of responding, in order to show harmful procedural error, the appellant must establish that the deciding official's consideration of this information likely had a harmful effect upon the outcome before the agency<span class="Italic">. See Boddie v. Department of the Navy,</span> 31 MSPR 607, 613 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has made no showing that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were improper or involved the transmission of new information, or that the consideration of any information communicated to the deciding official had an effect upon the agency's decision. Accordingly, we find that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications did not constitute harmful procedural error and that appellant has failed to prove her allegation that they constituted a prohibited personnel practice. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note appellant's argument that the agency violated 5 CFR &#x00A7; 752.404(b) by not providing her all the information relied on by the deciding official, specifically, the fruits of his <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications. However, as the administrative judge properly noted, the cited regulation deals with an employee's right to review the material relied upon in <span class="Italic">proposing</span> an adverse action. Thus, we find no violation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Earlier Board law placed few limitations on <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications involving the deciding official. Although the statute permitted an employee notice of the reasons for a proposed action and an opportunity to defend against them, it was not harmful error for a deciding official to conduct interviews or rely upon information unknown to the employee if the appellant had the opportunity to reply to that information at the Board hearing and if the record demonstrated that the stated reasons for the proposed action supported the penalty imposed by the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hadge v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 14 MSPR 142, 144 (1982) ("[A]ppellant has not demonstrated that his defense was prejudiced or that the deciding official would likely have reached a different conclusion had he not considered appellant's past performance and comments by his previous supervisors."). Errors in the agency internal review procedures leading to adverse action, e.g., <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications between agency officials and a performance review committee, were not harmful error if the appellant had the right to a <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">novo</span> hearing and evidentiary review by an AJ that cured the agency proceedings of any taint, as implied by <span class="Italic">Svejda v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 7 MSPR 108, 112-13, 7 MSPB 36 (1981). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Perez v. USPS</span>, 48 MSPR 354, 356 (1991) (that the deciding official allegedly conducted biased interviews was not reason for reversal without more specific allegations and because the opportunity for the appellant to cross examine the official during the Board hearing).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Nor was the action procedurally defective because, had he known of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information, the employee would have demanded an oral reply. The cure was in the Board hearing that followed, where the appellant could refute the evidence that was considered by the deciding official. <span class="Italic">Thornhill v. Dept. of Army</span>, 50 MSPR 480, 486-87 (1991); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">McTiernan v. Gronouski</span>, 337 F.2d 31, 35 (2d Cir. 1964) ("If indeed error were committed in the course of the Post Office Department's disciplinary proceedings through a failure to reveal these affidavits the error was rendered harmless when appellant was shown the affidavits almost three months in advance of the subsequent Civil Service Commission hearing on his dismissal[.] "). Neither due process nor any statute or regulation prohibited contact between the agency's deciding official and those having knowledge of the incidents supporting the charges against an employee. <span class="Italic">Brewer v. American Battle Monuments Comm'n</span>, 779 F.2d 663 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (citing <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. DLA</span>, 772 F.2d 887, 892 (Fed. Cir. 1985), and <span class="Italic">Depte v. United States</span>, 715 F.2d 1481, 1484 (Fed. Cir. 1983)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board summed up its pre-<span class="Italic">Stone</span> law, imposing a harmful error standard, concerning contacts between the deciding official and others having knowledge of the circumstances in <span class="Italic">Hudson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 64 MSPR 162, 167 (1994), with reference to the regulatory right to review the material relied on by the agency to support the proposal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e find no showing that the appellant was harmed by the deciding official's inquiries of her former supervisors in an attempt to verify her claims that she was a good employee who had been unfairly disciplined. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Forrester v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 27 MSPR 450, 453 (1985) (an agency's failure to comply with section 752.404(b)(1) by not allowing an employee to review the material on which it relied would constitute a procedural error which, if harmful to the appellant, would provide a basis for reversal of the action). She has not shown that the agency would have reached a different conclusion had the deciding official not made the above stated inquiries. <span class="Italic">See Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 672, 681, 685 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this connection, we note that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications between the deciding official and any other person during the agency's decisionmaking process do not establish, by themselves, improper influence on the deciding official or indicate reliance on material not available to the appellant or of which she was not notified. There is nothing to show that the deciding official did not exercise his independent judgment on the merits here as is required. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fontes v. Department of Transportation</span>, 51 MSPR 655, 668 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Blake v. DOJ</span>, 81 MSPR 394, 412-14 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 35-37 (1999), adopted a standard that appeared to exceed the proof required by the harmful error rule. <span class="Italic">Blake</span> essentially determined that the appellant must establish that an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication caused the outcome of the reply process to be determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also alleges that the administrative judge erred in finding that the deciding official's decision was not influenced by improper political pressure, the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication from Congressman Smith to the deciding official. The Board has recognized that there is no statutory or regulatory prohibition against <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications between the deciding official and other persons during the agency's decision making process<span class="Italic">. See Anderson v. Department of Transportation</span>, 59 MSPR 585, 595 (1993). An improperly motivated <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication to a deciding official by an adversary, however, denies the subsequently discharged employee his rights under the due process clause, taints the investigation, voids the entire proceeding, and renders the deciding official's removal decision a nullity, notwithstanding the removed employee's opportunity to present the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications issue to the Board on appeal of the merits of the removal decision<span class="Italic">. See Sullivan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 720 F.2d 1266, 1271-74 (Fed. Cir. 1983)<span class="Italic">. Holm v. Department of Justice</span>, 40 MSPR 630, 636 (1988) (key determination is whether <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication improperly predetermined outcome of disciplinary decision).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official, David Margolis, testified that he was told by a Department of Justice attorney that Congressman Smith, a member of the congressional delegation visiting MIA and Krome on June 10, had warned that if any of the penalties that the deciding official imposed was less severe than the OIG recommendations, INS would have trouble with Congressman Smith.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congressman Smith's statement, assuming it was in fact uttered and accurately conveyed to Margolis,[11] appears to have put Margolis in the difficult position of trying to render an objective decision in the appellant's case when a member of Congress had already expressed his view that the appellant was guilty. Margolis, however, testified that his job security would not be affected by how he decided the cases and that Congressman Smith's statements did not influence him, and that he would not be told how to decide the cases before him. Margolis's denial that he was influenced by Congressman Smith's statement is unwavering. <span id="Page_3258"></span>The record contains no other evidence to show that Margolis was influenced by the communication of Congressman Smith's statement. Congressman Smith's statement, therefore, did not constitute the kind of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> misconduct that eliminates all due process from the pre-removal administrative process, and rises to the level of clear harmful error. <span class="Italic">Cf. Holm</span>, 40 MSPR at 636 (improper <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication between agency official and deciding official when deciding official testified that, when he decided issue, the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> comment was on his mind). Thus, the administrative judge did not err in finding, in the absence of any other evidence that the penalty determination was influenced by improper political pressure, that the appellant failed to meet her burden of proving that her removal was predetermined or resulted from improper political pressure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;Apart from Margolis's testimony, indicating that he assumed the truth and accuracy of the purported statement by Congressman Smith, nothing in the record independently corroborates the substance and conveyance of the remarks. Pursuant to <span class="Italic">Sullivan,</span> it is plain that such evidence of an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication from a non-disinterested adversary, had it been presented and found credible, could indeed have so tainted the disciplinary decision process that the appellant's due process rights would have been irretrievably compromised<span class="Italic">. See Sullivan</span>, 720 F.2d at 1271-74. Proven, unveiled threats from someone wholly outside the chain of accountability within the Executive Branch, and who is arguably in a position to adversely affect the careers of decision-makers or the welfare of the agency involved for reasons antithetical to the assurance and administration of merit systems principles, will necessarily be subjected to the closest scrutiny. However, given the state of the pertinent evidence before us in this appeal, we need not further consider the alleged remarks, except to note that the alleged remarks from Congressman Smith were not directed particularly to the appellant's case, and that, despite the remarks, the agency nevertheless chose to mitigate several penalties from those proposed by OIG following its investigation....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Blake</span> was decided in March of 1999. <span class="Italic">Stone,</span> decided in June of 1999, did not mention <span class="Italic">Blake,</span> but <span class="Italic">Stone</span> changed the direction of due process analysis. The cases that follow involve specific situations that have arisen during the agency decisional process leading to due process challenges. Decisions before and after <span class="Italic">Stone</span> should be analyzed with reference to the change in approach toward these questions by the Federal Circuit, and presumably by the Board, in 1999 with regard to <span class="Italic">Stone,</span> and after 1983, with regard to <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">With these cases from the Federal Circuit and from the Board in mind, we proceed to analysis of specific situations involving communications during the reply process with the decisionmaker. Some decisions that follow may require reexamination as a result of more recent due process decisions from the court or from the Board.</p>
