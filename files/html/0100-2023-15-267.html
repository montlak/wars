<p class="Body-Text">Improper use of vehicles is serious: it costs the government money and exposes the government to liability. Unofficial use of a government vehicle carries a minimum statutory suspension of 30 days. <span class="Italic">Campbell v. DHHS</span>, 40 MSPR 525, 536 (1989). The statute penalizing misuse of government vehicles does not preclude a more severe penalty, e.g., removal or demotion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Flores v. USPS</span>, 78 Fed. Appx. 126, 129 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP) (statute "does not speak to the situation, as we have here, in which misuse of a government vehicle was one of several infractions by the same employee"). If the agency charges and sustains the statutory violation, the penalty cannot be reduced by the agency or the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Himmel v. DOJ</span>, 21 MSPR 149, 152 (1984); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Ross v. DHS,</span> <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/nonprecedential/ROSS_ROBERT_DA_0752_15_0521_I_1_REMAND_ORDER_1312569.pdf">DA-0752-15-0521-I-1</a> (NP 6/24/2016) (setting aside a settlement based on a charge of misuse of a government vehicle when, without altering the underlying charge, the settlement reduced the penalty to a five-day suspension).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">31 USC 1349(b) [formerly 31 USC 638a and 5 USC 78(c)(2)] provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An officer or employee who willfully uses or authorizes the use of a passenger motor vehicle or aircraft owned or leased by the United States Government (except for an official purpose authorized by section 1344 of this title) or otherwise violates section 1344 shall be suspended without pay by the head of the agency. The officer or employee shall be suspended for at least one month, and when circumstances warrant, for a longer period or summarily removed from office.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The referenced statute, 31 USC 1344, provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Passenger carrier use</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)(1)&#x2003;Funds available to a Federal agency, by appropriation or otherwise, may be expended by the Federal agency for the maintenance, operation, or repair of any passenger carrier only to the extent that such carrier is used to provide transportation for official purposes. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, transporting any individual other than the individuals listed in subsections (b) and (c) of this section between such individual's residence and such individual's place of employment is not transportation for an official purpose.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;For purposes of paragraph (1), transportation between the residence of an officer or employee and various locations that is--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;required for the performance of field work, in accordance with regulations prescribed pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;essential for the safe and efficient performance of intelligence, counterintelligence, protective services, or criminal law enforcement duties, or transportation of federally owned canines associated with force protection duties of any part of the intelligence community (as defined in section 3 of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3003)),</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">is transportation for an official purpose, when approved in writing by the head of the Federal agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;For purposes of paragraph (1), the transportation of an individual between such individual's place of employment and a mass transit facility pursuant to subsection (g) is transportation for an official purpose.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;A passenger carrier may be used to transport between residence and place of employment the following officers and employees of Federal agencies:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)(A)&#x2003;the President and the Vice President;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;no more than 6 officers or employees in the Executive Office of the President, as designated by the President; and</p>

<p class="Body-Text">A willful violation of the statute prohibiting unofficial use of a government vehicle occurs if the employee voluntarily uses a government vehicle with knowledge of whether the use was for other than official purposes. <span class="Italic">Harrison v. Dept. of Army</span>, 29 MSPR 294, 295 n.2 (1985) (citing <span class="Italic">Doolin v. DOJ</span>, 21 MSPR 563 (1984)); <span class="Italic">DHHS v. Haley</span>, 20 MSPR 365, 367 (1984) (30-day suspension of an ALJ for the unofficial use of a GOV). Vehicle misuse was considered in <span class="Italic">Doolin</span>, cited in <span class="Italic">Harrison</span>. The appellant declined to return a car at the end of duty, took the car home, and made no personal use of it. The statute, 31 USC 638(c)(2) [now 31 USC 1344(a)(2)], defined "official business" indirectly by excluding transportation between work and home, except as to employees engaged in field work whose duties make the transportation necessary and then only when approved by the head of the department. Under <span class="Italic">Doolin v. DOJ</span>, 21 MSPR 563, 566(1984), if an employee is not given authority to take a government vehicle home and does so anyway, it is immaterial that the agency decision is arbitrary. The employee must obey until the order is successfully challenged.<span class="Italic"> Woody v. GSA</span>, 6 MSPR 486, 489-90, 6 MSPB 410 (1981), examined, in determining whether misuse of a vehicle occurred, the voluntary and conscious use of the vehicle with knowledge or reckless disregard of whether its use was for other than an official purpose. The appellant should have followed orders, even if arbitrary, and returned the car. His refusal to do so constituted wilful misuse of the car. A 30-day suspension was required by the statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cottman v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 23 MSPR 688, 690 (1984) (following <span class="Italic">Woody, supra,</span> and applying "knowledge or reckless disregard" to the vehicle misuse statute). The vehicle misuse statute, 31 USC 1349(b) (1988), is not limited to "home-to-work" situations. When the primary use of the vehicle was not for official government use--instead for the employee to get lunch--the <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">minimis</span> exceptions in <span class="Italic">Lynch v.

<p class="Body-Text">If the charge is misuse of a government vehicle, the 30-day penalty is mandatory; the agency may impose no less. <span class="Italic">Soroko v. Defense Investigative Serv.</span>, 29 MSPR 402, 404 (1985) (since the appellant's request for domicile parking was not approved, as required by regulation, his continuation of parking a GOV in his home driveway for a period of two months constituted vehicle misuse); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Himmel v. DOJ</span>, 21 MSPR 149 (1984) (AJ could not mitigate penalty as to sustained charge of misuse of GOV); 31 USC 1349(b), 1344(a). The agency may remove an employee for vehicle misuse.

<p class="Body-Text">Use of a GOV to transport family members warranted a 30-day suspension on the theory that the violation of governing agency regulations was analogous to violation of the statute precluding unofficial use of government vehicles, <span class="Italic">Leaton v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 65 MSPR 331, 340-41 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutory penalty for using a government vehicle for other than an official purpose is a 30-day suspension. 31 USC &#x00A7; 1349(b). In <span class="Italic">Semans v. Department of the Interior,</span> 62 MSPR 502, 508 (1994), we found the charge of allowing "unauthorized use of a government vehicle assigned to [an employee] by a person other than [that employee]" to be so closely analogous to a charge of violation of section 1349(b) that, for purposes of determining the appropriate penalty, the offenses could be considered to be identical. In the present appeal, the agency has not charged the appellant with a violation of section 1349(b), nor is the charge at issue here identical to the charge in <span class="Italic">Semans.</span> <span class="Italic">Cf. Christensen v. US Postal Service</span>, 51 MSPR 681, 686-87 (1991) (a charge of using a government vehicle for conducting personal business is distinct from a charge of transporting an unauthorized passenger in a government vehicle), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 979 F.2d 216 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). Nevertheless, the charge here, violation of office policy on transportation of unofficial passengers in a government vehicle, is sufficiently similar to that for which we concluded that a 30-day penalty was appropriate in <span class="Italic">Semans,</span> that we look to <span class="Italic">Semans</span> for guidance. In light <span id="Page_2796"></span>of the foregoing, we conclude that the maximum reasonable penalty is a 30-day suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Christensen v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 681, 687 (1991) (misuse of a government vehicle and the transportation of an unauthorized person in the vehicle are two separate charges that, although related, involve different proof).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit added coherence to the Board's attempts to interpret the vehicle misuse statute in <span class="Italic">Felton v. EEOC</span>, 820 F.2d 391, 393-94 (Fed. Cir. 1987), involving a supervisor suspended for 30 days after she permitted a subordinate to use a GOV to secure the subordinate's personal vehicle, broken down on a nearby highway. The supervisor reasoned that office efficiency would be enhanced if the employee could use the GOV and get back to work without the loss of time that would be entailed if the subordinate did not have access to the GOV. The court reversed the Board's decision affirming the suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Had the word "willful" been omitted from the statute, the statute would apply to any authorization for any nonofficial purpose. It would have made all unwitting, inadvertent and unintended authorizations for nonofficial use a violation of the statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Morissette v. United States</span>, 342 U.S. 246 (1952). Such is not the case here. That Felton's authorization was a conscious and intentional act was admitted, but a knowing authorization of an unofficial use requires more than mere intent to do the act which lays the foundation for the charge. The requirement of knowledge applies to the unofficial nature of the use as well as to the authorization. She knew and intended to authorize the use, but there is no evidence that she actually knew that the use would be characterized as "nonofficial."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor can it be said that Felton's authorization was in reckless disregard of whether the use was for other than official purposes. EEOC Order No. 348...states the agency's policy on the use of motor vehicles. In discussing official use the Order states: "What constitutes official purposes is a matter of administrative discretion to be exercised within applicable laws. The general rule may be stated that where transportation is essential to the successful operation of an authorized agency...such transportation will be considered as official use." Viewing official use as a matter of administrative discretion, we think it clear that an administrator in Felton's position could reasonably have determined that the use authorized in this case would promote the successful operation of the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Felton's testimony makes clear that she acted in good faith in attempting to solve an office emergency. Poor management judgment in selecting an alternative to solve an office emergency does not rise to the level of "reckless disregard."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although <span class="Italic">Felton</span> was acknowledged by the Board, it was distinguished; the Board readily found reckless disregard of the proper use of a vehicle by an individual who used a pickup truck for limited commuting during a short period of time when the appellant was overworked and preoccupied with agency duties. The employee should have determined from a superior whether his intended use would be considered unofficial. Not having done so, his use of the pickup truck was in "reckless disregard" of whether the intended use was unofficial. <span class="Italic">Gotshall v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 37 MSPR 27, 29 (1988). <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Semans v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 62 MSPR 502, 506-07 (1994) (as to the appellant's personal and unofficial use of a GOV, the appellant had a good-faith belief that his trips home were authorized by his supervisor, who was told by the appellant that he planned to go home on his days off and who made no comment to the appellant about his use of a GOV for that purpose; the appellant was properly suspended under the vehicle misuse statute, however, for loaning the GOV to another employee without inquiring when and why the individual was using the car).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Miles v. Dept. of Army</span>, 55 MSPR 633, 636-37 (1992), again interpreted <span class="Italic">Felton</span> to define "reckless" in a manner that essentially established a test of whether the appellant should have known that the vehicle misuse was unofficial:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also correctly concluded that the appellant was guilty of "willful misuse" of the government vehicle. Under 31 USC 1349(b), "[a]n officer or employee who willfully uses or authorizes the use of [a] passenger motor vehicle...owned or leased by the United States government (except for an official purpose authorized by section 1344 of this title) or otherwise violates section 1344 shall be suspended without pay by the head of the agency. The officer or employee shall be suspended for at least one month, and when circumstances warrant, for a longer period or summarily removed from office." In <span class="Italic">Felton</span>, the court defined "willful" in section 1349(b) to mean "voluntarily and consciously...with knowledge of or reckless disregard for whether...the intended use was for other than official purposes."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here the appellant's use was "willful." Contrary to the appellant's assertion, he voluntarily and consciously used the government vehicle to enter a restricted area. Whatever his motive in entering the area, the fact remains that he used the vehicle with reckless disregard for whether he was using it for official purposes. Although the appellant characterizes his motives for using the vehicle as humanitarian or as responding to an emergency, and states that he had no reason to know his intended use for the vehicle was an unofficial purpose, the evidence shows that the appellant did not secure permission to drive the vehicle onto the restricted area, nor did he secure permission for his intended use. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Felton</span> at 393 (the agency failed to prove that the appellant knowingly, consciously, and willfully authorized a subordinate employee to use a government vehicle for other than an official purpose where she authorized a subordinate to use a government vehicle to transport her to her car which had broken down and where the employee was needed at work as expeditiously as possible). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Madrid v. Department of Interior</span>, 37 MSPR 418, 422 (1988) (the appellant's voluntarily transporting an unauthorized individual in an official government vehicle for personal purposes constituted willful misuse)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Referencing <span class="Italic">Felton</span>, elements of knowledge and reckless disregard of vehicular use restrictions, as well as supervisory knowledge or approval of vehicular misuse, were addressed in <span class="Italic">Aiu v. DOJ</span>, 70 MSPR 509, 515-18 (1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Aiu v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 96-3289). The Board distinguished willful misuse of a vehicle from reckless disregard of known restrictions, although the test used for determining reckless disregard appeared to be the same as that for negligence, i.e., lack of reasonable care. As to supervisory approval of the use of a vehicle, one factor stressed by the Board was the authority delegated to the supervisor to approve the use:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutory provision at issue proscribes "willful" use of an OGV for a nonofficial purpose. <span class="Italic">See</span> 31 USC &#x00A7; 1349(b). In order for an action to constitute a "willful" use for a nonofficial purpose within the meaning of this provision, the officer or employee must have had actual knowledge that the use would be characterized as nonofficial or have acted in reckless disregard as to whether the use was for a nonofficial purpose. <span class="Italic">Kimm v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 61 F.3d 888, 891-92 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Felton v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 820 F.2d 391, 393-94 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her initial decision, the administrative judge found that the record supported the appellant's claim that John Graetz and Joseph Parra, the appellant's first- and second-line supervisors, respectively, knew or should have known that the appellant was using his OGV to go to law school and that there was at least tacit approval of the use. In this regard, she found that both supervisors testified that they did not tell the appellant he could use the OGV to go to law school, but also admitted that they never told him not to use the OGV for that purpose. Finding that Graetz was aware that the appellant arrived at the airport for work in his assigned OGV, she concluded that, based on the appellant's work schedule, Graetz should have been aware that he was arriving from UHSL. She further found that the agency had failed to show that the appellant engaged in willful misuse of a government vehicle because the appellant testified that he did not know that his use of the OGV was unauthorized, and she found no reason to discredit his testimony, particularly since he had consistently admitted the use, including when he was first approached by agency investigators. In addition, she found persuasive the appellant's contention that his attendance at UHSL was analogous to other agency-approved training, and she determined that he had otherwise acted in good faith with respect to his use of the OGV. On that basis, the administrative judge concluded that the appellant had not acted in "reckless disregard" as to whether his use of the OGV was unauthorized.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review...the agency cites the testimony of John Graetz, who testified that in September or October 1993, he asked the appellant whether he was driving his OGV to UHSL, and that the appellant responded by telling Graetz "You don't want to know."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that the appellant's response was an "obvious subterfuge and a clear attempt by the appellant to discourage his supervisor from making further inquiries into [his] use of the OGV." The agency further contends that the appellant's response reflected his state of mind because "it strongly implies that he [knew] that his use of the OGV was unofficial and therefore unauthorized." The agency argues that if the appellant believed that his use of the OGV was for an official purpose, he would not have thought that his supervisor would not have wanted to know about it, and that the appellant's response undermines his claim that "he had a good faith belief that his trips to and from law school had been sanctioned by his supervisors. For the reasons stated below, we disagree with the agency's argument but nonetheless find that a violation of 31 USC &#x00A7; 1349(b) has been established based on the record before us.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge found that the appellant credibly testified that he did not know that his use of the OGV was unauthorized, she noted but failed to discuss his statement to Graetz that Graetz did not "want to know" whether the appellant was using his OGV to commute to law school. The inference that the appellant was at least uncertain about whether his use of the OGV was authorized readily follows from this statement, as does the conclusion that (at a minimum) he was not eager to discover whether or not it was authorized or for anyone else to do so either. We cannot infer from this bare statement, however, <span id="Page_2797"></span>that the appellant had actual knowledge that his use of the OGV was unauthorized; the words used in that statement simply do not reveal enough about his state of mind for us to reach that conclusion regarding his intent. The statement to Graetz thus does not demonstrate that the administrative judge erred by finding that the appellant did not know that his use of the OGV was unauthorized. The agency's argument to the contrary therefore is not well-founded.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Proof of actual knowledge, however, is not the only basis for finding a violation of 31 USC &#x00A7; 1349(b); proof of reckless disregard as to whether use of an OGV is unauthorized is another means of establishing such a violation. <span class="Italic">See Kimm</span>, 61 F.3d at 891-92; <span class="Italic">Felton</span>, 820 F.2d at 393-94. The administrative judge found that "reckless disregard" had not been established here based on her conclusion that the appellant had acted in good faith. The statement to Graetz, however, belies that conclusion. As discussed above, it essentially indicates that the appellant suspected that his use of the OGV might be improper but that he preferred not to clear up this potential problem and did not wish Graetz to do so. We cannot agree, then, with the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant acted in good faith when he doubted the propriety of his own conduct but nonetheless decided to proceed with his use of the OGV despite those doubts and without any attempt to dispel them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">His behavior with respect to his use of his OGV also supports a finding that he knew or suspected that his use was unauthorized. In this connection, we note that he never requested permission from either Graetz or Parra to drive his OGV to law school, or officially informed them or anyone else at the agency that he was using his OGV to attend UHSL. In light of his statement to Graetz, the appellant's failure to request permission to use his OGV to commute to law school indicates that he knew or suspected that his use of his OGV was improper, and that any official request that he might have made might well have been denied. Finally, there is no basis in the record for finding, as the administrative judge did, that the appellant had "tacit approval" from Graetz and Parra to drive his OGV to law school. Graetz testified only that he should have known that the appellant was driving his OGV to UHSL, which is not an admission that he had tacitly approved the use. Neither Graetz nor Parra had the authority, moreover, to authorize him to use his OGV to commute to law school. Given this background, therefore, we conclude that the appellant used the OGV in reckless disregard as to whether such use was unauthorized and thus violated 31 USC &#x00A7; 1349(b). <span class="Italic">See Kimm</span>, 61 F.3d at 891-92; <span class="Italic">Felton</span>, 820 F.2d at 393.</p>

Transport of a family member violated agency regulations precluding unofficial use of a GOV and it did not constitute permissible "minor" personal use of the vehicle:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's Order expressly states that use of a GOV for official purposes includes "[f]urnishing transportation only to persons whose presence is deemed essential to the successful completion of the official mission." The Order provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Determining whether the transportation of a particular person is essential to the success of the mission demands the exercise of good judgment which will be guided by the following rules: 1) Transportation is not to be furnished to anyone unless the vehicle is being used on an official mission and the presence in the vehicle of each person transported is essential to the completion of the mission. 2) When foreseeable arrests and seizures are to be made, no private person will be transported in a Government vehicle unless there is an emergency and the help of such person is necessary for the protection of the special agent engaged in these activities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> A separate agency Order provides that "[p]ersons not deemed essential to the completion of an official mission can include other Bureau employees or family members." Any deviation from the above restrictions had to be authorized by the special agent in charge or higher authority. The appellant was aware of the agency's Orders regarding use of a GOV, and knew that he could not have "just anyone" in his GOV.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant testified that he believed that he was making the most efficient use of his and the agency's time by providing transportation to his son in the GOV during his wife's "medical emergency." The administrative judge agreed, finding that the appellant had a good faith belief that he had discretion to rectify a family emergency and simultaneously maximize the time he was available to perform his agency functions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that a reasonable person in the appellant's position could not have determined that the presence of his 3-year old son in the GOV was essential to the completion of an official mission. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Felton</span>, 820 F.2d at 394. Further, there is no indication in the record that, on the occasions when the appellant transported his son in his GOV, the presence of his son was necessary for the appellant's protection while engaged in foreseeable arrests and seizures. We therefore find that the appellant did not reasonably exercise the discretion afforded him under the agency's Orders, which did not permit the transportation of unauthorized persons in a GOV in order to maximize an employee's availability for work during a "medical emergency" involving a family member. We find that the purpose of the presence of the appellant's son in the GOV was to further the appellant's personal convenience in transporting his son to day care during his wife's illness. <span class="Italic">Cf. Wilber v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 42 MSPR 582, 590 (1989) (an employee's use of a GOV to transport a waitress from one bar to another bar was willful misuse, notwithstanding the employee's contention that the waitress was an informant and therefore an authorized passenger, because the employee presented no evidence that he and the waitress were engaged in an official operation)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the appellant's use of his GOV to transport his son to day care did not constitute minor personal use. The Board has held that, if use of a government vehicle involved minor personal use, a charge of willful use may not be sustained under circumstances indicating that the vehicle was used primarily to further agency business. <span class="Italic">See Lynch v. Department of Justice,</span> 32 MSPR 33 (1986) (two stops at a dentist's office on the employee's route of business); <span class="Italic">D'Elia v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 12 MSPB 242, 14 MSPR 54 (1982) (stop at a disco on the employee's return route to her hotel); <span class="Italic">Ferguson v. Department of the Army</span>, 8 MSPB 274, 8 MSPR 615 (1981) (stop at a residence with a GOV to pick up a personal vehicle). This appeal, however, does not involve minor personal use such as that presented in <span class="Italic">Lynch</span>, <span class="Italic">D'Elia</span>, and <span class="Italic">Ferguson</span>. Unlike those cases, the appellant here voluntarily transported an unauthorized individual for personal purposes. <span class="Italic">See Madrid,</span> 37 MSPR at 423. We find that, under the circumstances of this appeal, the "minor personal use" exception does not apply. Accordingly, we find that the agency proved by preponderant evidence that the appellant willfully used a GOV for other than official purposes.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kimm</span> was reversed by the Federal Circuit: "official use" must be tempered by an employee's good-faith interpretation of agency regulations governing use of government vehicles, <span class="Italic">Kimm v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 61 F.3d 888, 889-93 (Fed. Cir. 1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As support for the suspension, the agency cited Kimm's alleged admission to an agency investigator that Kimm had driven his son to day care in his GOV one time during November 1992 and on two or three other occasions during the preceding year....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an initial decision issued March 25, 1994, the AJ reversed the agency's action, holding that the agency failed to prove by preponderant evidence that Kimm willfully used his GOV for other than official reasons. The AJ summarized Kimm's testimony at his hearing regarding his belief that his GOV use would not constitute a nonofficial use under the circumstances as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[Kimm] testified that his position required him to be "on call" around the clock, seven days-a-week, that he was often called out in the middle of the night, and occasionally had to sleep in his GOV. He testified that his GOV was equipped with weapons and an encrypted radio, so that he could be in constant contact with his office. [He] testified that during August, 1992, he was working a great deal of overtime, was often the Acting Resident Agent in Charge, and that he had been heavily involved in an extremely dangerous conspiracy investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[Kimm] testified that he deviated from the most direct route to and from work by 2.6 miles each way in order to take his son to or from day care. [If Kimm] had taken his son to day care in a [personal vehicle], then returned home to obtain his GOV, and then proceeded to work, the round trip would have been 21.2 miles, and would have taken a total of approximately 40 minutes, due to heavy commuter traffic. [Kimm] testified that due to his extremely heavy work load and long hours, he believed that he was making the most efficient use of his and the agency's time by providing transportation to his son in the GOV during his wife's "medical emergency." [Kimm] testified that he believed the agency's regulations allowed him discretion to make a "minor deviation." He testified that it was standard practice, for example, to make minor deviations to find a place to eat dinner while on a mission, or to alter one's route to and from the office, if a death threat had been received. He also testified that the agency was lax in the enforcement of its GOV regulations, and cited a number of incidents that he believed had occurred to support this belief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on Kimm's testimony and on this court's decision in <span class="Italic">Felton v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 820 F.2d 391 (Fed. Cir. 1987), the AJ found that Kimm did not act with the requisite knowledge or reckless disregard that his GOV use constituted a nonofficial use. Instead, because Kimm was continuously on call and authorized to use his GOV <span id="Page_2798"></span>for commuting, the AJ found that "his belief that he had discretion to rectify a family emergency and simultaneously maximize the time he was available to perform his agency functions, was a good faith belief, and not in reckless disregard of the agency's regulations." Thus, the AJ found that the agency did not prove willful misuse within the meaning of &#x00A7; 1349(b). The agency petitioned the full board for review of the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 18, 1994, the board reversed the initial decision and sustained the suspension....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">Felton v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 820 F.2d 391 (Fed. Cir. 1987), we held that a violation of &#x00A7; 1349(b) required more than a showing that the employee intended to take the action that provided the foundation for the charge. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 393. Rather, in order for the action to constitute a willful use for a nonofficial purpose within the meaning of the act, the employee must have had actual knowledge that the use would be characterized as "nonofficial" or have acted in reckless disregard as to whether the use was for nonofficial purposes. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 394. The board in this case did not specify whether, in its view, the agency had proved that Kimm actually knew or had acted with reckless disregard of the nonofficial nature of his GOV use; however, the record supports neither view.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After hearing Kimm's testimony and considering all the evidence, the AJ specifically found that Kimm did not have actual knowledge that the use would constitute a nonofficial use. The AJ characterized Kimm's demeanor during his testimony as "straightforward and unwavering...and consistent with his written and oral replies." In contrast, the AJ found the agency's evidence "inherently improbable." The AJ considered the fact that Kimm is a highly decorated ATF agent with more than ten years of service, a flawless record, and an excellent reputation, making it unlikely that Kimm would knowingly violate a rule or, if he did so, would then lie about his motives. When, as with a determination concerning a witness's state of mind, the AJ's finding is explicitly or implicitly based on the demeanor of a witness, the board may not simply disagree with the AJ's assessment of credibility. <span class="Italic">Chauvin v. Department of Navy,</span> 38 F.3d 563, 566 (Fed. Cir. 1994). If the board reverses such a finding, we will not sustain its decision on appeal unless the board has articulated sound reasons, based on the record, for its contrary evaluation of the testimonial evidence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, the board did not articulate any reason for a contrary evaluation of the testimony and we therefore will not sustain its decision to the extent that it was based on Kimm's knowledge that the use of the GOV was nonofficial.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ also specifically determined that the agency did not prove that Kimm acted with "reckless disregard" concerning whether the use was for other than official purposes. Rather, the AJ held that, under the circumstances, Kimm could reasonably have determined that his GOV use would promote the successful operation of the agency by saving considerable time and by maintaining contact with his agency during a time when Kimm was on call around the clock. In reversing the AJ, the board stated that "the agency's Orders...did not permit the transportation of unauthorized persons in a GOV in order to maximize an employee's availability for work during a 'medical emergency' involving a family member."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's policy with regard to GOV use provides that employees are responsible for using GOVs for official purposes only, including transporting only those persons whose presence is essential to the successful completion of an official mission. <span class="Italic">See</span> ATF Order 1850.1A, 1850.6A, 2735.1, 3000.1D. The agency orders provide that "[p]ersons not deemed essential to the completion of an official mission can include other Bureau employees or family members." ATF Order 2735.1. The orders also call for the employee's exercise of judgment in determining whether the transportation of a particular person is essential to the success of the mission. ATF Order 1850.1A.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the board stated, the agency policy does not specify that the conduct at issue here is permitted. However, the policy does not set forth specific types of conduct and characterize the official nature of each; the policy calls only for good faith judgment by an employee. Kimm does not dispute that he was aware of the agency policy and of the impropriety of using a GOV for other than official purposes; however, whether a use constitutes a nonofficial purpose leaves room for the exercise of judgment, which, under the circumstances, Kimm did not improperly exercise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In particular, Kimm was involved in an around-the-clock, dangerous investigation, which required him to be on call at all times. He was authorized to commute to work in his GOV, which contained specialized equipment necessary to remain in contact with the agency. Kimm was under considerable stress, not only from long hours of overtime, but from the possibility of his wife miscarrying. Kimm was also aware of the culture of the agency, which allowed minor deviations in the use of GOVs. Given the circumstances, Kimm could reasonably have concluded that bringing his son to and from day care on his way to and from work during a limited medical emergency, saving time and maintaining contact with his agency, was essential to successful completion of his mission. Even if Kimm could have first secured permission to transport his son, his failure to do so given the circumstances does not amount to "reckless disregard" for the regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board also concluded that "a reasonable person in [Kimm's] position could not have determined that the presence of his 3-year old son in the GOV was essential to the completion of an official mission." To support this conclusion, the board explained that on the occasions in question, the presence of Kimm's son was not actually necessary for Kimm's protection. However, whether Kimm's son was necessary for Kimm's protection is not probative as to whether Kimm was reckless in his disregard for regulations or whether he reasonably believed that he should use the GOV on a particular occasion to promote the success of his mission. Thus, the reason the board disagreed with the AJ is not relevant to the question whether a reasonable person should have known that the use of the vehicle under the circumstances of this case would be held to constitute use for a nonofficial purpose.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is of course absurd to consider the presence of a three-year-old child as being necessary for Kimm's protection. The point is whether, under the circumstances, Kimm's use of the GOV was in reckless disregard as to whether the use was nonofficial. Clearly, Kimm was not acting in reckless disregard. Kimm thought he was conscientiously fulfilling his duties to the best of his ability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, there is no evidence of record to support a finding that Kimm knew or should have known that the use of the vehicle in the circumstances of this case would be held to constitute use for a nonofficial purpose or that he acted in reckless disregard for whether the use was or was not for an official purpose. Official use was left to good judgment and we think it clear that Kimm could reasonably have determined that the use would promote the success of his mission by saving time and maintaining contact with the agency when he was authorized to commute and was on call at all times.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The finding of the board that Kimm willfully used a GOV for other than an official purpose is not supported by substantial evidence. Therefore, we reverse.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency regulation governs permitted uses of government vehicles, evidence that explains the intent of the regulation is relevant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ford v. DHUD</span>, 450 F. Supp. 559, 564 (N.D. Ill. 1978). But past practice at the agency may not convince the Board that an action against an employee cannot be sustained, <span class="Italic">Davis v. GSA</span>, 4 MSPR 525, 527 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant has contended that he was merely following the agency practice of using government vehicles for non-governmental purposes and that he followed the "normal business practice" at the facility of not verifying whether permission had been granted for the requested use. In view of the presiding official's specific findings that appellant had full knowledge of the circumstances of the unauthorized use based on his own admissions, these contentions, even if true, do not establish that appellant's conduct was not willful.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">There is usually no dispute concerning the pedigree of a vehicle. The vehicle misuse statute is quite specific. 31 USC 1349(b) creates the offense of willful use of a passenger motor vehicle owned or leased by the United States government for other than official purposes. A government traveler's misuse of a rental car from a commercial rental firm did not violate the statute when the vehicle, although authorized through a travel voucher, was rented through a rental agreement directly to the traveler and was paid for with a government-issued credit card that the employee bore the responsibility for paying. The government never assumed responsibility for direct payment for the rental; no lease or ownership interest was created. <span class="Italic">Chufo v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 45 F.3d 419 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon our review of the record, it appears that agency charged the appellant with misuse of a government vehicle without citing the statutory provision barring the willful use of a government vehicle for personal use. 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1349(b) (prohibiting the willful use of an OGV for nonofficial purposes); <span class="Italic">Aiu</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. at 515.
