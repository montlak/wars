<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-306"><span class="space">2.</span> Sanction Against Appellant</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Sanctions up to and including dismissal may be applied against appellants who do not comply with discovery orders. <span class="Italic">Butler v. Smithsonian Inst.</span>, 10 MSPR 644, 646 (1982). Sanctions are appropriate, under <span class="Italic">Abbott v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 18 MSPR 429, 432-433 &#x00B6; 6 (1983), against an appellant who fails to respond to discovery requests calling for information about what specifically the appellant believes was improper about an agency RIF action. In <span class="Italic">Abbott</span>, the AJ effectively imposed the sanction of precluding the appellants from obtaining a hearing. If an appellant fails to answer interrogatories on an affirmative defense, e.g., discrimination, raised during the appeal, the AJ may strike that claim as a sanction for the failure to comply with a discovery order requiring a response to the interrogatories. <span class="Italic">Moody v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 14 MSPR 453, 454 (1983), <span class="Italic">following remand from EEOC</span>, 30 MSPR 9, 12 (1986) (AJ need not find an appellant's actions to be willful or in bad faith before applying sanctions); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Robinson v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/ROBINSON_SIMUEL_CH_0752_02_0471_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_248734.pdf">94 MSPR 509</a>, 517 &#x00B6; 16 (2003)<span class="Italic"></span> (AJ had authority to impose some sanction short of dismissal against a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant who failed to attend a deposition that was required by an AJ's order). In <span class="Italic">Nickerson v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 451, 460-61 (1991), the AJ declined to consider a defense of harmful error after the appellant failed to obey an order directing a response to an interrogatory requiring the appellant to identify and explain allegations of harmful error that he intended to raise. It was immaterial that the appellant mentioned harmful error in his statement of issues at another stage of the case. Because the appellant had discovery processes available to him, <span class="Italic">Nickerson</span> found unpersuasive the appellant's contention that he could not answer the interrogatory until he heard the hearing testimony of two agency witnesses<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit determined that the AJ could refuse to permit an appellant to testify in support of an affirmative defense after the appellant failed to respond to interrogatories relating to that defense. <span class="Italic">Harp v. Dept. of Army</span>, 791 F.2d 161 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Cancelation of a hearing was affirmed as a sanction, <span class="Italic">Nasuti v. Dept. of State</span>, 675 Fed. Appx. 975, 980 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to Mr. Nasuti's contention, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a), which provides that a federal employee who appeals to the Board "shall have the right...to a hearing for which a transcript will be kept," did not entitle him to a hearing regardless of whether he complied with the administrative judge's discovery orders. In <span class="Italic">Ahlberg v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 804 F.2d 1238 (Fed. Cir. 1986), we held that &#x00A7; 7701(a) did not preclude the Board from dismissing an appeal under &#x00A7; 1201.43 for failure to prosecute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1244-45. There, the presiding official "warned" the appellants that their refusal to comply with an order to provide certain requested information would result in the dismissal of their appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1242. We upheld the Board's actions, explaining that the appellants' failure to comply, despite the warning, "waived any right they may have had to a hearing." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1243.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge warned Mr. Nasuti that his continued failure to comply with the administrative judge's discovery orders would result in the cancellation of the hearing. Nevertheless, Mr. Nasuti refused to comply with those orders and did not substantiate his reasons for doing so. Mr. Nasuti further asserted that the Board proceedings were "moot" because the administrative judge was not interested in holding an "expeditious or thorough hearing on the merits." As we explained in <span class="Italic">Ahlberg</span>, &#x00A7; 7701 is not so absolute as to require the Board to hold a hearing in the face of such repeated defiance. <span class="Italic">See Ahlberg</span>, 804 F.2d at 1243.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that Mr. Nasuti argues that the administrative judge abused his discretion in imposing sanctions under &#x00A7; 1201.43, we disagree. The administrative judge cancelled the hearing only after Mr. Nasuti refused to comply with the administrative judge's discovery orders on two separate occasions--and only after Mr. Nasuti was warned that continued refusal would result in cancellation. This is not a case in which a hearing was cancelled despite the presence of a good excuse for the conduct that led to the cancellation. <span class="Italic">Compare Habtemariam v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 180 Fed. Appx. 968, 970-71 (Fed. Cir. 2006). We cannot say that Mr. Nasuti's behavior did not rise to the level of "contumacious conduct or conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice" for which cancellation of a hearing is within the Board's discretion. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Yet the Board modified a sanction of issue preclusion in <span class="Italic">Thorne v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 30 MSPR 408, 410 (1986), declaring that it would not preclude an EEO affirmative defense for failure to answer interrogatories. The need for a complete record outweighed the need for the sanction if the case went to court or to EEOC. The appeal was remanded for rehearing, with permission for the AJ to consider a lesser sanction, e.g., an adverse inference against the appellant. Care should be taken to avoid a negative inference, or negative finding, when the lack of evidence is the result of a sanction barring the introduction of evidence for failure to comply with a discovery order. <span class="Italic">Dunbar v.

<p class="Body-Text">The sanction of dismissal of an appeal is a serious matter reserved for extreme misconduct. Although a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant cannot avoid sanctions because of his unrepresented status, it is inappropriate to dismiss his appeal because he failed, after attempting a response, to provide a complete reply to an agency motion for a more definite statement of the basis for his appeal. Also, "when there are significant adjudicatory facts in dispute, such factor weighs against dismissal." <span class="Italic">Hoyt v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 19 MSPR 21, 23 (1984). The Board will not dismiss an appeal for failure by the appellant to obey a discovery order, but the Board may impose a sanction that essentially results in a dismissal. In <span class="Italic">Roth v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 54 MSPR 172, 176-77 (1992), an involuntary resignation case, the appellant failed to obey an order directing her to appear for a deposition called by the agency. The AJ, citing deliberate disobedience and prejudice to the agency, sanctioned the appellant by drawing an inference that all of the appellant's claims of involuntariness lacked support. He then canceled the hearing for lack of a basis for Board jurisdiction. An order was then issued dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The Board approved the AJ's approach:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rule 37 identifies sanctions available if a party fails to obey an order to provide discovery. <span class="Italic">See</span> Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2). The evidentiary sanction imposed in the case at hand, drawing "an inference favorable to the agency that all of [the appellant's] claims of involuntariness of her resignation [were]lacking in support," is within the sanctions available under Rule 37. Further, the Board does not prohibit the imposition of an evidentiary sanction for a single failure to obey a discovery order. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Murdock v. GPO</span>, 38 MSPR 297, 299 (1988) (a single failure to comply with a Board order is insufficient to support a dismissal for failure to prosecute). Although the sanction imposed here led to dismissal for lack of Board jurisdiction, because jurisdiction could only be established by proof that the appellant's resignation was involuntary, the sanction itself was not dismissal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Traditionally, courts have not allowed an imposed sanction to result in dismissal on the merits except on the clearest showing that this course was required. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wright and Miller</span>, <span class="Italic">Federal Practice and Procedure</span>: &#x00A7; 2284. The reason for the party's failure to comply has been the pivotal consideration in determining what sanction to impose. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Societe Internationale Pour Participations Industrielles et Commerciales, S.A. v. Rogers</span>, 357 U.S. 197, 78 S. Ct. 1087, 2 L. Ed.2d 1255 (1958). In the past twenty years or so, courts have taken a stricter view of sanctions for discovery violations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc</span>. 427 U.S. 639, 96 S. Ct. 2778, 49 L. Ed.2d 747 (1976). If the failure to make discovery is willful, however, a court may well order dismissal or a default judgment even though less drastic sanctions are available. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Morgan v. Massachusetts General Hosp.</span>, 901 F.2d 186, 195 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that a sanction for a single failure to obey a discovery order <span id="Page_1295"></span>should allow the extreme result of dismissal in Board appeals only if the appellant's defiance of a discovery order is willful. Here, although the CALJ did not specifically find whether the appellant's actions were willful, upon examination of the record, we find that they were. "Willful" is defined as "proceeding from a conscious motion of the will; voluntary. Intending the result which actually comes to pass; designed; intentional; not accidental." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span>, 5th Edition at 1434. The appellant's failure to appear at the deposition was willful to the extent that she acted voluntarily, intentionally, and with the specific intent to disobey the order of the CALJ to attend the deposition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant had not received an amended order from the judge after she explained her reasons for objecting to his order to attend the deposition, and thus knew that she was required to attend. Further, the appellant did not show that incapacitation because of illness kept her from attending the deposition. In her opposition to the agency's motion for sanctions, the appellant stated that she was fearful of being subjected to a hostile deposition and she determined that she could not risk that stress and exasperation. The appellant did not, however, present any medical evidence of incapacity or medical consequences as a result of appearing for the deposition. As the CALJ stated, more is required than fear of stress and exasperation to establish a valid reason to evade the legal obligation to appear at the deposition. The appropriate action for the appellant would have been to attend the deposition and, if it turned unduly stressful or abusive, to seek a ruling from a judge limiting questioning or continuing the deposition. The CALJ's sanction, which resulted in dismissal of the appeal, was not, therefore, an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bilger v. Department of Justice</span>, 33 MSPR 602, 607 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 847 F.2d 842 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has the authority, through its administrative judges, to order compliance with its orders and to enforce compliance through sanctions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43. Such sanctions may be imposed upon the parties as necessary to serve the ends of justice. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43. As a general rule, appellants are subject to the same sanctions as agencies; consequently, administrative judges may apply sanctions up to dismissal against appellants who do not follow discovery orders in the same fashion as they apply them to agencies. <span class="Italic">Butler v. Smithsonian Institution</span>, 10 M.S.P.R. 644, 646 (1982); <span class="Italic">see Moody v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 14 M.S.P.R. 453, 454 (1983). Once an administrative judge imposes a sanction, the Board will not ordinarily disturb such a determination unless it is shown that the administrative judge abused his discretion or that his ruling adversely affected a party's substantive rights. <span class="Italic">Bilger v. Department of Justice,</span> 33 M.S.P.R. 602, 607 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 847 F.2d 842 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table)<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues that the administrative judge erred by imposing sanctions because he provided a response to the agency's discovery requests on the due date imposed by the administrative judge's second order compelling discovery. According to the agency, the appellant submitted only a partial response to its discovery request, and submitted that partial response untimely, i.e., after 5:00 <small>P.M.</small> on February 3, 2006. We note that neither party ever informed the administrative judge that the appellant had filed any discovery responses, whether partial or otherwise, although both parties had an ample opportunity to do so at some point between the date the responses were filed, February 3, 2006, and the date the initial decision was issued, May 23, 2006. Under these circumstances, we find that the administrative judge did not abuse her discretion in imposing a sanction because the record before her did not show that the appellant had complied with her discovery order. However, we find it appropriate to reopen this appeal and reconsider the agency's motion for sanctions for the following three reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, a mere 81 minutes after the agency notified the administrative judge that the appellant had not provided it with discovery responses, the appellant faxed his responses to the agency. The agency could easily have amended its notice of non-compliance to inform the administrative judge that the appellant had responded, and, in fact, the administrative judge did not impose sanctions until three days after the agency filed the notice of non-compliance. The agency may have believed that 6:18 <small>P.M.</small> was after the "close of business," but whether it truly was, and whether any tardiness should have been excused, were determinations for the administrative judge to make, not the agency. <span class="Italic">Cf. Williams v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 144, 148-49 (1997) (criticizing the agency's "gamesmanship" in arguing that an appeal should be dismissed as untimely filed when all along the agency possessed a certified mail return receipt proving that the appeal had been timely filed).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the administrative judge's final warning to the appellant before she imposed sanctions did not explain what "close of business" meant. "Close of business" is not defined in the Board's regulations either. When a document must be filed with the Board, it is considered timely if it is transmitted electronically or placed into the mail stream any time before midnight on the due date. <span class="Italic">See Fisher v. Department of Defense</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 165, 169 (1993); <span class="Italic">Dooley v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 684, 686 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 22 F.3d 1105 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). The record does not reveal any reason why it was important that the appellant send his discovery responses to the agency by "close of business" on February 3 instead of simply any time before February 4. There is also no evidence, or even any allegation, that the agency was prejudiced because it received the discovery responses at 6:18 <small>P.M.</small> on February 3 rather than some earlier time that day. Under the circumstances, we deem the appellant to have substantially complied with the deadline for discovery responses imposed by the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">Cf. Stauner v. Department of the Interior</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 179, 182, &#x00B6; 2 (2000) (where the appellant's attorney appeared not to understand that the administrative judge expected him to file a brief by 5:00 <small>P.M.</small> on a particular day, and he faxed his brief to the administrative judge at 10:00 <small>P.M.</small> that day, the administrative judge should have considered the brief).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, even assuming that the appellant's discovery responses were inadequate as the agency alleges, and that the appellant did not comply with the administrative judge's order, the sanction imposed was excessive. An administrative judge may impose sanctions "as necessary to serve the ends of justice." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43(a). Because this appeal involves a removal action taken under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512, 7513(d), the agency bears the burden of proving its charges by a preponderance of the evidence, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B), and it should not have removed the appellant, a tenured public employee, if it did not have evidence to support its charges. The discovery requests at issue were not aimed at obtaining evidence to help the agency meet its burden of proof, but instead sought information on how the appellant might attempt to explain his conduct or otherwise rebut the charges. Accordingly, deeming the agency to have proven its charges because the appellant did not respond to the agency's discovery requests was not appropriate. Rather, an appropriate sanction would have been to preclude the appellant from putting on evidence in support of any defense or rebuttal to the charges with respect to which he had not provided discovery responses. The Board's regulation envisions exactly such a sanction in an appropriate case, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43(a)(2), and assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant's discovery responses did not comply with the administrative judge's order, this is such a case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, while the Board is not bound by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, it may look to them for guidance. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72(a); <span class="Italic">Kravitz v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 44, 47 (1997). Doing so is appropriate here because the standard under the Federal Rules for imposing sanctions for failure to cooperate in discovery--what the court determines is "just" under the circumstances--is similar to the "necessary to serve the ends of justice" standard in the Board's regulations. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2); <span class="Italic">see Chimie v. PPG Industries, Inc.</span>, 402 F.3d 1371, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (a district court has broad discretion to impose a "just" sanction for a party's failure to provide discovery responses, such as precluding the party from introducing designated matters into evidence).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A sanction under the Federal Rules should be "proportionate" to the offense, and, when the possibility of a severe sanction is raised, a court should consider carefully whether a lesser sanction would be more appropriate for a particular violation. <span class="Italic">Bonds v. District of Columbia</span>, 93 F.3d 801, 808 (D.C. Cir. 1996). A "litigation-ending" sanction or a sanction that "approaches a default judgment" is a last resort, considering the value that the American judicial system places on getting to the merits of controversies. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Here, relieving the agency of its burden of proving its charges and sustaining those charges was not proportionate to the appellant's failure to respond to discovery requests directed at obtaining information on the evidence he intended to produce to defend against or rebut the charges. Thus, principles developed under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure also lead to the conclusion that a more appropriate sanction would have been to preclude the appellant from presenting evidence related to the disputed discovery requests. Such a sanction is "just" because it recognizes that, although "relevant and perhaps dispositive [evidence]" is being excluded, fairness dictates that evidence be subject to "fair testing [by the opposing party] in an even handed process." <span class="Italic">Perez-Perez v. Popular Leasing Rental, Inc.</span>, 993 F.2d 281, 287 n.4 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The remaining issue here is whether the appellant should be sanctioned at all. The agency contends that the appellant's discovery responses were incomplete but, because the agency does not elaborate and neither party has submitted those responses, it is unclear what evidence, if any, the appellant should be precluded from introducing. If, for example, the appellant responded to discovery requests relating to the first and second charges but not to the third charge, precluding him from presenting evidence to rebut the first and second charges would be <span id="Page_1296"></span>disproportionate to the offense and would not "serve the ends of justice." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43(a). We find that it is necessary to remand this appeal in order to determine whether the appellant complied with the administrative judge's discovery order and, if not, what sanction, if any, is appropriate for his non-compliance, taking into account the principles discussed above.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is enough for us, in this appeal, to focus on an aspect of the culpability component. Specifically, following the Supreme Court, we have long held that dismissal as a discovery sanction "is authorized only when the failure to comply with [a] court order is due to willfulness or bad faith and not from the inability to comply with the order." <span class="italic">Hendler</span>, 952 F.2d at 1382 (citing <span class="italic">National Hockey League</span>, 427 U.S. at 640); <span class="italic">see Societe Internationale</span>, 357 U.S. at 212; <span class="italic">Ingalls Shipbuilding</span>, 857 F.2d at 1451; <span class="italic">Adkins v.

The Claims Court's decision here departed from that legal rule.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Instead, the administrative judge canceled the hearing and provided the parties the opportunity to introduce additional evidence and argument before she decided the appeal based on the written record.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, considering the administrative judge's granting of the agency's motion to compel, the clarity of the administrative judge's instructions, the appellant's failure to comply with those instructions, and the appellant's responses to the show cause order, we find that preponderant evidence demonstrates that the appellant intended to provide nonresponsive answers to the agency's discovery requests and disobey the administrative judge's order.

Department of Homeland Security</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 67, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13, 15 (2007) (an appropriate sanction for the appellant's failure to respond to the agency's discovery requests would have been to preclude the appellant from putting on evidence in support of any defense or rebuttal to the charges with respect to which he had not provided discovery responses; such a sanction is "just" under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure because it recognizes that although "relevant and perhaps dispositive evidence is being excluded, fairness dictates that evidence be subject to fair testing by the opposing party in an even[-] handed process") (internal citations omitted). To the extent that the appellant claims that the administrative judge precluded her from testifying, the appellant withdrew her request for a hearing and requested a decision based on the written record <span class="Italic">before</span> the administrative judge ruled on the motion for sanctions. Thus, any failure to testify resulted from the appellant's withdrawal of her hearing request, not from any action by the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant contends that the administrative judge erred in imposing the sanction because she did not first provide written notice of an intent to impose a sanction and an opportunity to respond, the appellant has identified no Board regulation or other authority supporting such a requirement. While chapter 3, paragraph 7 of the <span class="Italic">Judge's Handbook</span>, entitled "Acknowledgment and Show Cause Orders," does provide that "the Board requires that even beyond jurisdiction, the [administrative judge] must provide an explanation of the burdens and methods of proof of any claim as to which the appellant has some or all of the burden of proof or production in an appeal," it does not require written notice and an opportunity to respond prior to imposing sanctions for a party's failure to comply with an administrative judge's written order that notifies the party that sanctions may be imposed for failure to comply. In fact, chapter 8, paragraph 9 of the <span class="Italic">Judge's Handbook</span> provides that administrative judges have the authority to order the taking of depositions, and that the Board has upheld the imposition of sanctions for a party's failure to comply with discovery orders.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, the sanction at issue prohibited the appellant from presenting additional evidence regarding her claim of disability discrimination. Because such a claim of discrimination may not be brought in an IRA appeal, the appellant has not shown that the administrative judge's sanction affected her substantive rights in the IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">See Marren v. Department of Justice</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 632, 638-39 (1991) (IRA appeals are not subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701 or &#x00A7; 7702; thus, the Board lacks the authority to decide, in conjunction with an IRA appeal, the merits of an allegation of discrimination), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 980 F.2d 745 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table), <span class="Italic">and modified on other grounds by Robinson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 307, 323 n.13 (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1297"></span><span class="italic">See</span> <span class="italic">Huffman v. Dept. of Navy</span>, DC-0752-14-0047-I-1 (NP 4/5/2023) (affirming sanction precluding appellant from testifying or from submitting evidence that was the subject of the order granting the agency's motion to compel).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant fails to cooperate in discovery, sanctions are appropriate, up to dismissal, for failure to comply with discovery orders; however, a timely-filed appeal should not be dismissed for failure to prosecute in the absence of bad faith or evidence that the appellant intends to abandon his appeal. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 108 MSPR 592, 597 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16, 2008 MSPB 95 (2008) (reinstating appeal when the AJ apparently did not recognize that the appellant produced the evidence that was ordered; noting also that good faith efforts falling short of full compliance should be considered in determining whether dismissal is an appropriate sanction). <span class="Italic">Brown v. MSPB</span>, 455 Fed. Appx. 982 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP), sustained dismissal of an appeal for failure to prosecute when the appellant failed to cooperate in attending a discovery deposition and when the appellant failed to respond to other orders issued by the AJ. [Discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-09-297.html#sec2-294">Failure to Prosecute Appeal</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ's rulings on discovery, and associated sanctions for failure to comply with discovery orders, are subject to review for abuse of discretion. Sanctions were set aside in <span class="Italic">Dunbar v. Dept. of Transp</span>., DC-0752-14-1003-I-1 (NP 11/15/2016). The AJ failed to explain the status of discovery during a case suspension, the agency filed motions concerning discovery without first consulting with the appellant, and the AJ ruled on those motions without allowing the appellant a reasonable time to respond to the motions. One or more of the AJ's rulings were issued during the period of the case suspension, when the better procedure would have been to take the case off suspension to adjudicate those motions.</p>
