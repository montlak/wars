<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-50"><span class="space">k.</span> Error or Lack of Authority of Government Counsel</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The decisions just described involve settlements reached by counsel that are then repudiated by appellants as unauthorized. What happens when the agency attorney is alleged to err on behalf of the agency? Will the Board hold the agency to the errors of counsel? The issue was raised but not decided in <span class="Italic">Burton v. DHHS</span>, 45 MSPR 37, 40 (1990) (remanded for more factfinding by the AJ). Addressing the conundrum of the government attorney whose settlement is unauthorized, <span class="Italic">Wesselhoft v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 46 MSPR 594, 596-98 (1991), abandoned any notion of a presumption that a government attorney who settles binds the government, and created a special rule to protect agencies (permitting settlements to be unraveled through protestations of lack of agency authority):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency designated attorney Curtis Anderson as its representative in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the scheduled hearing, the administrative judge stated that, prior to "going on the record," the parties had "continued" with settlement negotiations. The settlement agreement was then read into the record. The terms of the settlement agreement provided in relevant part that the agency would pay the appellant's attorney fees and costs in the amount of $40,000.00. Anderson stated that the agency accepted the terms of the agreement.... Finding that the agreement was lawful on its face and was reached freely by the parties, the administrative judge entered it into the record for purposes of enforcement and dismissed the appeal as settled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has filed a petition for review contending that Anderson was not authorized by the agency to enter into a settlement agreement involving payment of $40,000.00 in attorney fees. The agency asserts that, under its internal delegations concerning the conduct of administrative and judicial litigation, as set forth in its Solicitor's Manual, a settlement involving the payment of attorney fees of $20,000.00 or more must be approved by the agency's Solicitor. The agency alleges that in this case Anderson failed to obtain the Solicitor's approval of the settlement agreement.[1] In response, the appellant argues that the agency is bound by the actions of its attorney.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In support of its contention, the agency has submitted the signed declaration of Timothy S. Elliott, Acting Associate Solicitor for the agency, in which he states that, due to the amount of attorney fees involved, Anderson was required by the Solicitor's Manual to secure approval of the settlement agreement from the Solicitor, but that he failed to do so. The agency has also proffered a portion of Part I, Chapter 8 of its Solicitor's Manual that contains the delegation requiring the Solicitor's approval of settlements involving payment of attorney fees for more than $20,000.00.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant first contends that the settlement should be upheld because the agency has not met its burden of proving that it is invalid. In support of this argument, appellant cites a number of cases holding that the party attacking a settlement carries a heavy burden.... However, none of the cited cases involve a challenge to a settlement on the basis that the Government's agent lacked authority to enter into it. Indeed, it is <span id="Page_4822"></span>well settled that a purported agreement with the United States is not binding unless the other party can show that the official with whom the agreement was made had authority to bind the Government to the agreement<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Crop Insurance Corp. v. Merrill</span>, 332 U.S. 380, 384-85, 68 S. Ct. 1, 3, 92 L. Ed. 10 (1947); <span class="Italic">Mil-Spec Contractors, Inc. v. United States</span>, 835 F.2d 865, 867 (Fed. Cir. 1987).... While it is unnecessary to prove the agent's authority in every case, where the agency makes a non-frivolous claim that its agent lacked authority, the appellant bears the burden of proving that the agent had authority to bind the agency. Here the agency has offered evidence which, if true, raises a legitimate issue about Anderson's authority to bind the agency to the payment of $40,000 in attorney fees. Accordingly, for the settlement to be upheld, the appellant must prove that Anderson was acting within his authority when he agreed to the settlement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next appellant argues that the agency is estopped from denying its attorney's authority by the doctrine of apparent authority. Apparent authority exists "as to a third person by written or spoken words or any other conduct of the principal which, reasonably interpreted, causes the third person to believe that the principal consents to have the act done on his behalf by the [agent]." <span class="Italic">Restatement (Second) of Agency</span> &#x00A7; 27 (1958). Appellant contends that, by its actions, the agency clothed Anderson with the apparent authority to settle the case and, as a result, the agency is bound by the agreement. The doctrine of apparent authority, however, does not apply to the Government. <span class="Italic">H. Landau &#x0026; Co. v. United States</span>, 886 F.2d 322, 324 (Fed. Cir. 1989). The Government can be bound by an agent only if the agent has actual authority. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Therefore, even if the agency caused the appellant to believe that Anderson had authority to agree to $40,000 in attorney fees, that belief would be insufficient to bind the agency. Unauthorized acts taken by an agent do not bind the government....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, appellant asserts that Anderson had implied actual authority to enter into the agreement. Actual authority (express or implied) may be created by "written or spoken words or other conduct of the principal which, reasonably interpreted, causes the agent to believe that the principal desires him so to act on the principal's account." <span class="Italic">Restatement (Second) of Agency</span> &#x00A7; 26.... Unlike apparent authority, express or implied actual authority is sufficient to bind the Government to an agreement entered into by its agent....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the record, it is unclear whether Anderson had actual authority to enter into the attorney fee agreement. The agency has submitted a portion of the Solicitor's Manual indicating that Anderson needed the advance approval of the Solicitor before he was authorized to agree to $40,000 in fees, and it has submitted an affidavit stating that he did not obtain advance approval. However, appellant has not had an opportunity to contest that evidence, and he has not had the opportunity to conduct discovery and introduce his own evidence on the issue of actual authority. In addition, he has suggested in his response to the petition for review that high-level management officials outside of the Solicitor's Office approved the settlement. Given these circumstances, we believe that a hearing must be held before the issue may be decided.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If, after a hearing, the administrative judge finds that Anderson had either express or implied actual authority to settle the attorney fees for $40,000, the settlement shall be enforced and the agency shall be ordered to pay the fees. If, on the other hand, Anderson did not have authority to settle the attorney fees, the administrative judge shall vacate the initial decision and reinstate the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wesselhoft</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Russell v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 85 MSPR 230, 231-33 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-6 (2000), remanding to determine the agency representative's authority to settle an appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appealed her indefinite suspension from a GS-11 Electronics Technician position, effective August 29, 1998, pending the agency's investigation of her alleged unlawful sale of drugs on duty. During a January 5, 1999 tape-recorded telephonic settlement conference, the administrative judge asked the appellant and agency representative Lynn Rizer, Labor and Employee Relations Division, to state their oral settlement reached on the appellant's appeal. Following their responses, she again asked them whether they agreed to the terms of the settlement. The appellant and Rizer responded affirmatively. The settlement agreement provided, in relevant part, that the agency would cancel the appellant's indefinite suspension and place her on administrative leave, effective October 28, 1998, until the agency decided its proposed removal action charging her with the unlawful sale of drugs while on duty. With the parties' consent, the administrative judge entered the tape-recorded settlement agreement into the record for enforcement purposes. The administrative judge then issued an initial decision, dismissing the appeal as settled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency timely petitions for review, asserting that the settlement is invalid primarily because Rizer had no authority to settle the appeal. As support for its assertion, the agency submits declarations from Rizer and deciding official Robert Siciliani, attesting to Rizer's lack of actual authority to settle the appeal. Additionally, the agency submits paragraph 3a(10) of its Human Resources Office Procedures (HRO-OP) 12772.1 (Oct. 11, 1998) for Board appeals, which states that Central Office, Labor and Employee Relations Branch employees must "[d]iscuss Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) and settlement options with management and obtain ADR/settlement authority as appropriate." The same document also states that it is management's responsibility to "[p]rovide ADR and/or settlement authority to management representatives."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In asserting that Rizer had no actual authority to settle this appeal, the agency relies on <span class="Italic">Wesselhoft v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Interior,</span> 46 MSPR 594 (1991). There, we restated the well-settled proposition that "a purported agreement with the United States is not binding unless the other party can show that the official with whom the agreement was made had authority to bind the Government to the agreement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 596-97. We addressed the term "authority," noting that "[a]ctual authority (express or implied) may be created by 'written or spoken words or other conduct of the principal which, reasonably interpreted, causes the agent to believe that the principal desires him so to act on the principal's account"'; and finding that express or implied actual authority will bind the Government to an agreement entered into by its agent. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 597-98 (quoting <span class="Italic">Restatement (Second) of Agency</span> &#x00A7; 26 (1958)). By contrast, apparent authority, which exists "as to a third person by written or spoken words or any other conduct of the principal which, reasonably interpreted, causes the third person to believe that the principal consents to have the act done on his behalf by the [agent]," does not bind the Government to an agreement entered into by its agent. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 597 (quoting <span class="Italic">Restatement (Second) of Agency</span> &#x00A7; 27 (1958)); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Leiser v. Department of Justice,</span> 64 MSPR 543, 548 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 64 F.3d 678 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While it is unnecessary to prove the agent's authority in every ease, where the agency makes a nonfrivolous claim that its agent lacked authority, the appellant bears the burden of proving that the agent had authority to bind the agency. <span class="Italic">Wesselhoft,</span> 46 MSPR at 597. We found that the agency in <span class="Italic">Wesselhoft</span> set forth such a nonfrivolous claim, given its submission on review of a policy manual requiring its representative to obtain advance approval from the Solicitor for settlement agreements authorizing attorney fees and a declaration from the agency's Acting Associate Solicitor, stating that the representative had no such advance approval. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 596 n.1, 598. Additionally, we noted the appellant's assertions to the contrary on review and the fact that he had not yet had the opportunity to conduct discovery and introduce evidence to meet his burden of proof on the matter. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 598.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as in <span class="Italic">Wesselhoft</span>, the agency asserts through its HRO-OP policy, and declarations from both Rizer and the deciding official, that Rizer lacked the authority required under its policy to settle the appeal. Thus, we find that the agency states a nonfrivolous claim requiring a hearing. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 597-98. If, after a hearing, the administrative judge finds that Rizer had either express or implied actual authority to settle this appeal, the settlement shall be enforced<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> at 598. If, on the other hand, Rizer did not have authority to settle the appeal, the administrative judge shall reinstate the appeal<span class="Italic">. See id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">How is an appellant to protect himself against a decision like <span class="Italic">Wesselhoft</span>? Must each settlement agreement obligating an agency to pay money be researched as to internal delegations of authority? Must agency counsel display to appellants documents signed and sealed by high-level agency officials attesting to the specific authority of their attorneys to settle a personnel case? And how does the Board extricate itself from case law that places it in the position of binding an appellant to an agreement whose terms are unknown to him or, in effect, unauthorized? Perhaps the Board should require the procedures analogous to those used by criminal courts when pleas are accepted. The Board could require the appellant to state (in writing or in person at a hearing or in a telephone conference) that the appellant understands and accepts the terms of the agreement. The Board also could require the agency to produce a delegation of authority demonstrating that its counsel is warranted to enter the settlement on behalf of the agency. It is a simple process, and it mitigates the problem of appellants challenging their knowledge of or consent to settlement agreements and disavowals of settlements by agencies.</p>
