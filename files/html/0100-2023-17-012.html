<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-13"><span class="space">2.</span> Claim for Back Pay, Promotion</h4>
<p class="noindent">Although classification may be necessary to the implementation of a promotion, if the issue is entitlement to promotion, the grievance is not excluded under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">Warner Robins Air Logistics Ctr. and AFGE Local 987</span>, 10 FLRA 410, 411 (1982). A grievance and award pertaining to whether a grievant is entitled to a noncompetitive promotion do not concern the classification of a position. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3258 and DHUD</span>, 21 FLRA 413, 415 (1986). An arbitrator may entertain a grievance complaining that an agency improperly determined that the grievant lacked minimal qualifications to meet the requirements for a job being filled through competitive promotion procedures. <span class="Italic">DHHS, Family Support Admin. and NTEU Local 250</span>, 42 FLRA 347, 356-57 (1991); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-17 and VAMC Hampton</span>, 67 FLRA 4, 6 (2012) ("Classification matters are also implicated 'when the essential nature of a grievance is integrally related to the accuracy of the classification of the grievant's position, e.g., where the substance of the dispute concerns the grade level of the duties assigned to and performed by the grievant.'&#8197;...[I]t is clear that the grievance concerns the classification of the grievants' positions. The grievance seeks to 'align' the grievants' positions under PD 2228. But as the Arbitrator found, the Agency's 2008 reclassification action that established PD 2228 concerned <span class="Italic">only </span>administrative officer positions other than the grievants,' and the grade level of certain 'additional duties' of those positions."). In a decision that might warrant closer scrutiny under more recent caselaw, a claim for back pay did not involve a classification matter outside the jurisdiction of an arbitrator if no classification issue is presented during the arbitration and, instead, the grievant relies on a contract clause establishing equal pay for equal work. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 644</span>, 5 FLRA 60, 62 (1981) (grievant performed higher graded work). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-346.html#sec6-347">Temporary Promotions</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA confirmed in <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1636 and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Albuquerque</span>, 48 FLRA 511, 513-14 (1993), that an arbitrator may rule, in a challenge to a nonselection for promotion, that one of the selected employees failed to meet the announced qualification requirements:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7121(c)(4) provides that any grievance concerning an "examination, certification, or appointment" must be excluded from a negotiated grievance procedure under the Statute. The Authority has, in previous decisions, defined certain of the terms contained in that section and has found that they relate to the initial entry of an applicant into the Federal service. For example, in <span class="Italic">National Council of Field Labor Locals of the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO and United States Department of Labor</span>, 4 FLRA 376 (1980) (<span class="Italic">National Council</span>) the Authority addressed the meaning of the term "appointment" and concluded that "general usage of the term 'appointment' refers to the action which takes place at the time an individual is initially hired into the Federal service." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 381. In <span class="Italic">National Council</span>, the Authority applied the term "appointment" consistent with this general usage in finding that a grievance over the separation of a probationer was not precluded by section 7121(c)(4) of the Statute. The Authority adhered to this application of section 7121(c)(4) in <span class="Italic">United States Information Agency and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1812</span>, 32 FLRA 739, 748 (1988), in concluding that a grievance concerning the temporary assignment of an employee was not precluded by the Statute. More recently, the Authority stated that it "will continue to adhere to this usage of the term 'appointment' in applying section 7121(c)(4)" in a case involving an agency's failure to convert teachers in temporary positions to permanent positions<span class="Italic">. U.S. Department of Defense, Office of Dependent Schools and Overseas Education Association</span>, 45 FLRA 1411, 1416 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the term "certification," the Authority has stated that it is "the process by which the Office of Personnel Management submits certificates of a list of eligibles from a register to appointing officers so that the eligibles may be considered for appointment." <span class="Italic">OEA</span>, 31 FLRA at 310. Based on this definition, the Authority found that grievances relating to the eligibility of employees to be recertified as counselors were not precluded by section 7121(c)(4) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the use of the terms "appointment" and "certification" to refer to the initial entry into Federal service, we find that term "examination" refers to this matter as well. Thus, we find that examination refers to a process by which an applicant's qualification for employment is determined before the applicant is considered as a candidate for appointment. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 5 U.S.C. Chapter 33, Subchapter I, entitled "Examination, Certification and Appointment."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the grievance concerns an action affecting a current Federal employee. It does not concern the initial entry of an applicant into the Federal service. Accordingly, we conclude that the Arbitrator improperly denied the grievance as not arbitrable. Therefore, we will vacate the award and remand the case to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator for a decision on the merits of the grievance....</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA explained the permissible limits of an arbitrator's authority when deciding a promotion issue that the agency demonstrated to be a classification dispute, as it set aside an award favoring the grievant, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Air Educ. and Training Command, Randolph AFB and AFGE Local 1840</span>, 49 FLRA 1387, 1389-90 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted previously, section 7121(c)(5) of the Statute provides that matters concerning "the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction in grade or pay of an employee[&#8197;]" are excluded from the negotiated grievance procedure. Where the substance of an <span id="page_1679"></span>award concerns the grade level of duties assigned to, and performed by a grievant, the award concerns the classification of a position, within the meaning of section 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois and National Association of Government Employees, Local R7-23</span>, 38 FLRA 32, 36 (1990). Where, on the other hand, an arbitrator determines a grievant's entitlement to a temporary, career-ladder, or other noncompetitive promotion based on performance of previously-classified duties, the award does not concern classification matters<span class="Italic">. For example</span>, <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Customs Service, Pacific Region</span>, 32 FLRA 1141, 1147 (1988). Of course, a disputed failure to promote a grievant under a competitive procedure also does not concern classification matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we conclude that the award concerns the classification of the grievant's position. In this regard, there is no indication in the record that the grievant challenged a failure by the Agency to promote him temporarily because he performed higher-graded duties. There also is no indication that the grievant claimed an entitlement to a career-ladder promotion. Similarly, although the grievance and award contain references to the Agency's failure to promote the grievant, nothing in the record shows that the grievant disputed the Agency's failure to select him for a competitive promotion or that the grievant claimed a noncompetitive promotion under any law, rule, regulation, or provision of the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 916</span>, 42 FLRA 1342, 1344 (1991) (grievant claimed noncompetitive promotion based on failure of agency to implement alleged oral understanding requiring such promotion after completion of certain training); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Los Angeles District and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 42 FLRA 252, 254 (1991) (grievant claimed that agency violated a settlement agreement requiring noncompetitive promotion after desk audit established that grievant's position should be reclassified at a higher grade).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the substance of the award concerns the grade level of the duties performed by the grievant. In this regard, the Arbitrator determined, based on his consideration and evaluation of the grade level of the duties performed by the grievant, that the grievant "was capable of performing work as a WG-9 and that he actually performed the same type of work that the WG-9's were doing for a period of years."...&#8197;Moreover, although the Arbitrator ordered the Agency to provide the grievant backpay, the Arbitrator did not order the Agency to promote the grievant into a WG-9 position. Indeed, the Arbitrator found irrelevant to his award the Agency's argument that there were no available WG-9 positions into which the grievant could be promoted. In these circumstances, we conclude that the award results from the Arbitrator's determination that, in fact, the grievant's existing WG-5 position required the grievant to perform WG-9 duties. We conclude, therefore, that the award pertains to the classification of the grievant's position and, as such, the award conflicts with section 7121(c)(5) of the Statute and is deficient....</p>
<p class="noindent">An award that the grievant was improperly denied promotion because, in part, she was improperly rated at a lower grade level for a competitive promotion, did not constitute a classification issue, <span class="Italic">VAMC Dayton and AFGE Local 2209</span>, 65 FLRA 988, 994 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Authority has found that a disputed failure to promote a grievant under a competitive procedure does not concern classification matters; thus, the Arbitrator did not disregard specific limitations on his authority by finding that the grievant should have been rated as a GS-11. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Hous. &#x0026; Urban Dev.</span>, 65 FLRA 433, 435-36 (2011); <span class="Italic">VAMC Charleston</span>, 57 FLRA at 76 (finding that, because the arbitrator was charged with determining whether the grievant possessed specialized experience equivalent to one year at the next lowest grade to a GS-12, the arbitrator did not exceed his authority by considering whether the grievant had performed the duties of that position); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Air Educ. &#x0026; Training Command, Randolph Air Force Base, San Antonio, Tex.</span>, 49 FLRA 1387, 1389 (1994) (noting that, where an arbitrator determines that a grievant is entitled to a competitive promotion, the award does not concern classification matters). Moreover, the Arbitrator did not substitute his own standards for the qualification standards contained in the Handbook. Rather, he determined that the grievant was qualified for the promotion under both OPM's and the Agency's qualification standards. Consequently, the Agency has failed to demonstrate that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority by disregarding specific limitations on his authority.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award was set aside that essentially reclassified the grievant for pay purposes to a higher grade level because the work he performed was similar to that performed at a higher grade level. The award concerned the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n and DODDS</span>, 15 FLRA 358, 359 (1984). The principle that a grievance cannot involve the classification of a position was applied to overturn an award directing the agency to pay a WG-8 plumber at a WG-10 rate for doing the same work as employees permanently assigned to that work. Because of the direct interconnection between the grievance and the classification of the grievant's position, and because of the reclassification effect of the award, the grievance and the award concerned the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">VAMC, Togus and AFGE Local 2610</span>, 17 FLRA 963, 963-64 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Redstone Arsenal and AFGE Local 1858</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-42.html">73 FLRA 210</a> (2022) (grievance concerned classification and was not arbitrable when it sought permanent promotion based on assignment of additional duties); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 987 and Dept. of Air Force, Robins AFB</span>, 52 FLRA 212, 215 (1996) ("[T]he Arbitrator found that the substance of the grievance concerned the grade level of the duties assigned to the grievant's WG-5 materials handler position and, therefore, the classification of a position within the meaning of section 7121(c)(5) of the Statute."); <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 31 FLRA 933, 936 (1988) ("We agree with the Agency that the award is deficient under the Statute and must be set aside. The award of backpay to the three grievants for the period from October 26, 1984, to December 2, 1985, is deficient because the award is founded on the Arbitrator's conclusion that the grievants should have been classified at the GS-5 rather than the GS-4 level. The award, therefore, concerns the classification of a position. Where the substance of a grievance concerns the grade level of duties assigned to and performed by the grievant, the grievance concerns the classification of a position within the meaning of section 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 20 FLRA 694, 695 (1985); <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center, Tampa, Florida and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 547</span>, 19 FLRA 1177, 1178-79 (1985)"); <span class="Italic">VAMC, Tampa and AFGE Local 547</span>, 19 FLRA 1177, 1178 (1985) ("The Authority has recognized that a grievance concerning the accuracy of an employee's official position description, such as a grievance as to whether the duties regularly assigned by management and performed by the grievant are accurately reflected in the position description, is not a grievance concerning classification within the meaning of section 7121(c)(5). [<span class="Italic">FAA</span>] 8 FLRA 532, 535 (1982). However, the Authority has also held that when the essential nature of a grievance goes beyond the accuracy of the contents of the grievant's position description and is integrally related to the accuracy of the classification of the grievant's position, e.g., where the substance of the dispute concerns the grade level of the duties assigned to and performed by the grievant, the grievance concerns the classification of a position within the meaning of section 7121(c)(5) and an award finding such a grievance arbitrable and resolving it on the merits is deficient as contrary to that provision of the Statute.").</p>
<p class="noindent">An award was set aside that directed back pay because the agency delayed reclassification of the grievants' positions. The arbitrator arrived at his award by examining distinctions in duties of positions and then awarding a remedy, essentially the process used in classification audits. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Muskogee and AFGE Local 2250</span>, 47 FLRA 1112, 1116-17 (1993). A grievance over the grade level the grievant could receive through a noncompetitive career promotion and the grade level of the duties assigned to and performed by the grievant concerned the classification of the position. If the substance of the grievance concerns the grade level of the duties assigned to and performed by the grievant, the grievance concerns the classification of the position. <span class="Italic">USDA, Agric. Research Serv. and AFGE Local 1331</span>, 20 FLRA 508, 509 (1985). A promotion was set aside based on an arbitrator's disagreement with an agency decision that a GS-6 position through a career ladder promotion could not be achieved because the position could no longer be classified at the GS-6 level according to OPM guidance. Because the grievance and award concerned primarily the grade level of the grievant's promotion, they concerned classification of a position and, as a result, were excluded from the grievance procedure by &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">EEOC, Memphis Dist. Office, and Nat'l Council of EEOC Locals No. 216, AFGE</span>, 18 FLRA 88, 89-90 (1985). But a grievance and an award pertaining to whether the grievant was entitled to a noncompetitive promotion as a result of the grievant's position being upgraded through added duties and responsibilities did not concern the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">Army Missile Readiness Command and AFGE Local 1858</span>, 15 FLRA 286, 286-87 (1984). [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-346.html#sec6-347">Temporary Promotions</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">An indirect challenge to a classification process may result in FLRA vacating the award, a result reached in <span class="Italic">DHHS, FDA and NTEU Chap. 282</span>, 60 FLRA 352, 355-56 (2004), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 60 FLRA 789 (2005), when the arbitrator labeled as a procedural issue the failure of the grievant to receive favorable consideration through a peer review process for promotion to a higher grade based upon the assessment by a peer review committee that the grievant did not meet the criteria established for promotion under the agency's guidelines. FLRA set aside an award directing reevaluation of the grievant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute, a grievance concerning "the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction of grade or pay of an employee" is removed from the scope of the negotiated grievance procedure. The Authority has construed the term "classification" in &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) as involving "'the analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a class under the position-classification plan established by [the Office of Personnel Management] under chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code.'" <span class="Italic">Social Security Admin., Office of Hearings and Appeals, Mobile, Ala.</span>, 55 FLRA 778, 779-80 (1999) (<span class="Italic">SSA Mobile</span>) (quoting 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.101(c)). The Authority has held that where the substance of a grievance concerns the grade level of the duties permanently assigned to <span id="page_1680"></span>and performed by the grievant, the grievance concerns the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Social Security Admin.</span>, 31 FLRA 933, 936 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) excludes from the Authority's and arbitrators' jurisdiction "any grievance concerning--(5) the classification of any position...." The Statute does not distinguish between challenges to a classification determination based upon an allegedly substantive error in making that determination, and a challenge to a classification determination based upon an allegedly erroneous procedural error in making that determination, as the Union alleges here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case involves a peer review process whereby an Agency scientist may petition for a permanent upgrade from a GS-13 to a GS-14 or a GS-15. The peer review process essentially consists of a committee analyzing the permanent duties of a scientist and then making a recommendation to a specialist who makes a final determination as to the appropriate GS level of the scientist. As such, the peer review process concerns the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">SSA Mobile</span>, 55 FLRA at 779-80; <span class="Italic">Social Security Admin.</span>, 31 FLRA at 936. In support of this determination, the parties' Addendum to Article 59 states that the inclusion of that article in no way concedes that the peer review process is not classification and the Union even concedes that peer review is a classification process. Therefore, any grievance, alleging a procedural or substantive error, concerning the peer review process is barred under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is similar to <span class="Italic">United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 2</span>, 59 FLRA 520 (2003) (<span class="Italic">EPA</span>), where the Authority found an award deficient under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) where an arbitrator set aside a classification determination as being both procedurally and substantively erroneous. The arbitrator noted that the "'failure to consult [the grievant's] supervisor, a requirement in the evaluation process...further undermines the [specialist's] conclusions and recommendations.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 521. In addition, the arbitrator evaluated the agency's final evaluation statement (FES) and ordered a new one. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 525. The Authority stated, "the FES is a step in the process whereby a position is placed 'in a class under the position-classification plan established by [Office of Personnel Management]' and a matter pertaining to classification within the definition set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.101(c)." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. Based on the above, the Authority concluded that the award was deficient under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) because the arbitrator evaluated and modified the FES. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As in the <span class="Italic">EPA </span>case, the Arbitrator here found that the Agency committed procedural errors in conducting its classification determination, specifically, that the reviewer's letter notifying the grievant that she would not be upgraded to a GS-14 and the report provided by the specialist did not satisfy the record keeping requirements found in the peer review provision of the parties' agreement. The letter from the reviewer as well as the specialist's report are steps in the classification process. Therefore, by evaluating those documents and making a determination on their adequacy, the award concerns a classification matter and is deficient under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Authority should draw a distinction between arbitration awards that order a new classification determination to be made but do not direct the outcome to be reached, and arbitration awards that do. In support of the Union's claims the Arbitrator finds analogous our precedent upholding arbitral awards directing agencies to re-rate promotion candidates. The Arbitrator also found analogous the Authority's precedent permitting employees to challenge the accuracy of their position descriptions. However, neither grievances over promotion actions nor the accuracy of positions descriptions are subject to the proscription of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) and thus have no value as guidance. Consistent with <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) does not recognize the distinction the Union is seeking to draw between procedural challenges to the outcome of a classification determination and substantive challenges to the outcome of a classification determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, despite the Arbitrator's framing of the issue as procedural, the Arbitrator considered the actual classification determination in his award. The Arbitrator reviewed the application by the committee, reviewer and specialist of the classification criteria necessary for a GS-14 position and determined that the classification criteria had been improperly applied. As the Arbitrator's award evaluates the classification process and orders the Agency to reevaluate the grievant, the award is deficient under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">EPA, </span>59 FLRA at 525 (citing <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Muskogee, Okla.</span>, 47 FLRA 1112, 1116-17 (1993) (award found deficient under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) where arbitrator reviewed application of classification factors and determined they were improperly applied)). <span class="Italic">See also Social Security Admin.</span>, 60 FLRA 62, 65 (2004) (grievances concerning the grade level of duties assigned to permanent positions relate to classification and are not arbitrable) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 987</span>, 52 FLRA 212, 215 (1996)).</p>
