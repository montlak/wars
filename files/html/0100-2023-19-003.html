<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-4"><span class="space">1.</span> Multiple Agency Review Processes</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The mixed case is adjudicated under 5 USC 7702, a statute so convoluted that it was destined to fail, or, if not fail, at least create a lot of confused and disappointed litigants. Congress tried to provide intensive review of discrimination issues, permitting the Board, and then the EEOC, to decide the allegations, and establishing a procedure to resolve disputes between EEOC and the Board. Added to this complex procedure were the judicial review procedures already established under the civil rights acts. Those statutes, continuing for several pages of print suitable for the eyes of young insects, will not be repeated here. [Refer to <a href="0100-2023-24-001.html#sec17-1">Chapter 17</a>, "Judicial Review."] <span class="Italic">McAdams v. Reno</span>, 858 F. Supp. 945, 948-49 (D. Minn. 1994), summarized the mixed-case scheme:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB is an independent, quasi-judicial, federal administrative agency established under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1201. The MSPB provides a forum in which federal employees can appeal significant adverse employment actions taken against them. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701. In a "mixed case" appeal, an employee "alleges that an appealable agency action was effected, in whole or in part, because of discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap, or age." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(a)(2). A mixed case appeal is adjudicated under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702. This statute and its accompanying regulations provide that, in a mixed case appeal, the MSPB is authorized, and in fact required, to "decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1). The MSPB must make its decision within 120 days. The employee may then file an action in federal district court or seek administrative review with the EEOC. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the employee seeks administrative review with the EEOC, the EEOC has 30 days to decide whether to hear the case. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(b)(1). If the EEOC declines review, or if the EEOC accepts review and affirms the MSPB's decision, the employee may then proceed to district court. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(b)(5)(A). If, however, the EEOC accepts review and reverses the MSPB, the case is remanded to the MSPB for further consideration. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(b)(3)(B), (b)(5)(B). After further consideration, the MSPB either adopts or rejects the EEOC's findings. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(c). If the MSPB adopts the EEOC's findings, the employee may then seek judicial review. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(c). If, however, the MSPB rejects the EEOC's findings, a special panel with members from both the EEOC and the MSPB is convened to make a final decision. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(d)(1). The decision of this panel is then subject to judicial review. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(d)(2)(A). Judicial review from mixed cases lies with federal district courts, where an employee is entitled to have his or her discrimination claims tried <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2), (c). <span class="Italic">See generally, Washington v. Garrett</span>, 10 F.3d 1421, 1428 (9th Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">American Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Local 2052 v. Reno</span>, 992 F.2d 331, 332-33 (D.C. Cir. 1993); Peter B.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The courts and commentators appear to be unanimous in their denunciation of this unnecessarily elaborate and confusing system of intertwined administrative jurisdiction and judicial review. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Washington</span>, 10 F.3d at 1428 (describing the <span id="Page_3314"></span>"labyrinthine administrative and judicial review process"); Hadley, <span class="Italic">A Guide to Federal Sector Equal Employment Law &#x0026; Practice</span> at 756 (characterizing the processing of mixed cases as a "confusing and convoluted procedure"); Broida, <span class="Italic">A Guide to Merit Systems Protection Board Law &#x0026; Practice</span> at 1402 (criticizing the process as "so convoluted that it was destined to fail").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A mixed case arrives at the Board's regional office directly through an appeal or indirectly following initial processing through the employing agency's EEO complaint process. The choice between the agency EEO system or a direct Board appeal for the initiation of a mixed case appeal was summarized, <span class="Italic">Lott v. Dept. of Army</span>, 82 MSPR 666, 669 &#x00B6; 6 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual who has been subjected to an action appealable to the Board and believes that that action was based on discrimination may either file a timely formal discrimination complaint with the agency regarding the action or file an appeal with the Board within 30 days of the appealable action, but not both. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(b); <span class="Italic">Gomez-Burgos v. Department of Defense,</span> 79 MSPR 245, 248 (1998). Under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(b)(1) and (2), if the employee first files a formal complaint with his agency, then he must file a Board appeal within 30 days after he receives the agency resolution or final decision on the discrimination issue, or, if the agency has not resolved the matter or issued a final decision on the formal complaint within 120 days, he may appeal the matter directly to the Board at any time after the expiration of 120 calendar days.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant determines how to initiate a Board appeal in a mixed case. Nothing requires the appellant to initiate the discrimination allegation through agency EEO procedures or through the grievance procedures of a negotiated contract. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McConnell v. Dept. of Army</span>, 61 MSPR 163, 167 (1994). An appeal that raises an issue of discrimination must be processed as a mixed case. <span class="Italic">Watts v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 1 MSPR 135, 135, 1 MSPB 132 (1979).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">By whatever means the appeal arrives at the Board, the Board's processing of mixed case appeals was described in <span class="Italic">Ogden Air Logistics Ctr. v. AFGE Local 1592</span>, 6 MSPR 630, 634, 6 MSPB 531 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has jurisdiction to decide the discrimination issue if the appellant raises the issue in conjunction with a matter otherwise appealable to the Board. The appellant can then petition the EEOC to consider the Board's decision. The EEOC may concur with the Board or it can render a different decision on the discrimination issue; if the EEOC issues a different opinion, the Board must then adopt the decision or reaffirm its prior decision, with modifications if necessary. If the Board does not adopt the EEOC decision, a panel composed of one Board member, a Commission member, and a Chairman appointed by the President would consider and decide the case. Thus a "mixed case" can receive varied consideration under section 7702, which balances the respective expertise of the Board and the EEOC in an effort to protect the integrity of each.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Butler v. West</span>, 164 F.3d 634, 638-39 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (describing the mixed case process); <span class="Italic">Austin v. MSPB</span>, 136 F.3d 782, 783-84 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (describing the operation of a mixed case review, EEOC involvement); <span class="Italic">Sloan v. West</span>, 140 F.3d 1255 (9th Cir. 1998) (detailed description of mixed case process).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The statute requires that the Board decide allegations of discrimination and the merits of the action on appeal within 120 days from the date the appeal is filed. After the Board issues a final decision, the employee has 30 days to request EEOC review if EEOC review, as opposed to judicial review, is first selected by the employee. EEOC is then supposed to decide whether to consider the decision within the next 30 days. In practice, this does not occur. Appeals to EEOC are decided by its Office of Federal Operations (OFO). It can take many months--several years--for a case of any complexity to travel through the OFO to the point of a decision. If EEOC does consider the decision, it has 60 days to concur with the Board or to issue a different decision on a matter of discrimination. Or the Commission may decide it wants additional evidence and, occasionally, the Commission requests the Board to take additional evidence and the Board then remands the case to its regional office for this purpose. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, DC0752940027G1 (1995) (not reported in MSPR) (EEOC remanded for a "supplemental hearing" because it determined there was not enough evidence in the record to make a decision on the appellant's race discrimination appeal that was appealed to the Commission after the Board issued its final decision); <span class="Italic">Graham v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> DE07529110122 (12/4/91) (NP); <span class="Italic">Walker v. Dept. of Air Force</span> SF07529110174 (10/20/91) (NP); <span class="Italic">Mallard v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 18 MSPR 479, 480 (1983) (EEOC sent the case back to the Board because the Board "failed to recognize the handicap issues raised in the case"; the Board, in turn, sent the case back to its AJ for factfinding and legal conclusions). If EEOC sends a case back for more evidence, the Board remands the case to the AJ, who takes the evidence. The AJ provides the evidence received to the Board's Clerk, who forwards it to EEOC. A new initial decision is not issued. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wilson v. USPS</span>, 39 MSPR 338, 339-40 (1988). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-19-024.html#sec12-24">MSPB Remand; EEOC Remand</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A Commission decision differing from the Board's decision must be referred back to the Board. The Board then has 30 days to concur and adopt the decision of the Commission or, on civil service issues, set the Commission decision aside. The Board will adopt the EEOC findings on the discrimination issues if EEOC has not incorrectly interpreted any civil service rule, law, or regulation, and if the decision is supported by the evidence of record. 5 USC 7702(c). <span class="Italic">Ector v. USPS</span>, 24 MSPR 172, 173 (1984). If EEOC recommended a particular action and the employing agency has complied, the Board will dismiss the appeal on remand from EEOC since no further Board action is necessary. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McCurtis v. USPS</span>, 8 MSPR 117, 118 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the Commission's decision is set aside by the Board, the Board must then certify the case to a Special Panel that is given approximately 50 days to decide the case, with "due deference to the respective expertise of the Board and the Commission." The Panel consists of an individual appointed by the President, one member of the Board designated by the Chairman of the Board, and one member of the Commission designated by the Chairman of the Commission. The Panel met to consider <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 471 (Spec. Pan. 1986), treated in subsequent discussion concerning accommodation through reassignment, and to determine the <span class="Italic">Lynch v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 31 MSPR 519 (Spec. Pan. 1986), appeal. Both cases should be reviewed to learn more about the jurisdiction and procedures of the Panel. The Special Panel's most recent decision is <span class="Italic">Alvara v. DHS</span>, 121 MSPR 613, 2014 MSPB 77 (Spec. Pan. 2014).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A procedural wrinkle was brought to the fore by <span class="Italic">Lynch v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 31 MSPR 627 (1986). The AJ issued a decision in favor of the appellant on some, but not all, performance-related charges. The appellant waited for the initial decision to become final and then petitioned EEOC to review the case. The EEOC relied on conclusions reached by the AJ to find discrimination. The case was then remanded to the Board. The Board rewrote the findings of the AJ sufficiently to undermine the EEOC's conclusions concerning disability discrimination. Invoking its authority to concern itself with civil service issues under 7702(c)(2), the Board held that it was justified in making the revisions in the Board decision following the return of the case from EEOC. The law permitted that result and the appellant had not used the Board PFR process to seek review by the Board initially (nor apparently, had the agency). Member Devaney dissented, complaining that the Board was conducting <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">novo</span> factfinding three years after its own administrative judge's decision had become "final." [The case was certified to the Special Panel, whose decision and the decision of a reviewing court--finding unlawful the Board's belated factual revisions--are considered later in this chapter.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The administrative process, if followed to completion, is for those with stamina. The mixed case is more complex than the appeal without discrimination issues because of regulatory constraints on the Board's acceptance of jurisdiction, the right of review by the EEOC as to discrimination issues after a final Board decision, and the special procedures for judicial review. If the appellant's case moves through the whole rigmarole in the designated timeframes, it will take close to three years to finish the case. Then the appellant can begin a case in district court, involving another year or two. Litigation is no way to go through life, but personnel cases take on lives of their own. For a critique of the complexities of mixed case and other federal employees' appellate procedures, refer to GAO commentary in <span class="Italic">Federal Employee Redress: An Opportunity for Reform</span> (GAO/T-GGD-96-42; 11/29/95).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are judicial review rights at almost every step of the cumbersome mixed case process. Six different types of decisions during the administrative review process of 5 USC 7702 are judicially reviewable actions. References in the statute to "decisions of the Board" are to final decisions, not the initial decisions of administrative judges, according to <span class="Italic">Ballard v. TVA</span>, 768 F.2d 756 (6th Cir. 1985). The court concluded it would make no sense to have the appellant taking his case into court during the time that the Director of OPM or the Board itself could move to reopen the case. It made more sense to allow the administrative procedure to terminate in a final decision before the appellant was required to invoke the assistance of a district court. [Refer to <a href="0100-2023-24-001.html#sec17-1">Chapter 17</a>, "Judicial Review."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee has several options during the proceedings, including filing a PFR from an initial decision, filing an appeal with the EEOC, or going to district court after the initial decision is issued and becomes final. The options are the employee's. He may file a PFR with the Board. He is not obliged to lodge his initial challenge to the initial decision either in court or with the EEOC. <span class="Italic">Brantley v. TVA</span>, 25 MSPR 199, 199-200 n.1 (1984). Although by statute one may go directly to court after filing an EEO complaint with the employing agency and then waiting 120 days if no final decision is issued sooner, the difficulty is that the plaintiff waives the right to obtain review by either the court or MSPB of civil service issues that are discrete from the EEO claims. This problem was illustrated in <span class="Italic">Doyal v. Dept. of Army</span>, 29 MSPR 50, 53 (1985). After being removed from his job, the appellant filed an EEO complaint with his agency, then filed a timely suit in district court. The court ruled against the appellant on the discrimination issues and also held that it did not have jurisdiction over the appellant's claims of procedural error and prohibited personnel practices. The appellant then filed an appeal on those issues with the Board. The Board affirmed the regional dismissal of the appeal as untimely. Conscious election of forum, as opposed to mistaken misfiling, was not good cause for waiver of the time limits for filing an appeal. The appellant consistently viewed the basis of his case as the violation of EEO statutes. The civil service aspects of the complaint in court were ancillary to his claim of discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant may not simultaneously pursue a PFR to the Board and an appeal <span id="Page_3315"></span>to EEOC arising from the same circumstances, <span class="Italic">Austin v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 31, 33-34 (1996), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Austin v. MSPB</span>, 136 F.3d 782 (Fed. Cir. 1998), <span class="Italic">post</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Once an administrative judge of the Board issues an initial decision in a mixed-case appeal, the appellant may either file a petition for review with the Board before the initial decision becomes final in accordance with the Board's regulatory review procedures, or the appellant may allow the initial decision to become the final decision of the Board and seek further review before the EEOC or the Federal courts. 5 USC 7701(e)(1), 7702(b). We are aware of no statutory provision that permitted the appellant to seek simultaneous review of the initial decision before both the Board and the EEOC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7702 provides for further Board proceedings in mixed-case appeals after the EEOC has issued a decision in only two circumstances: (1) Where the EEOC forwards the appeal to the Board for the taking of further evidence, 5 USC 7702(b)(4), and (2) where the EEOC does not concur in the Board's decision, 5 USC 7702(c). Neither of these provisions applies here because the EEOC has concurred in the initial decision. Under these circumstances, the statute makes no provision for further Board proceedings. Indeed, the EEOC's decision correctly informed the appellant that his only right of review of that decision is in the Federal courts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant here filed a timely petition for review. Nevertheless, through happenstance, the Board did not receive the petition for review until after the EEOC issued its final decision. It appeared at the time that the EEOC requested the administrative record in this appeal that the appellant had decided to forgo Board review, allow the initial decision to become the final decision of the Board, and seek review of the initial decision before the EEOC. Thus, the EEOC adjudicated the case and now it has issued a final decision. Because the EEOC has reached a final adjudication in this appeal, the Board lacks the authority to further review this matter. Accordingly, we find that the appellant's petition for review must be dismissed for lack of Board jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit sent the case back to the Board. <span class="Italic">Austin v. MSPB</span>, 136 F.3d 782 (Fed. Cir. 1998). The court was not concerned with Austin's intent, but with EEOC's jurisdiction to consider the case. At the time Austin petitioned EEOC to review his case, the initial decision from the AJ had not become final. Since EEOC had jurisdiction to review only a final decision, its decision on appeal from the Board's initial decision was, in the court's estimation, a nullity. Because Austin filed a PFR with the Board, the Board never lost jurisdiction of his case, despite the EEOC involvement.</p>
