<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-68"><span class="space">b.</span> Stress Disorder</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board analyzed a PTSD mental disability defense, <span class="Italic">McCray v. DOD</span>, 68 MSPR 186, 192 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To make a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of disability discrimination, an appellant must establish that he is disabled, that the action appealed was based on his disability, and, to the extent feasible, he must articulate a reasonable accommodation which would render him able to perform the duties of his position. When an appellant has established such a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the agency must show that the action at issue was based on a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. The agency may meet this burden by showing that the action was not based on the appellant's disability or by showing that the appellant is not a qualified disabled individual; namely, a disabled person who, "with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position in question without endangering the health and safety of the individual or others." <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.203(d). <span class="Italic">See also Sheehan v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 66 MSPR 490, 493-94 (1995); <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 148, 151-52 (1988); <span class="Italic">Hirth v. Runyon</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03950067, slip op. at 4 (May 8, 1995). An agency must make reasonable accommodation to the known physical and/or mental limitations of a qualified individual with a disability, unless the agency can show that accommodation would cause an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.203(a)(1)....<span class="Italic">&#8197;</span><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Donlin v. Dept. of Labor</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03950013, slip op. at 3-4, 5 (Apr. 24, 1995) (an agency's accommodation obligation arises only when the disability is known; a "known" disability is one of which "relevant agency officials have actual, rather than imputed, knowledge or notice.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kye v. DLA</span>, 64 MSPR 570, 573-74 (1994), involving an appellant with mood disorder and depression and a charge that the appellant failed to safeguard or misused her government credit card, commented on causation and medical evidence of mental disability:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The necessary elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination will vary according to the particular facts and circumstances at issue. <span class="Italic">See Dazey v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 54 MSPR 658, 661 (1992). Generally, the elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination based on a mental illness such as depression include: a showing that the person is a qualified handicapped person and that the action appealed was based on his handicap; and, to the extent possible, an articulation of a reasonable accommodation under which the employee believes he could perform the essential duties of his position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. To make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination based on the condition of alcoholism, an appellant must prove that he is a qualified handicapped person and that his handicap caused his misconduct or that the misconduct was entirely a manifestation of his handicap. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. Dept. of</span> <span class="Italic">the Army</span>, 57 MSPR 203, 208-09 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we note that the physician who diagnosed the appellant's mood disorder and depression, Patrick Thrasher, M.D., first saw her July 23, 1993, almost three months after the occurrence of the charged misconduct. Therefore, this evidence provides scant support for a finding that the appellant's misconduct was caused by that condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the administrative judge's finding that the appellant had not shown a causal relationship between her claimed alcoholism and the sustained misconduct, similarly leads to a finding of a lack of causation between the sustained misconduct and the appellant's depression <span id="Page_3454"></span>or a combination of those two claimed medical conditions. That is, the administrative judge, assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant had established that she suffered from the handicapping condition of alcoholism, nevertheless correctly found that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The agency did not specifically claim that the appellant used her card to withdraw cash; but rather, that she failed to safeguard her card and PIN, failed to report its loss..., and, on one occasion, used the card for the rental of a motel room. The appellant has not claimed that she does not recall not missing the card, [or] not knowing of her responsibilities with the card....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant who raises a claim of disability discrimination must first establish that she is a disabled person entitled to the protection of the disability discrimination laws. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 452, &#x00B6; 5 (2005). A disabled person is one who has a "physical or mental impairment" that "substantially limits" one or more "major life activities," who has a record of such an impairment, or who is regarded as having such an impairment. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g); <span class="Italic">Harris,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 452, &#x00B6; 5. These terms must be interpreted strictly to create "a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled." <span class="Italic">Harris,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 452, &#x00B6; 5. The term "major life activities" means functions such as caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(i); <span class="Italic">Vyas v. Department of the Army,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 452, &#x00B6; 6 (1999). A person who is "substantially limited" in a major life activity is unable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform, or is significantly restricted as to the condition, manner, or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform the same major life activity. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1);<span class="Italic"> Vyas,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 452, &#x00B6; 10.

For the major life activity of working, "substantially limits" means that an individual is "significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities. The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3); <span class="Italic">see Fraser v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 72, &#x00B6; 12 (2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the evidence in the record indicates that the appellant suffered from "work-related stress" and that she attributed a significant portion of this stress to her alleged harassment and mistreatment by her immediate supervisor. However, the appellant's inability to work with a particular supervisor is not enough to show that she is "substantially" limited in the major life activity of working. <span class="Italic">See Bullock v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 531, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17 (2001) (an inability to work for a particular supervisor or in a particular position does not constitute a disability because it is not a barrier to employment and does not foreclose the employee generally from a broad range of jobs), <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 32 Fed. Appx. 538 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The evidence does not establish that the appellant's stress restricted her ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs, or that the agency regarded her as being so restricted. <span class="Italic">See Otterstedt v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 688, &#x00B6; 18 (2004); <span class="Italic">Fraser,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 72, &#x00B6; 13. The appellant has thus failed to prove that stress precluded her from a working in a broad range of positions, not just a certain position where she must interact with a certain supervisor. <span class="Italic">See Bullock,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 531, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the appellant failed to establish that she had any physical or mental impairment during her employment that substantially limited her ability to work, nor did she have a record of any physical or mental impairment that substantially limited her ability to perform any major life activity. We therefore conclude that the appellant failed to prove that she was a disabled individual, and the agency therefore did not discriminate against her on the basis of disability when it removed her for the charged misconduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Existence of a mental impairment is not determinative of a disabling condition; they are not the same. <span class="Italic">Lehman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 30 MSPR 72, 75 (1986) (medical reports did not demonstrate that the appellant's condition was so severe as to substantially limit her ability to work). <span class="Italic">Miller v. DHHS</span>, 23 MSPR 128, 131-32 (1984), distinguished mental impairment, a personality disorder, from mental disability:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The mere existence of a mental impairment is not determinative of a handicapping condition. Mental impairment and mental handicap are not synonymous terms. In order to prove discrimination on the basis of a handicapping condition, an appellant must first establish that she was a "handicapped person" within the meaning of 29 CFR Section 1613.702(a). A "handicapped person" is essentially one who has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities. The term major life activities means functions such as "caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, reading, learning and working." <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR Section 1613.702(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's expert witness testifying on the issue of handicapping condition was Dr. Raina Sotsky, psychiatrist. Dr. Sotsky testified that she began treating the appellant the day after her admission to the Veterans Administration Hospital in April, 1982. The appellant remained hospitalized for 13 days. Dr. Sotsky testified that, upon admission, the appellant was upset about her relationship with her supervisor and was tearful and crying. During appellant's hospitalization, she was diagnosed as having a personality disorder. Dr. Sotsky testified that the appellant, after her hospital discharge, was medically fit to return to work. Dr. Robert Mayer, board certified psychiatrist and supervisor of Doctor Sotsky, similarly stated that the appellant was medically fit to return to work after her hospitalization. Additionally, the appellant testified that after her removal, she was seasonally employed as a photographer during the fall of 1982 without incident.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We cannot conclude from this record that simply because appellant suffers from a mental impairment described as a personality disorder, she is deemed to be a handicapped person. Both psychiatrists testified that appellant was fit to return to work after her brief hospitalization in April/May, 1982. Moreover, appellant demonstrated a capability of working successfully and without incident after her hospitalization, both with her employing agency and as a photographer. Additionally, neither psychiatrist offered credible medical testimony that appellant's mental impairment limited any of her major life activities. Thus, the appellant has failed to establish the first element of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Stalkfleet v.

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Cohen v. Dept. of Army</span>, 46 MSPR 369, 374-75 (1990), involving an individual suffering stress disorder as a result of her occupation, the appellant's physician said that the appellant was permanently disabled from working at her assigned work station, Fort Sam Houston, but that she would be able to make a rapid recovery and return to useful service in less than six months if she were reassigned to another location. That was insufficient to establish her as a qualified disabled person:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Jimenez concluded that the appellant could not return to the civil service in any capacity at the time of his 1985 report. He raised the possibility, however, that, in three to five years, "she might be able to be retrained in some way to take on different tasks but not at the levels she is functioning at." If Dr. Jiminez's opinion is the correct one, the appellant would be considered a handicapped person under [29 CFR 1614.203(a)(1)].She would not be a "qualified handicapped person" under section [1614.203(a)(6)], however, because requiring the agency to maintain an employee on the rolls for three to five years, on the mere possibility that she might then be able to be retrained for a job other than the one she was previously performing, would not be a "reasonable accommodation," in that it would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the agency's program, <span class="Italic">see</span> [29 CFR 1614.203(c)].Accordingly, we conclude that, regardless of whether Dr. Montgomery's opinion or that of Dr. Jiminez was the more accurate, the appellant failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination.[7]</p>

Yates v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 70 MSPR 172, 178 (1996). It is not enough to show that the agency regarded the appellant as foreclosed from a particular job; the agency must regard the impairment as substantially limiting employment generally. <span class="Italic">Sutton v.

Although the agency clearly believed the appellant was not performing satisfactorily in his position of record when it initiated the PIP, the evidence does not show that it knew of his alleged depression, let alone that it regarded the asserted mental condition as foreclosing generally the type of employment at issue. Thus, the appellant failed to prove that he was regarded as having a mental impairment that substantially limited his employment in general. <span class="Italic">See Sutton</span>, 119 S.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not state what, if any, major life activity may have been substantially limited by the asserted mental condition. A review of the record shows that the appellant, at best, contended that depression substantially limited his ability to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the activity of working, "substantially limits" means that an individual is generally foreclosed by his impairment from the type of employment involved. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.2(j)(3); <span class="Italic">Groshans v. Department of the Navy,</span> 67 MSPR 629, 636 (1995).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant did not allege that he was generally foreclosed by depression from performing the work of a civil engineer. Instead, he claimed that he was stressed and frustrated by the duties of the Civil Engineer position from which he was removed. Moreover, he stated that when he was detailed to a civil engineering position in the design branch after the PIP and before the removal action, he no longer felt stressed and was working without problems. He asserted that he could perform the duties of a civil engineer under a different setting, and, to that end, he asked to be reassigned to another department. Moreover, after he was removed, he has continued to work as a civil engineer in private industry with no complaints of stress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An inability to work for a particular supervisor or in a particular position does not constitute a disability under the Rehabilitation Act because it is not a barrier to employment and does not foreclose an employee generally from his line of work. <span class="Italic">Sublette v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Army</span>, 68 MSPR 82, 86-88 (1995). We therefore find that the appellant failed to show that depression substantially limited the major life activity of working. Accordingly, he did not meet his burden of showing that he was a disabled person. <span class="Italic">Accord Sutton</span>, 119 S.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board denied another disability accommodation claim associated with an AWOL-based removal when the appellant's stress at work could have been reduced by sensitivity training with her coworkers and supervisors. Because the job difficulties did not foreclose a line of work, but only made difficult the performance of duties at the particular work station, the appellant was not a qualified disabled employee entitled to accommodation, <span class="Italic">Manuel v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The question of who is a handicapped person under the Rehabilitation Act is an individualized one, focusing on whether the particular impairment constitutes a significant barrier to employment for the particular person. The fact that an impairment prevents an employee from meeting the demands of a particular job does not necessarily mean that she is handicapped; the impairment must foreclose generally the type of employment involved. In <span class="Italic">Cohen</span> [<span class="Italic">Cohen v.

The agency's doctor concluded, however, that she could perform the duties of her position at other locations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 374.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The operative facts in the present case are very similar to those in <span class="Italic">Cohen</span>. Dr. Boyle diagnosed the appellant as suffering from PTSD. He testified that it was the way people in the workplace treated her that had made her nonfunctional in her job. He said that it was this fact that had caused him to write that it was doubtful that the appellant could ever return to work. It was his opinion, however, that the appellant could return to productive work in a different job at the VA Medical Center, or to her former position, if someone conducted some sensitivity training with her coworkers and supervisors. If Dr. Boyle's opinion is correct, the appellant would not be a handicapped person within the meaning of 29 CFR 1613.702(a), because she would not have established that her psychological impairment foreclosed her generally from the type of employment she had performed, only that it precluded her from meeting the demands of her particular job.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although an agency is required to make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of a qualified handicapped person, 29 CFR 1613.704(a), it is not required to accommodate the physical or mental impairment of an individual who is not a qualified handicapped person, unless required by its own regulations or by the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ransom v. Dept. of Army</span>, 49 MSPR 553, 556-57 (1991) (the possibility of reassignment in an appeal of a removal action for inability to perform may be relevant to a claim of harmful error if the agency did not afford reassignment rights under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement or if it failed to honor its own internal regulations requiring reassignment); <span class="Italic">Day v. Dept. of Army</span>, 47 MSPR 617, 620-21 (1991) (if any consideration should be given to whether a supervisor's departure would permit the employee to perform the duties of her position, it would be in the context of her affirmative defense of handicap discrimination). The appellant does not claim that she is able to perform the duties of her position without accommodation. Having failed to establish that she is a handicapped person entitled to accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act, or that accommodation is required by agency regulations or a collective bargaining agreement, the appellant has failed to establish a basis for requiring accommodation, and she was properly removed for inability to perform the duties of her position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board declined to credit a stress-related disability asserted as a defense to a charge of inappropriate workplace conduct. The defense focused on a particular job situation rather than the appellant's fitness for a line of work, <span class="Italic">Sublette v. Dept. of Army</span>, 68 MSPR 82, 86-88 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish that he is a disabled person, entitled to reasonable accommodation, the appellant must first show that he has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of his major life activities, including foreclosure generally of the type of employment involved; has a record of such an impairment; or is regarded as having such an impairment....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the appellant established that he was disabled, the administrative judge relied heavily on the testimony of the appellant's psychiatrist, Dr. Wolff. Dr. Wolff, however, first saw the appellant on November 2, 1993, after the agency had proposed the appellant's removal. The appellant was terminated because of misconduct he committed between February and October 1993. Although the appellant and Dr. Wolff testified that the appellant suffered from nightmares and occasional angry outbursts before he started seeing Dr. Wolff, there is no evidence that he sought psychiatric or other assistance, or that he felt that he could not perform his job, prior to his first meeting with Dr. Wolff.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the inquiry as to whether a person is disabled is an individualized one, which focuses on whether the particular impairment constitutes a significant barrier to the person's employment and/or other major life activity. <span class="Italic">See Rodriguez v. Dept. of the</span> <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>, 60 MSPR 279, 282 (1994). Dr. Wolff's testimony and the other medical evidence do not establish that the appellant's mental condition significantly restricted him as to the condition, manner or duration under which he could perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills, and abilities. The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1630.2(j)(3)(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Wolff testified that a stressful and chaotic work environment would exacerbate the intensity of whatever inclination the appellant might have for PTSD symptoms. He further stated that the appellant's work environment was disorganized and stressful, and somewhat reminiscent on a deep psychological level of the Vietnam experience.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Wolff further testified that the appellant should not be in a position where he makes policy decisions, although he would be very good at carrying out assigned tasks. Dr. Wolff provides no basis for his opinion, <span id="Page_3456"></span>beyond saying that he bases it on his evaluation of the appellant. We find that although there is evidence that the work environment was stressful, there is no evidence, aside from Dr. Wolff's opinion, that the appellant had difficulty making decisions, and was substantially impaired from performing in a decision-making position. In fact, there was very little, if any, evidence presented as to the exact nature of the work the appellant performed, and how his mental condition affected his ability to perform his duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, while the agency attempted to establish that the appellant's inappropriate behavior had occurred in the supervisory position he held before his most recent one, the appellant denied these incidents. The appellant had always received good performance appraisals in this previous position, and did not testify or offer other evidence that the supervisory nature of the position was difficult for him. Accordingly, we find that the appellant has failed to establish that he was significantly restricted with regard to performing in government supervisory positions in general.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, based on the appellant's evidence, even if we were to find that the appellant established that he had depression and PTSD while he held his last position, he has not shown that these conditions substantially impaired his ability to perform his work. To the extent that he did show such impairment, it was the stresses of his particular work environment, rather than the supervisory nature of the position, that contributed to his purported condition. Therefore, he has established at most that his impairment precluded him from meeting the demands of a particular job, and not that he was foreclosed generally from a type of employment, which he must prove to establish that he is disabled. <span class="Italic">See Manuel v. VA</span>, 58 MSPR 424, 428 (1993).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...To show a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination, an appellant must show that he is a disabled person and that the agency action appealed to the Board was based on the disability; and, to the extent possible, he must articulate a reasonable accommodation under which he believes that he could perform the essential functions of the position or of a vacant position to which he could be reassigned. <span class="Italic">Burgess v. Department of the Interior</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 134 &#x00B6; 19 (2003).

Department of Agriculture</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 72 &#x00B6; 12 (2003). For the major life activity of working, "substantially limits" means that an individual is "significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities. The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3); <span class="Italic">see Fraser</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 72 &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant suffers from depression and anxiety. The AJ did not specify, however, how the appellant's mental impairment substantially limits one or more of her major life activities. It appears that the AJ concluded that the appellant's sleep, anxiety, concentration and stomach problems, along with her depression, nausea and headaches, affected her ability to work. However, the medical evidence of record does not establish that the appellant was restricted in her ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs, or that the agency regarded her as being so restricted. <span class="Italic">See Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc.</span>, 527 U.S. 471, 491 (1999); <span class="Italic">Fraser</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 72 &#x00B6; 13. Following the appellant's hospitalization in 1998 for her depression and anxiety, the appellant's treating psychotherapist, John Roumasset, M.D., cleared the appellant for work two to three days per week. In March 2002, Dr. Roumasset indicated in a handwritten note that the appellant "is unable to work because of a disabling condition for which she is being treated." Dr. Roumasset extended his directive that the appellant not work through October 10, 2002. Nowhere did any of the appellant's treating physicians indicate that the appellant was restricted from performing a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs. Rather, the evidence indicates that, to the extent she was unable to work, she was unable to work in what she perceived to be a hostile work environment based on alleged harassment and retaliation by Nurisio.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant testified that, at the time of the March 28, 2003 hearing, she was working two days a week as a Part-Time Flexible Clerk. She testified further that she is capable of performing a wide variety of jobs. Additionally, she testified that her depression improved when she did not work with Nurisio. To the extent that the appellant alleged she could not work with a particular coworker, i.e., Nurisio, that is not enough to show that she was "substantially" limited in the major life activity of working. <span class="Italic">See Bullock v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 531 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17 (2001) (the EEOC and the Board have held that an individual is not substantially limited in the major life activity of working where situational depression prevents the individual from working at one particular location with particular coworkers or under one particular supervisor), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 32 Fed. Appx. 538 (Fed. Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence fails to establish that the appellant is disabled, or that the agency engaged in disability discrimination in effecting her demotion. Accordingly, the AJ erred in concluding that the appellant proved disability discrimination, and we reverse that portion of the ID.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An adjustment disorder, asserted as a disability discrimination defense to dismissal for participating in a strike against the government, was not a disabling condition in <span class="Italic">Belanger v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 16 MSPR 304, 308 (1983):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Appellant's primary evidence on this issue consisted of the report and testimony of a psychiatrist who saw appellant twice following the strike and who diagnosed appellant as suffering from an "adjustment disorder with mixed emotional features." The psychiatrist testified that, in layman's terms, his diagnosis meant that appellant was under considerable stress, but that the condition was temporary and appellant would fully recover. The Board agrees with the presiding official's finding that the above evidence does not establish that the appellant had a mental impairment that substantially limited one or more of his major life activities. Thus, since appellant has not shown that he was a handicapped person under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702, appellant has failed to establish the first requisite element of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appellant's stress-related disability extends to aspects of life aside from work, if the misconduct charged against the appellant is the product of the mental disability, and if the appellant presents a reasonable accommodation, the agency will have a duty to provide the accommodation if the employee is otherwise qualified for accommodation, as <span class="Italic">Patterson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">A physical or mental impairment is defined as any psychological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting the neurological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs, cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, respiratory, genitourinary, hemic and lymphatic, skin, or endocrine systems, or any mental or psychological disorder, such as mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, or specific learning disabilities. 29 CFR 1614.203(a)(2), 1630.2(h). A major life activity means functions, such as caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working. 29 CFR 1614.203(a)(3), 1630.2(i)<span class="Italic">. See also Miller</span>, 43 MSPR at 477. This list, however, is not exhaustive, and may include, but again is not limited to, sitting, standing, lifting and reaching. Appendix to Part 1630, discussing 1630.2(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual is substantially limited in a major life activity if she is unable to perform the activity as compared to the average person in the general population, or if she is significantly restricted as to the condition, manner or duration under which she can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition, manner, or duration under which the <span id="Page_3457"></span>average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1630.2(j).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an appellant is substantially limited in a major life activity, the major life activity of working should be examined last, and only in the event that the individual is not substantially limited with respect to any other major life activity. If an individual is substantially limited in any other major life activity, no determination need be made regarding whether the individual is substantially limited in working. <span class="Italic">See Scalese v. Widnall</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03960050 (Jul. 10, 1996)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find the present case similar to the circumstances in <span class="Italic">Randel v. Dalton</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03960070 (Aug. 8, 1996). There, the agency removed the appellant based upon charges of unauthorized absence, specifying that he had not reported for duty for several months, and had failed to submit adequate medical documentation to support his request for sick leave for this time. Shortly before the appellant stopped reporting to work, he incurred several incidents of disrespectful conduct toward his supervisor, and submitted a note from his physician stating that he was under stress on the dates in question. The appellant later submitted additional statements from a certified social worker indicating that the appellant was experiencing stress related symptoms and could benefit from leave. Another letter reported severe stress, and that the appellant alleged that mistreatment by his supervisors contributed to his condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following the agency's request for additional medical documentation, the appellant submitted a series of psychiatric statements indicating that he was quite depressed and anxious, that he should not return to work until his EEO complaint had been decided, and that he would benefit from a transfer. The agency found the appellant submissions inadequate and requested yet additional medical documentation. The appellant's psychiatrist responded by stating that the appellant suffered from major depression, as evidenced by his depressed mood, markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, significant weight loss, insomnia, fatigue or loss of energy, and diminished ability to think or concentrate. He further stated that he did not believe the appellant would be able to return to his former position because of the conditions existing there, but that the appellant's prognosis for recovery was very good. The agency, however, removed the appellant for unauthorized absence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an appeal with the Board alleging that the agency discriminated against him on the basis of his disability of major depression. The administrative judge, however, sustained the appellant's removal, finding that the appellant failed to provide administratively acceptable evidence of incapacitation, and that the agency properly removed him for excessive unauthorized absence. The administrative judge further found that the appellant had not established that he was an individual with a disability because he failed to show that he had an impairment that substantially limited one or more of his major life activities, including working.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the Board denied the appellant's petition for review of the initial decision, the appellant pursued this matter with the EEOC. That agency found that the appellant was a disabled person under its regulations because he suffered from an impairment that substantially limited his major life abilities of thinking, concentrating, and making decisions. In reaching this conclusion, the EEOC found that the appellant's evidence established that he suffered from an inability to concentrate, chest pain at and after work, nausea at work, and decreased appetite and weight loss. It further found that the appellant's evidence showed he was depressed, slept poorly, and had ceased exercising. The EEOC found that the evidence further established that a mental status examination revealed that the appellant was anxious and depressed, that he was tearful when discussing problems at work, and that his thought content exhibited significant symptoms of anxiety and depression, resulting in a diagnosis of major depression that was being treated with medication and therapy. The EEOC also noted that the appellant's psychiatrist indicated that the appellant met the criteria for major depression because he had a depressed mood, a markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, weight loss, insomnia, fatigue or loss of energy, and diminished ability to think or concentrate. The appellant's psychiatrist also indicated that the appellant's depression affected his ability to think clearly and make good decisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EEOC further found the appellant was a qualified individual with a disability because he had successfully performed in his position for several years, and that a causal connection existed between the disabling condition and the agency's reason for his removal--his ongoing absence from work. The EEOC then concluded that the agency failed to meet its obligations under the Rehabilitation Act because the agency did not show that the appellant's proffered accommodations would cause an undue hardship. The EEOC found that, as a reasonable accommodation, the appellant asked for leave to cover his absence from work, and for a reassignment to another position. The agency, however, denied the leave request and, although agency officials considered transferring the appellant to another position, they did so only because of the conflict between the appellant and his supervisor without considering accommodating his medical condition. The EEOC found this effort inadequate, stating that there was no systematic search for a vacant position based upon the appellant's qualifications and medical restrictions, and noting that the appellant's fourth-line supervisor testified that he never believed that the appellant had a disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EEOC referred the case back to the Board under 5 USC 7702(b)(5)(B). In <span class="Italic">Randel v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 72 MSPR 288 (1996), the Board concurred in and adopted the EEOC's decision, and forwarded the case to the field office for an adjudication of the appellant's claim for compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon the EEOC's findings in <span class="Italic">Randel</span>, we similarly find here that the appellant is a disabled person because her anxiety and depression substantially limit her major life activities of thinking, concentrating and making decisions. As discussed above, Dr. McCarthy's and Dr. Howerton's reports and letters establish that the appellant suffered from stress symptomatology--including overwhelming anxiety, tension, anger relative to what she felt was systematic institutional harassment, nervousness, shaking, headaches, damaged trust, self-worth, and self-esteem, and feelings of hopelessness--that was affecting relationships across the scope of her life. These symptoms gave rise to a diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Emotional Features (anxiety and depression), extended trauma, moderate to moderately severe.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find, however, that the appellant has not articulated a reasonable accommodation under which she can perform the essential functions of her position and is not a qualified individual with a disability. An employee with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position in question is a qualified individual with a disability. 29 CFR 1614.203(a)(6). The term "position in question," however, is not limited to the position held by the employee, but also includes positions that the employee could have held as a result of reassignment. <span class="Italic">See Randel v. Dalton</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03950108 (Feb. 8, 1996). <span class="Italic">See also Savage</span>, 36 MSPR at 152-53.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant here has failed to meet her burden of proving that she is a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of these regulations. <span class="Italic">See Stalkfleet v. USPS</span>, 6 MSPB 536, 6 MSPR 637, 647-48 (1981). Unlike appellant <span class="Italic">Randel</span> who was deemed a qualified individual with a disability based upon his successful performance in his position for several years, the appellant in the present case had difficulty from the beginning with the training required for her position. Indeed, as discussed earlier, her training problems led to her dispute with her supervisor that culminated in her emotional breakdown.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge found, the appellant was selected for the position of Computer Specialist, GS-05, in April of 1993, and entered into a training plan aimed at attaining the position of Computer Specialist, GS-09 within three years. One year later, however, the agency denied the appellant's promotion to the GS-7 level, and sent her for additional training that she was unable to complete successfully.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the appellant's medical evidence does not establish that she was capable of performing her computer programming duties. Dr. McCarthy was unable to state that the appellant could perform the duties of her position. Instead, his response to the agency's request for medical documentation for her leave request recommended a "friendly approach" on the job, with possible retraining, as if for the first time, and then proceeding in a step-by-step working relationship to determine "once and for all that she either is capable of learning the job with proper training or in fact cannot do it." Thus, the appellant has not established that, even with the accommodations of being granted leave and being retrained, she could perform the essential functions of her computer specialist position. Finally, we note that the appellant's petition for review provides no basis for setting aside the administrative judge's determination that the agency was unable to reassign her to another position because it was undergoing a reduction in force process at the time of her absence, and there were no other positions into which she could be moved.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Patterson</span> returned to EEOC. The Commission decided that the agency failed reasonably to accommodate her disability. The appeal returned to the Board, and the Board accepted the Commission's findings and entered a remedial order as to her 1995 removal, concluding in <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 80 MSPR 161, 163 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the EEOC decision rests solely upon an interpretation of discrimination law. The EEOC found that the agency discriminated against the appellant based upon her disability because it could have reasonably accommodated her medical condition by allowing her leave for her absence, after which she could have returned to her former position and performed its essential functions. The EEOC also found that, even if it were to assume that the appellant could not have performed the essential functions of her position, the agency did not act properly on her request for a reassignment as an accommodation for her condition <span id="Page_3458"></span>because it did not conduct a systematic search for vacant positions based upon the appellant's qualifications and her medical restriction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, however, that his latter finding arguably conflicts with our decision in <span class="Italic">Jackson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 79 MSPR 46 (1998), and the cases cited therein, because the EEOC did not examine whether the appellant met her burden of ultimately showing that a vacant funded position existed, after determining that the agency did not fulfill its obligation of identifying positions to which the appellant could have been reassigned. We need not decide now whether the EEOC's analysis of the burden of proof for identifying vacant positions for reassignment is so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law because its primary finding was that the agency discriminated against the appellant by denying her leave request. Further, we find no proper basis on which to conclude that the EEOC decision is so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law. Thus, under <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>, the Board lacks authority to disagree with the EEOC decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an appeal involving a claim that accommodation for an anxiety-related condition required a change of both work location and supervisor, <span class="Italic">Joyner v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 57 MSPR 154, 159 (1993), stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]t is undisputed that the appellant refused to return to work in her Budget Assistant position unless her supervisors and work location were changed. Inasmuch as the administrative judge correctly concluded that the appellant was not a handicapped employee because she was not foreclosed from other jobs...the appellant was not entitled to reassignment....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Powers v. DHHS</span>, 7 MSPR 619, 621 (1981), declined to credit job-related anxiety as a disabling condition; the condition did not affect an important life function. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Langon v. DHHS</span>, 749 F. Supp. 1 (D.D.C. 1990) (on summary judgment, finding no duty to accommodate a plaintiff, suffering from multiple sclerosis, through an assignment to home duty when the plaintiff presented insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the accommodations offered by the agency to improve the office work setting were insufficient), <span class="Italic">rev'd and remanded</span>, <span class="Italic">Langon v.

Dept. of Army</span>, 47 MSPR 617, 618-22 (1991) (declining, under the facts presented, but not entirely ruling out the possibility of requiring an agency to remove or reassign supervisors to alleviate the appellant's stress); <span class="Italic">Randall v. USPS</span>, 8 MSPR 434, 438 (1981) (alleged impairment of mental health that may have contributed to an altercation with a supervisor did not establish a disabling condition through the impairment of life activities: "She did not contend that she could not work, only that she required a change in shift to accommodate her fatigue.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Stress disorders may present problems of proof. A stress disorder caused in part by problems experienced in Vietnam was a disabling condition requiring accommodation based upon a favorable prognosis of the appellant's condition<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Villanueva v. USPS</span>, 26 MSPR 534, 537 (1985). However, the diagnosis of PTSD should be based on more than conjecture, even if the diagnosis is made by an expert. There should be evidence of the particular nature of the stressor and an explanation by the expert showing an understanding of the nature and extent of that stressor. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bordelon v. DHHS</span>, 54 MSPR 400, 403-04 (1992). Depression was not established as a disabling condition leading to shoplifting in <span class="Italic">Kelly v. DHHS</span>, 46 MSPR 358, 360-62 (1990), without proof that the depression limited specific major life activities and caused the offense, shoplifting, leading to the adverse action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant in a removal appeal who raises the affirmative defense of handicap discrimination has the burden of proving this defense by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56<span class="Italic">. See Clancy v. Department of the Navy,</span> 6 MSPB 173, 6 MSPR 196, 199 (1981). The appellant must prove not only that she suffers from a handicapping condition, but that the condition caused her misconduct. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Conti v. Department of the</span> Army, 34 MSPR 272, 277 (1987); <span class="Italic">Myers v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 28 MSPR 479, 480-81 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant may generally establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination by: (1) Showing that she is a handicapped person under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(a), and that the action appealed was based on handicap; and (2) to the extent possible, articulating a reasonable accommodation under which the appellant believes she could perform the essential duties of her position or of a vacant position to which she could be reassigned. <span class="Italic">See Savage v. Department of the Navy,</span> 36 MSPR 148, 151-52 (1988). The mere existence of a mental or physical impairment alone, however, is not sufficient to constitute a handicapping condition. <span class="Italic">See Lehman v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Army</span>, 30 MSPR 72, 75 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A "handicapped person" is defined, in part, at 29 CFR 11613.702(a), as one who has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities. The regulations further define mental impairment as "any mental or psychological disorder, such as mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning disabilities." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(b)(2). We find that the appellant has failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination because she has not shown that she is a "handicapped person" under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if we accept the appellant's medical evidence as establishing that she has a mental disorder, there is no showing that it limits a major life function. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(a). The medical record from the appellant's psychiatrist, W. Henao, M.D., shows that the appellant suffers from atypical depression and that she "tends to manipulate facts to suit her own needs, behavior which often ends up to her disadvantage." At the Board hearing, the appellant testified regarding her personal problems, concluding that they exacerbated her stress-related emotional disorder culminating in the shoplifting incidents. She did not, however, provide testimony as to limitations on any major life activity, as defined in 29 CFR 1613.702(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A clinical neuropsychologist, Jack Fletcher, Ph.D., testified at the hearing that the appellant's affective disorder, i.e., depression, was a long-standing problem, and that it was exacerbated by a series of events, as described by the appellant. He further testified, however, that the appellant could care for herself and that she knew what she was doing when shoplifting, that the appellant could separate her shoplifting behavior from her behavior on the job, and that she distorts events to meet her own needs. On re-direct, the psychologist replied affirmatively to the appellant's representative's statement that the impulsive act of stealing was poor judgment and decision-making, that it was an example of self-defeating behavior, and that the appellant's problem-solving skills were impaired. Dr. Fletcher did not, however, link the appellant's depression to significant limitations on specific major life activities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we find that the totality of the evidence is insufficient to warrant a finding that the appellant is a "handicapped person" under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(a). The appellant has failed to carry her threshold burden of establishing by the preponderance of the evidence that she had a mental condition or emotional illness which substantially limited her ability to work or another major life function. <span class="Italic">See Savage,</span> 36 MSPR at 152; <span class="Italic">McKoy v. Federal Communications Commission</span>, 9 MSPB 472, 10 MSPR 221 (1982); <span class="Italic">Powers v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 7 MSPB 453, 7 MSPR 619, 621 (1981). The administrative judge found that the appellant's mental disorder substantially limited her major life activities by interfering with her availability to work. She did not specify, however, the evidence that linked the condition to that life activity, and upon complete review of the record, we find no evidence to support that finding. As the agency notes in its petition, neither the appellant's misconduct nor her mental condition has been shown to have interfered with her availability to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the appellant did not establish that she is a handicapped person, the agency was under no obligation to accommodate the appellant, and any failure to do so could not constitute handicap discrimination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lehman,</span> 30 MSPR at 76.</p>
