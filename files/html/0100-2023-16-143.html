<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-143"><span class="space">e.</span> Interrogation of Representatives; Privileged Communications</h5>
<p class="noindent">Of concern in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv., Washington and NTEU</span>, 38 FLRA 1300, 1308-10 (1991), was whether an agency may, as part of its investigation into allegations of misconduct by a bargaining unit member, require a union representative to disclose information that he obtained as representative of that unit member. The disclosures could not be compelled:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Judge that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute by requiring a representative of the Union, to disclose, under threat of disciplinary action, the content or substance of statements made by an employee to that Union representative in the course of representing the employee in a disciplinary proceeding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This is a case of first impression for the Authority.&#x2003;The statute sets out certain rights and duties that are involved in this matter: Section 7102 protects the right of every employee "to form, join, or assist any labor organization," including the right "to act for a labor organization in the capacity of a representative" and to do so "freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal." Section 7114(a)(1) prescribes that "[a]n exclusive representative is responsible for representing the interests of all employees in the unit it represents"; and section 7114(a)(2)(B) requires that an exclusive representative shall be given the opportunity to be represented at "...any examination of an employee in the unit by a representative of the agency in connection with an investigation if...the employee reasonably believes that the examination may result in disciplinary action against the employee: and...the employee requests representation."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the Statute clearly assures the right and duty of a union to represent employees in disciplinary proceedings, and the correlative right of each employee to be represented. Therefore, it follows, as found by the Judge, that such rights and duties demand that the employee be free to make full and frank disclosure to his or her representative in order that the employee have adequate advice and a proper defense.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The conversations between Union representative Rizzo and employee Mueller occurred while Rizzo was representing Mueller in a disciplinary proceeding and was assessing Mueller's case, Mueller's version of what happened, and the defense they would employ at the oral reply meeting. Accordingly, we conclude that those conversations constituted protected activity. <span class="Italic">Cook Paint</span>, 258 NLRB at 1232 ("consultation between an employee potentially subject to discipline and his union steward constitutes protected activity in one of its purest forms.").[1] Any interference with that protected activity violated the Statute unless, as contended by Respondent, the right to maintain the confidentiality of the conversations had been waived or some overriding need for the information was established.[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;We reject Respondent's argument that cases such as this, which arise under the Statute and involve allegations of theft of property entrusted to the care of the Government, are fundamentally different from <span class="Italic">Cook Paint</span>, which arose in the private sector. Although we agree with Respondent that we must not be party to any violation of the public trust, we fail to see the breach of that trust in according employees and their representatives the <span id="Page_1355"></span>rights to engage in confidential communications without fear of disclosure. Rather, we emphasize that section 7101 of the Statute states that the "effective conduct of public business" is enhanced by the participation of employees in representational activities. As discussed above and in <span class="Italic">Cook Paint</span>, the rights of employees to be represented by their labor organizations in disciplinary proceedings would be seriously weakened if the confidentiality of their conversations with union representatives could easily be violated.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;In the absence of any showing herein of an extraordinary need for the information, we need not reach the issue of what circumstances would permit the questioning of a union representative about employee misconduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Rizzo did not waive the privilege to retain the confidentiality of these conversations.&#x2003;Rizzo clearly objected to being interrogated concerning his conversations with Mueller. Further, the record evidence does not support the Respondent's contention that during the oral reply proceeding "Rizzo volunteered that Mueller had told him about the events in question, and then proceeded to tell Respondent's representatives what Mueller had told him."...&#8197;Rather, the evidence shows that Rizzo simply stated the facts from Mueller's standpoint and that he did not refer to the actual content of his conversations with Mueller....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we specifically adopt the Judge's conclusions that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute by interfering with, restraining, or coercing Mueller in the exercise of rights under the Statute and that it further violated section 7116(a)(1) by interfering with, restraining, or coercing Rizzo both by inhibiting him from obtaining needed information from employees and by interfering with Rizzo's protected right to engage in union activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In so finding, we reject the Respondent's proposed "reasonable belief" standard. Such a standard would be difficult to enforce and would permit agencies to coerce information from union representatives merely by raising evidence of misconduct by employees known to have sought assistance from their representatives. Moreover, as noted by the Judge, such a standard would be largely empty and futile when applied after an interview had already occurred. Therefore, such a standard would undermine the clear, established statutory right and duty of a union to represent employees in disciplinary proceedings, and the correlative right of each employee to be represented.[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;In rejecting the Respondent's "reasonable belief" standard argument, we find it unnecessary to address the Respondent's exception disputing the Judge's factual finding that Rizzo had said that Mueller remembered only "some" of the events of June 5 and 6. In view of our disposition of this case, which makes the reasonableness of Respondent's interrogation of Rizzo's irrelevant, it is not material whether Rizzo's statement was so qualified.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Respondents' special agent asked the employee two questions concerning advice that the Union vice president gave the employee, in an attempt to verify a report that the vice president had advised the employee to lie in the course of an earlier investigation. The GC excepts to the Judge's conclusion that the Respondents established a sufficient overriding need to permit the agent's questions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Judge did not err in finding that the Respondents established a sufficient need to justify the two questions asked by the special agent.&#x2003;In particular, the Respondents were justified in attempting to verify the information that its supervisor had received, that the steward reported an instruction by the Union vice president to falsify an official investigation. This is a serious allegation, and the record does not reveal any way that the Respondents could have determined whether a formal investigation was warranted without questioning the employee and the steward, both of whom also were engaged in protected activity.[3] The special agent limited the questioning to the critical issue, and ended this line of questioning immediately on being told by the employee that there had been no instruction to provide false information. Under these circumstances, the Respondents have established a need for this very limited investigation sufficient to override the right of the employee to keep the conversation confidential.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;As both the steward and the employee were engaged in protected activity, we do not agree with our dissenting colleague's view that, if the Respondents interviewed the steward prior to the employee, then the issue could have been resolved prior to implicating statutory rights.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency's interest in determining the cause of destruction of the mails was sufficient to override the interest of a union representative in protecting the source of information, coupled with the voluntary nature of the union official's disclosure to management of the information he received concerning that destruction, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Robins AFB and AFGE Local 987</span>, 66 FLRA 589, 589, 591-92 (2012):</p>

<p class="noindent-1">After bringing the allegation to management's attention, the Union president was asked, on a few occasions, to divulge the source of the allegation. He refused "to do so because the employee had requested anonymity, fearing retaliation and reprisal by his first-line supervisor." The Union president then received a written directive from his supervisors requiring him "to report to the AFOSI building for an interview." Two investigators from AFOSI--a federal law enforcement agency within the Department of the Air Force "responsib[le] for conducting criminal investigations, counterintelligence activities, and specialized investigative and force protection support"--conducted the interview.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the interview, the investigators asked the Union president to sign a document stating "that disciplinary action, including dismissal[,] could be taken against him for...refus[ing] to answer or fail[ing] to reply fully and truthfully[.]" The Union president refused to do so. The Union president answered all of the investigators' questions "except the one asking him to identify the source of" the allegation. The investigators then concluded the interview.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusion: The Respondent did not violate &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) of the Statute by threatening the Union president with discipline if he refused to disclose the informant's identity. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The GC asserts that the Judge erred in finding that the Respondent is not liable for the actions of AFOSI investigators who are exempt from the Statute's coverage. According to the GC, the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) of the Statute, through AFOSI, by threatening the Union president with discipline if he refused to disclose the identity of the informant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find it unnecessary to address whether the Respondent can be held liable for AFOSI's actions. Even assuming that AFOSI's exemption does not shield the Respondent from ULP liability and that AFOSI was acting as the Respondent's representative, the Respondent did not violate &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The standard for determining whether management's statement or conduct violates &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) is an objective one. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 56 FLRA 696, 697 (2000) (<span class="Italic">VA</span>). The question is whether the statement or conduct would tend to coerce or intimidate the employee, or whether the employee reasonably could have drawn a coercive inference from the statement. <span class="Italic">VA</span>, 56 FLRA at 697; <span class="Italic">see also Dep't of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Ill., </span>34 FLRA 956, 962 (1990)<span class="Italic"> </span>(<span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span>). Although the surrounding circumstances are taken into consideration, the standard is not based on the subjective perceptions of the employee or the intent of the employer. <span class="Italic">E.g., VA</span>, 56 FLRA at 697;<span class="Italic"> Scott AFB</span>, 34 FLRA at 962.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this standard, the Authority has held that a respondent violates &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) by requiring a union representative to disclose, under threat of disciplinary action, privileged communications made by an employee to that union representative in the course of representing the employee in a disciplinary proceeding. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., VA</span>, 56 FLRA at 697; <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Customs Serv., Wash., D.C.</span>, 38 FLRA 1300, 1308 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Customs Serv.</span>). The Authority has determined that such communications should be protected because employees must be free to make full and frank disclosures to their representatives in order to obtain adequate advice and a proper defense. <span class="Italic">See Customs Serv., </span>38 FLRA at 1308; <span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard, Long Beach, Cal.</span>, 44 FLRA 1021, 1037 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Long Beach</span>). However, the Authority has found no violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) when the right to maintain the confidentiality of the conversations was waived or some overriding need for the information was established. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. <span id="Page_1356"></span>Dep't of Treasury, U.S. Customs Serv., Customs Mgmt. Ctr., Ariz.</span>, 57 FLRA 319, 324 (2001) (<span class="Italic">Customs Mgmt. Ctr.</span>) (Member Wasserman dissenting); <span class="Italic">Long Beach</span>, 44 FLRA at 1037-38.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming--without deciding--that the discussion between the Union president and the employee was a privileged communication, the Respondent has established an overriding need to know the informant's identity. Here, the investigation was undertaken after the Union president brought an allegation to management's attention. <span class="Italic">See also Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Office of Internal Affairs, Wash., D.C.</span>, 53 FLRA 1500, 1510 (1998) (taking into account that investigation was undertaken in response to an employee's allegations when determining that the respondent established an extraordinary need for the information). The allegation concerned a serious matter--i.e., that employees working in the Respondent's mailroom were improperly destroying first and second class mail and thus were engaging in possible criminal activity. As a result, the investigators were justified in insisting that the Union president disclose the source of the allegation. <span class="Italic">See Customs Mgmt. Ctr.</span>, 57 FLRA at 324 (finding that, considering the serious nature of the allegation, the respondents were justified in attempting to verify the information that its supervisor had received); <span class="Italic">see also United States v. Nixon</span>, 418 U.S. 683, 703-13 (1974) (the constitutionally-based privilege of the President of the United States to obtain confidential advice from his closest advisors gives way to the need for evidence in a criminal prosecution).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The GC contends that the Respondent has not shown that "the identity of the inform[ant] was necessary" given that AFOSI "did not even bother to determine how many employees work[ed] in [the] Respondent's mail[room] before issuing th[e] threat." However, AFOSI's detachment commander testified that many of AFOSI's agents were, or were preparing to be, deployed overseas, and that, with limited resources, he wanted to go directly to the source of the allegation and "develop a plan of attack from there," rather than interview mail-room employees individually. The GC does not dispute this testimony. Moreover, AFOSI investigators limited their questioning to the identity of the informant, and they immediately concluded the interview when the Union president refused to identify the source of the allegation. <span class="Italic">See Customs Mgmt. Ctr.</span>, 57 FLRA at 324-25 (considering the fact that the special agent limited the questioning to the critical issue and ended his line of questioning immediately on being told by the employee that there had been no instruction to provide false information in finding that the respondent had an overriding need for the information).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under these circumstances, the Respondent has established a need for this information sufficient to override any theorized privilege that might have attached to the informant's identity. <span class="Italic">See Customs Mgmt. Ctr.</span>, 57 FLRA at 325. Accordingly, even assuming AFOSI's exemption does not shield the Respondent from ULP liability, the Respondent did not violate &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent">Considerations of waiver concerning questioning of representatives arose in <span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard and FEMTC</span>, 44 FLRA 1021, 1037-41 (1992). A union representative, Walsh, disclosed to Edwards, a labor relations specialist for the Navy, information concerning an employee, Garcia, that related to Garcia's back pay during a period following removal and before settlement of an MSPB appeal. Later, when the agency became concerned about Garcia's representations concerning his interim pay, the agency sought to interview Walsh about information he gained from Garcia and statements Walsh earlier made to Edwards. Although Walsh objected to investigative inquiries concerning his discussions with Edwards and Garcia, FLRA ruled that Walsh waived his right to silence concerning statements he made to Edwards, but he had not waived that right as to information he directly obtained from Garcia:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Customs Service, Washington, D.C.</span>, we found that the respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute by requiring a union representative to disclose, under threat of disciplinary action, the content or substance of statements made by an employee to the union representative in the course of representing the employee in a disciplinary proceeding. We found that, under the Statute, an employee must be free to make full and frank disclosure to his or her representative in order to obtain adequate advice and a proper defense. In <span class="Italic">Customs Service, Washington, D.C.</span>, the conversations between the union representative and the employee occurred while the representative was representing the employee in a disciplinary proceeding and was assessing his case and the defense they would employ at the oral reply meeting. Accordingly, we concluded that "those conversations constituted protected activity." 38 FLRA at 1308. We stated that "[a]ny interference with that protected activity violated the Statute unless...the right to maintain the confidentiality of the conversations had been waived or some overriding need for the information was established." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1309.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Customs Service, Washington, D.C.</span>, we found that the representative did not waive the privilege to retain the confidentiality of these conversations. We noted that the representative clearly objected to being interrogated concerning his conversations with the employee. Further, we found that, contrary to the respondent's contention, the record did not show that during the oral reply proceeding the representative volunteered that the employee had told him about the events in question and then proceeded to tell the respondent's representatives what the employee had told him. Rather, we found that the evidence showed that the representative simply stated the facts from the employee's standpoint and that the representative did not refer to the actual content of his conversations with the employee. 38 FLRA at 1309.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, in <span class="Italic">Customs Service, Washington, D.C.</span>, we found that the respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute by interfering with, restraining, or coercing the employee in the exercise of rights under the Statute and that it further violated section 7116(a)(1) by interfering with, restraining, or coercing the representative both by inhibiting him from obtaining needed information from employees and by interfering with his protected right to engage in union activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying <span class="Italic">Customs Service, Washington, D.C</span>. to this case, we must determine whether the Respondent required Walsh to disclose, under threat of disciplinary action, the content or substance of statements made by Garcia to Walsh in the course of representing Garcia, in violation of section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute. As an initial matter, we find that conversations between Garcia and Walsh, in which Garcia told Walsh that he had been engaged in outside employment during his period of removal from the Shipyard, occurred while Walsh was representing Garcia in a disciplinary proceeding and a subsequent settlement of the disciplinary action. Accordingly, consistent with our decision in <span class="Italic">Customs Service, Washington, D.C.</span>, we conclude that the conversations between Garcia and Walsh constituted protected activity and that Walsh had the right to maintain the confidentiality of those conversations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Any interference with that protected activity violated the Statute unless the right to maintain the confidentiality of the conversations had been waived or some overriding need for the information was established.&#x2003;Inasmuch as there is no allegation herein of an overriding need for the information, we need not reach the issue of what circumstances would permit the questioning of a union representative about employee misconduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We next consider whether the right to maintain the confidentiality of those conversations between Garcia and Walsh concerning Garcia's outside employment was waived. In <span class="Italic">Customs Service, Washington, D.C.</span>, we found that the representative did not waive the right to maintain the confidentiality of the conversations found to constitute protected activity. We noted that the representative clearly objected to being interrogated concerning his conversations with the employee. Similarly, in this case, the record demonstrates that in the interviews of May 23 and June 3, Walsh clearly objected to being interrogated concerning his conversations with Garcia. Based on the record before us, we find, contrary to the Judge's determinations, that during the May 23 and June 3 interviews Walsh was invoking the privilege accorded to information disclosed by an employee to his or her representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having determined that Walsh invoked the privilege accorded to information disclosed by an employee to his or her representative, we must examine whether Walsh had a right under the Statute to maintain the confidentiality of the information disclosed. During the May 23 interview, Walsh refused to answer two specific questions asked by the CID investigators. First, Walsh refused to answer the investigators' question about whether Walsh had ever spoken with Edwards about Garcia working and collecting money while he was out on unemployment. We find, in agreement with the reasoning and finding of the Judge, that Walsh did not have a right under the Statute to keep confidential any information that he had already told Edwards. Therefore, we conclude that the investigators' question was not improper and would not have constituted a violation of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, Walsh refused to answer the investigators' question on May 23 about whether Walsh had any knowledge of Garcia "working off the books." Unlike the first question, which was an attempt to find out what Walsh had told Edwards, this question was an effort to find out what Garcia had disclosed to Walsh. We agree with the Judge that "the proper line of questioning is not what Garcia told Walsh, but, rather, what Walsh told Ms. Edwards." Accordingly, we find, in agreement with the Judge and contrary to the Respondent's assertion in its cross-exception, that with respect to this question, Walsh had a right under the Statute to invoke the privilege accorded to information disclosed by an employee to his or her representative. We found above that Walsh invoked the privilege. We further find that the Respondent, through Keeling, threatened Walsh on August 29 with disciplinary action in part because Walsh had refused to answer this question.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By threatening Walsh on August 29 with disciplinary action because Walsh refused to disclose the content or substance of statements made to him by Garcia while Walsh was representing Garcia, the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute by interfering with, restraining, or coercing Walsh in the exercise of his rights under the Statute. For these reasons, we disagree with the Judge's conclusion that Keeling's conduct <span id="Page_1357"></span>on August 29 simply constituted compliance with the parties' agreement. We also disagree with the Judge to the extent that he held that because Walsh called Keeling on August 29 and asked what the recommended penalty would be, Keeling's response did not constitute an unfair labor practice. The fact that Keeling's action on August 29 was in response to a question from Walsh does not address the basis for the Respondent's threat to discipline Walsh and, therefore, is not relevant to the question of whether the Respondent's threat to discipline Walsh was based on an impermissible reason.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that during the June 3 interview, Walsh refused to sign the administrative warning and to answer any questions. In agreement with the Judge, we find that, inasmuch as Walsh's reason for refusing to answer was not in response to specific questions, we cannot ascertain whether such refusal was protected by a right to maintain the confidentiality of the information sought. Accordingly, we make no finding as to whether the investigators' attempt on June 3 to interrogate Walsh was improper and constituted a violation of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that an order requiring the Respondent to cease and desist from its improper action and to post a notice is appropriate to effectuate the purposes and policies of the Statute.&#x2003;</p>
<p class="noindent">Of waiver of a potential privilege, the Merit Systems Protection Board considered unprotected from disciplinary action statements by an employee to a union representative when that representative voluntarily repeated the comments to an agency labor relations office, <span class="Italic">Berkner v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 116 MSPR 277 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-17, 2011 MSPB 27 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On April 22, 2009, the agency proposed to remove the appellant, a Geographer with the U.S. Census Bureau, based on a charge of making inappropriate statements. Specifically, the agency charged:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">On Friday, April 17, 2009, [the appellant] met with Franklin Silberstein, Chief Steward, AFGE local 2782, at approximately 12:15 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span> [regarding her then-pending discrimination complaint.] During that meeting, [the appellant] clearly stated to Mr. Silberstein, "If I get fired, I'll kill myself." [Silberstein] asked [the appellant] not to do that. [The appellant] explained that when [she] kill[s] [her]self, [she] will return and haunt people, perhaps even being born again and getting even that way. [The appellant] also stated that [she] might take others with [her], adding, "Not here, I know where they live."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">After Mr. Silberstein asked [the appellant] to not take things into [her] own hands and asked [her] to recant [her] statement, [she] replied, "I recant it, but I will do what I will do. I'll do what I do."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's communications with her union representative were not privileged. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her petition for review, the appellant asserts that the administrative judge erred in denying her motion <span class="Italic">in limine</span> and in finding that her communications with Mr. Silberstein as her union representative were not privileged. The appellant asserts that the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) has determined that communications between a union representative and a bargaining unit employee are privileged against disclosure to management for purposes of disciplining the employee. (citing <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury Customs Service and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 38 F.L.R.A. 1300, 1308 (1990)). The appellant further asserts that the Board should defer to the FLRA on this issue and should not create a disparity between its own case law and that of the FLRA. She thus encourages the Board to hold that "communications between an employee and either an EEO representative or a union representative are privileged and may not serve as the basis for any adverse employment action against the employee." She further encourages the Board to extend the FLRA's reasoning to hold that the only party who may waive the privilege is the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed more fully below, because we believe that the facts in the instant case do not support the application of a privilege between a union representative and a bargaining unit employee, even as recognized by the FLRA, the Board need not determine whether to establish such a privilege under Board law.[*]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[*]&#x2003;The Board has stated that "evidentiary privileges should not be lightly granted." <span class="Italic">See Gangi v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 165, &#x00B6; 23 (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's communications with her union representative are distinguishable from those held to be privileged under FLRA law. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although FLRA decisions are not binding on us,<span class="Italic"> Fanelli v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 115, &#x00B6; 11 (2008), we have relied upon the FLRA's reasoning in certain contexts, as appropriate, <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of Energy</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 430, &#x00B6; 10 (2001). The appellant correctly points out that the FLRA has found that the "content or substance of statements made by an employee to [her] Union representative in the course of representing the employee in a disciplinary proceeding" is protected as privileged. <span class="Italic">See Customs Service</span>, 38 F.L.R.A. at 1308 (finding that the agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) by requiring a union representative to disclose, under threat of disciplinary action, the content of statements made by an employee); <span class="Italic">see also </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1). An agency may not interfere with the confidentiality of such communication unless the right to maintain the confidentiality of the conversations has been waived or some overriding need for the information is established. <span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard and Federal Employees Metal Trades Council AFL-CIO</span>, 44 F.L.R.A. 1021, 1038-40 (1992) (finding that conversations between a bargaining unit employee and a union representative constituted protected activity and that the agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) by threatening a union representative with disciplinary action for refusing to disclose the content or substance of statements made to him by a bargaining unit employee).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the appellant is correct that the FLRA recognizes such a privilege, even the FLRA limits the scope of protection. The FLRA has recognized that an agency's need for information regarding protected conversations may arise in the context of an investigation of employee misconduct. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">United States Department of Treasury United States Customs Service Customs Management Center and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 57 F.L.R.A. 319 (2001) (finding that the agency established a sufficient need to justify questioning a bargaining unit employee concerning the advice given by a union vice president in light of an allegation that the vice president advised the employee to lie in the course of an earlier investigation). Further, in a case with facts similar to the instant case, the FLRA found that an agency established an extraordinary need to conduct an investigation and question bargaining unit employees regarding an alleged incident at a union meeting following the agency's receipt of a sworn affidavit from an employee alleging that physical violence had been threatened by one employee against another on the premises. <span class="Italic">See Federal Bureau of Prisons Office of Internal Affairs and American Federation of Government Employees</span>, 53 F.L.R.A. 1500, 1510 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, <span class="Italic">Customs Service </span>and <span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard</span>, in which the FLRA recognized as privileged communications between an employee and a union representative, are factually distinguishable from the instant appeal and thus do not establish that the appellant's statements to Mr. Silberstein are privileged. In both <span class="Italic">Customs Service </span>and <span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard</span>, the agency was seeking, under the threat of discipline, to <span class="Italic">require </span>disclosure of confidential information that otherwise would be protected, and the union representative objected to being interrogated regarding his conversation with a bargaining unit employee. <span class="Italic">See Long Beach Naval Shipyard</span>, 44 F.L.R.A. at 1039; <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, 38 F.L.R.A. at 1308-09. In <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, the agency sought to interview a union representative regarding the statements of a union employee, who was charged with dishonest conduct and attempted theft, to the representative concerning the employee's recollection of relevant events. <span class="Italic">See Customs Service</span>, 38 F.L.R.A. at 1301-02. The union representative protested the interview, and the agency cautioned the representative that he was required to disclose information relating to the investigation of the union employee and that he could be subject to disciplinary action if he refused. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1302. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard</span>, the agency sought to require a union representative to disclose, under threat of disciplinary action, the content of statements made by a union employee to the representative regarding whether the employee was engaged in outside employment during his period of removal. <span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard</span>, 44 F.L.R.A. at 1038. The union representative objected to being interrogated concerning his conversations with the union employee. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1039.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, Mr. Silberstein voluntarily reported the appellant's comments to the agency's labor relations department and drafted a memorandum detailing the conversation. Further, as noted above, the statements in the instant case were analogous to those at issue in <span class="Italic">Federal Bureau of Prisons </span>in which the FLRA found that the agency had an extraordinary need to conduct an investigation. Thus, the instant case is factually distinguishable from those such as <span class="Italic">Customs Service </span>and <span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard </span>in which the FLRA has recognized and enforced a privilege protecting communications between a union representative and a bargaining unit employee. Accordingly, the appellant's suggestion that our failure to find her communications privileged in the instant case would create a disparity between the law as applied by the Board and the FLRA is without merit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's communications are not protected under Board law.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In asserting that the Board should recognize a privilege for communications between a union representative and a bargaining unit employee,<span class="Italic"> </span>the appellant relies on the Board's decision in<span class="Italic"> Daigle v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 625 (1999), as evidence that the Board recognizes the importance of confidential communications between an employee and an EEO counselor. In <span class="Italic">Daigle</span>, the agency proposed to remove Mr. Daigle based on, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, a charge of disrespectful conduct toward agency personnel after Mr. Daigle, during an EEO counseling session and in referring to a supervisor, stated that "[i]f I wasn't a sane man, I'd take a weapon and blow the motherfucker's brains out." <span class="Italic">Daigle</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 625, &#x00B6; 2. In refusing to sustain the charge, the Board stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="Page_1358"></span>Given the fact that EEO counseling sessions are a semi-confidential means through which employees complain about the conduct of other agency personnel, <span class="Italic">see </span>29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105, and the fact that complainants are likely to be emotionally distraught when they are reporting perceived discrimination to the EEO counselor, these sessions are one of the contexts in which it is reasonable to afford employees more leeway with regard to their conduct than they might otherwise be afforded in other employment situations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find a distinction between venting about the actions of a particular supervisor in the course of an EEO counseling session and the appellant's statements that she would kill herself, return to haunt people, and possibly take others with her if the agency removed her. While Mr. Daigle's statements were disturbing, in addition to profane, it was implicit in his statement that he would not actually harm his supervisor as he stated that he would take such actions if he were <span class="Italic">not </span>a sane man. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>, &#x00B6; 2. Mr. Daigle also was clearly venting his frustrations with respect to a particular supervisor as it directly related to his EEO matter as opposed to the appellant's statements threatening suicide and broadly indicating a willingness to harm multiple agency employees, potentially even at their residences, if the agency removed her. Moreover, ignoring or excusing the appellant's statements that she would kill herself and potentially others if she were removed goes far beyond extending employees additional "leeway" in their conduct while speaking with an EEO counselor. Accordingly, the fact that the appellant's inappropriate statements were made during the course of a meeting with her EEO representative does not excuse her inappropriate statements or prevent the agency from relying on such statements in its removal action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We acknowledge that we have previously expressed concern with an agency taking an adverse action against an employee on the basis of statements made to medical professionals and employee assistance program (EAP) counselors. <span class="Italic">See Larry v. Department of Justice</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 348 (1997); <span class="Italic">Powell v. Department of Justice</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 29 (1997). In <span class="Italic">Larry</span>, the agency charged Mr. Larry with, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, threatening a supervisor based on statements that Mr. Larry made to a psychotherapist in the agency's EAP. <span class="Italic">Larry</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 355. The Board found that the agency failed to prove that the appellant made a threat under the elements set forth in <span class="Italic">Metz v. Department of Treasury</span>, 780 F.2d 1001 (Fed. Cir. 1986), because the evidence showed that the appellant made the statements in the course of psychotherapy with the intent to obtain professional treatment for his violent feelings and not with the intent to threaten anyone. <span class="Italic">Larry</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 358. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Powell</span>, the agency charged the appellant with threatening to kill five agency employees based on statements he made in a telephone conversation with an EAP counselor. <span class="Italic">Powell</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 32. In considering whether the agency proved its charge under <span class="Italic">Metz</span>, the Board noted that it was "particularly troubled by the agency's use of the appellant's conversation with an EAP counselor as the basis for his removal," reasoning that the agency advertised its EAP as a confidential program where employees could obtain assistance. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 35.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Larry </span>and <span class="Italic">Powell</span>, however, are distinguishable from the instant case in important aspects. First, <span class="Italic">Larry </span>and <span class="Italic">Powell </span>both involved threat charges and required analysis under <span class="Italic">Metz</span>. <span class="Italic">See Gray v. Government Printing Office</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 184, &#x00B6; 11 (2009) (recognizing a distinction between <span class="Italic">Powell </span>and <span class="Italic">Larry</span>, in which the agency was required to prove a threat charge under <span class="Italic">Metz</span>, and a charge of making statements that cause anxiety in the workplace). Here, the appellant was charged only with inappropriate statements. Moreover, the appellant here made her statements to her union and EEO representative, not to a licensed psychotherapist or EAP counselor. <span class="Italic">Cf. Jaffee v. Redmond</span>, 518 U.S. 1 (1996) (recognizing a federal licensed psychotherapist-patient privilege). Accordingly, we perceive no support in Board case law for finding that the appellant's statements to her union representative were privileged.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's statements would not be protected under the attorney-client privilege. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The attorney-client privilege is the oldest privilege recognized for confidential communications at common law and is intended "to encourage full and frank communications between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and the administration of justice." <span class="Italic">Upjohn Co. v. United States</span>, 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981); <span class="Italic">Grimes v. Department of the Navy</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 7, &#x00B6; 6 (2005). When considering claims of attorney-client privilege, we have relied on the following elements:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The privilege only applies if (1) the asserted holder of the privilege is or sought to become a client; (2) the person to whom the communication was made is (a) a member of a bar of a court, or his subordinate, and (b) in connection with the communication is acting as a lawyer; (3) the communication relates to a fact of which the attorney was informed (a) by his client (b) without the presence of strangers (c) for the purpose of securing primarily either (i) an opinion on law or (ii) legal services (iii) or assistance in some legal proceeding, and not (d) for the purpose of committing a crime or tort; and (4) the privilege has been (a) claimed and (b) not waived by the client.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Grimes</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 7, &#x00B6; 9 (citing <span class="Italic">United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp.</span>, 89 F. Supp. 357, 358-59 (D. Mass. 1950)); <span class="Italic">Gangi</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 165, &#x00B6; 24.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this standard, even if Mr. Silberstein had been the appellant's attorney, rather than her union and EEO representative, the appellant's communications to him would not have been privileged under the high confidentiality standards imposed under the attorney-client relationship. The appellant's statements that she would kill herself and potentially others if she were removed were not communications made in order to obtain legal advice and fall within the future crime exception to the attorney-client privilege. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Alexander</span>, 287 F.3d 811, 816 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that a client's threats to harm others, as communicated to his attorney by telephone and letter, were not communications made in order to obtain legal advice, constituted threats to commit future crimes, and were therefore not protected by the attorney-client privilege). Accordingly, the appellant's statements would not have been protected by the attorney-client privilege.</p>
<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit interceded to reverse FLRA's position as to interrogation of union representatives by IG or Department of Justice personnel. The court explained in <span class="Italic">DOJ v. FLRA</span>, 39 F.3d 361, 363-64, 368-69 (D.C. Cir. 1994), <span class="Italic">vacating and remanding</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Washington, D.C. and Nat'l Border Patrol Council, AFGE</span>, 46 FLRA 1526 (1993) (ALJ Decision), that union representatives cannot shield information they obtain from disclosure to agency inspectors general:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In early 1990, the Office of Inspector General in the Department of Justice opened an investigation of Border Patrol Agent Jason S. Wood of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, an agency within the Justice Department. Wood, who worked at the Plentywood, Montana, Border Patrol Office, was suspected of selling government-owned ammunition, falsifying his time and attendance records and gambling and abusing alcohol.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statutory authority to investigate law enforcement personnel employed at the Justice Department rests with the Department's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR)...&#8197;The Office of Inspector General conducts investigations of such individuals for OPR pursuant to a memorandum of understanding between the two offices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Inspector General utilized Edward L.&#x2003;Nelson, an assistant Chief Patrol Agent of the Service, to conduct the investigation of Wood. It is agreed that while Nelson performed his duties for the Inspector General, the Immigration and Naturalization Service could not direct or control him.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The National Border Patrol Council, American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, served as the collective bargaining representative of a bargaining unit including Wood and other agents in the region. The union had a collective bargaining agreement with the Service. When Wood got wind of the investigation, he spoke with Jerry Gillies, a vice president of the union and, like Wood, a Border Patrol Agent. During their conversations in January 1990 and on July 15 and 16, 1990, Wood supplied details about his conduct. Gillies gave advice to Wood, told him that Nelson--who was in town--was an investigator for the Inspector General, and informed Wood of the procedures that would be followed when he submitted to an interview.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On July 15, 1990, while Wood and Gillies were talking on the telephone, Nelson arrived at Wood's home. Nelson told Wood that he was under investigation and instructed him to appear for an "investigative examination." The next day, Nelson spoke with an Assistant United States Attorney regarding the possibility of prosecuting Wood for stealing government property. The prosecutor believed he did not have enough evidence to prove that the government owned the ammunition Wood sold. When Nelson mentioned that Wood may have talked to Gillies about the ammunition, the prosecutor requested Nelson to interview Gillies. Nelson did so by telephone on July 17, 1990, with another special agent of the Office of Inspector General.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Gillies was reluctant to give any information to Nelson.&#x2003;He said he had been acting as a union representative when Wood talked with him and thought their conversations were privileged. Nelson responded that no such privilege existed and warned Gillies that if he refused to answer, his security clearance might be revoked, and he could be subject to disciplinary action. Answering Nelson's questions, Gillies supplied information about Wood's selling ammunition, falsifying time and attendance records, gambling and other matters, all of which Gillies had learned from Wood in their talks.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On July 18, 1990, Nelson conducted his "investigative examination" of Wood under oath and on the record. (By then, the Assistant United States Attorney had reviewed the results of the Gillies interview and had determined not to prosecute Wood.) William Hagen, another Border Patrol Agent, accompanied Wood as his union representative. Nelson advised Wood that he would be required to testify about allegations <span id="Page_1359"></span>of misconduct. He warned Wood that anything he said could be used against him in administrative disciplinary proceedings but not in criminal proceedings unless he testified falsely, and that if he refused to answer, "this may subject you to revocation of any security clearance you may hold as well as disciplinary action up to and including removal from the Service." After administering an oath to Wood, Nelson questioned him about the ammunition sales and other matters, including Wood's conversations with Gillies and Wood's conducting an unauthorized investigation of Nelson. Twice Hagen requested an adjournment so that he could meet privately with Wood. Both times Nelson denied the request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nelson provided the results of his investigation to an Office of Inspector General "coordinator" in the Service's regional office. Thereafter, the Inspector General supplied a copy of Nelson's written report to the Service. The Service notified Wood that it proposed to remove him on the grounds that he had stolen government property; had falsified, misstated, exaggerated, or concealed material facts in connection with an investigation or other proper proceeding; and had engaged in conduct unbecoming an officer. Representing Wood in the disciplinary proceeding, the union forwarded requests to the Service for five different types of documentary material "'[i]n order to properly respond to the allegations set forth in the notice' of proposed removal." The Service provided some, but not all, of the information. At the conclusion of proceedings, the Service decided to suspend Wood for five days.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On a complaint brought by the General Counsel of the Federal Labor Relations Authority at the union's urging, the Administrative Law Judge ruled that the Office of Inspector General and OPR had committed unfair labor practices in violation of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (8), by...questioning Wood and Gillies about their "privileged" conversations....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ALJ held that the investigator had infringed upon the employee-union representative "privilege" established in <span class="Italic">United States Department of Treasury Customs Service, Washington, D.C.</span>, 38 F.L.R.A. 1300 (1991). Quoting the ALJ, the Authority in <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> viewed the issue as "whether the designated union representative of an employee in an actual or potential disciplinary action can be examined by management concerning statements made by the employee to his, or her, representative." 38 F.L.R.A., at 1302. There is, the Authority answered, a "privilege" protecting "the content or substance of statements made by an employee to [his] Union representative in the course of representing the employee in a disciplinary proceeding." 38 F.L.R.A. at 1308. Because section 7114(a) "assures the right and duty of a union to represent employees in disciplinary proceedings," an employee must "be free to make full and frank disclosure to his or her representative in order that the employee have adequate advice and a proper defense<span class="Italic">." Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not question this reasoning insofar as it applies to management.&#x2003;But the Office of Inspector General is not within that category. The Inspector General operates independently, his investigatory procedures are not a proper subject of collective bargaining, and he does not act on behalf of the employing agency. The privilege the Authority recognizes, derived from the section 7114(a) right of an employee to union representation in an investigation, may be good as against management. But it is not good as against the world. The Authority's jurisdiction is limited to labor-management relations. As its counsel agreed at oral argument, whatever privilege the Authority set up in that context would not shield a conversation between an employee and his union representative from disclosure in court, or before a grand jury. If an FBI or a DEA agent, or a federal prosecutor--all Department of Justice employees--pressured a union official to reveal such a conversation, this would not constitute an unfair labor practice for the quite apparent reason that section 7114(a) does not apply. So too with the Office of Inspector General, as Congress has created it.</p>
<p class="noindent">From the Federal Circuit--whether a conversation between a union representative and a bargaining unit employee is privileged from redisclosure in situations not involving threats or criminal activity was briefly discussed in <span class="Italic">Martin v. DHS</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-1578.Opinion.4-20-2020_1572692.pdf">810 Fed. Appx. 867</a>, 871 (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP), determining there to be no privilege as to the use by the agency in an adverse action against the union official (Martin) for inappropriate comments he made:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Mr. Martin is a former DHS customs officer and former chapter president of the National Treasury Employees union ("union"). In 2015, the DHS Office of Inspector General ("OIG") received complaints from two agency employees, Ms. Lozoya and Ms. Demara, that, while discussing union matters off-duty, Mr. Martin made sexually inappropriate comments to each of them about these employees' providing sexual favors to him in exchange for union services. DHS OIG opened an investigation and interviewed Ms. Lozoya and Ms. Demara. OIG then recorded, with the consent of Ms. Lozoya and Ms. Demara, Mr. Martin's telephone conversations with both employees, and made a video recording of Mr. Martin's meeting with Ms. Demara in a hotel room. In the telephone recordings, Mr. Martin referred to the employees as having an "IOU" list with him; he discussed spanking them; and he made comments such as "Who's your daddy?" and "It's your daddy." During the video recording, Mr. Martin referred to one of his supervisors, Jimmy Tong, with a racial slur.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AJ found that the agency did not commit an unfair labor practice by recording employees while they discussed union business, finding the recording to be "a proper exercise of management's rights." The AJ noted that even if a union representative-bargaining unit member privilege exists in this context, it was waived by Ms. Lozoya and Ms. Demara when they agreed to the recordings. He also found that Mr. Martin's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated because Ms. Lozoya and Ms. Demara consented to the recordings, and, moreover, that the exclusionary rule "does not apply to administrative proceedings." J.A. 38 (quoting <span class="Italic">Fahrenbacher v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 260, &#x00B6; 14, n.5 (M.S.P.B. 2001)). Finding a nexus between the sustained charges and the efficiency of the service, the AJ affirmed the agency's removal of Mr. Martin from federal service.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Mr. Martin argues that the Board abused its discretion in not finding that the OIG committed an unfair labor practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) when it interfered with confidential conversations between a union representative and a bargaining union member. This court has not recognized a union representative-bargaining unit member privilege. To the extent that it exists, however, we hold that it does not protect union representatives from charges of misconduct based on discussions with unit member employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This privilege appears to originate from a decision by the Federal Labor Relations Authority ("FLRA") in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury Customs Service Washington, D.C. (Respondent) &#x0026; Nat'l Treasury Employees Union (Charging Party),</span> 38 F.L.R.A. 1300 (Jan. 8, 1990). In that case, the privilege was recognized for the benefit of the employee: "that <span class="Italic">the employee</span> be free to make full and frank disclosure to his or her representative in order that <span class="Italic">the employee</span> have adequate advice and a proper defense." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1308 (emphasis added). In the few cases that have recognized this privilege, the privilege has been asserted for the benefit of protecting employee disclosures, not those of the union representative. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Justice v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth</span>., 39 F.3d 361, 368-69 (D.C. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Bell v. Vill. of Streamwood</span>, 806 F. Supp.2d 1052, 1058 (N.D. Ill. 2011); <span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard Long Beach, California (Respondent) &#x0026; Fed. Emps. Metal Trades Council AFL-CIO (Charging Party/union),</span> 44 F.L.R.A. 1021, 1038 (Apr. 29, 1992). The union representative-bargaining unit member privilege is analogous to the attorney-client privilege, whose purpose is also to "to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients." <span class="Italic">Upjohn Co. v. United States</span>, 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981). And just as the attorney-client privilege "is that of the client, not that of the attorney," <span class="Italic">Am. Standard Inc. v. Pfizer Inc</span>., 828 F.2d 734, 745 (Fed. Cir. 1987), if there is a union representative-bargaining unit member privilege, it belongs to the employee and not the union representative. The Board thus committed no error in holding that Mr. Martin could not assert the privilege.</p>
<p class="noindent">Distinguishable from cases involving interrogation of representatives concerning their communications with those they represent on matters pertaining to working conditions of unit members are interrogations of union officials about their own conduct as representatives. <span class="Italic">Fed. Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 709</span>, 53 FLRA 1500, 1508-12 (1998), involved an agency's investigation of an alleged threat by a union official against another person during a union meeting on agency property. The ensuing investigation was not interference with union activities as long as the inquiry involved the allegedly threatening conduct and not the content of substantive discussions during the union meeting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The standard for determining whether the initiation and/or conduct of the investigation into the Union meeting incident violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute is whether, viewed objectively, Respondent Internal Affairs' actions would tend to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of rights protected under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Hill AFB</span>, 35 FLRA at 895....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel emphasizes that the complaint does not assert a <span class="Italic">"per se"</span> violation based on the fact that a Union meeting was the venue of the activity being investigated and, instead, is asking only that this fact be considered relevant. The General Counsel claims, however, that the initiation of the investigation violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute because Respondent Internal Affairs "had no 'extraordinary need,' to conduct the investigation."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Judge noted, the Authority previously has held that a union representative cannot be compelled to divulge confidential information given to the representative by a unit employee unless an agency establishes an "extraordinary need" for the information. In <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, 38 FLRA at 1308, the Authority stated that, absent extraordinary need, an employee's right to confidentiality of statements made to a union representative in preparation for a disciplinary hearing is necessary <span id="Page_1360"></span>in order for the employee to be free to make frank disclosures to the union representative. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Long Beach</span>, 44 FLRA at 1038, the Authority held that, absent extraordinary need, an agency does not have a right to information that an employee relates to his union representative in the course of an action before the Merit Systems Protection Board. As in <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, the Authority stated in <span class="Italic">Long Beach</span> that an employee must be free to make frank disclosures to the union representative in order for the employee to receive adequate representation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1037 (citing <span class="Italic">Customs Service)</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The context in which this case arises is different from that in <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> and <span class="Italic">Long Beach</span>. In particular, it is neither argued nor apparent that: (1) Respondent Internal Affairs was seeking to require disclosure of confidential information that otherwise would be protected; or (2) any of the unit members interviewed by the Respondent was representing another unit member in a disciplinary proceeding or other proceeding such that a need for confidentiality is apparent. In addition, no cases other than <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> and <span class="Italic">Long Beach</span> have been cited where an agency was required to establish the "extraordinary need" referenced in those cases. Accordingly, we are not persuaded that, applying Authority precedent, the Respondent was required to establish an extraordinary need to conduct the disputed investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, even if the Respondent were required to establish "extraordinary need," we find that the facts and circumstances in this case constituted such need. The investigation was undertaken following the receipt of a sworn affidavit from an employee alleging that physical violence had been threatened by one employee against another on the premises of a Federal correctional institution. We agree with the Judge that, even considering the concerns expressed by the Special Agent about the veracity of the affidavit, "it would have been irresponsible" not to investigate the charges contained in the affidavit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our conclusion that the initiation of the investigation did not violate the Statute is supported by the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Defense Property Disposal Region Ogden, Utah and</span> <span class="Italic">Defense Property Disposal Office (DPDO), Camp Pendleton</span>, <span class="Italic">Oceanside, California</span>, 24 FLRA 653, 657 (1986) <span class="Italic">(DPDO)</span>, cited by the Judge. In <span class="Italic">DPDO</span>, the Authority found that a union steward, who took pictures of unit members' activity at a military site, was engaged in protected activity because the steward intended to use the pictures in filing a grievance. The Authority also found, however, that military guards did not interfere with the union steward's rights under the statute by observing the steward while he took the pictures because, according to the Authority, the guards needed to be concerned about security breaches and the military installation needed to be subject to certain rules in order to be protected from sabotage and espionage. The instant case, which concerns possible physical violence at a Federal prison, presents similar security concerns.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we deny the General Counsel's exception to the Judge's conclusion that the initiation of the investigation into the Union meeting incident did not violate the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the testimony, our review of the transcript as a whole leads us to conclude that it supports the Judge's factual finding that the Special Agent took pains not to trespass on Union business, and that he avoided the substance of the Union meeting (the asbestos issue). The General Counsel does not dispute the Judge's conclusion that the Special Agent's testimony regarding his approach to the investigation was "credibl[e]." In this regard, the Special Agent testified specifically that he took precautions to avoid questioning employees about Union business. The Agent also testified that he was not interested in Union business, that he did not ask questions about the content of the Union meeting in general, and that he did not ask questions about asbestos specifically.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have considered the testimony of the Special Agent concerning a quotation in one of the affidavits about the Union President's use of profanity. The Special Agent acknowledged that he inserted the quotation into one of the affidavits, even though the interviewee had stated in the interview that she could not remember the exact profanity used by the Union President. The Special Agent also admitted that he allowed interviewees to identify other employees who attended the Union meeting. The Agent testified further that he did not stop unit employees from supplying information about events that occurred before adjournment of the meeting because, according to the Agent, it seemed that the unit member considered these events relevant. Examined in isolation, this testimony provides some support for the General Counsel's position. However, understood in the context of the case, and given the credited testimony above, we find that the testimony does not indicate a methodology that trespassed on protected rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the affidavits, contrary to the General Counsel's assertion, this evidence does not establish that the interviewed employees were subjected to coercive questioning. The affidavits do not recite the content of the questions posed by the Special Agent and his colleague who conducted the interviews; the affiants' statements present only their answers in response to those questions. Therefore, they do not provide direct insight into the content of the questioning. Although the affidavits mention note-taking and voting in general terms, they give no indication of the content of either the notes or the voting. All one can glean from the affidavits is that the Associate Warden's wife attended the meeting, and that the Union President opposed her presence and her note-taking. Thus, contrary to the General Counsel's assertion, it is impossible to ascertain from reading the affidavits whether the interviewed Union member was "beleaguered," or whether the special agents "[wrote] everything down." Moreover, even assuming that the agents did write everything down, the General Counsel has not indicated why that would constitute a violation of the Statute rather than an effort to record the interview accurately.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel also asserts that the questioning was coercive because the interviewees were directed "to appear at a certain time and a certain place to provide information about their protected activity." However, the fact that the interviews were set in advance does not make them coercive. An equally plausible explanation is that the Special Agent and his colleagues arranged in advance for a time and place when they could meet with the employees. There is nothing necessarily coercive about scheduling an appointment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Interference occurred when an agency EEO investigator required a union steward to disclose discussions the steward had with an employee with whom he worked to prepare a response to a proposed admonishment. The response spawned an EEO complaint from the grievant's supervisor. The union steward could reasonably conclude that he would be subject to discipline if he did not answer the questions of the EEO investigator. The agency compounded the ULP by offering a settlement to the steward, who apparently was named in the EEO complaint, requesting the steward to agree to cease harassment of the supervisor. The union's right and duty to pursue the employee's reply to the admonishment was impaired by the settlement proposal because the agency was requesting that the union agree to limit its representational responsibilities. <span class="Italic">VA and AFGE Local 1687</span>, 56 FLRA 696, 697-98 (2000).
