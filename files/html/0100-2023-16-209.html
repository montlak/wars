<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-209"><span class="space">b.</span> Orientation Sessions</h5>
<p class="noindent">Through 1987 it seemed clear that orientation sessions between new employees, including employees within the bargaining unit, and personnel specialists of the agency were considered formal discussions. Attendance was mandatory; discussion concerned personnel policies and general employment conditions. The union was entitled to have its members' interests represented at the orientation meetings. <span class="Italic">DHEW, Region IV, Atlanta and NTEU</span>, 5 FLRA 458, 460 (1981) ("Inasmuch as the orientation sessions in question are formal discussions within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(a) of the statute the union is entitled to be represented at them insofar as they involve any member of its bargaining unit."). It was not required that there be actual dialogue at an orientation session to make it a formal meeting requiring the agency to permit the presence of the exclusive representative. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE Local 1395</span>, 16 FLRA 232, 242-43 (1984) (ALJ Decision) ("[N]ew and/or rehired employees came into the Cottage Grove office to begin work. New employees were introduced to other employees, in 1981, either in staff meetings or in desk-to-desk introductions.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Matters changed, or at least distinctions were created. In <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Region</span> <span class="Italic">II and AFGE Local 2369</span>, 29 FLRA 1205, 1207-09 (1987), the question was whether an employee's orientation session with her new supervisor was a formal discussion. The two spoke for about 20 minutes concerning office rules, office hours, leave, proper attire, security, housekeeping, smoking, paycheck distribution, and timing of breaks. At the end of the discussion, the supervisor gave the employee a tour of the office and introduced her to the other employees. The union was not given an opportunity to be represented at that meeting. There was no ULP:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We consistently have held that in determining whether a union's right to representation attaches under section 7114(a)(2)(A), all the elements of that section must be present: (1) there must be a discussion; (2) which is formal; (3) between one or more representatives of the agency and one or more unit employees or their representatives; (4) concerning any grievance or personnel policy or practices or other general condition of employment....&#8197;Additionally, in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correctional Institution (Ray Brook, New York)</span>, 29 FLRA No. 52 (1987), we stated that in applying that analytical framework, we will also be guided by the intent and purpose of section 7114(a)(2)(A)--to provide the union with an opportunity to safeguard its interests and the interests of bargaining unit employees--viewed in the context of the union's full range of responsibilities under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The sole question presented here is whether the...meeting was "formal."...&#8197;[T]he meeting was not a formal discussion...[T]he meeting was held between a new employee and her supervisor with no other management representatives in attendance. The meeting took place at the supervisor's desk, lasted about 20 minutes and was followed by a tour of the office and introductions to the other employees. There was no advance notice of the meeting, no notes were taken and no preparation was made for the meeting. Finally, the document given to the employee [containing office rules and regulations] was customarily given to new employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the...meeting here is unlike the situations presented in the two cases relied upon by the General Counsel. In <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, the Authority adopted the Judge's finding that an orientation session with about six new employees was a formal discussion. In finding that the session satisfied the indicia of formality, the Judge noted that: (1) the orientation took place in a conference room; (2) it was conducted by a second-level supervisor with other management officials present; (3) it lasted 1-1/2 hours; (4) it was prearranged and not spontaneous; (5) attendance appeared to be mandatory; (6) attendance at the meeting was noted; (7) there was a definite plan of items to be discussed; and (8) the employees were given an orientation package that had been prepared in advance. In <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Region IV</span>, the sessions were held at a regularly scheduled time each month; generally included 15-18 employees; were conducted by the agency's personnel specialists; followed an established agenda and covered a wide range of personnel and employment matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the meeting took place in connection with the employee's introduction to her supervisor. The supervisor testified that he was unaware that he would be meeting with the employee until she was escorted to his desk by the Assistant District Manager...&#8197;Much of the discussion that followed pertained to personnel matters that were either discussed previously at the orientation session held at the Hackensack office or involved the employee's particular concerns. Thus, there were elements of spontaneity, one-on-one discussion, unstructured informality, and employee-initiated aspects of the meeting which were not present in the cases cited by the General Counsel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have recognized that not all discussions between representatives of agency management and unit employees are formal discussions....&#8197;We do not view the type of exchange that occurred on September 9 as being a formal discussion. Rather, it was an informal meeting between a new employee and her supervisor. Accordingly, the Union was not entitled to be represented at the meeting....</p>
<p class="noindent">Following up on President Biden’s Executive Order 14025, “Worker Organizing and Empowerment” (April 26, 2021), <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-04-29/pdf/2021-09213.pdf"></a>, OPM issued a memo for federal agencies on October 20, 2021, concerning union involvement in orientation of new employees. <a href="https://chcoc.gov/content/highlighting-bargaining-unit-employee-rights-hiring-and-boarding-process"></a> The memo states, in part:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of the policies of EO 14025, agencies are strongly encouraged to implement the following actions at the earliest opportunity:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;Include in all job opportunity announcements (JOAs) whether the position is included in a bargaining unit or not (if not already doing so);</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;Include in all JOAs for bargaining unit positions, the name and local or chapter number of the union which represents the bargaining unit position (if not already doing so);</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;Engage all local unions representing bargaining unit employees <span id="page_1457"></span>in your agency and provide the union(s) an opportunity to be part of any new employee orientation process (if not already doing so). This may require agencies to engage in collective bargaining to establish how the union(s) may be part of this process; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;Provide new bargaining unit employees information regarding their rights under the FSLMRS. We have included a recommended template which agencies could use for this purpose during new employee orientation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Accompany the memo were FAQs, including:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2)&#x2003;Doesn’t the law require agencies to remain neutral regarding union organizing?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Yes. Agencies and their managers and supervisors should remain neutral, but this does not mean agencies are prohibited from providing certain information to employees or removing certain obstacles that might inhibit a union’s ability to exercise its rights under the law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2) provides that it shall be an unfair labor practice for an agency “to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization by discrimination in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment.” However, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(e) provides that “the expression of any personal view, argument, opinion or the making of any statement which--(1) publicizes the fact of a representational election and encourages employees to exercise their right to vote in such election, (2) corrects the record with respect to any false or misleading statement by any person, or (3) informs employees of the Government’s policy relating to labor-management relations and representation, shall not, if the expression contains no threat or reprisal or force or promise of benefit or was not made under coercive conditions, (A) constitute an unfair labor practice under any provision of this chapter, or (B) constitute grounds for the setting aside of any election conducted under any provisions of this chapter.”</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With the issuance of this guidance, OPM is simply encouraging agencies to inform employees of the Government’s policy relating to labor-management relations and representation and informing employees of their rights under the law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5)&#x2003;Why does OPM encourage agencies to list the name and local or chapter number of the union which represents the bargaining unit position listed in the JOA?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">OPM believes that job applicants should have as much information as possible about any position which they are considering. By providing the name of the union and local or chapter number of the union that represents the position listed in the JOA, the applicant is provided more information related to the position and an opportunity to learn more about the union which represents the position listed in the JOA. While some JOAs do state the name of the union which represents the position, not all JOAs provide this information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">6)&#x2003;Aren’t new employee orientation sessions considered formal discussions, requiring agencies to allow exclusive representative to attend?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Yes, there are instances in which new employee orientation sessions constitute a formal discussion in which the union has a right to attend. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) provides that an exclusive representative has the right to be represented at “any formal discussion between one or more representatives of the agency and one or more employees in the unit or their representatives concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practices or other general condition of employment....”</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found that new employee orientation sessions are formal discussions within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) when attendance is mandatory; sessions are conducted by representatives of the agency (e.g., personnelists), and the discussion is about subject matters pertaining to personnel policies, practices, or other conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See Department of Health and Human Services and National Treasury Employee Union</span>, 5 FLRA 458 (1981); <span class="Italic">Also see Social Security Administration and American Federation of Government Employees</span>, 16 FLRA 232 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">7)&#x2003;While we have heard that some agencies have allowed local unions to talk to new employees in employee orientation as part of the on-boarding process, we have never done this before in our agency. Doesn’t the law provide restrictions on when, where and what unions can say to bargaining unit employees regarding joining the union/paying union dues?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Yes, there are some limitations on what unions can do during work time and in work areas. However, Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) case law has outlined the conditions where a union representative can communicate information to bargaining unit employees about the union and when and where a union can solicit membership to the union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The solicitation of union membership is a right protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102 which guarantees employees “the right to form, join, or assist any labor organization, or to refrain from such activity...” although 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7131(b) specifically requires that such solicitation of membership “be performed during the time the employee is in a non-duty status.” Since new employee orientation sessions are held during duty hours, a union cannot solicit bargaining unit employees to become dues paying union members at such meetings. In one decision, the Authority found that the requirement to be in a non-duty status applies both to the employees being solicited and employees soliciting. <span class="Italic">See Social Security Administration and American Federation of Government Employees</span>, 13 FLRA 409 (1983). This does not, however, prevent a union from communicating to bargaining unit employees information about their rights to be represented by a union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, a union cannot distribute information during new employee orientation about benefits available only to dues paying members. In one case, the Authority found that distribution of a brochure on official time that provides benefits available only to dues paying members was solicitation of union membership and clearly in violation of section 7131(b). <span class="Italic">See National Treasury Employees Union and Department of Energy</span>, 19 FLRA 224 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the union can, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, advise bargaining unit employees that the union is the exclusive representative; describe the bargaining unit it represents; and provide contact information on where Union representatives can be reached as this is deemed representational activity and protected under 5 USC 7131(d). In one case, the Authority reviewed a union proposal which would allow the union to disseminate information about the union. The proposal was found to be within the duty to bargain. By providing the information about the union, it aided in implementing the labor-management relationship and was not an overt plea for union membership. “By advising employees of the Union’s status as the exclusive representative, distributing the Chapter announcement cards aids in implementing the labor-management relationship and is not solely related to the institutional structure of the Union.” <span class="Italic">See National Treasury Employees Union and Internal Revenue Service</span>, 6 FLRA 508 (1981).</p>
<p class="noindent">Another October 20, 2021 OPM Memo to agency heads provided further guidance on information to employees about unions, <a href="https://chcoc.gov/content/guidance-implementation-eo-14025-highlighting-bargaining-unit-employee-rights-join-union-and">https://chcoc.gov/content/guidance-implementation-eo-14025-highlighting-bargaining-unit-employee-rights-join-union-and</a>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">OPM periodically receives inquiries from federal employees who are unaware they are represented by a labor union or seeking assistance in contacting a union representative in their agency. Therefore, OPM believes that actions can be taken to ensure federal employees are aware of their bargaining unit status, the rights afforded to them under the FSLMRS, and how employees can engage with their union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of the policies of EO 14025, agencies are strongly encouraged to implement the following actions at the earliest opportunity:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;Provide notice to bargaining unit employees of their rights under the FSLMRS on a quarterly or biannual basis. This can occur in addition to or in conjunction with the Weingarten Rights notice as required by 5 U.S.C. Chapter 71, Section 7114(a)(2)(B). Refer to your agency collective bargaining agreement regarding Weingarten rights and other employee rights under the FSLMRS.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;Any notification to bargaining unit employees regarding their rights under the FSLMRS should highlight their rights to join a union and the contact information of their union representative. We have included a recommended template which agencies could use for this purpose. This template is similar to the template OPM recommends agencies provide to new hires during the on-boarding process.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the FAQ section of its April 12, 2022, <span class="Italic">Guidance on Implementation of EO 14025: Highlighting Union Rights to Access and Communicate with Bargaining Unit Employees</span>, OPM explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">8)&#x2003;Aren't new employee orientation sessions considered formal discussions, requiring agencies to allow an exclusive representative to attend?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Yes, there are instances in which new employee orientation sessions constitute a formal discussion in which the union has a right to attend. 5 U.S. Code &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) provides that an exclusive representative has the right to be represented at "any formal discussion between one or more representatives of the agency and one or more employees in the unit or their representatives concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practices or other general condition of employment."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Authority has found that new employee orientation sessions are formal discussions within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) when attendance is mandatory; sessions are conducted by representatives of the agency (e.g., personnelists), and discuss subject matters pertaining to personnel policies, practices, or other conditions of employment to conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Department of Health and Human Services and National Treasury <span id="page_1458"></span>Employee Union</span>, 5 FLRA 458 (1981); <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration and American Federation of Government Employees</span>, 16 FLRA 232 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">9)&#x2003;We have heard that some agencies have agreed for local unions to talk to new employees in employee orientation as part of the on-boarding process. Doesn't the law provide restrictions on when, where, and what unions can say to bargaining unit employees regarding joining the union/paying union dues?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Yes, there are some limitations on what unions can do during work time and in work areas. However, Authority case law has outlined the conditions where a union representative can communicate information to bargaining unit employees about the union and when and where a union can solicit membership to the union.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The solicitation of union membership is a right protected under 5 U.S. Code &#x00A7; 7102 which guarantees employees "the right to form, join, or assist any labor organization, or to refrain from such activity...." However, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7131(b) specifically requires that such solicitation of membership "be performed during the time the employee is in a non-duty status."

<p class="noindent-1">10)&#x2003;Why should we include unions in periodic employee town halls?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Providing union representatives an opportunity to be part of an employee town hall event can provide the union an opportunity to remind bargaining unit employees about their rights as bargaining unit employees and provide information on contacting the union. This supports the policies of EO 14025. However, since employee town halls are held during duty hours, a union cannot solicit bargaining unit employees to become dues paying members during this time.</p>
