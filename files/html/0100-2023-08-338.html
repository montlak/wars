<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dean v. Dept. of Agric.</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/WEED_ALVERN_C_DE_3330_08_0490_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_434353.pdf">99 MSPR 533</a>, 536-52 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1-45 (2005), commented on the purpose of veterans preference in the federal appointment process, resolved a conflict between VEOA rights and appointment authority under an Outstanding Scholar Program, and explained the need to prove a causal relation between a VEOA violation and nonappointment before the Board will order a back pay remedy:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency petitions for review of an initial decision that granted the appellant's request for redress under the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA), Pub. L. No. 105-339, 1998 U.S.C.C.A.N. (112 Stat.) 3182, codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a, and ordered the agency to retroactively appoint the appellant to the position in question and to pay him back pay and liquidated damages.... We find that, although the agency violated the appellant's rights under a statute relating to <span id="Page_593"></span>veterans' preference, the appropriate remedy is the issuance of a Board order requiring the agency to comply with the statute it violated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is a veteran with a 30% service-connected disability who applied for the position of Personnel Management Specialist, GS-201-07, with the agency's Natural Resources Conservation Service in Columbia, South Carolina. A vacancy announcement (Number AR122434) indicated that the position was career/career conditional, that applications would be accepted from all U.S. citizens, and that the "basis for rating" would be "the extent and quality of experience and training relevant to the duties of the position, based on information contained in their applications and their responses to the occupational questions." The announcement indicated that qualified candidates would be assigned a score between 70 and 100 and that points for veterans' preference would be added if supported by documentation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency notified the appellant that he was qualified for the position and that his name would be referred for consideration. Although he subsequently was ranked second on a list of eligibles with a rating of 105.0, the agency, under the authority of the Outstanding Scholar Program, selected an individual with no veterans' preference. The selectee's Standard Form 50-B, "Notification of Personnel Action," identified the position as being in the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the appellant filed a complaint with the Department of Labor (DOL) claiming that his veterans' preference rights had been violated, and after DOL notified him that his claim did not have merit, he filed this appeal. He asserted that the agency "willfully and deliberately violated statute and regulation by selecting a so-called Outstanding Scholar" who was not a veteran. The appellant claimed that the agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318 by passing him over in favor of a non-veteran without seeking and obtaining the approval of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The appellant asserted that the agency's "'practice of issuing multiple certificates' corresponding to different recruitment categories, regardless of whether preference eligible[s] have been exhausted, and then selecting from the certificate that the non-veteran had been placed on nullified the Appellant['] s veterans' preference." The agency responded that it followed its own policies and guidelines, as well as OPM regulations and directives, in the selection process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that the appeal was timely filed and within the Board's jurisdiction. Based on the written submissions of the parties, because the appeal did not present disputes of material fact, the AJ found that the agency violated the appellant's veterans' preference rights by selecting a non-veteran under the Outstanding Scholar Program for the position without notifying the appellant and OPM that it proposed to pass him over. The AJ found that the agency's use of an Outstanding Scholar certificate, rather than a certificate for which veterans' preference is afforded, nullified the appellant's veterans' preference. The AJ found that the only authority that appeared to support the agency's argument and OPM's guidance was the consent decree in <span class="Italic">Luevano v. Campbell</span>, 93 F.R.D. 68 (D.D.C. 1981), but he was not satisfied that a consent decree--an agreement between an executive agency and private parties approved by a district court judge--was sufficient authority for an agency to choose not to use competitive examining, "frustrating the intent of Congress to afford a veterans' preference, especially when a qualified veteran with statutory preference in such an examination applies for an announced vacancy."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the remedy, the AJ found that an order to comply with the statute or regulation under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a) should include an order for retroactive appointment in this case since otherwise the Board's order would provide no relief to the appellant because the selection process in question is now over. The AJ also found that an order that did not include retroactive appointment would "amount to an injunction against future wrongdoing with respect to persons who are not a party to this proceeding," and such an order would exceed the Board's jurisdiction unless those individuals first exhausted their DOL remedy pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1). The AJ concluded that the likely intent of the statute was not to provide prospective relief to others, but to provide make-whole relief to the appellant, and that the appellant established clear entitlement to the position for which the agency selected a non-veteran. Upon finding that the agency's violation was willful, the AJ ordered the agency to appoint the appellant retroactively to the GS-7 Personnel Management Specialist position in Columbia, South Carolina, to compensate him for any loss of wages or benefits, and to pay him an additional amount, equal to back pay, as liquidated damages under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(b). The AJ did not order interim relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question before us is whether the agency violated the appellant's veterans' preference rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3302, 3304(b) when it used the Outstanding Scholar Program, the product of a consent decree in a Title VII lawsuit,[1] to select a nonpreference eligible who had not taken an examination for the position in question, rather than the appellant, a veteran, who was found qualified for the position under a competitive examination process. In its starkest terms, this case presents a conflict between two significant employment policies: the policy of creating special preference and protection to aid in the readjustment and rehabilitation of returning veterans and the policy of preventing and remedying discrimination in the work place. However, Title VII, which addresses discrimination in employment, resolves the conflict in favor of veterans' rights by providing that: "[N]othing contained in this title shall be construed to repeal or modify any...law creating special rights or preference for veterans." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-11. Further, the consent decree which gave rise to the Outstanding Scholar Program, grew out of the policies of Title VII and expressly provided that any adverse impact resulting from the requirements of the Veterans' Preference Act[2] may constitute a defense to the determination of adverse impact with respect to any competitive procedures. We find, therefore, that the Outstanding Scholar Program cannot be relied upon to avoid the competitive examination process when veterans' rights are at issue, absent specific legislation or Executive Order.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Today's civil service laws trace their origin to the Pendleton Civil Service Act of 1883, 22 Stat. 403, which "provided for the creation of a classified civil service and required competitive examination for entry into that service." <span class="Italic">Arnett v. Kennedy</span>, 416 U.S. 134, 149 (1974). As the Supreme Court observed, the Act was "designed to eliminate the abuses associated with the patronage system from much of the federal service," <span class="Italic">Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong</span>, 426 U.S. 88, 106 (1976) (footnote omitted), and instituted a "system of merit appointment, based on competitive examination,...replacing a patronage system in which appointment had often been treated as a method of rewarding support at the polls," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 107. The Senate Report on the bill made this purpose clear:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The single, simple, fundamental, pivotal idea of the whole bill is, that whenever, hereafter, a new appointment or a promotion shall be made in the subordinate civil service in the departments or larger offices, such appointment or promotion shall be given to the man who is best fitted to discharge the duties of the position, and that<span class="Italic"> such fitness shall be ascertained by open, fair, honest, impartial competitive examination</span>. The impartiality of those examinations is to be secured by every possible safeguard. They are to be open to all who choose to present themselves. There will be tests of fitness of the applicant for the particular place to which he aspires.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 576, 47th Cong., 1st Sess. at 13-14 (1882) (emphasis supplied).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress retained the principle of appointment by merit throughout its various amendments and compilations of civil service law. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(a)(1), the President may prescribe rules which shall provide, "as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant," for "open, competitive examinations for testing applicants for appointment in the competitive service which are practical in character and as far as possible relate to matters that fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the applicants for the appointment sought." Similarly, in enacting a set of merit system principles to govern federal personnel management, Congress reiterated that "selection and advancement should be determined solely on the basis of relative ability, knowledge, and skills, after fair and open competition which assures that all receive equal opportunity." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(1). Thus, Congress provided that "[a]n individual may be appointed in the competitive service only if he has passed an examination or is specifically excepted from examination under section 3302 of this title." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 3302 of Title 5 of the United States Code, in turn, provides that the President "may prescribe rules governing the competitive service" and that those rules "shall provide, as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant, for--(1) necessary exceptions of positions from the competitive service; and (2) necessary exceptions from the provisions of section[ ] ...3304(a)..." Thus, Congress intended that competitive examinations would be the norm for appointments in the competitive service and that exceptions from the norm, in the form of rules prescribed by the President, are permitted when "necessary" for "conditions of good administration." <span class="Italic">See National Treasury Employees Union v. Horner</span>, 854 F.2d 490, 499 (D.C.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, Pub. L. No. 359, ch. 287, 58 Stat. 390, as amended, was enacted to aid in the readjustment and rehabilitation of veterans. <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Cohen</span>, 333 U.S. 411, 418 (1948). Congress believed that the problems of returning veterans were particularly acute and merited special consideration because their normal employment and mode of life had been seriously disrupted by their service in the armed forces and they could not be expected to resume their regular activities without reemployment and rehabilitation aids. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Federal Government, in its capacity as an employer, took the lead in such a program, and the Veterans' Preference Act was adopted, creating special preference and protection for returning veterans at every stage of federal employment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 418-19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Veterans' preference in hiring for competitive-service positions takes two basic forms. First, by statute, agencies are permitted to appoint certain veterans noncompetitively. For example, veterans with compensable service-connected disabilities of 30% or more may receive "noncompetitive appointment[s] leading to conversion to career or career-conditional employment." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3112. In addition, veterans of certain conflicts are eligible for noncompetitive "excepted" appointments at or below particular grades to positions otherwise in the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 307.101(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second form that veterans' preference takes in hiring comes into play in the competitive examining process. An integral part of the examining process is the assignment of numerical scores, followed by the rating and ranking of candidates according to those scores. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 337.101(a) (OPM, or an agency operating under a delegation of authority from OPM pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1104(a)(2), "shall assign numerical ratings" to candidates). Under the Veterans' Preference Act, specific statutory provisions apply to the rating and ranking of preference eligible individuals. Preference eligibles have points added to their passing scores on examinations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 337.101(b). Preference-eligible veterans are entitled to five additional points, and disabled veterans,[3] as well as selected survivors, dependents, and parents of certain veterans and military service members, are entitled to ten additional points. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 337.101(b). Once the scores of the candidates for a position have been modified to include any additional points, the names of applicants who have qualified for appointment to the competitive service are entered onto "registers or lists of eligibles," in rank order, with preference eligibles ranked ahead of others with the same rating. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3313; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.401. For positions other than scientific and professional positions in grades GS-9 or higher, disabled veterans who have a compensable service-connected disability of 10 percent or more are entered onto registers in order of their ratings ahead of all remaining applicants. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3313(2)(A); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.401. An examining authority certifies "enough names from the top of the appropriate register" to permit the appointing authority "to consider at least three names for appointment to each vacancy in the competitive service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3317(a). The appointing authority "shall select for appointment to each vacancy from the highest three eligibles available for appointment on the certificate furnished under section 3317(a)." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(a). If an appointing authority "proposes to pass over a preference eligible on a certificate in order to select an individual who is not a preference eligible, such authority shall file written reasons with [OPM] for passing over the preference eligible" and obtain OPM's approval. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1). For a preference-eligible veteran with a 30% or more disability, the veteran is entitled to notice of the proposed passover and an opportunity to respond to OPM. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;A disabled veteran is defined as an individual who was honorably separated from the armed forces and who has a service-connected disability or is receiving compensation, disability retirement benefits, or a pension administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs or a military department. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(2). The statute defines all disabled veterans as preference eligible. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3)(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To determine whether the agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(b) when it appointed, in the competitive service, an individual from the Outstanding Scholar list who had not passed an examination and who was not "specifically excepted from examination under section 3302" of title 5, we must first determine if section 3304(b) is a statute "relating to veterans' preference," as required by VEOA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c (the Board may order a remedy under VEOA only if it determines that an agency has violated a right described in section 3330a, i.e., an individual's right "under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference"). As set forth below, we find that it is.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Absent a distinct definition in a statute or regulation, the words in a statute are assumed to carry their "ordinary, contemporary, common meaning." <span class="Italic">Perrin v. United States</span>, 444 U.S. 37, 42 (1979); <span class="Italic">Union Pacific R.R. Co. v. Hall</span>, 91 U.S. 343, 347 (1875) ("Congress may well be supposed to have used language in accordance with the common understanding."); <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh v. Department of Justice</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 490 &#x00B6; 13 (2002), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 336 F.3d 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2003). The Supreme Court has held, in analyzing the Airline Deregulation Act, that the ordinary meaning of the words "relating to" is a broad one. <span class="Italic">Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.</span>, 504 U.S. 374, 383-84 (1992). The Court held that the phrase means "to stand in some relation; to have bearing or concern; to pertain; to refer; to bring into association with or connection with." The Court noted that, in a case involving an interpretation of the same phrase under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), it had held that a state law "relates to" an employee benefit plan, and is pre-empted by ERISA, "if it has a connection with, or reference to, such a plan." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 384. Thus, the Court held in <span class="Italic">Morales</span> that, "[s]ince the relevant language of the ADA [Airline Deregulation Act] is identical, we think it appropriate to adopt the same standard here: State enforcement actions having a connection with or reference to airline 'rates, route, or services' are pre-empted." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">VEOA does not define the phrase "relating to," nor does any applicable regulation. Thus, the ordinary meaning, as defined by the Supreme Court, should be applied. We find that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(b) "stand[s] in some relation to," has a bearing on, concerns, and "has a connection with" veterans' preference rights. By establishing the principle that examinations are the norm and that individuals may not be appointed in the competitive service unless they have passed an examination or are specifically excepted from examination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302, section 3304(b) ensures that the veterans' preference provisions that are a part of the examination process, such as 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309 (a preference eligible who receives a passing grade in an examination for entrance into the competitive service is entitled to additional points above his earned rating), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3313 (the names of preference eligibles who have qualified in examinations for the competitive service shall be entered on appropriate registers or lists of eligibles ahead of others having the same rating) and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b) (appointing authorities proposing to pass over a preference eligible on a certificate in order to select an individual who is not a preference eligible shall file written reasons with OPM for passing over the preference eligible), will generally be applied to the appointment process for positions in the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without an overarching statute "relating to veterans' preference" and enforceable under VEOA, and which provides that appointments may be made in the competitive service only if an individual has passed an examination or is specifically excepted from examination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302, the enforcement of such fundamental veterans' preference provisions as 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309, 3313, and 3318, would occur only when an agency actually held an examination. We believe that such a result would not only be inconsistent with the applicable statutory language, but would be inconsistent with the Congressional intent that VEOA address "a variety of strategies recently used by agencies that threaten veterans' preference, whether that is their intended effect or not." H.R. Rep. No. 105-40 (1997). Indeed, Congress expressed concern about testimony provided during the congressional hearings that veterans' preference in the federal workplace "is often ignored or circumvented and that its continued viability is threatened on several fronts." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Senate similarly believed that "it is vital that the Federal Government open to veterans as many employment opportunities as possible." <span class="Italic">Young v. Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 99 &#x00B6; 6 (2002) (quoting S. Rep. No. 105-340, at 15, 17 (1998)), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 66 Fed. Appx. 858 (Fed. Cir. 2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By ensuring that statutes such as 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309, 3313, and 3318 are applied by agencies unless there exists an exception to examination that meets the criteria of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302, section 3304(b) is intrinsically connected to those statutes in a way that prevents veterans' preference rights in the federal workplace from being ignored or circumvented. This interpretation of the "relating to" language in section 3330a, which supports a finding that section 3304(b) is a statute "relating to" veterans' preference rights, is also consistent with the fact that VEOA is a remedial statute and the general principle that remedial statutes should be construed to suppress the evil and advance the remedy. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. Department of the Navy</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 669 &#x00B6; 7, <span class="Italic">vacated on other grounds,</span> 55 Fed. Appx. 538 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">Pastor v.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant has proven a violation of his rights under Section 3304(b)</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having determined that section 3304(b) is a statute "relating to" veterans' preference rights, we must next ascertain whether the agency violated section 3304(b) in the selection here at issue. Section 3304(b) provides that "[a]n individual may be appointed in the competitive service only if he has passed an examination or is specifically excepted from examination under section 3302 of this title."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">a</span>. <span class="Italic">The noncompetitive appointment in this case of an individual to a position in the competitive service did not comport with sections 3304(b) and 3302.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, there is no indication that the individual selected by the agency and appointed in the competitive service took or passed an approved <span id="Page_595"></span>examination. In fact, the agency explained that "[a]n application was received from an applicant with eligibility for Personnel Management Specialist, GS-201-7, with eligibility as an Outstanding Scholar," and the agency "decided to appoint this individual at the GS-7 grade level as a Career Conditional Appointment with a Legal Authority of 'Direct Hire OPM Authority, ACWA Outstanding Scholar Program.'" The agency asserted that, because the appellant and other preference eligibles provided no evidence of qualification as an Outstanding Scholar, "no numerical ranking was completed."... In a February 21, 2002 "Memorandum for the Record," Dory Stevenson, Human Resources Manager, wrote: "I decided to pursue the Outstanding Scholar route to hire another person," and "we can do this with direct hire since the provision to clear the CTAP/ICTAP eligibles was met when the original announcements were made." These actions by the agency appear to be consistent with OPM's "background information" on the Outstanding Scholar Program, which provides that rating and ranking are not required and suggests that applicants need not receive a passing score in an examination....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, the noncompetitive appointment, i.e., without examination, of an individual to the position in the competitive service at issue in this case does not comport with sections 3304(b) and 3302, unless the individual the agency appointed was "specifically excepted from examination under section 3302" of title 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">b</span>. <span class="Italic">The Luevano consent decree did not purport to create an exception that supersedes veterans' preference rights under the competitive process.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding our earlier finding that the Outstanding Scholar Program, in and of itself, cannot be relied upon to avoid the competitive examination procedures when veterans' rights are at issue, as explained below, the <span class="Italic">Luevano</span> consent decree was not intended to create an exception that supersedes veterans' preference rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1981, the federal district court of the District of Columbia approved a consent decree (hereinafter "Luevano decree" or "decree") resolving a class employment discrimination action. The action was brought by "a nationwide class of blacks and Hispanics" against OPM and "all Federal departments, agencies, and corporations subject to section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, which have used, are using, or may use the PACE." <span class="Italic">Luevano Consent Decree</span>, 1981 WL 402614 (1981). The plaintiffs alleged that the Professional and Administrative Career Examination (PACE), which was used "to identify qualified individuals for employment into entry level jobs in over 100 professional and administrative occupations in the Federal service, was culturally biased and "discriminate[d] against class members in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Luevano v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Luevano</span> decree provided that OPM must eliminate the PACE within three years and develop in its place alternative examinations for particular job categories or groups of job categories. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 78. The decree established "special programs," including the Outstanding Scholar Program, under which applicants were excepted from the competitive examination process, and required their use "to eliminate any adverse impact against class members" based on any continued "use of the PACE register" during the three-year period. <span class="Italic">Luevano,</span> 93 F.R.D. at 79. "It [was] the intent of the parties that these special programs are supplemental to the interim use of the PACE and alternative examining procedures to assure equal employment opportunity in the Federal service" and was "not the intent of the parties that use of these special programs shall replace the interim use of the PACE or the use of alternative examining procedures...." <span class="Italic">Decree,</span> 1981 WL 402614 &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The decree also provided that "[a]ny adverse impact which results from the requirements of the Veterans' Preference Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318, will be taken into account and may constitute a defense to the determination of adverse impact with respect to any competitive procedures." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at &#x00B6; 9. This language suggests that the special programs established by the decree were not intended to override veterans' preference rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court decision approving the decree did not find that the civil rights laws alleged to have been violated by the PACE examination superseded veterans' preference laws. To have done so would have been contrary to the provision in Title VII stating that "[N]othing contained in this subchapter [which prohibits discrimination in employment] shall be construed to repeal or modify any Federal, State, territorial, or local law creating special rights or preference for veterans." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-11. And the court expressly found that the purpose of the decree <span class="Italic">accorded</span> with the underlying policies of Title VII:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">36.&#x2003; The parties have agreed, and the Court finds, that the purpose of the Decree is to provide, in accord with the underlying policies of Title VII and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, for the elimination of the PACE, and for the development of alternative examining procedures which will eliminate adverse impact against blacks and Hispanics as much as feasible, and which will validly and fairly test the relative capacity of applicants to perform PACE occupations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Luevano,</span> 93 F.R.D. at 80.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the court originally envisioned retaining jurisdiction for only five years, subject to renewal, the parties have not argued or shown that the court's jurisdiction has terminated. It thus appears that OPM and other federal agencies continue to be bound by the decree.[4] This does not mean, however, that they are bound to use the decree's special programs, such as the Outstanding Scholar Program, to supersede veterans' preference rights. To the contrary, such a use would be inconsistent with the express provisions of Title VII and the acknowledgement of veterans' preference rights in the decree itself.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In explaining why it interpreted the original version of VEOA as requiring a new excepted appointing authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304, OPM stated that "absent specific legislation or Executive order, OPM has no authority to permit the noncompetitive appointment of candidates in the competitive service." 65 Fed. Reg. 14,431 (2000). Here, the agency has not identified "specific legislation or [an] Executive order" permitting the noncompetitive appointment of candidates in the competitive service under the Outstanding Scholar Program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming that the President delegated such authority to OPM, OPM has not promulgated a "rule," as section 3302 requires, establishing the Outstanding Scholar Program as a specific exception to the examination process with regard to veterans' preference rights. Congress required OPM to adhere to the notice and comment procedures of the Administrative Procedures Act when promulgating any rule. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1103(b) (the Director of OPM "shall publish in the Federal Register general notice of any rule or regulation which is proposed by the Office and the application of which does not apply solely to the Office or its employees"); <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Horner</span>, 854 F.2d 490, 496 (D.C. Cir. 1988). No rule establishing the Outstanding Scholar Program as an exception under section 3302 has been subject to such notice and comment procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.101, "[a]n appointing officer may fill a position in the competitive service by any of the methods authorized in this chapter." The current version of Chapter I, Title 5 C.F.R., contains two references to the Outstanding Scholar Program. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.205(g) (an agency must clear its reemployment priority list before making appointments under a direct-hire authority, "which includes the Outstanding Scholar provision"); 330.705(b)(2) (setting forth actions subject to an order of selection in filling vacancies from outside the <span id="Page_596"></span>agency's workforce, which includes noncompetitive appointments to the competitive service, "(e.g., the types listed in part 315, subpart F of this chapter, as well as Outstanding Scholar and Bilingual/Bicultural appointments <span class="Italic">made under the authority of the Luevano consent decree</span>)") (emphasis added). Although these regulations describe actions agencies must take when making appointments under the Outstanding Scholar Program, they do not "authorize" appointments under that program; rather, section 330.705(b)(2) refers to the <span class="Italic">Luevano</span> consent decree as authorizing the appointment. In any event, there is no indication that these regulations are based on specific legislation or an Executive order authorizing OPM to permit the noncompetitive appointment of candidates in the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is also no indication that OPM's Delegated Examining Operations Handbook is based on such legislation or Executive order. As its title suggests, that document is a "handbook" that provides guidance for agencies that have been delegated examining authority by OPM. The 2003 Handbook "provides agencies with guidance, options, and, where necessary, specific operational procedures that are designed to ensure that examining programs comply with merit system laws and regulations." Handbook, Introduction at i. The Handbook also provides that it is to be used in conjunction with specific authorities in agency delegation agreements, applicable laws in Title 5, United States Code, and regulations published in the Code of Federal Regulations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, the Handbook is subject to, and may not override, such statutes as 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, as previously noted, in granting the President the authority to create exceptions from open, competitive examinations in making appointments in the competitive service under section 3302, Congress required that the exceptions be necessary and warranted by considerations of good administration. <span class="Italic">Horner</span>, 854 F.2d at 499 ("Congress expressly provided that OPM should consider 'conditions of good administration' in deciding whether exceptions from the competitive service are 'necessary.'...");<span class="Italic"> National Treasury Employees Union v. Horner</span>, 654 F. Supp. 1159, 1162, 1165 (D.D.C. 1987) (while Congress has given the Executive branch the authority to except certain positions from the requirement that selections of Federal personnel be based on relative ability, knowledge, and skills, after fair and open competition, including competitive examinations for testing applicants for appointment, Congress has directed that such exceptions be made when necessary and warranted by considerations of good administration). Even assuming that the other requirements of section 3302, discussed above, have been met, there has been no showing that an exception to the examination process, in the form of the Outstanding Scholar Program, was determined by the President or OPM to be necessary and warranted by considerations of good administration. The <span class="Italic">Luevano</span> decision did not find that the civil rights laws alleged to have been violated by the PACE examination superseded veterans' preference laws, and, as noted earlier, it does not appear that the court would have been correct had it so found. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that the above analysis could affect federal employee hiring for positions in the competitive service that are covered by the <span class="Italic">Luevano</span> consent decree. Congress, however, has charged the Board with adjudicating appeals under VEOA and ordering a remedy when there has been a violation of an individual's rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. The Board's role as an adjudicatory agency under VEOA is not to set policy regarding preferred methods of federal employee hiring involving veterans' rights. Indeed, that policy has already been set forth in title VII, which resolves the conflict between veterans' rights and discrimination law in favor of veterans' rights. Nor is it the Board's role to determine when necessary exceptions from competitive examinations are warranted by "conditions of good administration." That responsibility lies with the President, Congress, and OPM. If the President, Congress, or OPM determines that the Outstanding Scholar Program is a necessary exception to competitive examination, which overrides veterans' rights, they may compel a different result by enacting a statute, issuing an Executive order, or promulgating a regulation to that effect. <span class="Italic">See Reid v. Department of Commerce</span>, 793 F.2d 277, 284 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ("'The remedy for any dissatisfaction with the results in particular cases lies with Congress and not this court. Congress may amend the statute; we may not.'") (quoting <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc.</span>, 458 U.S. 564, 576 (1982)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the agency violated the appellant's rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(b), a statute relating to veterans' preference, when it appointed to the Personnel Management Specialist position an individual who had not passed an examination and who had not been specifically excepted from examination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appropriate remedy in this case is not retroactive appointment; rather, the agency must comply with the applicable law.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts that the AJ erred in determining that the proper remedy in this case is retroactive appointment, an award of back pay, and an award of damages equivalent to the back pay award. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">VEOA provides that, if the Board determines that an agency has violated a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference, it "shall order the agency to comply with such provisions." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c. VEOA further provides that, when there has been a violation, the Board is to "award compensation for any loss of wages or benefits" and, when the Board determines that the violation was willful, an amount equal to back pay is to be awarded as liquidated damages. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board's regulations reiterate these statutory provisions. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.25 ("If the Board determines that a Federal agency has violated the appellant's VEOA rights, the decision of the Board....will order the agency to comply with the statute or regulation violated...."). As set forth above, the agency violated the appellant's rights under a statute relating to veterans' preference. Therefore, reading the provisions of section 3330c as a whole, we find that the agency, in reconstructing the hiring for the Personnel Management Specialist position in Columbia, South Carolina, must comply with the requirement, set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(b), that "[a]n individual may be appointed in the competitive service only if he has passed an examination or is specifically excepted from examination under section 3302 of this title."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are aware of no provisions within VEOA stating that an individual whose rights have been violated is automatically entitled to the position sought. Rather, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c reflects that such an individual is entitled to a selection process consistent with law. This reading of the statute comports with the holding of our reviewing court that the Board is not authorized to supplant remedies Congress expressly provided or to create new remedies which it believes Congress overlooked. <span class="Italic">See King v. Jerome</span>, 42 F.3d 1371, 1375-76 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Moreover, this approach is consistent with the statutory provision regarding the award of compensation for "any" loss of wages or benefits suffered by reason of a violation of a veterans' preference right. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c. An individual can suffer such losses only if he would have been hired by the agency in the absence of a violation of his rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also disagree with the view that a failure to order a retroactive appointment in this case would result in no relief for the appellant and would merely amount to an injunction against future wrongdoing. The relief for the appellant in this case, as required by statute, is an order from the Board requiring the agency to comply with the violated provisions of a statute relating to veterans' preference, and an award of compensation for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by reason of the violation. While the Board can order the agency to comply with the violated law, it is unclear whether the appellant is entitled to an award of compensation because it is unknown whether he would have been selected for the position if the proper procedures had been followed. Moreover, there is no basis for rejecting the statutorily-mandated remedy based on a concern as to how a Board order in this case may affect persons who are not parties in this proceeding. The impact, if any, of this order on non-parties is subject to any future case that may involve such an issue.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dean</span> and <span class="Italic">Olson</span> were affirmed on a reconsideration petition for review by the Director of OPM, permitting the case to proceed, at the option of OPM, to the Federal Circuit. The Board stated in <span class="Italic">Dean v. USDA &#x0026; OPM</span>, 104 MSPR 1, 5-13 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-23, 2006 MSPB 318 (2006), that veterans preference should have been applied to positions filled through the Outstanding Scholar Program:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(b) is a statute relating to veterans5 preference</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues that the Board erred in finding that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(b) is a statute "relating to veterans' preference" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a, the provision giving the Board authority to adjudicate the <span id="Page_597"></span>appellants' claims.[1] OPM objects to the Board's finding concerning section 3304(b), which generally requires appointees to the competitive service to have passed an examination, because the statute makes no express reference to veterans' preference and applies to both veteran and nonveteran appointments.[2] In support of its argument, OPM also cites <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Department of the Interior</span>, 424 F.3d 1151 (Fed. Cir. 2005), which upheld an OPM regulation prescribing how veterans' preference should be applied to attorney positions in the excepted service. According to OPM, the court's decision plainly indicates that statutes relating to veterans' preference include only the statutes "defining veterans' preference rights" enumerated by the court, a list that does not contain section 3304(b). <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1155. However, there is no indication in the opinion that these provisions, which define "preference eligible" and govern the rating and ranking of preference eligible individuals in the examination process, are the only ones that relate to veterans' preference, an issue that was not before the court. Since <span class="Italic">Patterson</span> addressed the weight to be given veterans' preference in the excepted service, the court had no occasion to address whether section 3304, which establishes the competitive service examination requirement, is a statute relating to veterans' preference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a provides in pertinent part: "(a)(1)(A) A preference eligible who alleges that an agency has violated such individual's rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor....(d)(1) If the Secretary of Labor is unable to resolve a complaint under subsection (a) within 60 days after the date on which it is filed, the complainant may elect to appeal the alleged violation to the Merit Systems Protection Board...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(b) provides in pertinent part: "An individual may be appointed in the competitive service only if he has passed an examination or is specifically excepted from examination under section 3302 of this title." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(a) requires that competitive service rules shall provide for "open, competitive examinations" that "fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the applicants for the appointment sought."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM also cites as support for its contention the fact that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(e)(1) does not include section 3304 among the statutes establishing "veterans' preference requirements" that it enumerates for purposes of a companion provision, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11), that makes personnel actions that violate such requirements "prohibited personnel practices." The list in section 2302(e)(1) is a longer one than the list of such statutes in <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>, a fact that is inconsistent with OPM's argument that the court's enumeration was an exhaustive one. More importantly, like the <span class="Italic">Patterson</span> decision, section 2302(e) does not purport to provide a definition of the broader term "relating to veterans' preference."[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;OPM is mistaken in asserting that its position is supported by <span class="Italic">Ramsey v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 98, &#x00B6; 11 (2000), a regulation review proceeding in which the Board found that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f) does not establish a veterans' preference requirement. Section 3304(f) entitles preference eligible veterans and certain other veterans to compete for vacant positions in specified circumstances when other applicants outside the government are not being considered. The provision expressly states that it does not confer any entitlement to veterans' preference not otherwise required by law. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(3). <span class="Italic">Ramsey</span> did not involve the Board's VEOA jurisdiction and did not address the scope of "relating to veterans' preference."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 3330a does not define "relating to veterans' preference," and the cases cited by OPM do not address the meaning of this phrase. In the absence of a statutory definition, the Board properly interpreted this language in terms of common usage and its ordinary meaning. <span class="Italic">See Perrin v. United States</span>, 444 U.S. 37, 42 (1979); <span class="Italic">Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 263 F.3d 1341, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2001). As the Board noted in <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, the ordinary meaning of the words "relating to" is a broad one: to concern, have a bearing on or connection to. 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 16, <span class="Italic">citing Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc</span>., 504 U.S. 374, 383-84 (1992). The Board reasonably determined that section 3304(b) has a bearing on veterans' preference rights because it establishes the principle that open, competitive examinations are the norm and that individuals may not be appointed in the competitive service unless they have passed such an examination or are specifically excepted from examination under section 3302. Without this requirement, the veterans' preference statutes which entitle preference eligible veterans who pass an examination to additional points and a higher ranking would be limited in effect. Absent section 3304(b), these basic provisions would apply only in cases where agencies choose to hold an examination for a vacant position, with the result that the entitlement they confer could be easily circumvented. Since the provisions that explicitly define veterans' preference for the competitive service cannot operate without section 3304(b), the Board correctly concluded that it is a statute relating to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">See Dean</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Alternatively, OPM states that a statute or an OPM regulation may nonetheless entirely exclude the application of Veterans' Preference Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309-3318, to a position. As a case recognizing a statutory exclusion, OPM cites <span class="Italic">Scarnati v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 344 F.3d 1246 (Fed. Cir. 2003), which upheld the Board's jurisdictional dismissal of the claim by a disappointed applicant for a physician position at the Department of Veterans Affairs that his veterans' preference rights were violated. The court agreed with the Board that the statutory exclusion of the position that he sought from the coverage of civil service laws generally precluded a claim under VEOA. This case clearly has no application here where there is no contention that the positions sought by the appellants were excluded by statute from civil service law coverage.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM also relies on the court's recognition in <span class="Italic">Patterson</span> that OPM has delegated authority from the President under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1) to except positions such as the attorney positions involved there from the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 424 F.3d at 1155 n.4. The court noted that OPM has statutory authority and responsibility to enforce veterans' preference in the excepted service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1302(c), and it upheld an OPM regulation issued under this authority that excepted the positions in question from rating and ranking procedures and provided for application of veterans' preference only to the extent that it is administratively feasible. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1157-60. According to OPM, this case illustrates a principle applicable here that it has authority to except positions from veterans' preference requirements. However, <span class="Italic">Patterson</span> involved authority under section 3302(1) to except positions from the competitive service, not authority under section 3302(2) to except appointments to the competitive service from the examination requirement (and thus from veterans' preference). The decision did not find that veterans' preference was entirely inapplicable to the excepted service positions involved, merely that the agency's failure to rate and rank the petitioner was not a violation of the Veterans' Preference Act. Moreover, the court concluded that the Board should have dismissed Mr. Patterson's appeal for failure to state a claim, rather than for lack of jurisdiction, because the Board had jurisdiction under VEOA to consider his claim that his nonselection violated his veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1160. Thus, <span class="Italic">Patterson</span> does not support OPM's argument.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this connection, we also note that when OPM placed all positions subject to the <span class="Italic">Luevano</span> consent decree in the excepted service, its action was struck down as arbitrary and capricious. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Horner</span>, 854 F.2d 490 (D.C. Cir. 1988). This decision further supports our conclusion that OPM's power to place positions in the excepted service does not authorize creation of the Outstanding Scholar Program, which is a non-competitive method of making appointments to positions in the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Outstanding Scholar Program cannot be relied upon to avoid the competitive examination process when veterans' preference rights are at issue.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues that the <span class="Italic">Luevano</span> consent decree established the Outstanding Scholar Program under Title VII as a supplementary, noncompetitive hiring authority that is not subject to veterans' preference. By agreeing to this remedial provision of the consent decree, OPM maintains that it effectively exercised its delegated authority under Executive Order 10,577 to except certain individuals from competitive examination for purposes of section 3304(b). It also relies for such an exception on its issuance of two regulations that inform agencies how to use this hiring authority. It thereby challenges the Board's findings in <span class="Italic">Dean</span> that there was no indication the President had delegated authority to OPM to establish an exception from examination for the Outstanding Scholar Program or that OPM had in fact promulgated a rule creating such an exception. 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 31-33. Further, OPM contends that the Board incorrectly held that the <span class="Italic">Luevano</span> consent decree did not intend to create an exception that supersedes veterans' preference rights. According to OPM, the Board erred because it failed to reconcile the Title VII consent decree and the Veterans' Preference Act so as to give effect to both statutes, but instead subordinated Title VII to the Act. Finally, OPM questions the Board's authority to interpret the decree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 3304(b) permits an individual's appointment to the competitive service without an examination only when the individual has been specifically excepted from examination under section 3302. Section 3302(2) authorizes the President to prescribe rules for necessary exceptions to the examination requirement. OPM maintains that authority to create such an exception was delegated to it by Executive Order 10,577 in section 101, Rule III, "Noncompetitive Acquisition of Status," &#x00A7; 3.2, "Appointments Without Competitive Examination in Rare Cases." This provision, codified at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 3.2, states in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Subject to receipt of satisfactory evidence of the qualifications of the person to be appointed, OPM may authorize an appointment in the competitive service without competitive examination whenever it finds that the duties or compensation of the position are such, or <span id="Page_598"></span>that qualified persons are so rare, that, in the interest of good civil-service administration, the position cannot be filled through open competitive examination.... Detailed statements of the reasons for the noncompetitive appointments made under this section shall be published in OPM's annual reports.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM contends that a valid delegation from the President need not specifically authorize OPM to create an exception for the Outstanding Scholar Program, and it asserts that the delegation in section 3.2 grants it broad authority that is sufficient for this purpose. But section 3.2, fairly read, appears to grant a rather narrow authority, hardly one that could authorize an extensive hiring program such as the one at issue here. It is directed at situations where an individualized assessment finds that there are too few applicants for a position to make a meaningful competition possible. OPM suggests that the Outstanding Scholar Program falls in this category because it is a response ordered by the <span class="Italic">Luevano</span> decree to the fact that too few minority applicants were available from competitive examinations. However, the situation addressed by <span class="Italic">Luevano</span> was not one where a meaningful competition was not possible, as contemplated by the regulation; rather, it was one where there were many applicants, but the competitive examination used to rank them was alleged to have had a discriminatory impact on minority applicants.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;OPM also cites its authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(a)(3), which permits certain appointments without regard to veterans' preference "where OPM has determined that there is a severe shortage of candidates or there is a critical hiring need." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 337.201-337.206 (2005). However, the nonselections at issue in these cases occurred before the effective date of this provision (60 days after November 25, 2002), and its enactment long postdates the initiation of the Outstanding Scholar Program. Furthermore, there is no evidence that OPM has made the requisite findings with respect to the positions covered by the <span class="Italic">Luevano</span> decree. Thus we find that this authority is inapplicable to the issue here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming OPM has delegated authority to do so, there is no evidence that it has issued a rule creating such an exception under section 3302(2). OPM cites two of its regulations that provide agencies guidance in the use of the Outstanding Scholar authority in conjunction with other hiring authorities, suggesting that they were sufficient to establish an exception to section 3304(b). Under the regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.205(g) an agency is required to clear its reemployment priority list before making appointments under a direct-hire authority, "which includes the Outstanding Scholar provision." Similarly, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.705 specifies the order of selection when an agency fills competitive service vacancies from outside its own workforce, which includes in section 330.705(b)(2) the place in this order of Outstanding Scholar appointments. In <span class="Italic">Dean</span> the Board found that these regulations describe how to make such appointments, but do not serve to authorize them. 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 34. The regulations do not state that they are establishing Outstanding Scholar appointments as an exception for purposes of section 3304(b), or explain why the exception from examination is necessary, or specify the conditions that permit such appointments to be made. Although section 330.705(b)(2) states that Outstanding Scholar appointments are made under the authority of the <span class="Italic">Luevano</span> decree, this summary reference is insufficient to meet the statutory requirement. Thus we find that OPM has not shown that it has issued a regulation establishing an exception under section 3304(b), assuming it had delegated authority to do so. Even if OPM had issued such a regulation based on <span class="Italic">Luevano</span>, however, the Board could not uphold it because, for the following reasons, we reaffirm our finding that <span class="Italic">Luevano</span> did not authorize use of the Outstanding Scholar program to override veterans' preference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fundamental basis of OPM's position is that the Outstanding Scholar Program is authorized by the <span class="Italic">Luevano</span> consent decree. Apart from reliance on its regulations referring to the program, OPM argues in the alternative that the <span class="Italic">Luevano</span> decree provision approving this hiring authority, or OPM's consent to the decree, is by itself sufficient for purposes of the section 3304(b) requirement. In other words, because the decree's provision requiring use of the program as a remedy for the discriminatory impact of competitive examinations was within the district court's authority under Title VII, the program must be effected. Logically, the underlying premise is that Title VII impliedly limits or repeals the section 3304(b) requirement to the extent necessary to permit the use of a needed remedy for discrimination. Thus OPM contends that only this reading can appropriately give effect to both statutes, as principles of statutory construction require the Board to do.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The basic error in OPM's position, however, is its misreading of the <span class="Italic">Luevano</span> decree as authorizing noncompetitive appointments that override veterans' preference. The decree states in &#x00B6; 9 that "[a]ny adverse impact which results from the requirements of the Veterans' Preference Act...may constitute a defense to the determination of adverse impact with respect to any competitive procedures." OPM interprets this language as applying only to situations in which an appointment is made pursuant to competitive procedures, either under the continued interim use of the Professional and Administrative Career Examination (PACE) or under the replacement examinations ordered by the decree. In OPM's view, if the agency chooses to use the Outstanding Scholar hiring authority instead of competitive procedures, this provision has no relevance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The problem with OPM's reading is that it removes any constraint on the agency as to when the Outstanding Scholar authority may be used. Yet clearly this supplementary, noncompetitive hiring authority is authorized to remedy the adverse impact of competitive procedures that perpetuate the under-representation of the <span class="Italic">Luevano</span> plaintiff class in appointments to the positions subject to the decree. <span class="Italic">See Luevano</span>, 93 F.R.D. at 80. The language in &#x00B6; 9 must be read in light of this remedial purpose and consistently with the statement in Title VII that "nothing contained in this title shall be construed to repeal or modify any...law creating special rights or preference for veterans." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-11. The consent decree language at issue reflects this statutory definition of adverse impact because it in effect provides that the competitive selection of a preference eligible veteran as the result of an examination does not constitute the adverse impact from an examination that the decree addresses. The purpose of the Outstanding Scholar Program approved by the decree is to mitigate the adverse impact of the examination on blacks and Hispanics. It does so by remedying the under-representation of members of the <span class="Italic">Luevano</span> plaintiff class through their noncompetitive appointment as Outstanding Scholars. But in a case where a selection is due to veterans' preference, there is no adverse impact permitting such an appointment from the program.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Luevano</span>, the court did not resolve the merits of the plaintiffs' claim, and the government did not admit that it had engaged in unlawful discrimination. 93 F.R.D. at 86, 92. To the extent that OPM suggests otherwise in the course of arguing that Title VII and the Veterans' Preference Act create inconsistent obligations for the government, its suggestion is misplaced. Since any judicially-imposed remedy in a Title VII case must take into account the fact that Title VII does not repeal or modify veterans' preference laws, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-11, a negotiated resolution in a Title VII case, for example, <span class="Italic">Luevano</span>, must also take this fact into account.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM rightly asserts that proper compliance with the consent decree through use of the Outstanding Scholar Program does not violate veterans' preference rights. But what OPM calls compliance with the decree in fact misapplies this hiring authority to permit making Outstanding Scholar appointments where there is no adverse impact, i.e., where a preference eligible veteran is or might be available for appointment as a result of an examination. It is a misapplication of the decree because by its express language the decree recognizes that a selection due to veterans' preference is not adverse impact within the meaning of Title VII.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The appellants and the amici have challenged the administration of the Outstanding Scholar program on other grounds besides the appointment of individuals who were not validly excepted from examination in violation of veterans' preference rights. These objections are based on the appointment as Outstanding Scholars of individuals who are not members of the minority groups represented by the <span class="Italic">Luevano</span> plaintiffs. Such claims raise factual issues outside the scope of this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues that to the extent that the Board believes that the Luevano consent decree impermissibly conflicts with other federal statutes, the proper course is for the appellants to seek relief from the consent decree by moving to intervene in the <span class="Italic">Luevano</span> proceeding for the purpose of seeking a modification of the decree. We do not agree. In <span class="Italic">Martin v. Wilks</span>, 490 U.S. 755 (1989), the Supreme Court rejected a similar argument. There, white firefighters brought suit alleging that they were being denied promotions because of their race. The employment actions at issue were made pursuant to consent decrees resolving class action complaints alleging that the city of Birmingham, Alabama, (City) and the Jefferson County Personnel Board (Board) had engaged in racially discriminatory hiring and promotion practices in violation of Title VII. The decrees set forth an extensive remedial scheme, including long-term and interim annual goals for the hiring and promotion of blacks as firefighters. The City and the Board argued that because the white firefighters failed to intervene in the proceedings resulting in the consent decrees, their reverse discrimination claims concerning actions taken under the decrees should be dismissed as collateral attacks on the consent decrees. The Supreme Court disagreed. Allowing the claims to go forward, the Court relied on the words of Justice Brandeis in <span class="Italic">Chase National Bank v. Norwalk</span>, 291 U.S. 431, 441 (1934): "The law does not impose upon any person absolutely entitled to a hearing the burden of voluntary intervention in a suit to which he is a stranger.... Unless duly summoned to appear in a legal proceeding, a person not a privy may rest assured that a judgment recovered therein will not affect his legal rights." <span class="Italic">Martin v. Wilks</span>, 490 U.S. at 763.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM also objects that the Board's decisions amount to improper second-<span id="Page_599"></span>guessing of the <span class="Italic">Luevano</span> district court because the Board has no authority to review and set aside the court's decision. This objection reflects OPM's view that the Board has invalidated a hiring program established by the district court and in doing so has exceeded its authority. OPM mischaracterizes the Board's decisions. The Board has merely interpreted the consent decree by reference to its language and that of the statute authorizing the decree in the adjudication of a case within the Board's VEOA jurisdiction. The Board has not set aside the Outstanding Scholar hiring authority approved by the district court, as contended. Rather, it has ruled that use of this authority must be consistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(b) and with the requirements of veterans' preference and the consent decree's clear intention.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision is based on legal requirements and does not set policy concerning preferred hiring methods. Where the Board has jurisdiction to review a rule issued by OPM establishing a necessary exception from competitive examination, as warranted by conditions of good administration, the Board's review is necessarily deferential to OPM's policy role in matters related to appointment. Here, such deference is not warranted because OPM has not established such a rule. Even were such deference due, it is fundamental that the Board must interpret and apply the statutes that are applicable to the matters within its jurisdiction, as it has done in deciding these cases.</p>
