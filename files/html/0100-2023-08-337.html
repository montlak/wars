<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-329"><span class="space">a.</span> Federal Career Intern Program</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Career Intern Program (FCIP), no longer operational, created under Exec. Order 13162 (July 6. 2000) and OPM regulations, established procedures for appointments to excepted service positions that could be converted to career or career-conditional appointments after two years. Those procedures provided for veterans preference and the necessity for a passover justification. <span class="Italic">See Alvarez v. DHS</span>, 112 MSPR 434, 435 &#x00B6; 2, 2009 MSPB 198 (2009) (citing 5 CFR 213.3202(o)(6)(i) (2009)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The FCIP and its impact upon the intent of VEOA to open competition to veterans was considered in <span class="Italic">Dean v. OPM</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/DEAN_DAVID_AT_3330_10_0534_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_547704.pdf">115 MSPR 157</a>, 160-75 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-33, 2010 MSPB 213 (2010) (enf. den.<span class="Italic">, Dean v. OPM</span>, 117 MSPR 547, 550, 2012 MSPB 39 (2012) ("the complete rescission of the FCIP renders Appellant Dean's petition for enforcement moot, and we DENY it for this reason")), determining that the FCIP, as constituted at the time of the <span class="Italic">Dean</span> decision, was not in accordance with VEOA because the appointments it authorized (leading to entry into the competitive service) were not properly exempted from the competitive service examining system, resulting in a corrective action order for Mr. Dean and another appellant with whom Dean's case was joined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2000, President Clinton issued Executive Order No. 13,162, thereby creating the Federal Career Intern Program (FCIP). The purpose of FCIP is "to attract exceptional men and women to the federal workforce who have diverse professional experiences, academic training, and competencies, and to prepare them for careers in analyzing and implementing public programs." Exec. Order No. 13,162, &#x00A7; 1. Appointments under the FCIP are to positions in Schedule B of the excepted service and are not to exceed two years, unless extended by the employing agency, with the concurrence of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), for up to one additional year. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00A7; 4(a). According to the Executive Order, "service as a Career Intern confers no rights to further Federal employment in either the competitive or excepted service upon the expiration of the internship period," although "[c]ompetitive civil service status may be granted to a Career Intern who satisfactorily completes the internship and meets all other requirements prescribed by the OPM." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00A7; 4(b)(3), (4). The Executive Order further provides, however, that when an employee holding a career or career-conditional appointment accepts an FCIP appointment and fails to complete his or her internship for reasons unrelated to misconduct or suitability, he or she has a right to return to career or career-conditional employment at a grade and pay no lower than the grade and pay he or she had under the prior appointment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00A7; 4(b)(5). Finally, the Executive Order charged OPM with promulgating regulations governing the FCIP, and ensuring that "appropriate veterans' preference criteria" are applied in the selection of Career Interns. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3(b), 6. OPM has issued regulations to implement the Executive Order. Those regulations delegate to individual agencies the authority to decide which positions will be filled under FCIP. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(10).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Evans</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2009, the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) issued three vacancy announcements for nine GS-7 Veterans Service Representative (VSR) positions in Columbia, South Carolina: (1) No. 2009-295-SC, which was limited to individuals eligible for appointment under the Veterans Recruitment Authority (VRA), the VEOA, and CTAP (career transition assistance for displaced employees); (2) No. VB259652, which identified the FCIP as the appointing authority; and (3) No. VB2596520, which was open to all U.S. citizens. Appellant Evans, a preference-eligible veteran with a 60% service-connected disability who was a non-probationary GS-4 File Clerk with the DVA, applied for the VSR position and requested consideration under the VRA only.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The DVA prepared separate certificates for applicants it found qualified under the VRA, the VEOA, the FCIP, and the all sources announcement. The appellant's name appeared on the VRA certificate. The selecting official filled all nine VSR positions from the FCIP certificate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a complaint with the Department of Labor (DoL) claiming that DVA had violated his veterans' preference rights, but DoL did not resolve the complaint to his satisfaction so he filed this appeal under the VEOA.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant Dean, a preference-eligible veteran with a 30% service-connected disability, filed a complaint with DoL alleging that FCIP systematically violates his right to compete for federal employment because vacancies under FCIP are not considered subject to the statutory public notice requirement.

In a later submission, the appellant alleged that federal agencies frequently post FCIP vacancy announcements on web sites that are accessible only to students and alumni of particular colleges, and that agencies send recruiters to college job fairs, who make appointments under FCIP "on the spot." The appellant alleged that as a result of such practices, he and other veterans are being shut out of job opportunities. He further alleged that OPM's own figures show that from 2001-2009 over 99,000 individuals were hired under FCIP....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Board has jurisdiction over these appeals.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VEOA empowers the Board to adjudicate claims for violation of an "individual's rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A), (d). To establish jurisdiction over such a claim, an appellant must show that he exhausted his remedies with DoL and non-frivolously allege that he is a preference eligible veteran, the action(s) at issue took place on or after the October 30, 1998 enactment date of VEOA, and the agency violated his rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 385, &#x00B6; 9 (2010); <span class="Italic">Abrahamsen v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 6 (2003). Claims of veterans' preference violations "should be liberally construed," and an allegation, in general terms, that an individual's veterans' <span id="Page_585"></span>preference rights were violated is sufficient to satisfy the last jurisdictional element. <span class="Italic">Slater v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 28, &#x00B6; 6 (2009); <span class="Italic">Elliott v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 364, &#x00B6; 8 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that appellant Evans has established jurisdiction. Specifically, Evans has presented undisputed evidence that he exhausted his remedy before DoL; it is undisputed that Evans is a preference-eligible veteran; it is undisputed that the action he challenges took place in 2009; and he has non-frivolously alleged that his statutory veterans' preference rights were violated when DVA used FCIP to fill the position for which he applied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, we agree with the administrative judge that appellant Dean has established jurisdiction. Specifically, Dean has presented undisputed evidence that he exhausted his remedy before DoL; it is undisputed that Dean is a preference-eligible veteran; it is undisputed that the actions he challenges took place after 1998; and he has non-frivolously alleged that his statutory veterans' preference rights have been violated by the placement of FCIP positions in the excepted service, with the resultant exemption from the requirement that vacancies be publicly announced.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the administrative judge, and relying on <span class="Italic">Jolley v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 299 Fed. Appx. 969 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (non-precedential), OPM argued that Dean's appeal is barred by his failure to apply for a particular position. The Board may follow non-precedential Federal Circuit decisions that it finds persuasive. <span class="Italic">Worley v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 237, &#x00B6; 8 (2000). Leaving aside whether we find <span class="Italic">Jolley</span> persuasive, that decision has no application here because it holds that a claim of discrimination under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4311, 4324, may not be pursued with regard to a position for which the individual claiming discrimination never applied. By contrast, Dean's appeal arises under the VEOA, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a, and it is governed by Board VEOA precedent. <span class="Italic">See Weed v. Social Security Administration</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 323, &#x00B6; 15 (2009) (an individual's failure to apply for a position filled under FCIP does not bar him from pursuing a VEOA appeal when he claims that his failure to apply was caused by an agency's decision not to publicize the vacancy). Whereas in <span class="Italic">Letchworth v. Social Security Administration</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 269, &#x00B6; 7 n.5 (2006), the Board held that a veteran who applied for vacancies in some locations but not others could not complain that non-veterans were hired in locations for which he chose not to apply, in <span class="Italic">Weed</span> the Board made clear that a VEOA claim may be pursued where, as here, the appellant alleges that as a result of an agency's violation of veterans' preference rules he was prevented from applying for a position. To hold otherwise would create a gaping loophole in the VEOA; it would make some alleged violations of veterans' preference rights immune from review just because they are hidden. Congress could not have intended such a perverse result. <span class="Italic">Cf. Kirkendall v. Department of the Army</span>, 479 F.3d 830, 841 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (rejecting a "narrow" interpretation of the VEOA's deadline provisions in light of the VEOA's important purpose of creating a right of redress for veterans' preference violations); <span class="Italic">Dean v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 19 (2005) (the VEOA is a remedial statute that should be construed so as to "suppress the evil and advance the remedy"), <span class="Italic">aff'd on recon.</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 1 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1) is a statute relating to veterans5 preference.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, the VEOA empowers the Board to grant relief for violations of an "individual's rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A), (d). The VEOA does not define "relating to," nor does any applicable regulation. In the absence of a distinct definition, the Board assumes that the words "relating to" carry their "ordinary, contemporary, common meaning." <span class="Italic">Dean v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 16 (quoting <span class="Italic">Perrin v. United States</span>, 444 U.S. 37, 42 (1979)). Thus, a "statute...relating to veterans' preference" is one that "stands in some relation to," "has a bearing on," "concerns," or "has a connection with" veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The statute at the heart of this appeal provides that--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The President may prescribe rules governing the competitive service. The rules shall provide, as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant, for--(1) necessary exceptions from the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1). As detailed below, we agree with appellant Dean and amici AFGE and NTEU that section 3302(1) is a statute relating to veterans' preference because veterans' preference is a central feature of the system for examining candidates for entry into the competitive service; the creation of exceptions from the competitive service necessarily implicates veterans' preference rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin by observing that statutory preference for veterans in federal employment is not new. It has existed in some form since the Civil War,[4] and the current rules can be traced to the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, Pub. L. No. 78-359, 58 Stat. 387. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in a letter endorsing the Act, said this:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I believe that the federal government, functioning in its capacity as an employer, should take the lead in assuring those who are in the armed forces that, when they return, special consideration will be given to them in their efforts to obtain employment. It is absolutely impossible to take millions of our young men out of their normal pursuits for the purpose of fighting to preserve the nation, and then expect them to resume their normal activities without having any special consideration shown to them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">February 26, 1944 letter from President Franklin D. Roosevelt to Congressman Robert Ramspeck (available online at <span class="Italic">The American Presidency Project</span>, "Public Papers" section.[5] ).

<p class="Block-Quote1">With that backdrop, we now turn to the specific features of veterans' preference in the statutory competitive examination system, which were described in <span class="Italic">Joseph v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 684, &#x00B6; 8 n.3 (2006), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 505 F.3d 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2007), as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An integral part of the competitive examining process is the assignment of numerical scores, followed by the rating and ranking of candidates. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 337.101(a) (the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), or an agency operating under a delegation of authority from OPM, "shall assign numerical ratings" to candidates). Preference eligibles have points added to their passing scores on examinations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 337.101(b). Preference-eligible veterans are entitled to five additional points; disabled veterans and certain relatives of disabled veterans are entitled to ten additional points. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 337.101(b). After the candidates' scores have been adjusted to include any additional points, the names of applicants who have qualified for appointment are entered onto "registers or lists of eligibles," in rank order, with preference eligibles ranked ahead of others with the same rating. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3313; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.401. For positions other than scientific and professional positions in grades GS-9 or higher, disabled veterans who have a compensable service-connected disability of 10 percent or more are entered onto registers in order of their ratings ahead of all remaining applicants. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3313(2)(A); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.401. An examining authority certifies "enough names from the top of the appropriate register" to permit the appointing authority "to consider at least three names for appointment to each vacancy in the competitive service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3317(a). The appointing authority "shall select for appointment to each vacancy from the highest three eligibles available for appointment on the certificate furnished under section 3317(a)." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(a). If an appointing authority "proposes to pass over a preference eligible...in order to select an individual who is not a preference eligible, such authority shall file written reasons with [OPM] for passing over the preference eligible" and obtain OPM's approval. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2002, Congress created "alternative ranking and selection procedures" for competitive-service positions. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3319.[6] Under these procedures, which are known as "category rating," an examining agency defines two or more quality categories; candidates are assessed and those with similar proficiency are placed in the same category; disabled veterans are placed in the highest category; within a category, preference eligible veterans are listed ahead of non-preference eligibles; the two highest categories may be combined if there are fewer than three candidates in the highest category; and a non-preference eligible may not be selected ahead of a preference eligible in the same category unless pass over procedures at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3317(b) or 3318(b), as applicable, are followed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The statute authorizing alternative ranking and selection procedures by its own terms applies where OPM is exercising its authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304, which expressly governs competitive-service examinations, and where an agency is exercising competitive examining authority under a delegation from OPM under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1104(a)(2). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3319(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Dean v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-19, the Board held that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(b)--which provides that "[a]n individual may be <span id="Page_586"></span>appointed in the competitive service only if he has passed an examination or is specifically excepted from examination under section 3302 of this title"--is a "statute relating to veterans' preference." The Board reasoned that section 3304(b) established competitive examinations as "the norm," thereby ensuring that the veterans' preference rights which are part of the examination process would generally be applied. Section 3304(b) is "intrinsically connected" to veterans' preference rights because it ensures that such rights are not circumvented or ignored by agencies simply choosing not to conduct competitive examinations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 19. We likewise observe in the present case that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1) establishes placement of positions in the competitive service as the norm, with exceptions only as "necessary" for "good administration." <span class="Italic">See National Treasury Employees Union v. Horner</span>, 854 F.2d 490, 495 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (the competitive service is "the norm," exceptions from which may only be made when "necessary" for "conditions of good administration"). Veterans' preference in hiring has its force and effect under the two methods for assessing candidates for the competitive service, as discussed above, namely, traditional competitive examining with rating and ranking and the alternative category rating system. By establishing competitive-service hiring as the norm, section 3302(1) is intrinsically connected to veterans' preference rights in that it ensures that such rights are not circumvented or ignored. We hold that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1) is a "statute relating to veterans' preference" upon which a VEOA claim may be based.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Our holding is not altered by the Presidential Memorandum issued May 11, 2010, which directs agencies, "no later than November 1, 2010," to adopt category rating under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3319 as their primary method of examining candidates for entry into the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See</span> Memorandum at sec. 1(a)(3). As noted above, veterans' preference is a key component of both category rating and traditional rating and ranking.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Appellant Dean has established a violation of his veterans' preference rights.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dean argues that OPM has failed to justify placement of positions filled under FCIP in the excepted service; that this improper placement allows agencies to avoid the statutory requirement that notice of competitive-service vacancies be made to the public; and that as a result, his veterans' preference rights have been systematically violated. As detailed below, we agree, and we find that FCIP is flawed in a second way as well.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin our analysis with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1), which states that the President "may prescribe rules governing the competitive service," and that the rules shall provide, "as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant," for "necessary exceptions from the competitive service." Pursuant to this authority, in 1954 the President issued Executive Order No. 10,577, 19 Fed. Reg. 7521 (reprinted at 5 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 3301 note).[8] This Executive Order was amended by over a dozen subsequent Executive Orders issued between 1955 and 2001. The current version appears at 5 C.F.R. Parts 1-10, The Civil Service Rules. Those Rules provide, in relevant part, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x00A7; 1.1 Positions and employees affected by the rules in this subchapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The rules in this subchapter shall apply to all positions in the competitive service and to all incumbents of such positions. Except as expressly provided in the rule concerned, the rules in this subchapter shall not apply to positions and employees in the excepted service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x00A7; 1.2 Extent of the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The competitive service shall include: (a) All civilian positions in the executive branch of the Government unless specifically excepted therefrom by or pursuant to statute or by the Office of Personnel Management (hereafter referred to in this subchapter as OPM) under &#x00A7; 6.1 of this subchapter; and (b) all positions in the legislative and judicial branches of the Federal Government and in the Government of the District of Columbia which are specifically made subject to the civil service laws by statute. OPM is authorized and directed to determine finally whether a position is in the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x00A7; 6.1 Authority to except positions from the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(a)&#x2003;OPM may except positions from the competitive service when it determines that appointments thereto through competitive examination are not practicable. These positions shall be listed in OPM's annual report for the fiscal year in which the exceptions are made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(b)&#x2003;OPM shall decide whether the duties of any particular position are such that it may be filled as an excepted position under the appropriate schedule.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(c)&#x2003;Notice of OPM's decision granting authority to make appointments to an excepted position under the appropriate schedule shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x00A7; 6.2 Schedules of excepted positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">OPM shall list positions that it excepts from the competitive service in Schedules A, B, and C, which schedules shall constitute parts of this rule, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Schedule A.</span> Positions other than those of a confidential or policy-determining character for which it is not practicable to examine shall be listed in Schedule A.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Schedule B.</span> Positions other than those of a confidential or policy-determining character for which it is not practicable to hold a competitive examination shall be listed in Schedule B. Appointments to these positions shall be subject to such noncompetitive examination as may be prescribed by OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Schedule C.</span> Positions of a confidential or policy-determining character shall be listed in Schedule C.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;The 1954 Executive Order actually amended earlier Executive Orders governing the competitive service. For present purposes it is unnecessary to trace the history of the Civil Service Rules because the relevant portions of the Rules have not changed since the FCIP was created in 2000.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The President may delegate authority for "personnel management functions" to OPM. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1104(a)(1). Civil Service Rule 6.1 on its face is a delegation from the President charging OPM with determining exceptions from the competitive service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1). We assume solely for purposes of this decision that OPM may further delegate, to individual agencies, the authority to place positions in the excepted service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1104(a)(2) (OPM "may delegate, in whole or in part, any function vested in or delegated to" OPM). FCIP is flawed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1), a law relating to veterans' preference, because it is inconsistent with the Civil Service Rules that govern placement of positions in the excepted service and because it does not require the justification of placement of positions in the excepted service as required by statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">FCIP is inconsistent with the Civil Service Rules that govern placement of positions in the excepted service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1).</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's rules for the FCIP, implementing Executive Order No. 13,162, appear at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o). There is nothing in those rules to prohibit an agency from deciding whether to fill a particular position with a competitive-service appointment or an excepted-service Schedule B appointment under FCIP on an <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> basis, after applications are received. The <span class="Italic">Evans</span> case is illustrative. DVA advertised for multiple VSR vacancies under an open competitive announcement <span class="Italic">and</span> an FCIP announcement (among other authorities), assessed the candidates and prepared certificates corresponding to the different announcements, and <span class="Italic">then</span> decided to fill the positions using excepted-service appointments under FCIP.[9] Civil Service Rule 6.1(b), which provides that "OPM shall decide whether the duties of any particular position are such that it may be filled as an excepted position under the appropriate schedule," clearly contemplates that a <span class="Italic">position</span> must be classified as competitive-service or excepted-service even before a vacancy announcement is issued. This reading of the rule is supported by Civil Service Rule 6.2, which provides that Schedule B of the excepted service is reserved for "[p]ositions other than those of a confidential or policy-determining character for which it is not practicable to hold a competitive examination."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;What DVA did in <span class="Italic">Evans</span> is not unique. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gingery,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 306, &#x00B6; 2 (in "the same hiring process," the Department of Defense filled two Auditor positions in the competitive service and two Auditor positions in the excepted service under FCIP). In any event, we do not base our decision on how frequently agencies postpone, until after applications are received and a competitive examination is conducted, deciding whether to fill a particular position with a competitive-service appointment or an excepted-service appointment under FCIP. The evidentiary records in these cases are not developed on the issue, and how often this practice occurs is not dispositive. Rather, the important fact is that OPM's rules governing FCIP allow this practice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This facet of FCIP has a major effect on veterans' preference, as shown by what DVA did in <span class="Italic">Evans</span>. DVA conducted a competitive examination for the VSR position and generated a certificate with the names of 25 candidates, all of whom were preference-eligible veterans, and all of whom received scores (unadjusted for veterans' preference) of close to 100 on a 100-point scale. Having conducted a competitive examination and having identified 25 highly-qualified candidates, DVA cannot plausibly claim that holding a competitive examination for the VSR position was or would have been "impracticable"; yet, DVA filled all nine of the VSR positions with FCIP appointments under Schedule B, which is reserved for "[p]ositions other than those of a confidential or policy-determining character for which it is not practicable to hold a competitive examination." Eight of the nine candidates that DVA selected from the FCIP certificate were non-veterans who by all indications could not have been selected ahead of the 25 <span id="Page_587"></span>veterans on the competitive certificate. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 332.401-332.406.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that FCIP is inconsistent with the Civil Service Rules that govern placement of positions in the excepted service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1)--a law relating to veterans' preference--because it allows an agency to invoke an appointing authority reserved for "positions...for which it is not practicable to hold a competitive examination" after the agency holds a competitive examination that yields highly-qualified preference-eligible candidates.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">FCIP violates the rights of preference-eligible veterans under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1) because it does not require agencies to justify placement of positions in the excepted service as required by section 3302(1).</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Again, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1) provides that the President "may prescribe rules governing the competitive service," and that "[t]he rules shall provide, as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant, for--(1) necessary exceptions from the competitive service." OPM, and by extension, agencies acting under a delegation of authority from OPM, do not have unfettered discretion to place positions in the excepted service under section 3302(1).<span class="Italic"> National Treasury Employees Union v. Horner</span>, 854 F.2d at 495. Rather, section 3302(1) establishes that exceptions from the competitive service must be justified as "necessary" for "conditions of good administration." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We acknowledge that the issue before the court in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Horner,</span> 854 F.2d at 498, was whether OPM's placement of certain positions in the excepted service was "arbitrary and capricious" under the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2)(A), whereas the issue in these cases is whether the appellants' rights under a "statute...relating to veterans' preference" have been violated, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3330a(a), (d). We have already found that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1) is a statute relating to veterans' preference, however, so the court's decision is instructive insofar as the court held that section 3302(1) establishes a substantive standard that must be satisfied for a position to be placed properly in the excepted service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Executive Order No. 13,162, which created the FCIP, does not except any particular position from the competitive service. Similarly, OPM's regulations implementing Executive Order No. 13,162 do not except any particular position from the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o). Instead, OPM's regulations governing the FCIP leave it to individual agencies to determine which positions will be filled under FCIP. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(10). Those regulations, the relevant portion of which is reproduced in full as a footnote below, do not themselves find that excepting FCIP positions from the competitive service is "necessary" for "conditions of good administration," nor do they require individual agencies to make such findings.[10] As a result, the regulations violate 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;The relevant portion of OPM's regulations provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(10)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Agency responsibilities.</span> Each agency will determine the appropriate use of the FCIP relating to recruitment needs in geographical areas, specific occupational series, and grades, pay bands or other pay levels, ensuring that programs are developed and implemented in accordance with the merit system principles. Each agency must describe in writing how it will use the FCIP, including, but not limited to, such aspects as: (i) Delegating the authority to develop FCIPs (e.g., department-wide versus bureaus and agency components); (ii) Defining the roles and responsibilities of supervisors and other key officials in FCIP administration, such as human resources staff, budget and finance staff, career counselors, or mentors; (iii) Identifying the positions or occupations that will be covered under the FCIP; (iv) Developing procedures for accepting applications, and evaluating and selecting candidates according to part 302 of this chapter on employment in the excepted service and any other applicable requirements; (v) Designing, implementing, and documenting formal program(s) for the training and development of employees selected under the provisions of this Program, including the type and duration of assignments; (vi) Deciding how to inform the career interns of what will be expected during the internship, including developmental assignments and performance requirements; and (vii) Planning, coordinating, implementing, and monitoring program activities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(10).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant Dean has been injured by this violation because as a preference eligible veteran he has a right to compete, under merit promotion procedures, for vacancies for which an agency is accepting applications from outside its workforce. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.106; <span class="Italic">Brandt v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6; 12 (2006).[11] He also has a right to file an application for any position to be filled via competitive examination under an all-sources vacancy announcement. The requirement that agencies notify OPM of vacancies for which they will consider applicants from outside their workforces, and the related requirement that OPM make available to the public a list of vacancies for which agencies will consider applicants from outside their workforces, by their own terms apply only to the competitive service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3327(b), 3330(b)-(d). Appellant Dean is thus being deprived of the right to apply for positions when agencies fill the positions under FCIP without public notice, since he cannot apply for a job about which he has no knowledge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11] According to OPM, appellant Dean's statutory right to compete has not been affected because that right applies only to positions filled under merit promotion procedures and FCIP appointments are not made under merit promotion procedures. We disagree because OPM's own guidance, to which the Board has deferred, provides that the right to compete under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f) is triggered when an agency accepts applications from outside its workforce. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.106; <span class="Italic">Brandt</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We wish to emphasize what we do not hold. <span class="Italic">Amicus</span> NTEU asserts in <span class="Italic">Evans</span> that FCIP violates the merit system principles because it allows hiring without "fair and open competition." The cases before us, however, arise under the VEOA; the sole issue is whether the appellants' rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference have been violated. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3330a(a), (d). Further, appellant Dean asserts that in the last 10 years over 99,000 individuals have been appointed under FCIP, and <span class="Italic">amicus</span> NTEU asserts that hiring under FCIP has become standard practice (rather than the exception) in some agencies for some occupations. The evidentiary records have not been developed with regard to these assertions, though, and in any event our holding does not depend on our making findings of fact about the frequency of the use of FCIP. Rather, our holdings stated above are based purely on our interpretation of the relevant laws and regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this connection, we overrule the statement in <span class="Italic">Gingery v. Department of Defense</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6; 9 (2007), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 550 F.3d 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2008), that FCIP is "a valid exception to the competitive examination requirement" because it is "authorized by an Executive Order." The <span class="Italic">Gingery</span> decision did not discuss whether the key features of FCIP discussed herein are permitted under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">As relief, appellant Dean is entitled to have OPM comply with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1).</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VEOA provides that upon finding that an agency has violated a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference, the Board "shall order the agency to comply with [the statute or regulation violated] and award compensation for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by the individual." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a). In a typical VEOA non-selection case, the Board orders reconstruction of the hiring process consistent with the law to ascertain whether the appellant would have been selected for the position he sought. <span class="Italic">See Gonzalez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 567, &#x00B6; 9, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 355 Fed. Appx. 417 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (non-precedential). Appellant Dean does not claim that OPM has denied him any particular job, however. Rather, he claims that OPM's violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1) deprived him of his right to know about and apply for jobs elsewhere in the government. These other government agencies are not before the Board and as a result we cannot order relief against them. Moreover, we cannot discount the possibility that, notwithstanding the lack of any requirement in OPM's regulations that agencies justify their use of the FCIP under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1), there may be some agencies that have provided sufficient justification. Accordingly, the relief to which appellant Dean is entitled and that operates against the only agency currently before the Board in his case is to order OPM to comply with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1).[12]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12] In light of this holding, it is unnecessary to decide whether OPM may delegate to individual agencies the authority to place positions in the excepted service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recognized that in unusual cases its decisions may have such a far-reaching impact on the workings of the government that the normal timeline for compliance should be extended. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Sink v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 628, 635 (1995). This appears to be such a case. At the same time, untold numbers of veterans are potentially being shut out of job opportunities for which they would have preference, because the agencies are filling the positions under FCIP without public notice. It is also significant to note that our decision today cannot come as a complete surprise to OPM, given that in two precedential decisions issued in August 2009 the Board raised serious questions about whether FCIP ran afoul of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1). <span class="Italic">See Weed</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 323, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18; <span class="Italic">Gingery</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 306, &#x00B6; 15. Balancing the foregoing considerations, we conclude that OPM must comply with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1) within 120 days of the date of this decision instead of the customary 30 days. <span class="Italic">See Sink</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. at 635 (considering the "magnitude" of its decision finding that the Postal Service violated the reduction in force rules in a nationwide restructuring that affected thousands of employees, the Board extended the ordinary compliance period to 120 days).[13]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13] We are aware that on May 11, 2010, the President ordered OPM to review the FCIP and to provide "recommendations concerning the future of that program" within 90 days. <span class="Italic">See</span> Presidential <span id="Page_588"></span>Memorandum of May 11, 2010, &#x00A7; 2(c). We are not privy to those recommendations, and as of today we have no knowledge of any planned modifications to FCIP that could affect the remedy here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Appellant Evans has established a violation of his rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1) and is entitled to reconstruction of the hiring process for the VSR position.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, appellant Evans applied for the VSR position under the VRA. The VRA authorizes appointments of certain veterans in the competitive service without competition. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 307.101-307.104. As the discussion above indicates, DVA has not justified, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1), filling the nine VSR positions at issue with excepted-service appointments. While there could be some agency that has justified filling a position under a Schedule B FCIP appointment, DVA actually conducted a competitive examination and determined that 25 candidates applying under the open competitive announcement were highly qualified. DVA therefore has not shown, much less purported to determine, that it was "not practicable to hold a competitive examination," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 6.2, for the VSR position. DVA also determined that appellant Evans was qualified for a VRA appointment. Therefore, the appropriate remedy is to reconstruct the hiring process consistent with the law to ascertain whether the appellant would have been selected for the position he sought. <span class="Italic">See Gonzalez</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 567, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Several cases reviewed the FCIP before <span class="Italic">Dean.</span> The FCIP appointment process, the application of veterans preference, and the passover requirement were described in <span class="Italic">Gingery v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant argues that the agency's hiring under the FCIP constitutes improper circumvention of his preference rights. In support of this argument, he relies on <span class="Italic">Deems v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 161 (2005), <span class="Italic">Dean v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533 (2005), <span class="Italic">aff'd on recons.</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 1, (2006), and <span class="Italic">Olson v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The appellant also refers to the fact that the agency interviewed him only once, while it conducted second interviews of some other candidates who eventually were selected for the FCIP positions; he asserts that he should have been interviewed twice, once in connection with an FCIP position and once in connection with a non-FCIP position; and he argues that, because it interviewed him only once, the agency failed to give him proper consideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This issue does not appear to have been raised below, and the only reason given for this failure--i.e., the appellant's alleged inability to understand "technical jargon"--is inadequate. <span class="Italic">See Morrison v. Department of the Army</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 655, 659 n.4 (1998) (while <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellants are not expected to proceed with the precision of an attorney in a judicial proceeding, they may not escape the consequences of inadequate representation); <span class="Italic">Banks v.

Moreover, even if the argument described above were properly before the Board, we would see no merit in it. The appellant has cited no basis for finding that the agency was obligated, under a statute or regulation relating to veteran preference, to interview him separately for the FCIP and non-FCIP positions, and we know of none.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has misinterpreted the decisions he cites. The Board did not indicate in those decisions that noncompetitive hiring authorities could never be used to hire candidates not entitled to preference when qualified preference-eligible candidates were available. Instead, it indicated that, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304, an individual could be appointed in the competitive service only if he had passed an examination or qualified for appointment under a valid noncompetitive appointing authority. <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-38; <span class="Italic">see Olson</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 322, &#x00B6; 6. The Board observed in <span class="Italic">Dean</span> that preference eligibles received certain advantages in a competitive examination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309-3318, and it concluded that the appointment in that case of a candidate not entitled to veteran preference violated the appellant's preference rights because the appointee did not pass a competitive examination and was not appointed under a valid noncompetitive appointing authority. <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14, 21-38.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appointments at issue in <span class="Italic">Dean</span> and <span class="Italic">Olson</span> were made under the Outstanding Scholar Program (OSP). <span class="Italic">See Olson</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 322, &#x00B6; 2; <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 7.

In <span class="Italic">Deems</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 13, it made the same finding regarding the Clerical and Administrative Support Positions (CASP) assessment tool. In the absence of any showing that the selectees in those cases had passed an examination or had been specifically excepted from examination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302, the Board concluded that the agencies had violated the appellants' preference rights by appointing the selectees to the competitive service positions for which the appellants had applied. <span class="Italic">Olson</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 322, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9; <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 30-38; <span class="Italic">Deems</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 16.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no indication that the two FCIP appointees in this case "passed an examination," as that term is used in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304. The FCIP authority used here, however, differs from those used in the cases on which the appellant relies because it represents a valid exception to the competitive examination requirement. Unlike the OSP and CASP programs, it was expressly authorized by an Executive order promulgated under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302. <span class="Italic">See</span> Exec. Order No. 13,162, Preamble, 65 Fed. Reg. 43,211 (July 6, 2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The purpose of the FCIP is "to attract exceptional men and women to the federal workforce who have diverse professional experiences, academic training, and competencies, and to prepare them for careers in analyzing and implementing public programs." Exec. Order No. 13,162, &#x00A7; 1.

<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM is authorized to promulgate regulations needed to carry out the purposes of the Executive order, <span class="Italic">id.</span>, &#x00A7; 6, and in fact it has done so. Under regulations applicable to excepted appointments such as those under the FCIP, an agency may evaluate candidates under a "category rating" system as an alternative to traditional rating and ranking with numerical scores. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 213.3202(o), 302.304, 302.401.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge in this case found that the agency had complied with the relevant provisions of part 302 regarding the ranking and selection of candidates for the positions at issue here, including the provisions governing the selection of candidates who were not preference eligibles when there were higher-ranking preference-eligible candidates. Specifically, she found that the agency had ranked preference-eligible candidates higher than candidates not entitled to preference; that the selectees were nevertheless within reach for selection under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401(a); and that the agency complied with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401(b), which required it to "record its reasons" for passing over the appellant and to furnish a copy of the reasons to the appellant "on request." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> She also indicated that, although the appellant had not been furnished a copy of those reasons at the time of his nonselection, the agency was not required to furnish a copy at that time because the appellant had not requested one. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 8 &#x0026; n.4.4 The appellant has identified no error in these findings, and none is apparent to us.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal, the Federal Circuit determined that the OPM passover regulation was invalid, that the passover procedures of 5 USC 3318 are made applicable to the excepted service by 5 USC 3320, and remanded the case to the Board for reconsideration.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Most federal civil service employees are employed by way of either the "competitive service" or the "excepted service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2102(a)(1), 2103(a) (2006). Agencies tend to have more flexible hiring for excepted service positions as opposed to competitive service positions. Competitive service hiring often entails an examination administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Treasury Employees Union v. Horner</span>, 854 F.2d 490, 492 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Excepted service hiring, by contrast, does not require an examination and includes "a variety of more flexible and informal procedures--some established by OPM and others developed by individual agencies." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. pt. 213 (Excepted service). The President possesses the authority to "prescribe rules governing the competitive service," which themselves "shall provide, as nearly <span class="Italic">as conditions of good administration warrant</span>, for...<span class="Italic">necessary exceptions</span> of positions from the competitive service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">President Clinton created the FCIP under an executive order and pursuant to &#x00A7; 3302(1) "in order to provide for the recruitment and selection of exceptional employees for careers in the public sector." Exec. Order No. <span id="Page_589"></span>13,162, 65 Fed. Reg. 43,211 (July 6, 2000). Section 4(a) of the Executive Order explained that "[a] successful candidate shall be appointed to a position in Schedule B of the excepted service...unless otherwise approved by the OPM." The President delegated to OPM responsibility for "prescrib[ing] such regulations as it determines necessary to carry out the purpose of this Order." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the Executive Order, OPM promulgated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o). <span class="Italic">See</span> 70 Fed. Reg. 44,219 (Aug. 2, 2005); 65 Fed. Reg. 78,077 (Dec. 14, 2000). Subsection (1) of this regulation requires agencies to follow the procedures set forth in 5 C.F.R. pt. 302, Employment in the Excepted Service, when making appointments under the FCIP. Accordingly, agencies may evaluate candidates under a "category rating" system instead of the traditional "numerical rating" system. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401(a). When using a category rating system, "an agency must make its selection from the highest available preference category, as long as at least three candidates remain in that category. When fewer than three candidates remain in the highest category, consideration may be expanded to include the next category." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency chooses to select a candidate from one of these next categories, it must comply with certain passover procedures. For the competitive service, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b) requires that "[i]f an appointing authority proposes to pass over a preference eligible on a certificate in order to select an individual who is not a preference eligible, such authority shall file written reasons with [OPM] for passing over the preference eligible" and obtain OPM's permission for the passover. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1). When a preference eligible has a compensable service-connected disability of 30% or more, "the authority shall at the same time it notifies [OPM] under paragraph (1) of this subsection, notify the preference eligible of the proposed passover, of the reasons thereof, and of his right to respond." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 3318(b)(2). Also in the case of such a preference eligible, OPM's functions cannot be delegated. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 3318(b)(4). For the excepted service, on the other hand, OPM enacted a passover regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401(b), that provides less procedural protections:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When an agency, in making an appointment as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, passes over the name of a preference eligible who is entitled to priority consideration under &#x00A7; 302.304 and selects a non-preference eligible, it shall record its reasons for so doing, and shall furnish a copy of those reasons to the preference eligible or his/her representative on request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties do not dispute the facts as they pertain to Mr. Gingery's employment. The Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) solicited applications for three auditor positions under the FCIP, though it subsequently withdrew an offer for one of the positions for unrelated reasons. Mr. Gingery, a preference-eligible veteran with service-connected disability rated at 30% or more, applied for these auditor positions. DCAA considered OPM certificates of eligibles and used a category rating system to fill the auditor positions. Mr. Gingery's veterans' preference placed him in Category 1; there were no other applicants in Category 1 or in Categories 2 or 3. There were six candidates in Category 4. Because there were fewer than three candidates in Category 1, DCAA considered the applicants in Category 4 under section 302.401(a), in addition to considering Mr. Gingery. Of the applicants ultimately referred to the selecting official for consideration and interviews, only Mr. Gingery had veterans' preference. Nevertheless, a panel of supervisory auditors did not recommend Mr. Gingery for a second interview. Instead, DCAA hired two auditors under the FCIP. DCAA ultimately selected two non-preference eligibles (i.e., applicants not eligible for preference) from Category 4 and, in accordance with section 302.401(b), recorded its reasons for not selecting Mr. Gingery. The DCAA selecting official did not request OPM permission to pass over Mr. Gingery but rather requested and received permission from a human resources manager. The official also did not notify Mr. Gingery of the proposed passover, of the reasons for the proposed passover, or of his right to respond.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Gingery filed a complaint with the Department of Labor under the VEOA. When that Department failed to resolve his complaint, Mr. Gingery appealed to the MSPB. Mr. Gingery alleged that "DCAA willfully violated his veterans' preference rights under the VEOA when it failed to select him for any of the auditor-trainee positions, failed to request permission from [OPM] to pass him over and failed to notify him of its intent to pass him over in accordance with the procedures set forth under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)." In an initial decision, the administrative judge (AJ) explained that &#x00A7; 3318 applies only to the competitive service and that the auditor positions were filled as excepted service positions under the FCIP. The AJ noted that nothing in the record indicated that Mr. Gingery requested the reasons for being passed over and that DCAA therefore complied with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401(b) when it provided a written statement of its reasons for not selecting Mr. Gingery. The AJ concluded that DCAA did not violate Mr. Gingery's veterans' preference rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Gingery petitioned the MSPB for review of the AJ's initial decision on the basis that "[DoD's] hiring under the FCIP constitutes improper circumvention of his preference rights." The MSPB granted review and concluded that the FCIP constituted a valid exception to hiring in the competitive service because the FCIP "was expressly authorized by an Executive order promulgated under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302." It further explained that OPM promulgated regulations pursuant to the Executive Order and that DoD complied with those regulations and the corresponding excepted service regulations to which they referred. Thus the MSPB affirmed the AJ's initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Gingery appeals the MSPB's final decision on two grounds. He argues that OPM's passover regulation (5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401(b)) is invalid because it is inconsistent with the passover procedures of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b) when applied to the excepted service via 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320. Mr. Gingery also argues that "the FCIP is unlawful in its entirety" because it violates &#x00A7; 3302(1)'s requirement that exceptions to the competitive service be "necessary" for "conditions of good administration." DoD responds that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401 is valid and was properly applied by OPM and that Executive Order 13,162 represents the President's unfettered discretion to place civil service positions in the excepted service. Because we conclude that OPM's passover regulation is invalid and that Mr. Gingery's veterans' preference rights were violated, we need not reach the broader questions of the FCIP's validity.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;We note that the decision of the MSPB on appeal did not address Mr. Gingery's argument regarding whether the FCIP or the decisions to place the auditor positions into the excepted service via the FCIP was lawful. Should it become necessary to resolve this issue, the MSPB should do so in the first instance. <span class="Italic">See Horner</span>, 854 F.2d at 490. If this remand does not resolve Mr. Gingery's case, we note that he is not precluded from renewing his FCIP challenges before the MSPB.</p>

If, however, "the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue," we ask "whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The precise question at issue in this case is what procedures an agency should follow when it passes over a preference eligible having a compensable service-connected disability of 30% or more and selects a nonpreference eligible for a position in the excepted service. For the competitive service, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b) requires that an appointing authority obtain OPM's permission and, when a preference eligible has a compensable service-connected disability of 30% or more, notify the preference eligible of the proposed passover, of the reasons for the passover, and of his right to respond. OPM's regulation, which applies to the excepted service, requires only that an appointing authority record its reasons for the passover and provide a copy of these reasons to the preference eligible or her representative upon request. We conclude, however, that Congress has already addressed this question in applying the competitive service passover procedures of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b) to the excepted service via 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Selection into the excepted service in the executive branch shall be conducted "in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service by [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7;] 3308-3318." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320 (2006). The 1966 codification of Title 5, Pub. L. No. 89-554, 80 Stat. 378, combined former &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 858 and 869 to create the current &#x00A7; 3320. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320 (Historical and Revision Notes); <span class="Italic">see also</span> S. Rep. No. 89-1380, at 64 (1966). Section 858 referred to selection in the unclassified civil service and directed an official to make any such selection "in accordance with provisions of this chapter." The corresponding chapter--Chapter 17--was titled "Preference of Veterans in Government Employment (New)." Section 869 essentially excluded the legislative and judicial branches from Chapter 17, which the current &#x00A7; 3320 accomplishes by specifying that it applies only to the executive branch and the government of the District of Columbia. The Historical and Revision Notes further explain that former &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 858 and 869 were restated in &#x00A7; 3320 "to conform to section 3318(a)." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320 (Historical and Revision Notes).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 3318 is titled "Competitive service; selection from certificates." Subsection (a) refers to certificates furnished under &#x00A7; 3317(a).[2] Under subsection (b), when "an appointing authority proposes to pass over <span id="Page_590"></span>a preference eligible on a certificate," the authority must file written reasons for the passover with OPM and get OPM's permission for the passover. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1). When a preference eligible has a compensable service-connected disability of 30% or more, "the authority shall at the same time it notifies [OPM] under paragraph (1) of this subsection, notify the preference eligible of the proposed passover, of the reasons thereof, and of his right to respond." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 3318(b)(2).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Taken together, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3320 and 3318 resolve the first step of our <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> analysis. Through &#x00A7; 3318, Congress spoke on the question of what procedures an agency should follow when it passes over a preference eligible and selects a nonpreference eligible for a position in the competitive service. And through &#x00A7; 3320, Congress makes clear that &#x00A7; 3318 applies in the same manner to the excepted service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government argues that in <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Department of the Interior</span>, 424 F.3d 1151 (Fed. Cir. 2005), we held that OPM had responsibility for implementing all veterans' preference rights in the excepted service. The government argues that it continues to give veterans' preferences, but that it is not required to follow the exact statutory protections enacted by Congress. The government misinterprets our decision in <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>. In <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>, the veteran challenged an OPM regulation that did not require the addition of points based on veterans' preference to a qualifying rating or ranking, which the agency used to evaluate applicants. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1157. He argued that this regulation was invalid as contrary to the plain language of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3320 and 3309, which required the addition of points to a rating when appointment was made through examination. At issue was how an agency should "apply the principles of veterans' preference to positions within the excepted service that are not subject to examination." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1158-59. We reasoned as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x00A7; 3309 is silent on the issue of how agencies should apply veterans' preference rights to a preference eligible in the <span class="Italic">competitive service</span> who is <span class="Italic">not required to pass an examination</span>.... It therefore necessarily follows that Congress has not spoken on the issue of how to apply the principles of veterans' preference to positions within the <span class="Italic">excepted service</span> that are <span class="Italic">not subject to examination</span>.... [T]he regulations issued by OPM to fill this gap are therefore entitled to deference under <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1158-59 (emphasis added). Although &#x00A7; 3320 clearly requires &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3308-3318 to apply to the excepted service in the same manner as the competitive service, it was impossible for &#x00A7; 3309 to be applied in the <span class="Italic">Patterson</span> case. Section 3309 applied only to those who take exams. Because the excepted service applicants at issue in <span class="Italic">Patterson</span> were not subject to an exam, &#x00A7; 3309 was inapplicable to them--in fact, it would have been impossible to apply. We concluded therefore that OPM's regulation was reasonable and consistent with the Veterans' Preference Act (VPA) of 1944, Pub. L. No. 78-359, 59 Stat. 387 (codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2108, 3309-3320), which provides preference eligible veterans with additional benefits in seeking civil service employment. <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>, 424 F.3d at 1159.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The present case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Patterson</span> because there is no examination requirement in &#x00A7; 3318 and no analogous requirement that would preclude application of &#x00A7; 3318 to the excepted service under &#x00A7; 3320. Section 3309 applied to examinations, which are specific to the competitive service, whereas &#x00A7; 3318 applies to selection from certificates, which are used in both the competitive and excepted services. Because Congress clearly and unambiguously stated in &#x00A7; 3320 that &#x00A7; 3318 should apply to the excepted service in the same manner it applies to the excepted service, OPM is not entitled to <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference, and we "must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress." <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 843.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulation--5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401(b)--is invalid because it provides 30% or more disabled Veterans with less protection than Congress guaranteed them in &#x00A7; 3318. The regulation demands only that an agency (1) <span class="Italic">record</span> its reasons for passing over the preference eligible and (2) <span class="Italic">upon request</span>, <span class="Italic">provide</span> a copy of those reasons to the preference eligible or her representative. Title 5, however, requires that an agency's appointing authority obtain OPM <span class="Italic">permission</span> to pass over the preference eligible. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1) (2006). Moreover, &#x00A7; 3318(b) provides additional protections for preference eligibles having a compensable service-connected disability of 30% or more. For these individuals, the appointing authority must--at the time it solicits OPM's permission for the intended passover and regardless of any request--"notify the preference eligible of the proposed passover, of the reasons thereof, and of his right to respond." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 3318(b)(2). The statute even requires "a demonstration by the appointing authority that the passover notification was timely sent to the preference eligible's last known address." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Lastly, OPM's functions cannot be delegated. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 3318(b)(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, OPM's promulgated regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401(b), which establishes <span class="Italic">lesser</span> protections for veterans who are 30% or more disabled, is at odds with the statutory protections Congress guaranteed these veterans. Because Congress has already addressed precisely this issue and OPM's regulation conflicts with the statute itself, we hold this OPM passover regulation invalid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401(b) is invalid because it does not give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress in enacting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3320 and 3318. There is no question that the requirements of &#x00A7; 3318 (as applied to the excepted service via &#x00A7; 3320) were not met in this case. The final decision of the MSPB is therefore <span class="Italic">REVERSED</span> and <span class="Italic">REMANDED</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">NEWMAN, <span class="Italic">Circuit Judge</span>, concurring.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I agree that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401(b) is inconsistent with statutory requirements regarding pass-over procedures, and that reversal and remand for application of the proper procedures are appropriate. I join the court's holding on this issue. I write separately because the court has not treated the central issue of this appeal, an issue that can have a larger effect on Mr. Gingery's legal rights than the correct application of the pass-over provisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Gingery's central argument relates to the placement into the excepted service of the auditor position for which he applied. This deprived him of important veterans' preference rights that apply to competitive service positions. He argues that the Federal Career Internship Program ("FCIP") was improperly implemented for this position, and that the GS-0511 auditor position for which he applied would normally be filled through competitive examination and associated hiring rules, which he states would have granted him ten preference points as a veteran with at least 30% disability. This aspect is squarely presented on this appeal. It was not a secondary or alternative argument, as the court now suggests, maj. op. at 6, nor was it an issue that "the decision of the MSPB on appeal did not address," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 6 n.1. On the contrary, the full Board, on review of the AJ's initial decision, discussed the validity of the FCIP at some length. <span class="Italic">Gingery v. Dep't of Defense</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 671, 674-75 (2007). As the majority states: "The MSPB granted review and concluded that the FCIP constituted a valid exception to hiring in the competitive service...." Maj. op. at 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On this appeal Mr. Gingery again points to the cases in which the Board had previously found that appointments made pursuant to alternative hiring programs were not valid exceptions from the competitive service, and violated veterans preference rights. <span class="Italic">See Dean v. Dep't of Agriculture</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 1 (2006) (discussing Outstanding Scholar Program appointments); <span class="Italic">Deems v. Dep't of Treasury</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 161 (2005) (discussing Clerical and Administrative Support Positions appointments). Responding to Mr. Gingery's argument that the issues are analogous, the Board stated: "The FCIP authority used here, however, differs from those used in the cases on which the appellant relies because it represents a valid exception to the competitive examination requirement." <span class="Italic">Gingery</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. at 675. It is this holding to which Mr. Gingery directed most of his briefing on this appeal, and which attracted the participation of the National Treasury Employees Union ("NTEU") as <span class="Italic">amicus curiae</span>. The NTEU stresses the growth of excepted hiring pursuant to the FCIP, as compared with competitive hiring, as the predominant hiring mechanism for entry-level positions in the executive branch. Mr. Gingery argues that the auditor position for which he applied was improperly placed within the internship program and thereby removed from the competitive service. This issue of this appeal is separate from the issue of validity of OPM's regulation on the pass-over procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2102(a)(1), the competitive service includes "all civil service positions in the executive branch" except those "positions which are specifically excepted from the competitive service by or under statute," or other limited exceptions that do not apply to the auditor position at issue. The statutory authorization for the exception of positions from the competitive service appears at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The President may prescribe rules governing the competitive service. The rules shall provide, as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant, for--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;necessary exceptions of positions from the competitive service;....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FCIP was implemented by Executive Order No. 13,162, which assigned its administration to OPM. Mr. Gingery and the NTEU state that exceptions from competitive hiring procedures for executive branch civil service positions require, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302, a showing of necessity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Gingery and the NTEU point out that hiring pursuant to the FCIP, as it <span id="Page_591"></span>pertains to the auditor position for which Mr. Gingery applied, does not meet the statutory necessity requirement. The government conceded that no showing of necessity was made for the auditor position at issue here, and argued instead that the President and OPM and all of the executive branch agencies have "unfettered discretion" to except positions from the competitive service. This argument was rejected in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Horner</span>, 854 F.2d 490 (D.C. Cir. 1988), where the court held to be arbitrary and capricious OPM's movement of competitive positions into the excepted service, with no reasonable showing of necessity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302. The court stated: "In this case, as the district court found, several provisions of title 5 of the U.S. Code, viewed together, provide a meaningful--not a rigorous, but neither a meaningless--standard against which to judge OPM's decision to convert the PAC positions from competitive to excepted status." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 495.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Gingery states that the auditor position for which he applied was not listed in the OPM's annual report of excepted positions, citing 70 Fed. Reg. 2284 (Jan. 12, 2005) and 71 Fed. Reg. 58,680 (Oct. 4, 2006). The auditor position was not shown to be a "necessary exception" to the standard procedures of the competitive service. I recognize that the considerations are complex; however, the issue was fully and fairly raised on this appeal, and has a direct impact on this petitioner, for the veteran states that he is deprived of his statutory additional points of rating. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309(1); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1), (2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This was a primary issue addressed in the briefing and at oral argument of Mr. Gingery's appeal. The issue is before this court, and it should be discussed and resolved.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gingery</span> returned to the Board. In <span class="Italic">Gingery v. DOD</span>, 112 MSPR 306, 309-12 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-16, 2009 MSPB 151 (2009) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Gingery v. DOD,</span> CH-3443-06-0582-X-1 (NP 9/18/2012), <span class="Italic">post</span>), the Board sent the case back to the regional office for further consideration, and for an opportunity to allow OPM to intervene, on the validity of permitting intern appointments to be through excepted service rather than competitive service procedures, with consequential effects upon the remedy that Mr. Gingery might receive:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Compliance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subchapter 1 of chapter 33, U.S. Code, includes a number of provisions governing the examination, certification, and appointment of candidates for positions in both the competitive service and the excepted service. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b), an employing agency is not free to fill a position in the competitive service by appointment of a candidate who is not a preference eligible while declining to select for that position a higher-ranking preference-eligible candidate. If it wishes to "pass over" the preference eligible to select a lower-ranking non-preference-eligible candidate, it must first "file written reasons with [OPM] for passing over the preference eligible." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b). OPM "shall determine the sufficiency or insufficiency of the reasons submitted by the" agency; "it shall send its findings to the [agency] and to the preference eligible"; and that agency "shall comply with the findings of" OPM. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Moreover, if the preference eligible the employing agency proposes to pass over has a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or more, the agency "shall notify the preference eligible of the proposed passover, of the reasons therefor, and of his right to respond to such reasons to [OPM] within 15 days of the date of such notification." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(c). This notification is to be made at the same time the agency submits its passover proposal to OPM, <span class="Italic">id.</span>, and the preference eligible's response is to be considered by OPM in making its determination on the proposal, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have indicated above that the FCIP positions at issue here were in the excepted service, rather than the competitive service, and that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b) applies to selections for competitive service positions. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320, however, selections for positions in the excepted service are to be made "in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service by sections 3308-3318 of" title 5. In an apparent effort to ensure that procedures for filling excepted service positions conformed to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b), OPM promulgated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401(b). That regulatory provision does not require either the OPM approval that is required under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b) or the notice to the preference eligible that is required under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(c). Instead, it requires the agency only to "record its reasons for" passing over the preference eligible, and to "furnish a copy of those reasons to the preference eligible...on request." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401(b), the agency in this case did not seek OPM approval of a proposal to pass over the appellant in order to select FCIP candidates who were not preference eligible; instead, it sought and obtained that approval internally. In doing so, it recorded its reasons for the passover, consistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401(b). Because the appellant did not request a copy of the reasons for the passover, the agency did not furnish one to him. <span class="Italic">See</span> Appeal File, Tab 17 (the appellant's submission of September 19, 2006, at 2); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the court, the appellant argued that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401(b) was invalid because it was inconsistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b). <span class="Italic">See Gingery</span>, 550 F.3d at 1351. The court concurred in this argument. It found that, in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320, Congress had made "clear that &#x00A7; 3318 applie[d] in the same manner to the excepted service" as it did to the competitive service. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1352-53. It found further that the regulatory provision gave preference eligibles--and especially those with compensable service-connected disabilities of 30 percent or more--less protection than Congress had guaranteed them in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318, that it accordingly was inconsistent with the applicable statute, and that its passover provision therefore was invalid. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1354. Because the agency had not complied with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318, as applied to the excepted service through 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320, the court reversed our decision in this case. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Compliance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have indicated above that the FCIP may be used only to fill positions in the excepted service. By electing to fill some of its auditor positions under the FCIP, the agency was, in effect, electing to except them from the competitive service. While this case was pending in court, the appellant argued that those positions were improperly excepted. <span class="Italic">See Gingery</span>, 550 F.3d at 1354-56 (Newman, J., concurring).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302, Congress authorized the President to "prescribe rules governing the competitive service," and it stated that those rules were to "provide, as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant, for...(1) necessary exceptions of positions from the competitive service...." The appellant evidently argued before the court that the FCIP positions should not have been excepted from the competitive service under this provision without a showing of necessity, that the exception from that service of the auditor positions at issue here had not been shown to have been a "necessary exception" to the procedures required with respect to the competitive service, and that the agency therefore was not authorized to fill the position by appointment from the FCIP list. <span class="Italic">See Gingery</span>, 550 F.3d at 1354-56 (Newman, J., concurring). The court did not reach this issue. Although one judge on the panel that heard this case expressed the view that the court should have addressed the issue, <span class="Italic">id.</span>, the majority declined to do so, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 1351 n.1. In referring to that issue, however, the majority specifically noted that, if its remand of the case did not resolve the case, the appellant was "not precluded from renewing his FCIP challenges before the MSPB." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have indicated above that the appellant has filed a submission challenging various aspects of the selection process. Specifically, he argues that "OPM failed to give effect to the necessity analysis required under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1)." It appears, therefore, that the appellant does not consider the court's remand of his case to resolve the issue of whether his rights as a preference eligible were violated during the selection process, and that he still believes the use of the FCIP authority violated those rights. In light of the appellant's renewed argument, and for reasons provided below, we find that this case must be remanded for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note first that, if we were only to order the agency to comply with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1) and (2), the appellant would receive, at most, appointment to an excepted service auditor position. As we have indicated above, however, one of the auditor vacancies the agency filled during the hiring process at issue here was filled in the competitive service by appointment from a certificate issued by OPM. The appellant competed for that position; his name appeared at the top of the certificate used to fill it; and the agency's failure to select him from that certificate was an issue before the Board. <span class="Italic">Gingery</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6; 5. Moreover, as correspondence the appellant has submitted following the court's remand of this case suggests, appointment to a competitive service position could be regarded as more desirable than appointment to the same position in the excepted service. <span class="Italic">See</span> Remand File, Tab 1 at 18 (statement by the attorney who represented the appellant before the court that, "[e]ven if [the appellant] were to be hired under a reconstruction of the FCIP certificate, he would still be harmed by...avoidance of the FCIP issue since...[u]nder the FCIP he would have a two-year probationary period, compared to the one-year period under the competitive certificate").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the candidate selected from the OPM certificate on which the appellant's name appeared also was a preference eligible who was within reach for selection, we indicated in our earlier decision that that selection did not violate the appellant's rights as a preference eligible. <span class="Italic">See Gingery</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6; 5; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 332.404(a), 332.406(b). As explained below, however, absent a determination regarding the validity of the exception from the competitive service of the auditor positions that were filled by FCIP selectees, we cannot rule out the possibility that the agency's appointment of those selectees violated the appellant's rights as a preference eligible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we indicated in our previous decision in this case, the Board observed in <span class="Italic">Dean v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 14, 21-38 (2005), <span class="Italic">aff'd on recons</span>., 104 M.S.P.R. 1 (2006), that preference eligibles received certain advantages in a competitive examination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309-3318, and it concluded that the appointment of a candidate <span id="Page_592"></span>who was not a preference eligible, who had not passed a competitive examination, and who was not appointed under a valid noncompetitive appointing authority violated the rights of the appellant in that case, a preference eligible who had competed unsuccessfully for the same position through a competitive examination. <span class="Italic">Gingery</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6; 7. We distinguished <span class="Italic">Dean</span> from the present case on the ground that the FCIP authority used here, unlike the authorities used in <span class="Italic">Dean</span> and similar cases, represented a valid exception to the competitive examination requirement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 9. In relying on this distinction, however, we did not address the concerns that were raised before the court. That is, we did not address the issue of whether the exception of the auditor positions at issue here complied with the "necessity" requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1). In light of the arguments raised below, the statements the court made in remanding this case to us, and the possible effect a determination regarding this issue may have on the remedial action to which the appellant is entitled, we find that the issue must be addressed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that the arguments presented to the court regarding the agency's authority to except its auditor positions from the competitive service are not included in the record before us, and that the record on this issue is otherwise undeveloped. Remanding this case to the regional office therefore is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following remand, the case continued in a compliance phase, after the agency tentatively offered Mr. Gingery the job he sought, with the Board determining that the agency properly imposed a requirement that Mr. Gingery be eligible for a security clearance and enter into a mobility agreement as a condition to his appointment as an auditor. <span class="Italic">Gingery v. DOD,</span> CH-3443-06-0582-X-1 (NP 9/18/2012). The Board subsequently concluded that the agency properly required, as part of the reconstruction process, that Mr. Gingery, to assume current employment with the agency, qualify for a current security clearance rather than a clearance under conditions pertaining when first he applied for the job. <span class="Italic">Gingery v. VA</span>, 121 MSPR 423, 2014 MSPB 59 (2014).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Weed v. SSA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/WEED_ALVERN_C_DE_3330_08_0490_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_434353.pdf">112 MSPR 323</a>, 332-35 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-18, 2009 MSPB 159 (2009), noted the opinion of Judge Newman in <span class="Italic">Gingery</span> as it remanded to its AJ another case involving the FCIP and the broader question posed by the Board of when and how an agency (as opposed to OPM) can determine to fill positions under excepted service rather than competitive service hiring authorities:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FCIP may be used only to fill positions in the excepted service. <span class="Italic">See</span> Exec. Order No. 13,162, &#x00A7; 4(a); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o) (listing FCIP positions among those filled under Schedule B of the excepted service). By electing to fill the Claims Representative and Contact Representative positions under the FCIP, the agency was, in effect, electing to except them from the competitive service. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302, Congress authorized the President to "prescribe rules governing the competitive service," and it stated that those rules were to "provide, as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant, for...(1) necessary exceptions of positions from the competitive service...." Having found that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal, we turn to the merits of this appeal and find that the appellant's argument that the agency should not have been permitted to use the FCIP to circumvent his veterans' preference rights directly implicates section 3302. In fact, the appellant alleges on review that the FCIP is illegal on its face, and cites to the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Gingery</span>, 550 F.3d at 1354-56, which includes in Judge Newman's concurring opinion arguments relating to the issue of whether the agency's use of the FCIP met the "necessity" showing set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302. In addition, NTEU specifically argues in its <span class="Italic">amicus curiae</span> brief that the agency violated section 3302 through its use of the FCIP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, VEOA provides redress for violations under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A). Although the Board has held that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(b) is a "statute...relating to veterans' preference" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A),[7] the Board has not squarely addressed the question of whether section 3302 qualifies as such a statute.[8] Accordingly, the AJ shall provide the parties on remand with an opportunity to present evidence and argument on this issue, shall provide OPM with an opportunity to intervene in the appeal, and shall issue a new initial decision addressing that issue and, if the AJ finds that section 3302 relates to veterans' preference under section 3330a(a)(1)(A), the issue of whether the exception of the Claims Representative and Contact Representative positions complied with the "necessity" requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1). <span class="Italic">See National Treasury Employees Union v. Horner</span>, 854 F.2d 490, 495 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (provisions of title 5 of the U.S. Code, including 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302, provide a "meaningful--not a rigorous, but neither a meaningless--standard" against which to judge an OPM decision to except positions from the competitive service).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Section 3304(b) provides, in relevant part, that an individual may be appointed in the competitive service only if he has passed an examination or is specifically excepted from examination under section 3302 of title 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Deems v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 9 (2005), the Board stated that section 3302 was a "statute which applies to veterans' preference," without providing any supporting analysis. In <span class="Italic">Dean v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 36 (2005), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 1 (2006), the Board addressed section 3302 within the context of determining whether there was a violation of section 3304(b), noting that "[e]ven assuming that the other requirements of section 3302, discussed above, have been met, there has been no showing that an exception to the examination process, in the form of the Outstanding Scholar Program, was determined by the President or OPM to be necessary and warranted by considerations of good administration." However, the Board repeatedly held that section 3304(b) was a statute "relating to" veterans' preference, and that the agency had violated that statute, not section 3302. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-20, 38. The majority opinion in <span class="Italic">Gingery</span>, 550 F.3d at 1351 n.1, noted that the Board could address on remand Mr. Gingery's argument "regarding whether the FCIP or the decision to place the auditor positions into the excepted service via the FCIP was lawful," but it did not address the question of whether section 3302 was a statute relating to veterans' preference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addressing the above issues, the parties should also address, as appropriate, the question of whether the statutory scheme permits the exclusion of particular positions from the competitive service by individual agencies, rather than solely by the President or OPM. <span class="Italic">See Fish v. Department of the Navy</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 595, 597 (1986) (the President has the power to except positions from the competitive service, and OPM, under delegating authorities, exercises the power on behalf of the President). As set forth above, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302 provides that "the President" may prescribe rules that shall provide, as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant, for necessary exceptions of positions from the competitive service. Moreover, section 3302 provides that "[e]ach officer and individual employed in an agency to which the rules apply shall aid in carrying out the rules." This statement could be regarded as indicating that the rules identifying particular positions as necessary exceptions from the competitive service are to be issued by the President and/or OPM and <span class="Italic">carried out</span> by officers and individuals in agencies, not issued by those officers and individuals. In this regard, we note that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(a)(3) provides that the President may prescribe rules which shall provide, as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant, for authority for agencies to appoint, without regard to the provision of sections 3309 through 3318, candidates directly to positions for which public notice has been given and OPM has determined that there exists a severe shortage of candidates or there is a critical hiring need. Section 3304(a) further provides that OPM "shall prescribe, by regulation, criteria for identifying such positions and may delegate authority to make determinations under such criteria." These provisions of section 3304(a) arguably support the proposition that Congress knew how to grant OPM the authority to delegate to agencies the responsibility for identifying positions not subject to competitive procedures, and that it did so with respect to section 3304(a), but did not do so with respect to section 3302. OPM, nevertheless, appears to have delegated to agencies, like the agency in this case, the authority to identify positions for the FCIP. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(10)(iii) (each agency must describe in writing how it will use the FCIP, including identifying the positions or occupations that will be covered).[9]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;The record includes the agency's FCIP "Guide for Managers" for the Denver Region, dated April 2007. Assuming that OPM may delegate the authority to identify particular FCIP positions to individual agencies, the parties should address on remand whether the agency in this case prescribed its own rules setting forth "necessary exceptions" of positions from the competitive service under the FCIP.</p>
