<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-25"><span class="space">d.</span> Jurisdiction to Accept and Enforce Settlement Providing for Fees or Supporting Fee Motion</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Delorme v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/DELORME_JOYCE_M_DE_3443_12_0472_C_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1369887.pdf">124 MSPR 123</a>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-21, 2017 MSPB 2 (2017), announced that if the parties settle a case and agree that their settlement will be placed into the record for enforcement by the Board, the settlement can be enforced without a preliminary determination that the appeal was within the Board's jurisdiction. The Board's earlier position was that when an agency settles a Board appeal before the issuance of the initial decision, the Board will not accept the settlement for purposes of enforcement unless the appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction, and that jurisdictional limitation applied to settlements involving counsel fee awards. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 51 MSPR 103, 108 (1991) ("The Board must ascertain that it has jurisdiction over the underlying subject matter of a settled case before it may award attorney fees in that case."); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Joyce v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 83 MSPR 666 (1999) (<span class="Italic">Joyce II</span>), <span class="Italic">in part overruling</span> <span class="Italic">Joyce v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 74 MSPR 112 (1997) ("we find that the Board may award attorney fees only in those cases over which it has jurisdiction"), discussed <span class="Italic">post</span>. The theory of the earlier cases was that the Board <span id="Page_4563"></span>should not enforce a settlement of a case that is not within its jurisdiction. In routine adverse actions, annuity disputes, or performance-based actions, jurisdiction should not be an issue of significance. In appeals arising in other contexts, e.g., constructive adverse actions, or in USERRA, IRA, or VEOA appeals, establishing jurisdiction may be a problem should jurisdiction essentially equate to a finding in favor of the appellant on the merits of the appeal. [Refer to <a href="0100-2023-23-001.html#sec16-1">Chapter 16</a> concerning settlements and Board jurisdiction to accept settlements for purposes of enforcement.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Delorme</span> does not undercut the need for a settlement that is in the record; it eliminates the difficulty getting it into the record if jurisdiction must be first established in a constructive adverse action or IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">Sacco v. DOJ,</span> <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SACCO_GERALDINE_DC_0752_99_0219_A_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_251118.pdf">90 MSPR 37</a>, 41 &#x00B6; 9 (2001), indirectly noted of the link between Board jurisdiction and its ability to award fees, as it interpreted the Supreme Court decision in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon Bd. v. West Virginia DHHR</span>, <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/532/598.html">121 S. Ct. 1835</a> (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Court further noted that while private settlements alone would not support an award of attorney fees, settlements entered into the record and made subject to enforcement clearly could do so, in addition to consent decrees, judgments, or other legal findings, on the merits supporting legal liability....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Delorme</span> was decided on January 4, 2017, several days before the Board lost its quorum and ability to issue final precedential decisions--a situation that remained in effect through March of 2022, when the quorum was restored. A decision issued soon after the Board regained its quorum in early 2022, <span class="Italic">Tyson v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, DC-0752-14-0446-A-1 (NP 5/16/2022), involving a dispute over whether the appellant was a probationer settled, and the settlement provided that the AJ determine reasonable attorney fees. The AJ denied any fees after deciding that the statutory "interest of justice" criteria were not met. Remanding, the Board determined that the entitlement to fees was part of the settlement, the AJ was to determine their reasonableness and not to evaluate entitlement under 5 USC 7701(g)(1). <span class="Italic">Tyson</span> noted that <span class="Italic">Delorme</span> determined that the source of the Board's authority to enforce settlements is independent of the Board's jurisdiction over the underlying matter appealed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The decisions that follow predated <span class="Italic">Delorme</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An example of the Board's approach toward counsel fee petitions arising out of settlements of IRA cases is <span class="Italic">Auker v. DOD</span>, 86 MSPR 468, 474-75 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-19 (2000), likely involving a lower threshold for establishing jurisdiction than in a constructive adverse action appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the Board may award attorney fees under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701, it must determine that it has jurisdiction over the appeal that serves as the basis for the award<span class="Italic">. Joyce v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 83 MSPR 666, 674 (1999). In order to establish jurisdiction over an IRA appeal that concerns an action not otherwise appealable to the Board, an appellant must show the following by preponderant evidence: (1) That he made a disclosure protected under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8); (2) that the agency took or failed to take, or threatened to take or fail to take, a "personnel action" as defined in 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2); (3) that the appellant raised the issue before OSC; and (4) that proceedings before OSC were exhausted<span class="Italic">. Geyer v. Department of Justice</span>, 63 MSPR 13, 16-17 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to...establishing that the appellant has made a disclosure protected under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), we note that that provision covers, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the disclosure of information the employee reasonably believes evidences a violation of law, rule, or regulation. The appellant in this case has alleged that he disclosed to the Defense Criminal Investigations Section, on November 13, 1997, that a retired employee had "returned to office and helped himself to office chairs, official American flag, official pictures, etc. [sic]." He also has provided a document that he has indicated is a copy of the memorandum in which he made this disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The removal of the items described in the appellant's letter would appear to constitute a violation of law, i.e., it would appear to constitute theft or misappropriation of government property. The appellant has provided no information, however, that would establish the reasonableness of his belief that such a violation occurred. Moreover, the agency has questioned the existence of such a reasonable belief, and it has alleged that the disclosure "was grounded in rumor and office gossip...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances described above, we find that this case must be remanded for a determination as to whether the Board has jurisdiction over the appellant's appeal.

The appellant's submission includes evidence that the agency reassigned him to a position that left him virtually idle, making his working conditions intolerable. Based on this submission alone, we find that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support a finding of jurisdiction that, but for the settlement, would place this case in a posture ripe for consideration of the merits."). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-22-007.html#sec15-8">Jurisdiction Over Action Under Appeal</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The rule was somewhat different if the issue is timeliness. Believing that the parties may waive the impediment of timeliness to the establishment of jurisdiction, the Board will accept a settlement agreement if the only bar to jurisdiction is timeliness. The theory is that the timeliness defense is waived if the parties agree to settle. <span class="Italic">McNamee v. VA</span>, 39 MSPR 530, 533 (1989).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The analysis of jurisdiction as to settled cases involving contested jurisdiction developed principally through pre-<span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> appeals of actions that were canceled prior to an initial decision and that then led to a fee petition. The Board's analysis was provided in <span class="Italic">Joyce v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 83 MSPR 666, 670-82 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-36 (1999) (<span class="Italic">Joyce II</span>), <span class="Italic">in part overruling</span> <span class="Italic">Joyce v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 74 MSPR 112 (1997), involving an appeal from a constructive removal and suspension. In the 1999 <span class="Italic">Joyce</span> decision, spawned from an OPM reconsideration petition, the Board retreated from the position that a fee petition could be resolved on the basis of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction and instead required factual evidence of jurisdiction, through hearing if necessary. These cases would not now arise since, post-<span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, the Board will not entertain a fee petition based on a unilaterally and properly canceled action. In <span class="Italic">Joyce,</span> over the cogent dissent of Chairman Erdreich, who pointed out that a hearing on the merits to support fees makes little sense if the agency canceled an action to avoid a merits hearing, the Board stated in its 1999 decision that a substantive jurisdictional finding is required to award counsel fees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(a)(1), the Board shall "hear, adjudicate, or provide for the hearing or adjudication, of all matters within the jurisdiction of the Board under this title, chapter 43 of title 38, or any other law, rule, or regulation, and, subject to otherwise applicable provisions of law, take final action on any such matter." Under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2), the Board shall "order any Federal agency or employee to comply with any order or decision issued by the Board under the authority granted under paragraph (1) of this subsection and enforce compliance with any such order." Further, under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), the Board "may require payment by the agency involved of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee...if the employee...is the prevailing party and the Board...determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice, including any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency or any case in which the agency's action was clearly without merit."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Shaw v. Department of the Navy,</span> 39 MSPR 586, 589-93 (1989), the Board held that there is no basis for an award of attorney fees in cases where it is not clear that the Board has jurisdiction over the underlying subject matter of the appeal. <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> reasoned that, although 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g) did not specify that the authority to award attorney fees was limited to cases over which the Board had jurisdiction, such a limitation was a "necessary concomitant" to the cited authorities. Because the Board could only act or designate an employee to act for it in accordance with its statutory authority under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(a)(1), the Board found no significance to the absence of an express limitation on the award of attorney fees to those cases over which the Board has jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Shaw</span>, 39 MSPR at 589. <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> also held that judicial precedent in connection with other statutory authorities provided no basis for Board awards of attorney fees in the absence of a determination of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 591-93.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Joyce,</span> 74 MSPR at 115-16, the Board overruled <span class="Italic">Shaw</span>, rejecting <span class="Italic">Shaw's</span> determination that limiting the award of attorney fees to cases over which the Board had jurisdiction was "implicit" in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g). The Board in <span class="Italic">Joyce</span> essentially found that: (1) Contrary to <span class="Italic">Shaw,</span> the Board does "act" in cases where it is ultimately found that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appeal; (2) 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(a)(1) merely empowers the Board to hear and adjudicate <span class="Italic">on</span> <span class="Italic">the merits</span> those matters that are within its jurisdiction; and (3) the plain language of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g) does not require a finding of Board jurisdiction in order to establish the authority to grant attorney fees. The Board found no persuasive reason for the Board and its AJs to build a record and engage in a significant expenditure of analytical resources merely for the purpose of determining whether the agency should be spared the expense of attorney fees expended by the appellant in fighting agency practices or policies that the agency ultimately rescinded or modified to the satisfaction of the appellant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 116.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues that the first finding set forth above is an inappropriate basis on which to overrule <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> because each adjudicatory body has the inherent authority to determine whether it has jurisdiction over the case before it. <span class="Italic">[S]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">ee</span> <span class="Italic">Martin v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 62 F.3d 1403, 1406 (Fed. Cir. 1995) ("Every federal court has jurisdiction to <span id="Page_4564"></span>determine the limits of its jurisdiction in a particular case."). Thus, OPM asserts that whether the Board "acts" in cases in which it is ultimately found that it lacks jurisdiction is irrelevant to the issue of attorney fees, because in order to act on the merits of a case the Board must make a preliminary determination of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (every tribunal has the responsibility to determine whether it has jurisdiction). Although we are reluctant to overrule recent precedent, we agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM also asserts that the second and third findings set forth above run afoul of the principle that the United States, in the absence of its consent, is immune from suit, and that the specific terms of its consent to be sued define an adjudicative body's jurisdiction to entertain the suit....&#8197;Thus, OPM contends that a waiver of sovereign immunity cannot be implied, but must be unequivocally expressed, and that here, there is no explicit language in section 7701(g) that permits the granting of attorney fees in cases in which only a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of jurisdiction has been alleged<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, too, we agree, despite our misgivings about overruling recent precedent. As OPM points out, section 7701(g) contains no substantive grant of jurisdictional authority. Rather, substantive authority to adjudicate and "take final action" on appeals is derived from 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(a)(1), which the Board is not free to expand at will. <span class="Italic">See King v. Jerome,</span> 42 F.3d 1371, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (the Board's authority is limited to what Congress has expressly given it, and this grant of jurisdiction must be strictly construed). Thus, there is no unequivocal expression by Congress that attorney fees may be awarded against the United States in the absence of Board jurisdiction. As in <span class="Italic">Martin,</span> 62 F.3d at 1406, the statute at issue "says nothing about jurisdiction," but "simply authorizes fee awards in cases already within the jurisdiction" of the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, it is fundamental that a section of a statute should not be read in isolation from the context of the whole act, and that a court, in interpreting legislation, must not be guided by a single sentence or part of a sentence, but should look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy<span class="Italic">. Richards v. United States,</span> 369 U.S. 1, 11 (1962). Here, we find that <span class="Italic">Joyce</span> improperly read section 7701(g) in isolation from the other provisions of the statute. Reading the relevant provisions as a whole, we find that the Board may award attorney fees only in those cases over which it has jurisdiction. It would be unreasonable, for example, to have required Congress to repeat in section 7701(g) that the Board must have jurisdiction in order to award attorney fees, when it had already set forth in section 1204(a)(1) that the Board could only hear, adjudicate, or "take final action" on those matters within its jurisdiction. We also note that the Board is only authorized to order and enforce the compliance of orders that were issued under its jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2); <span class="Italic">Murdock-Doughty v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 74 MSPR 244, 249 (1997). Thus, if the jurisdictional determination in <span class="Italic">Joyce</span> were allowed to stand, the Board could be in the position of ordering and enforcing orders granting attorney fees on the basis of decisions that were not "issued by the Board under the authority granted under paragraph (1) of this subsection," i.e., decisions that were not issued by the Board based on an adjudication of a matter within the jurisdiction of the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even when read alone, the language of section 7701(g) suggests that a finding of jurisdiction is required in order to award attorney fees. The statute allows for an award of attorney fees when warranted in the interest of justice, "including any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency or any case in which the agency's action was clearly without merit." While these two examples are illustrative, and not exhaustive, <span class="Italic">see Allen v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 2 MSPR 420, 433-35 (1980), they do describe situations in which the Board normally would have jurisdiction over the merits of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Farrero v.</span> <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management,</span> 35 MSPR 630, 634 (1987) (in general, the "clearly without merit" criterion focuses on the result of the case before the Board); <span class="Italic">Wren v. Department of the Army,</span> 2 MSPR 1, 2 (1980) (5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b) is not an independent source of Board jurisdiction), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 681 F.2d 867, 871-73 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Under an established principle of statutory construction--<span class="Italic">ejusdem generis</span>--general words are construed to describe only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Caddell v. Department of Justice,</span> 52 MSPR 529, 532 (1992). Thus, a catchall phrase, such as "warranted in the interest of justice," should be read as applying only to categories similar to those specifically enumerated, i.e., other situations in which the Board normally has jurisdiction over the merits of the appeal. Section 7701(g) should, therefore, be read as authorizing attorney fees where a finding of jurisdiction has been made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, OPM asserts that in an attorney fee proceeding the Board cannot rely on the convenience of avoiding, where possible, the necessity of determining whether it has jurisdiction over an appeal where an appellant has been restored to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. OPM asserts that such an argument of convenience was rejected by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Testan,</span> 424 U.S. at 400; where the Court declined to circumvent the specificity requirement for a waiver of the doctrine of sovereign immunity merely because to do so might seem "responsive to a particular conception of enlightened governmental policy." <span class="Italic">See also Commissioner v. Lundy,</span> 516 U.S. 235, 252-53 (1996) ("We are bound by the language of the statute as it is written," and if the plain language might not accord with what one party may think is "'good policy,'" "we are not at liberty 'to rewrite [the] statute because [we] might deem its effects susceptible of improvement.'").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with OPM that the policy set forth in <span class="Italic">Joyce</span> of preserving the Board's analytical resources may not be used to circumvent a statutorily-required jurisdictional finding. We also note that the policy may be less compelling than originally anticipated. In this case, for example, the AJ held several status conferences, afforded the parties an opportunity on remand to submit evidence and argument on the issue of whether the agency could rebut the presumption that fees were warranted in the interest of justice, and issued an initial decision. The full Board has reviewed the AJ's initial decision. These adjudicatory resources could have been expended in a jurisdictional hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further agree with the determination in <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> that the civil rights attorney fees cases cited therein as examples do not support by analogy Board awards of attorney fees in the absence of a determination of jurisdiction. As explained in <span class="Italic">Shaw,</span> 39 MSPR at 592-93, those cases do not hold that attorney fees may be awarded in the absence of a finding of jurisdiction. Rather, they merely find that an award of fees may be granted in the absence of a specific determination that the plaintiff was discriminated against, after jurisdiction has been established<span class="Italic">. See Maher v. Gagne,</span> 448 U.S. 122, 130-31 (1980) (respondent alleged violations of her Fourteenth Amendment due process and equal protection rights, which the District Court and the Court of Appeals held to be sufficiently substantial to support federal jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Young v. Kenley,</span> 641 F.2d 192, 194 (4th Cir. 1981) (indicating that the parties reached a settlement after the plaintiff presented her evidence at trial); <span class="Italic">Wood v. Regan,</span> 622 F. Supp. 399, 402 (E.D. Pa. 1985) ("This Court, then, has jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 7703 (b)(2) to hear plaintiff's case.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Joyce</span> allowed for the implementation of a practical rule that the Board believed would equitably and efficiently resolve a difficult issue that would arise in a limited number of cases. After considering OPM's arguments, however, and upon further reflection, we find that the Board is constrained by statute from implementing a rule such as that set forth in <span class="Italic">Joyce.</span> Thus, we will no longer apply the holding in <span class="Italic">Joyce.</span> Instead, we determine that the holding in <span class="Italic">Shaw,</span> that a substantive jurisdictional finding is required in order for the Board to award attorney fees, is good law and no longer overruled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Joyce</span>, 74 MSPR at 117, the Board noted that it had recently followed the "prevailing party" test set forth in <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby,</span> 506 U.S. 103, 111 (1992), wherein the Supreme Court stated, <span class="Italic">inter alia,</span> that a prevailing party under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 2641, as amended, 42 USC &#x00A7; 1988, is one who obtains an enforceable judgment against the defendant from whom fees are sought, or comparable relief through a consent decree or settlement. <span class="Italic">See Ray v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 64 MSPR 100, 104 (1994) (the civil rights attorney fee statute prevailing party concept is equally applicable in awarding attorney fees under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1)-(2)). The Supreme Court had found that a plaintiff prevails when "actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.<span class="Italic">" Farrar,</span> 506 U.S. at 111.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board held in <span class="Italic">Joyce,</span> 74 MSPR at 117-18, that despite the "apparent" requirement in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> that there be an enforceable judgment, settlement agreement, or consent decree that changes the parties' legal relationship, it would continue to apply the principle set forth in <span class="Italic">Hodnick v. Federal Mediation &#x0026;</span> <span class="Italic">Conciliation Service,</span> 4 MSPR 371, 373-75 (1980), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds,</span> <span class="Italic">Ray,</span> 64 MSPR at 105 n.17, that an appellant may be a prevailing party where, after the filing of an appeal, the agency voluntarily granted the relief sought, the AJ dismissed the appeal as moot, and the relief was causally related to the initiation of the appeal in the absence of a Board final decision. The Board found that the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Hodnick</span> still carried weight because permitting an agency to avoid liability for fees merely by conceding an appeal before a final decision was issued would greatly diminish the purpose of the fee provision, which was to ease the financial burden of bringing meritorious appeals, and would tend to discourage settlements, which would be contrary to public policy favoring the speedy resolution of appeals to the Board. <span class="Italic">Joyce,</span> 74 MSPR at 117-18. The Board noted that its decision to follow <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> "liberalized" the prevailing party test by holding that parties who win nominal damages, or less than a significant portion of the relief they are seeking, may still be prevailing parties. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 118. Thus, the Board found that the appellant was a prevailing party because he obtained, as a result of his initiation of a Board appeal, actual relief on the merits that affected the behavior of the agency toward the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues that in this case there was no enforceable judgment or comparable relief through a consent decree or settlement agreement, as required by <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, and that such an enforceable judgment or comparable relief would "rest on a determination of subject matter jurisdiction." <span id="Page_4565"></span>OPM asserts that the Board improperly disregarded <span class="Italic">Farrar,</span> and that the appellant is not, therefore, a prevailing party. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The principle set forth in <span class="Italic">Hodnick,</span> i.e., if a respondent grants all or part of the relief sought before a judgment or other order is entered, attorney fees may be awarded if that relief was granted as a result of the institution of the action, preexisted <span class="Italic">Farrar,</span> and is generally known as the "catalyst" theory of recovery. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Zinn by Blankenship v. Shalala,</span> 35 F.3d 273, 274 (7th Cir. 1994). In the aftermath of <span class="Italic">Farrar,</span> almost all of the circuits that have considered the issue have found that their versions of the catalyst theory survive <span class="Italic">Farrar. See Payne v. Bd.</span> <span class="Italic">of Educ., Cleveland City Schools,</span> 88 F.3d 392, 397 (6th Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Marbley v.</span> <span class="Italic">Bane,</span> 57 F.3d 224, 234 (2d Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Kilgour v. City of Pasadena,</span> 53 F.3d 1007, 1010 (9th Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Zinn by Blankenship,</span> 35 F.3d at 275-76 (the Third, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits still apply the catalyst theory). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">S-1 and S-2 v. State Bd. of Educ. of N. Carolina,</span> 21 F.3d 49 (4th Cir. 1994) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>) (holding in a 7-6 decision that the catalyst theory is no longer available post-<span class="Italic">Farrar</span>). These courts have found that <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> addressed whether a plaintiff who received a jury verdict resulting in a final judgment of nominal damages could be considered a prevailing party, that the catalyst theory was not at issue in <span class="Italic">Farrar,</span> and that the Supreme Court would not abolish a rule employed by nearly every circuit and previously recognized by the Court itself as settled law, without expressly indicating that it was doing so. <span class="Italic">See Marbley,</span> 57 F.3d at 234; <span class="Italic">Zinn by</span> <span class="Italic">Blankenship,</span> 35 F.3d at 275-76; <span class="Italic">see also S-1 By and Through P-1 v. State Bd. of</span> <span class="Italic">Educ. of N.

In the absence of a decision by the Federal Circuit addressing this particular issue, we agree with the above reasoning, which is consistent with our reasoning in <span class="Italic">Hodnick and Joyce.</span> Therefore, we affirm our holding in <span class="Italic">Joyce</span> that the appellant is a prevailing party.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Joyce</span>, 74 MSPR at 118, the Board held that "where the agency has unilaterally rescinded its action, i.e., returned the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, and the appellant has set forth a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of jurisdiction and has incurred attorney fees, we find that a rebuttable presumption is established that an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice." Citing <span class="Italic">Allen,</span> the Board noted that it has "substantial discretion" in determining when an attorney fee award is warranted, and that the five circumstances "considered to reflect 'the interest of justice'" are not exhaustive, but illustrative. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM asserts that by creating a rebuttable presumption that attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice, the Board has improperly reversed the burden of proof by effectively requiring the agency to prove that fees are not warranted in the interest of justice, and has placed an appellant who has not won on the merits in a better position than an appellant who has proven his case on the merits and obtained a complete reversal of the agency's action. OPM claims that the establishment of a rebuttable presumption requires a nexus between the facts proven and the facts presumed therefrom, and that here, the presumed facts--that attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice because the agency's action was a prohibited personnel practice, wholly unfounded, a gross procedural error, in bad faith, or brought to harass or exert improper pressure on an appellant who is substantially innocent of charges--cannot be said to more likely than not flow from the proven facts--the agency's rescission of its action and the appellant's incursion of attorney fees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. OPM contends that the rebuttable presumption set forth in <span class="Italic">Joyce</span> is not an additional <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor akin to the others because it "contains no substantive content," and it is impossible to determine precisely what the agency must rebut in order to establish that an attorney fee award was not in the interest of justice. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As OPM points out, a presumption may be established if there is a sound, rational connection between the proven and inferred facts. <span class="Italic">See NLRB v. Baptist</span> <span class="Italic">Hosp., Inc.,</span> 442 U.S. 773, 787 (1979). Thus, a presumption normally arises where "proof of one fact renders the existence of another fact so probable that it is sensible and timesaving to assume the truth of [the inferred] fact...until the adversary disproves it." <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc.,</span> 494 U.S. 775, 788-89 (1990). The Board and the Federal Circuit have utilized rebuttable presumptions in a variety of cases. <span class="Italic">See Bruner v. Office of Personnel</span> <span class="Italic">Management,</span> 996 F.2d 290, 293-94 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (an agency's "action in separating an employee for disablement produces a presumption of disability that serves to shift to the government the burden of production."); <span class="Italic">Reynolds v. Department of Justice,</span> 63 MSPR 189, 193 (1994) (evidence that a letter was sealed, properly addressed, and deposited in the U.S. Mail with postage prepaid gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that the letter reached the addressee in due course of the mails); <span class="Italic">Ceja v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 34 MSPR 399, 404 (1987) (an hourly rate set forth in a fee agreement creates a rebuttable presumption that that amount represents the maximum reasonable fee which may be awarded); <span class="Italic">Kruger v. Department of Justice,</span> 32 MSPR 71, 74 (1987) (a rebuttable presumption of nexus in an adverse action appeal may arise in "certain egregious circumstances" based on the nature and gravity of the misconduct).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In clarification of our decision in <span class="Italic">Joyce,</span> we find that there is a sound, rational connection between the proven facts that the agency canceled its action, returned the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, and paid him back pay, and the inferred fact that the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits when it brought the proceeding. As the Federal Circuit found in <span class="Italic">Dunn v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 98 F.3d 1308, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 1996), an award of attorney fees under the "knew or should have known" <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category may be warranted where the agency made its original judgment "negligently or in disregard of relevant facts." As the appellant points out, "a case where the agency gave up and rescinded its action is very likely to be one where the underlying action was so ill conceived as to warrant an award of fees." We note in this regard that in the Board's experience a majority of agency actions that are initially adjudicated on the merits are affirmed. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> 1997 Annual Report at 16 (68% affirmed); 1996 Annual Report at 17 (77% affirmed); 1995 Annual Report at 18 (62% affirmed). Thus, when an agency takes the relatively unusual step of voluntarily rescinding its action, it is probably because it made its original judgment "negligently or in disregard of relevant facts." This presumption is rebuttable. Although the appellant always bears the ultimate burden of proving his entitlement to attorney fees, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Stewart v. Office of</span> <span class="Italic">Personnel Management,</span> 70 MSPR 544, 548 (1996), the burden of production shifts to the agency once the requirements for the presumption have been met. <span class="Italic">Cf. Bruner,</span> 996 F.2d at 294. Thus, our holding in <span class="Italic">Joyce</span> is clarified: Where the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal, the agency has unilaterally rescinded its action, i.e., returned the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, and the appellant has incurred attorney fees, there is a rebuttable presumption that fees are warranted in the interest of justice under the "knew or should have known" <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our holding that a substantive jurisdictional finding is required in order for the Board to award attorney fees does not mean that, when an appeal of an alleged constructive removal or suspension is mooted by agency action, a motion for fees will in every case require the Board to hold a jurisdictional hearing. An appellant is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing if he has made a nonfrivolous allegation of facts that could establish the Board's jurisdiction, i.e., that his resignation was coerced or that the agency forced him to take leave. <span class="Italic">See Braun v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs</span>, 50 F.3d 1005, 1008 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Waldau v. Merit Systems</span> <span class="Italic">Protection Board,</span> 19 F.3d 1395, 1397 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">see also Dumas v. Merit</span> <span class="Italic">Systems Protection Board,</span> 789 F.2d 892, 893-94 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (if the alleged facts are sufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of involuntariness, the appellant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing). Thus, when such a nonfrivolous allegation is made, the Board cannot conclude that it <span class="Italic">lacks</span> jurisdiction without giving the appellant an opportunity for a hearing. Because, however, the agency does not have a statutory right to a hearing, <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 51 MSPR 218, 220-21 (1991), the Board may, in appropriate cases; find jurisdiction over a constructive adverse action on the basis of the documentary record. This would occur when the agency has failed to rebut the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of jurisdiction, despite having had the opportunity to do so. By contrast, if the existence of jurisdiction requires additional evidence to resolve factual issues raised by the parties, a hearing should be held.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant alleged in his petition for appeal that he was forced to stay away from the workplace because the agency stopped providing him assistance at work that he needed to perform because of his disability, i.e., emptying his urine leg bag, pouring liquids for him to drink, and moving him about the building. In support of this claim, the appellant submitted agency memoranda indicating that the agency was discontinuing previous help and listing the tasks, including the above, that he would be required to perform without agency assistance. In his response to the acknowledgment order, the appellant stressed the medical necessity of his consuming liquids during the day, with a supporting affidavit from his physician, as well as the minimal nature of the support required.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency, in its response to the order, contended that the appellant was responsible for his absence from work because he failed to purchase a pump that would make agency assistance with his leg bag unnecessary, refused offers to help him obtain an electric wheel chair, and could drink from a water fountain that was wheel chair accessible. The agency asserted that the assistance formerly provided the appellant was burdensome to the agency and unpleasant to a decreasing number of volunteers, and was dangerous because it exposed them to potential contact with the appellant's bodily fluids and to personal liability if the appellant were injured being helped in and out of his van. The agency disputed the minimal nature of helping the appellant to drink on the ground that mixing beverages and placing pills in his mouth was required, and it contended that the appellant had refused its offer to allow him to work at home as an accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to a subsequent show-cause order on the jurisdictional issue, the appellant referred to the evidence he had previously provided. The agency made no additional argument on the jurisdictional issue, but submitted material that it had provided to the appellant in discovery, such as documents relating to its efforts to accommodate him and its <span id="Page_4566"></span>reasons for discontinuing some forms of assistance. In a second response, the appellant submitted two agency memoranda obtained in discovery that reflect one official's opinion that the agency was obligated to require employees to assist the appellant because the Federal Personnel Manual mentioned handling urine bags and transferring from wheel chair to other transport as examples of personal assistance that they may be required to provide. In that submission, the appellant's counsel also contended that the appellant could not drink from the water fountain referred to by the agency because he could not use the handle or lean over to drink out of it. The agency made no further response to the show-cause order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's submissions are sufficient to constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of enforced leave entitling him to a jurisdictional hearing. Indeed, the AJ found that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction in this appeal, and the Board discerned no error in that finding. <span class="Italic">Joyce,</span> 74 MSPR at 117. Thus, when the agency unilaterally rescinded its action in this appeal, the appellant had a right to a hearing on his constructive suspension claim. The undeveloped record on jurisdiction in this attorney fee proceeding is not attributable to any voluntary action by the appellant. Once the agency rescinded its action, the appellant was powerless to force a jurisdictional hearing. The appellant requested a hearing in connection with his motion for attorney fees to address, among other things, "factual issues necessary to resolve any jurisdictional issue." The AJ, however, decided the jurisdictional issue in the attorney fee proceeding based on the written record as it existed at the time the agency rescinded its action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the agency has introduced sufficient rebuttal evidence to require that a hearing be held. The agency's submissions appear to create fact questions concerning the feasibility or reasonableness of a leg pump, an electric wheel chair, and telecommuting as alternative forms of accommodation. The agency's contention that the formerly provided accommodations are too burdensome and dangerous to continue may be open to question, but the factual issues involved are ones that should be decided after a hearing. Whether the agency rebutted the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case based on its refusal to provide him with assistance in drinking liquids is a closer question. Nevertheless, finding jurisdiction on this basis would not be justifiable because the appellant's need for assistance in drinking cannot be considered in isolation from other disputed issues bearing on whether his absence from work was involuntary. In particular, the question of whether the appellant reasonably refused the agency's offer of permission to work at home, if resolved against him, would seem to undercut an involuntariness claim relying on denial of access to liquids at the work site.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, on this record the Board cannot conclude that the accommodations the appellant sought would not place an undue burden on the agency. Put differently, on this record the Board cannot conclude that the appellant had a right under the Rehabilitation Act to these accommodations. If he did not have such a right, then it appears that modification or withdrawal of these accommodations would not have been a constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">See Schultz v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 78 MSPR 159, 163 (1998) (an employee's absence due to a medical condition was a constructive suspension because the agency was bound by the Rehabilitation Act to accommodate his medical condition).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, therefore, is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing in this attorney fee proceeding. <span class="Italic">See Shaw,</span> 39 MSPR at 594-95 (in finding that the appellant was entitled to a jurisdictional hearing within the context of an attorney fee proceeding, the Board noted that although a determination of whether fees are warranted on the basis that the agency's action was without merit should be based on the record established on the merits, without holding a hearing in cases settled prior to a determination of jurisdiction, the "merits" issues have not been examined); <span class="Italic">see also, e.g., Shu v. Veterans Administration,</span> 44 MSPR 423, 426-27 (1990) (remanding for a jurisdictional hearing in an attorney fee proceeding where the underlying appeal was settled). The Board has long held that it may question its own jurisdiction at any time. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ellis v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 77 MSPR 675, 677 (1998); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 54 MSPR 415, 419 (1992); <span class="Italic">Shaw,</span> 39 MSPR at 588 n.1, 592 (citing <span class="Italic">Antosh v.</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Election Commission,</span> 664 F. Supp. 5 (D.D.C. 1987), for the principle that a defendant is not foreclosed from challenging subject matter jurisdiction in a collateral proceeding, i.e., under the Equal Access to Justice Act, although he failed to do so during the pendency of the underlying suit).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, although we agree with the Chairman's observation in his dissent that it would be more efficient for the Board to take jurisdiction based on the appellant's allegations, we do not interpret the authorities discussed above, 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1204 &#x0026; 7701, as permitting the Board to disregard the agency's rebuttal to the appellant's allegations. If the agency had rescinded its actions without attempting to rebut the appellant's allegations then there would be no need for a hearing, but in light of the agency's opposition to the appellant's pleadings there is some doubt about whether the Board has the power to do anything other than dismiss the case. <span class="Italic">Cf. Johns-Manville Corp. v. United States,</span> 893 F.2d 324, 327 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (the trial court erred in awarding costs to the defendant after concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction; regardless of whether the lack of jurisdiction was apparent only when matters outside the pleadings were considered, if the court lacks jurisdiction "it has no power to do anything but strike the case from its docket"). In this connection, notwithstanding the Chairman's belief that it is not in the best interests of the parties to go to a jurisdictional hearing, the agency evidently believes that it is better off fighting the appellant's motion for attorney fees than conceding jurisdiction; it is not for the Board to decide that the agency should pay the appellant's attorney fees to save the agency the cost of a hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Joyce II</span> was applied to require a jurisdictional hearing on a fee motion arising from an appeal of an action canceled by the agency, <span class="Italic">Miller v. VA</span>, 84 MSPR 692, 695-98 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-11 (2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective January 18, 1998, the agency reduced the appellant from the GS-14 position of Health System Specialist to the same position at the GS-13 level with retained pay through January 18, 2000. The appellant petitioned for appeal, alleging that the agency's action was a demotion within the Board's appellate jurisdiction. In response to the appeal, the agency moved to dismiss it, alleging that the appellant's reduction in grade resulted from a reclassification and was voluntary, and thus outside the Board's jurisdiction. The administrative judge scheduled a jurisdictional hearing. During the hearing, the agency unilaterally rescinded the appellant's reduction in grade, and retroactively restored him to his former GS-14 position. The administrative judge thereafter dismissed the appeal as moot.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequent to the administrative judge's dismissal of the appeal, the appellant filed a motion for an award of attorney fees. The administrative judge found, relying on <span class="Italic">Joyce v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 74 MSPR 112, 118 (1997) (<span class="Italic">Joyce I</span>), that under the circumstances of this case the Board had the authority to award attorney fees without first making a finding of jurisdiction. The administrative judge also found that the appellant was the prevailing party, that he had incurred fees, that the agency had failed to rebut the presumption arising in cases such as this that fees were warranted in the interest of justice, and that some, but not all, of the fees claimed by the appellant were reasonable. The administrative judge awarded the appellant fees and costs in the total amount of $30,003.01.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also asserted that fees are not warranted in the interest of justice because it would have prevailed on the jurisdictional issue. Subsequent to the issuance of the initial decision, the Board decided <span class="Italic">Joyce v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 83 MSPR 666 (1999) (<span class="Italic">Joyce II</span>), which overruled <span class="Italic">Joyce I</span> with respect to the Board's obligation to make a jurisdictional finding to establish authority to grant attorney fees. Thus, where an agency unilaterally rescinds its action by returning an appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, a substantive jurisdictional finding is required in order to decide a motion for attorney fees. <span class="Italic">Joyce II</span>, 83 MSPR &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-19, <span class="Italic">overruling Joyce I</span>, 74 MSPR 112. If, in such an appeal, prior to rescission, the agency did not rebut the appellant's nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction, the appellant's resulting <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction allows the Board to find jurisdiction over a constructive adverse action on the basis of the documentary record, and to decide the motion for fees. <span class="Italic">Joyce II</span>, 83 MSPR &#x00B6; 28. However, if the documentary record does not allow a finding of jurisdiction because the agency presented evidence to rebut the appellant's nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction, the Board will remand the proceeding for a jurisdictional hearing and a finding on whether the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal before a ruling on a motion for attorney fees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 28-36. If the Board finds, based on the jurisdictional hearing or on the documentary record, that it has jurisdiction over an appeal where the agency has unilaterally rescinded its action, and the appellant is a prevailing party and has incurred fees, there is a rebuttable presumption that fees are warranted in the interest of justice under the "knew or should have known" category, and that the appellant's motion for fees should be granted. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24-27. <span class="Italic">See generally Allen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 2 MSPR 420, 434-35 (1980) (an attorney fee award by the Board may be warranted in the interest of justice when, e.g.: (1) The agency engaged in a prohibited personnel practice; (2) the agency action was clearly without merit or wholly unfounded, or the employee was substantially innocent of the charges; (3) the agency initiated the action in bad faith; (4) the agency committed a gross procedural error; or (5) the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, as noted above, effective January 18, 1998, the agency reduced the appellant from the GS-14 to the GS-13 position of Health System Specialist with retained grade through January 18, 2000. The appellant alleged that the agency's action, as verified by the SF-50s effecting his reduction in grade, constituted a demotion within the Board's jurisdiction. One SF-50, which does not indicate a demotion, describes the action as a reassignment under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 335.102.* Another SF-50, which effects the <span id="Page_4567"></span>reduction in grade from GS-14 to GS-13, describes the action as a position change under 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 335.102 and 536.103(b). A subsequent SF-50, which changed the appellant's position from Health System Specialist to Program Analyst also relies on 5 CFR &#x00A7; 335.102 as authority. The appellant argued that he made a nonfrivolous allegation that he was subjected to a constructive adverse action which abolished his GM-0671-14 Health System Specialist position and demoted him to the lower grade GS-0343-13 Program Analyst position in a different competitive level with different duties and functions. We find that the evidence relied on by the appellant establishes a nonfrivolous allegation that the appellant's change to a lower grade was a demotion within the Board's jurisdiction. He would have been entitled to a hearing on his jurisdictional claim had the agency not rescinded the action. Therefore, in light of the agency's current challenge to the Board's jurisdiction, the proceeding must be remanded for a hearing on the appellant's jurisdictional claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;Section 335.102, 5 CFR, relates to an agency's authority to promote, demote, or reassign.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency submitted a number of responses to the appellant's petition for appeal, ultimately asserting that the change to a lower grade was a result of an oral settlement agreement between the agency and the appellant, and thus was voluntary. In support of its assertion, the agency proffered the testimonial evidence of four witnesses who it represented would state under oath that the appellant and the agency negotiated and entered into such an oral settlement agreement. We find that the agency's proffered testimonial evidence of an oral settlement agreement is sufficient rebuttal evidence to disallow the Board from finding jurisdiction based on the written record; however, the appellant's nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction necessitates remand for a jurisdictional hearing and a finding on whether the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal before a ruling on a motion for attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If there is a settlement, the best practice is to address fee entitlement and amounts in the settlement.</p>
