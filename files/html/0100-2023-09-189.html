<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-186"><span class="space">a.</span> Consolidation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">"An administrative agency's docket management is a matter that is within [the Board's] discretion." <span class="Italic">Noa v. FAA</span>, 15 MSPR 126, 131 (1983). 5 USC 7701(f) provides the Board the authority to consolidate or join appeals. The rule on consolidation (and joinder) is 5 CFR 1201.36 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Explanation</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Consolidation occurs when the appeals of two or more parties are united for consideration because they contain identical or similar issues. For example, individual appeals rising from a single reduction in force might be consolidated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Joinder occurs when one person has filed two or more appeals and they are united for consideration. For example, a judge might <span id="Page_1167"></span>join an appeal challenging a 30-day suspension with a pending appeal challenging a subsequent removal if the same appellant filed both appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Action by judge</span>. A judge may consolidate or join cases on his or her own motion or on the motion of a party if doing so would:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Expedite processing of the cases; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Not adversely affect the interests of the parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Any objection to a motion for consolidation or joinder must be filed within 10 days of the date of service of the motion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Guidance on consolidation is provided by the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span>, Chapter 3:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">CONSOLIDATION AND JOINDER</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> generally 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.36.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Concurrent Processing</span>. Once appeals are consolidated or joined, they are processed concurrently. Generally, only one hearing is held. As appropriate, one or more decisions may be issued in a consolidated appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">120-day Deadline</span>. For case-tracking purposes, the 120-day deadline is computed from the receipt date of whichever appeal was received last by the RO.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Multi-Region Consolidated Appeals</span>. When the CAJ identifies an appeal as part of a potential multi-region consolidation, he or she must immediately notify ORO. The CAJ must provide information concerning the approximate number of appellants in the consolidation, the agency's identity, and the name(s) of the appellants' representative(s). The Board or its designee may rule on a nationwide consolidation. <span class="Italic">See</span> section 4d., below, for more on such consolidations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">e.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Mass Appeals (RIFs or Furloughs)</span>. In addition to the organizational change noted in subsection c, above, the following procedures may be used to adjudicate appeals from a large-scale agency action such as an extensive reduction in force (RIF) or furlough. The ROs may modify these procedures when warranted. In fact, the more than 33,000 furlough appeals received in 2013 were processed using new and innovative methods, as well as these tried and true methods.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1) <span class="Italic">Group Appeals</span>. Group the appeals by categories for which acknowledgment orders might be tailored, e.g.:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(a)&#x2003;Appeals having common substantive issues, such as</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">i.&#x2003;(e.g., RIF appeals) (1) the <span class="Italic">bona fides</span> of the RIF; (2) competitive area, competitive level, performance, or subgroup determinations; (3) assignment rights to specific positions; and (4) transfer of function issues;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">ii.&#x2003;(e.g., furlough appeals) (1) the <span class="Italic">bona fides</span> of the furlough; (2) same official duty station and proposing and deciding officials; (3) common agency file to be used for all appellants.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(b)&#x2003;Appeals having common jurisdiction or timeliness issues;</p>

<p class="Block-Quote4">(d)&#x2003;Appeals by <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellants.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">While whether the appellant requested a hearing generally had been considered an appropriate basis for consolidation, the furlough appeals taught that because of the likelihood of a party changing his mind after checking the box on the appeal form saying that he wants a hearing, the utility of that basis may be limited.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Issue Acknowledgment Orders Appropriate to the Consolidation</span>. The CAJ or designee may modify the standard acknowledgment orders to address changes in the processing of mass appeals. Because of the special circumstances presented by group appeals, normal time limits for issuance of acknowledgment orders may be modified by the CAJ (or designee). Service requirements may be altered to eliminate service on represented appellants. In processing the 2013 furlough appeals, ORO developed standard acknowledgment orders and other documents specifically tailored to the situation. Should any similar circumstances develop in the future, it may be appropriate to tailor a new acknowledgment and/or other order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Issue an Order of Consolidation</span>. After receiving the agency files, ROs or, if appropriate, ROs in conjunction with ORO, must make decisions regarding appropriate consolidations as soon as practicable. Prehearing conferences may be used to determine which appeals should be consolidated. When the appropriate consolidations have been decided, the AJ should issue the order of consolidation. While the size and make-up of a consolidation may be changed later during the processing of the appeals, it is preferable to make the effort to properly consolidate cases based on the information presently available at the earliest point when such a determination is possible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(4)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Develop and Maintain Appeal Files</span>. The AJ may accept submissions only from a designated representative or a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant. PII concerning an individual appellant must go only in that appellant's individual file; information relevant to the entire consolidation goes into the consolidated dummy file. If it is discovered that, either through a party's pleading or an AJ's Order, PII of an appellant was shared with any other appellant, action must be taken immediately to remove the PII from the record and OCB must be notified so that the extent of the exposure may be determined and the appropriate notice sent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(5)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Conduct Prehearing Conferences</span>. The AJ may require that some or all prehearing conferences be conducted formally and be recorded. The AJ also may require that prehearing conferences be conducted by video conference or telephone.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(6)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Using Bifurcated Hearings</span>. Bifurcated hearings may be held on common issues. A panel of AJs may sit to hear the evidence regarding the common issues(s), or the CAJ/ORO may assign one AJ to hear and decide the common issues. After there is a final decision regarding the common issues, the remaining issues of the individual cases or consolidations would be heard.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Consolidation involves combination in one appeal of appeals of more than one appellant. Several appeals of different individuals may be consolidated if the issues are similar and interrelated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Barrett v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 57 MSPR 635, 636 n.1 (1993). The Board may consolidate appeals even without the consent of the parties when the Board believes that consolidation could result in appeals being processed more expeditiously and without adverse effect upon any party. <span class="Italic">Trick v. FAA</span>, 8 MSPR 608, 610 (1981) (relying on 5 USC 7701(f)). Without a showing of prejudice, the AJ's decision not to consolidate will not be reversed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 17 MSPR 584, 586 (1983) (declining to consolidate a case because the appellant's representative objected to consolidation). Consolidation involves an element of administrative discretion. <span class="italic">See</span> <span class="italic">Lentz v. Dept. of Interior</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP) ("Here, in contrast, Mr. Lentz brought separate appeals in the first place. And not only did he not ask the Board for consolidation of the present appeal with those remanded in 2017 (and the two additional appeals with which they were later consolidated), but he has not shown prejudice that would justify overriding the Board's exercise of its 'broad discretion to control its own docket' and 'substitut[ing] our judgment for that of the [B]oard in this regard.' <span class="italic">Olivares v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 17 F.3d 386, 388 (Fed. Cir. 1994)."); <span class="italic">Lentz v. Dept. of Interior</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed.

Mr. Lentz identifies no reason that, even without consolidation, he could not introduce here all relevant evidence, including evidence that might also appear in his other Board appeals.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">According to <span class="Italic">Former CSA Employees v. DHHS</span>, 9 MSPR 299, 301 (1981), the Board may consolidate appeals without the parties' consent if the Board believes consolidation could result in the more expeditious processing of appeals, without adversely affecting any party. Factors considered by an AJ concerning consolidation are: the appeals all involve the same legal questions and operative facts; the same counsel represents all the appellants; no apparent conflict of interest exists between the appellants; the witnesses as to each appellant's case are substantially the same; and the consolidation results in an significant reduction of time and cost for the parties concerned. That some appellants raise issues not common to all the other appellants does not bar the consolidation. Appeals may be consolidated despite objections of the parties to an appeal. Although consolidation should not be ordered if the parties would be prejudiced, without a showing that testimony or proof would have differed without consolidation, no prejudice is found. <span class="Italic">Noa v. FAA</span>, 15 MSPR 126, 131-32 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hoback v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 86 MSPR 425, 427 n.1 (2000) ("We consolidate these [IRA]appeals because they involve the same agency, the same representatives, and similar issues, and because to do so will result in more expeditious processing and no party will be adversely affected by the consolidation."); <span class="Italic">Tekautz v.

Dept. of Transp.</span>, 15 MSPR 624, 626 (1983) (AJs can address individual claims as well as common issues of fact and law).<span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Trick v. FAA</span>, 8 MSPR 608, 611-12 (1981), required AJs to consider several factors bearing on the desirability of consolidation of appeals from termination of air traffic controllers fired for striking:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">National Issues</span>. Identification of all common issues of fact and law which may be national in scope, and which therefore may appropriately be the subject of discovery and determination on a national consolidated basis;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">National Discovery</span>. The nature and extent of anticipated discovery requests in any such consolidated proceeding;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">National Witnesses</span>. The identification, by name and title, of persons whose testimony would probably be requested with respect to matters to be determined in any such consolidated proceeding;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Representation</span>. The extent to which appellants, or groups of appellants, can agree or have agreed upon designation of common or lead counsel for purposes of (a) serving and receiving service of pleadings and documents, and/or (b) representation with respect to any such consolidated proceeding;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Nonstrike-Related Dispositive Issues</span>. Identification by name (and MSPB docket number if assigned) of all interested appellants raising potentially dispositive individual defenses which are unrelated to the alleged strike, such as having been on approved leave at the time in issue, specifying the nature of such defense and whether, in the event such defense is unsuccessful, issues common to other appellants would then be relevant to such appellant's case;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">6.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Prejudicial Effects</span>. Identification by name (and MSPB docket number if assigned) of any interested party who believes that his, her or its rights would be prejudiced or interests adversely affected by any such consolidation, specifying the nature, extent and reasons for such prejudice and supporting by affidavit any facts relied upon to show such prejudice or adverse effect.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Trick v. FAA</span>, 9 MSPR 291, 294-97 (1981), declined to nationally adjudicate approximately 11,000 appeals by separated air traffic controllers. Regional consolidation was deemed a better approach:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The responses to the motion and the Board's Order make it abundantly clear that there are not, at this time, discernible common issues of fact or law, the resolution of which would facilitate the adjudication of individual appeals. No discovery has been completed by any parties and, indeed, the agency has not yet filed its answer and supporting documents on many appeals. The movant himself is either unable or unwilling to amplify on the general description of common issues contained in his motion which he believes compel national consolidation. Movant requests the Board to consolidate for the purpose of identifying common issues. However, identification of common issues is ordinarily a prerequisite to consolidation. <span class="Italic">Kershaw v. Sterling Drug, Inc.</span>, 415 F.2d 1009, 1012 (5th Cir. 1969).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming the existence of common issues, such common issues alone are not enough in the absence of other factors which would promote convenience and economy in administration<span class="Italic">. Prudential Insurance Co. of America v. Marine National Exchange Bank</span>, 55 F.R.D. 436 (E.D. Wis. 1972); <span class="Italic">Schacht v. Javits</span>, 53 F.R.D. 321 (S.D.N.Y. 1971); <span class="Italic">Journapak Corp. v. Bair</span>, 27 F.R.D. 509 (S.D.N.Y. 1961).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The factors present here belie such convenience and economy. The appeals are presently at varying stages within the Board's eleven regional offices. Many of the parties will undoubtedly be unable adequately to present their views before the presiding official until after receipt of the complete appeal file compiled by the agency. In other cases, the appellants are now prepared to proceed to hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, although the appellants' terminations were based on identical charges, the facts and theories upon which they rely in contesting the agency's actions are diverse and, in many instances, unique to their particular circumstances. The Board's review of the various approaches to the appeals indicates that no appreciable savings of time would be gained by consolidating the appeals for limited purposes at the national level. No resolution of appeals could result from a nationally consolidated proceeding addressing questions regarding alleged procedural errors by the agency which were cited by some appellants as examples of common issues. The statutory harmful error test requires the Board to give individual consideration to each appellant's claim of harm. Similarly, the issue as to whether the appellants willfully participated in an unlawful strike may not be determined except on the basis of the intent manifested by the individual appellants. Thus, appellants who successfully demonstrate that their absence from work at the time of the alleged strike resulted from duress, or a good faith belief that they were on approved leave, might be found not to have participated in the alleged unlawful strike.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also recognizes that a consolidated proceeding may cause considerable inconvenience and expense to parties living several hundreds of miles from the Board's headquarters in Washington, D.C. Similarly, the administrative burdens on the Board to insure the rights of all parties would be formidable. Management of a consolidation of almost 11,000 appeals would be additionally complicated by virtue of the many parties appearing <span class="Italic">pro se</span> and the apparent animosity which exists between parties who have identified themselves with PATCO and those who have disclaimed any sharing of interests or objectives with PATCO.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The movant bears the burden of persuading the Board that common questions of fact and law exist, that consolidation would expedite resolution of those common questions, and that it is in the best interests of the parties. <span class="Italic">Prudential Insurance, supra</span>, 55 F.R.D. 436, 437; <span class="Italic">Schacht, supra</span>, 53 F.R.D. 321, 324-325. In the instant case neither the movant nor those supporting the motion have provided the Board with information adequate to conclude that those criteria have been satisfied. By contrast, the potential for delay, administrative inconvenience and confusion militate strongly against a national consolidation at this stage of the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board cannot justify national consolidation on the basis of the data before us at this time, the Board recognizes consolidation may be warranted at the regional offices where there is substantial commonality of counsel, work site, witnesses, and/or legal defenses. Presiding officials in the regional offices are in a posture to address individual claims as well as common issues of fact and law. We can, of course, consider for interlocutory appeal or other precedential decision, any appropriate issues which may arise in the course of the regional proceedings. Nor do we hereby preclude consideration of subsequent motions for national consolidation based on circumstances arising hereafter in these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also recognizes that multitudinous motions for discovery to be served on persons at the national level may require careful consideration by the Board's officials to avoid burdensome demands on those persons from whom discovery is sought. In this regard, it is anticipated that the Board's regional offices will coordinate their activities and endeavor to proceed at approximately the same pace. Accordingly, the regional offices will, in the near future, issue orders setting time limits in which to file motions for discovery. In accordance with the Board's procedures, motions for depositions, subpoenas, or interrogatories will be referred to one of the Board's administrative law judges who will be able to coordinate scheduling and ensure against undue burdens.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In massive consolidations the Board may require that certain matters be addressed by interested parties, e.g., national discovery and witnesses, designation of lead counsel, identification of dispositive issues within groups of appeals, and the use of regional or local subconsolidations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Former CSA Employees v. DHHS</span>, 9 MSPR 299, 303 (1981); <span class="Italic">Trick v. FAA</span>, 8 MSPR 608, 612 (1981). The AJ may consolidate cases for a given purpose, e.g., a hearing, and then issue separate initial decisions. Each appellant must then file a timely PFR as to each decision that he wishes to challenge. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Clark v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 634, 638 n.3 (1992). Appellants are responsible for the progress of their individual appeals when those appeals are consolidated. If without good cause an appellant in a consolidated case fails to attend to his or her case by following an AJ's prehearing orders and by failing to participate in directed conferences, the AJ properly dismisses the appeal for failure to prosecute. <span class="Italic">Leseman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 122 MSPR 139, 2015 MSPB 5 (2015) (consolidated furlough appeals).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are arguments for and against consolidation. From the appellants' viewpoint, if there are a number of lawyers working on common issues in consolidated cases, responsibility can be apportioned among them for discovery, witness preparation, investigation, research, and briefing. A certain economy of effort can be achieved. A disadvantage of consolidation can be the unified discovery. If individual appellants' lawyers conduct independent investigations, they might turn up information that otherwise would have gone undiscovered. From the perspective of appellants, a disadvantage of consolidation is that the hearings can be long, as many individuals testify about similar events. A lawyer who sits through a long consolidated hearing will likely recover through a fee petition, if anything, a fee commensurate with only his portion of the work in the appeal--a fee that may not cover the time spent listening to others testify about matters and issues of little consequence to his client.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For the agency, consolidation is a timesaver. Consolidation permits one hearing rather than many and provides the luxury of unified briefing. Consolidation also avoids inconsistent results by different AJs who consider appeals raising similar or related issues by more than one appellant--a situation that is poorly treated by the Board--and a situation that may lead to conflicting remedial orders from AJs to agencies and a situation that is likely to result in PFRs by those who lost their case with one AJ and would arguably have prevailed with another AJ who favorably reviewed a coworker's case with similar if not identical facts.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If consolidation is undesirable, the appellant must object. If an appellant joins <span id="Page_1169"></span>a request for consolidation, he waives any objection that may have to that procedure. <span class="Italic">Moylan v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 735 F.2d 524 (Fed. Cir. 1984). He cannot await the result and then object after the loss of his case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rockwell v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 789 F.2d 908 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Consolidation was challenged in <span class="Italic">Dorrance v. Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 735 F.2d 516 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Dorrance argued that the consolidation of his case with 63 other appeals denied his right to a fair hearing by rendering the hearing process a sham; however, Dorrance did not object to the consolidation until after the Board procedures were finished. He made no attempt to introduce evidence in his own defense. The court discerned no error. The consolidated appeals involved the same issues and facts, and the same counsel represented all of the appellants. Because demonstration of prejudice through consolidation is a seemingly impossible task, one should make the best of the situation rather than diverting enormous resources to an effort to challenge the consolidation once it is approved. [Refer to consolidation in Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-10-063.html#sec3-63">Conduct of Hearing; Responsibilities of Judge</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an AJ applies the proper criteria in consolidating an appeal under 5 USC 7701(f), to demonstrate reversible error an appellant must demonstrate the outcome of his case would differ were his appeal separately heard. <span class="Italic">Wright v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 19 MSPR 417, 419 (1984); <span class="Italic">Beckum v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 15 MSPR 751, 755 (1983) ("Appellant has failed to show that the ruling would have differed had his appeal been heard separately rather than simultaneously with other appeals."); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Apple v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 16 MSPR 280, 288 (1983) (also noting that the appellant must object at the regional level to the consolidation if he is to preserve the objection in his PFR). Lacking a showing of prejudice, consolidation will not be a basis for reversal of an initial decision. <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 15 MSPR 92, 108 (1983). Of claimed prejudice through a furlough consolidation, <span class="Italic">IRS Miller Consolidation v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, DA-0752-13-4549-I-2 (NP 11/3/2014), determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellants did not file a timely objection to the consolidation order. In any event, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.36(b), an administrative judge may consolidate cases if doing so would expedite processing of the cases and not adversely affect the interests of the parties. The administrative judge's orders required the parties to file documents containing personally-identifiable information in the appellants' personal docket numbers, not the "fixed lead" consolidation case. The appellants have not otherwise shown that their interests were adversely affected by the consolidation. <span class="Italic">See Apple v. Department of Transportation</span>, 16 M.S.P.R. 280, 289 (1983) (finding no error in consolidating appeals when the appellants' cases were treated individually at the hearing, testimony was taken, and there was an opportunity for cross-examination of the agency's witnesses when they testified as to each appellant); <span class="Italic">Noa v. Department of Transportation</span>, 15 M.S.P.R. 126, 132 (1983) (the fact that some of the appellants raised issues that were not common to all other appellants is not sufficient to bar the act of consolidation), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Moylan v. Department of Transportation</span>, 735 F.2d 524 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If two appellants jointly petition for review of separately issued initial decisions, their PFR will be treated as a motion for consolidation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bustos v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 58 MSPR 608 (1993) (Table); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Bivens v. TVA</span>, 8 MSPR 458, 460 (1981) (consolidating appeals at the PFR level when the appeals arose from the same facts, a single hearing was held for both appellants, and the AJ issued substantially identical initial decisions).</p>
