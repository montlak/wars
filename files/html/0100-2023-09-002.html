<h3 class="h3" id="sec1-3"><span class="space">A.</span> PURPOSE</h3>
<p class="noindent">A product of many compromises, embracing many ambiguities, the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) created for federal sector labor relations a foundation resting on statute rather than Executive Order. The Reform Act established the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) and the Federal Service Impasses Panel (FSIP) as the agencies responsible for administering the labor relations program through regulation and guidance, adjudication, and training. The statute provided judicial review of FLRA decisions resolving disputes over negotiability of bargaining proposals and unfair labor practices.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the preliminary provisions of the labor relations sections of the Reform Act, Congress identified goals to be achieved through the labor relations program: collective bargaining, effective and efficient government, and the right of employees to participate in or refrain from labor relations activities. The Statute made explicit the legislative objectives:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101. <span class="Italic">Findings and purpose</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;The Congress finds that--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;experience in both private and public employment indicates that the statutory protection of the right of employees to organize, bargain collectively, and participate through labor organizations of their own choosing in decisions which affect them--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(A)&#x2003;safeguards the public interest,</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(B)&#x2003;contributes to the effective conduct of public business, and</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(C)&#x2003;facilitates and encourages the amicable settlements of disputes between employees and their employers involving conditions of employment; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;the public interest demands the highest standards of employee performance and the continued development and implementation of modern and progressive work practices to facilitate and improve employee performance and the efficient accomplishment of the operations of the Government.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, labor organizations and collective bargaining in the civil service are in the public interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;It is the purpose of this chapter to prescribe certain rights and obligations of the employees of the Federal Government and to establish procedures which are designed to meet the special requirements and needs of the Government. The provisions of this chapter should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102. <span class="Italic">Employees' rights</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Each employee shall have the right to form, join, or assist any labor organization, or to refrain from any such activity, freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal, and each employee shall be protected in the exercise of such right. Except as otherwise provided under this chapter, such right includes the right--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;to act for a labor organization in the capacity of a representative and the right, in that capacity, to present the views of the labor organization to heads of agencies and other officials of the executive branch of the Government, the Congress, or other appropriate authorities, and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment through representatives chosen by employees under this chapter.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Supreme Court stated in its first decision involving the Reform Act's labor relations provisions, <span class="Italic">BATF v. FLRA</span>, 464 U.S. 89, 104 S. Ct. 439 (1983):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act, part of a comprehensive revision of the laws governing the rights and obligations of civil servants, contains the first statutory scheme governing labor relations between federal agencies and their employees. Prior to enactment of Title VII, labor-management relations in the federal sector were governed by a program established in a 1962 Executive Order. The Executive Order regime, under which federal employees had limited rights to engage in concerted activity, was most recently administered by the Federal Labor Relations Council, a body composed of three Executive Branch management officials whose decisions were not subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The new Act, declaring that "labor organizations and collective bargaining in the civil service are in the public interest," 5 USC 7101(a), significantly strengthened the position of public employee unions while carefully preserving the ability of federal managers to maintain "an effective and efficient Government," 7101(b). Title VII expressly protects the rights of federal employees "to form, join, or assist any labor organization, or to refrain from any such activity," 7102, and imposes on federal agencies and labor organizations a duty to bargain collectively and in good faith, 7116(a)(5) and (b)(5). The Act excludes certain management prerogatives from the scope of negotiations, although an agency must bargain over the procedures by which these management rights are exercised. <span class="Italic">See</span> 7106. In general, unions and federal agencies must negotiate over terms and conditions of employment, unless a bargaining proposal is inconsistent with existing federal law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 7103(a), 7114, 7116, and 7117(a). Strikes and certain other forms of concerted activities by federal employees are illegal and constitute unfair labor practices under the Act. 7116(b)(7)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Act replaced the management-controlled Federal Labor Relations Council with the FLRA, a three-member independent and bipartisan body within the Executive Branch with responsibility for supervising the collective-bargaining process and administering other aspects of federal labor relations established by Title VII. 7104. The Authority, the role of which in the public sector is analogous to that of the National Labor Relations Board in the private sector...adjudicates negotiability disputes, unfair labor practice complaints, bargaining unit issues, arbitration exceptions, and conflicts over the conduct of representational elections. <span class="Italic">See</span> 7105(a)(2)(A)-(I). In addition to its adjudicatory functions, the Authority may engage in formal rulemaking, 7134, and is specifically required to "provide leadership in establishing policies and guidance relating to matters" arising under the Act. 7105(a)(1). The FLRA may seek enforcement of its adjudicatory orders in the United States Courts of Appeals, 7123(b), and persons, including federal agencies, aggrieved by any final FLRA decision may also seek judicial review in those courts. 7123(a).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">BACKGROUND</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">An Historical Overview Of The Management Of Federal Public Employees</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The history of federal public employment in the United States evidences two competing visions of the proper relationship between the President and the individuals who are employed to work for the federal government within the Executive Branch.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See The Civil Service and the Statutory Law of Public Employment</span>, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 1619, 1619 (1984). The first of these visions emphasizes "broad deference to the executive in matters of public employment[,]" and is based on the belief that such deference "is essential both to efficient public administration and [to] the realization of the popular will." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. According to this view, the President must have free reign to discharge federal employees, and to regulate labor relations between the government and its employees, because such authority is necessary to run a capable and efficient Federal Government. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1620. This belief also maintains that such power is necessary to ensure that the President can promote the will of the people by installing federal bureaucrats who actually seek to achieve the political platform that undergirds the President's election. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second vision of public employment worries that unfettered "executive discretion" to hire and fire civil servants can damage "the integrity of public administration in general," especially if an unchecked administration arbitrarily discharges career employees who hold contrary political views or who seek to blow the whistle on abusive employment practices within the Executive Branch. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This second vision of public employment also often asserts that a public employee has acquired a "property interest of sorts in his office[,]" <span class="Italic">id</span>., and expresses concerns not only about the impact that an abrupt dismissal might have on the administration of the federal government as a whole, but also on that employee's future employment prospects, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. at 1621. Based on such concerns, the second vision of the civil service system "fosters the view that the public executive ought to be extensively constrained in employment decisions" regarding apolitical civil service employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1619; <span class="Italic">see also, e.g., Harrison v. Bowen</span>, 815 F.2d 1505, 1518 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (discussing how certain statutes constrain executive discretion to remove employees).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, these two different visions of the role of the President in managing the civil service have proven ascendant at different <span id="Page_2"></span>moments in American history, including during periods that preceded the statute at issue in this case. Indeed, because "[i]nitially, presidents had broad powers to fill the civil service with their [own] appointees[,]" Jacob Marisam, <span class="Italic">The President's Agency Selection Powers</span>, 65 Admin. L. Rev. 821, 863 (2013), throughout the nineteenth century, newly inaugurated presidents would regularly purge the ranks of the civil service, <span class="Italic">see id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Civil Serv. Comm'r v. Nat'l Ass'n of Letter Carriers</span>, 413 U.S. 548, 557-58 (1973) (describing these practices). The exercise of presidential power to manage the federal workforce in this way waned significantly in the mid-twentieth century, as both President John F. Kennedy and President Richard M. Nixon expressly curtailed the purging practice by issuing executive orders that afforded significant procedural protections to civil servants. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., Exec. Order No. 11,491, 34 Fed. Reg. 17605 (October 29, 1969); Exec. Order No. 10,988, 27 Fed. Reg. 551 (January 17, 1962). The Kennedy and Nixon orders also authorized the creation of labor unions representing federal government employees, and expressly granted federal employees "limited collective bargaining rights[,]" thus "provid[ing] the initial authorization for federal experimentation with unionization." <span class="Italic">See</span> Scott L. Novak, <span class="Italic">Collective Bargaining</span>, 63 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 693, 695-96 (1995); <span class="Italic">see also Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &#x0026; Firearms v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth</span>., 464 U.S. 89, 91-92 (1983) ("<span class="Italic">BATF</span>").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With the 1970s, the view that slothful federal employees enjoyed too much protection against discharge became increasingly popular, amidst mounting concern over government integrity in the wake of the Watergate scandal. It was against this backdrop that Congress enacted the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 ("the CSRA"), Pub L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (1978), which was codified (as amended) in scattered sections of Title 5 of the United States Code. This legislation was expressly billed as an effort to codify the previous assortment of executive orders and rules that regulated the relationships between the federal government and its civil service employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">The Civil Service and the Statutory Law of Public Employment</span>, 97 Harv. L. Rev. at 1631-33. And the CSRA "comprehensively overhauled the civil service system," <span class="Italic">Lindahl v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 470 U.S. 768, 773 (1985), by replacing the "outdated patchwork of statutes and rules built up" during the previous hundred years through executive orders and federal statutes, <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 444 (1988) (quoting S. Rep. No. 95-969, p.3 (1978)), with "an elaborate new framework for evaluating adverse personnel actions against federal employees[,]" <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 443 (internal quotation marks, citation, and alternation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Significantly for present purposes, Congress crafted the CSRA with the express goal of "balanc[ing] the legitimate interests of the various categories of federal employees with the needs of sound and efficient administration." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 445. To that end, "[t]he CSRA protects covered federal employees against a broad range of personnel practices, and it supplies a variety of causes of action and remedies to employees when their rights under the statute are violated." <span class="Italic">Grosdidier v. Chairman, Broad. Bd. of Governors</span>, 560 F.3d 495, 497 (D.C. Cir. 2009). At the same time, the CSRA also streamlined the lengthy and laborious appeals processes that pre-dated the CSRA, making it easier for employers to take successful disciplinary or performance-based actions against federal employees. <span class="Italic">See Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. at 445.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The aforementioned FSLMRS, which addresses collective bargaining and labor unions exclusively, is Title VII of the CSRA, and is "the first statutory scheme governing labor relations between federal agencies and their employees." <span class="Italic">BATF</span>, 464 U.S. at 91.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Statutory Provisions That Are Relevant To The Instant Dispute</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The arguments presented in the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment in this case chiefly revolve around several provisions of the FSLMRS, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101-06, 7111-23, 7131-35, as well as a few miscellaneous provisions that appear either in the CSRA or elsewhere in the United States Code, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4302, 7301.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Purpose, Structure, And Provisions Of The FSLMRS</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The very first section of the FSLMRS lays out the purposes of the statute and the legislative findings that underlie it. Congress makes crystal clear that, in its considered judgment, labor unions and collective bargaining "safeguard[&#8197;] the public interest"; "contribute[&#8197;] to the effective conduct of public business"; and "facilitate and encourage the amicable settlement[&#8197;] of disputes between employees and their employers involving conditions of employment[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(a)(1). This statutory text also emphasizes the importance of adhering to "the highest standards of employee performance and the continued development and implementation of modern and progressive work practices to facilitate and improve employee performance and the efficient accomplishment of the operations of the Government." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7101(a)(2). Broadly speaking, the FSLMRS sets out to accomplish these goals by, among other things: affirming the rights of federal employees to unionize and to engage in collective bargaining, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7102, 7103(a)(12); determining what matters must, can, or cannot be bargained over, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7102, 7106, 7117, 7121, 7131; and developing a dispute-resolution mechanism for the various foreseeable issues that might arise during the collective bargaining process or as part of a final collective bargaining agreement, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7104-05, 7116, 7118-19, 7121-22, 7132.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First and foremost, the FSLMRS firmly establishes the rights of federal employees to join labor unions for the purpose of petitioning government officials about labor matters, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7102, 7102(1), and describes labor unions as entities that represent federal employees by "engag[ing] in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment through representatives chosen by employees under this chapter[,]" <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7102(2). The terms "collective bargaining" and "conditions of employment" are terms of art within the FSLMRS, which means they have particular meanings that bear on this case. "Collective bargaining" is defined as "the performance of the mutual obligation of...an agency and the [union]...to meet at reasonable times and to consult and bargain in a good-faith effort to reach agreement with respect to the conditions of employment affecting such employees." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(12). The "conditions of employment" that are subject to negotiation under the statute include "personnel policies, practices, and matters, whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise, affecting working conditions[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14). Furthermore, when bargaining over such matters, both agencies and union representatives must abide by their obligation to "meet and negotiate in good faith[,]" <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(4), and this means that the parties to the negotiation must generally "enter into discussions with an open mind and a sincere intention to reach an agreement[,]" <span class="Italic">United Steelworkers of Am., AFL-CIO-CLC, Local Union 14534 v. Nat'l Labor Relations Bd</span>., 983 F.2d 240, 245 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (quoting <span class="Italic">Sign and Pictorial Union Local 1175 v. Nat'l Labor Relations Bd</span>., 419 F.2d 726, 731 (D.C. Cir. 1969)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After establishing that the right to good-faith collective bargaining exists, the statute lays out what matters are subject to negotiation and the extent to which those matters must be discussed. In this regard, the FSLMRS establishes a three-tier system based upon the negotiability of matters in collective bargaining discussions. First, the FSLMRS establishes a default presumption that it is "mandatory" for agencies and unions to bargain over the "condition[s] of employment" in the workplace. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Cherry Point, N.C. v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth</span>., 952 F.2d 1434, 1439 (D.C. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">accord</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7102(2), 7103(a)(12), (14). Moreover, while the phrase "conditions of employment" is broad, the FSLMRS further explicitly emphasizes at least two mandatory bargaining matters: the scope of grievance procedures for disputes between employees and management, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a), and the availability of "official time[,]" <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7131(d)--i.e., the availability of paid time to union members to work on union-related matters, <span class="Italic">see BATF</span>, 464 U.S. at 91. Second, the FSLMRS explicitly designates a narrow category of matters (listed in section 7106(b)(1)) as 'permissive' matters for bargaining, in the sense that the parties may bargain over the matters contained within this section "at the election of the agency[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1); <span class="Italic">see id</span>. (allowing, "at the election of the agency," negotiation as to the "numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to" any project, or "the technology, methods, and means or performing work"); <span class="Italic">see also Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth</span>., 414 F.3d 50, 53 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (acknowledging that these matters constitute "permissive" subjects of bargaining).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third and finally, the FSLMRS <span class="Italic">prohibits</span> negotiation over matters relating to management rights or those matters subject to Government-wide rules or regulations. Accordingly, none of the bargaining rights the FSLMRS confers may interfere with the rights of federal agencies "to determine the mission, budget, organization, number of employees, and internal security practices of the agency" or "to hire, assign, direct, layoff, and retain employees...or to suspend, remove, reduce in grade or pay, or take other disciplinary action against such employees" as allowed by law. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a). The statute also frees federal agencies of any obligation to negotiate over those "matters which are the subject of any...Government-wide rule or regulation[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1). This means that the right to collective bargaining does not extend to rules or regulations that are "generally applicable throughout the Federal Government[,]" even if the rule does not "apply[&#8197;] to...a fixed minimum percentage of the federal civilian workforce." <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n, Inc. v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth</span>., 827 F.2d 814, 816-17 (D.C Cir. 1987) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Am. Fed'n of Gov't Emps., Local 2782 v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth</span>., 803 F.2d 737, 741 (D.C. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As mentioned, the FSLMRS also recognizes that a number of disputes may arise in the context of collective bargaining negotiations or during the execution of a collective bargaining agreement. Thus, the statute prohibits labor unions or federal agencies from engaging in "unfair labor practices[,]" such as interfering with the ability of employees or agencies to pursue their rights under the FSLMRS, or refusing to negotiate in good faith. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), (a)(5), 7116(b)(1), (b)(5). It also provides mechanisms for agencies and labor unions to resolve any impasse during negotiations, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7119, and to determine whether a union's proposal is actually negotiable under the FSLMRS, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7117(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Federal Labor Relations Authority</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The various relevant provisions of the FSLMRS discussed above cover a lot <span id="Page_3"></span>of substantive ground regarding the scope of federal labor-management relations. But there's more: to ensure that these statutory prescriptions are administered effectively, Congress also created a permanent agency that it named the Federal Labor Relations Authority ("FLRA"). <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 7104(a). The FLRA has three members who are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 7104(a), (b). No more than two of its three members may come from the same political party, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. &#x00A7; 7104(a), and the members may "be removed by the President only upon notice and hearing and only for" cause, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7104(b). Thus, the FLRA is a bipartisan, independent agency. <span class="Italic">See Secs. Exch. Comm'n v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth</span>., 568 F.3d 990, 997 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Per the FSLMRS, the FLRA must "provide leadership in establishing policies and guidance relating to matters under" the statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7105(a)(1), and the agency is specifically tasked with promulgating regulations pertaining to the FSLMRS, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. &#x00A7; 7134. The FLRA must also carry out a number of other prescribed duties, such as "resolv[ing] issues relating to the duty to bargain in good faith under section 7117(c)[,]" <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7105(2)(E); "conduct[ing] hearings and resolv[ing] complaints of unfair labor practices[,]" <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7105(a)(2)(G); and providing, by and large, the final word relating to employee grievances under any grievance procedures established by a collective bargaining agreement, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. &#x00A7; 7122.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the FLRA is called upon to hear a dispute, it may hold hearings and take testimony, require an agency or labor union "to cease and desist from violations" of the FSLMRS, or otherwise "take any remedial action it considers appropriate to carry out the policies of this chapter." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7105(g). However, the FLRA is not the ultimate authority on such matters; under the statute, "[a]ny person aggrieved by any final order of the [FLRA]" may, with two minor exceptions, "institute an action for judicial review of the [FLRA's] order in" the federal court of appeals where that person resides, or in the D.C. Circuit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7123(a). The statute further provides that when such an appeal is filed, the court of appeals "shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding and of the question determined therein[,]" and may affirm, modify, or set aside the FLRA's order. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7123(c). Given the FLRA's expertise and the extensive role that Congress envisioned for this agency in administering the FSLMRS, the agency is entitled to <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference when interpreting the ambiguous provisions within that statute. <span class="Italic">See Fort Stewart Schs. v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth</span>., 495 U.S. 641, 645 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Relevant Miscellaneous Provisions Of The United States Code</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other statutory provisions that are either contained within the CSRA (but outside of the FSLMRS), or appear elsewhere in the United States Code, are relevant to this case. For example, in the CSRA, Congress created an agency known as the Merit Systems Protection Board ("MSPB") that adjudicates employee objections to certain adverse personnel actions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3 (listing the various types of actions that the MSPB may hear). Among other things, the MSPB is specifically empowered to hear cases regarding the removal or reduction in grade of an employee "for unacceptable performance[,]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303, and cases involving an "adverse action taken against employees...based on misconduct[,]" <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. at 446; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513. The MSPB's decisions are typically reviewable in the Federal Circuit. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the category of other sections of the United States Code that specifically address the President's ability to regulate the civil service, section 3301 of Title 5 authorizes the President to "prescribe such regulations for the admission of individuals into the civil service in the [E]xecutive [B]ranch as will best promote the efficiency of that service[,]" <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 3301(1), and the President is also expressly authorized to "ascertain the fitness of applicants as to age, health, character, knowledge, and ability for the employment sought[,]" <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 3301(2). Similarly, section 7301 of Title 5 states that "[t]he President may prescribe regulations for the conduct of employees in the [E]xecutive [B]ranch." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7301. The public law version of the CSRA also states: "no provision of [the CSRA] shall be construed to limit, curtail, abolish or terminate any function of, or authority available to, the President which the President had immediately before the effective date of this Act." Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. 95-454, &#x00A7; 904(1), 92 Stat. 1111, 1224 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOD, AAFES v. FLRA</span>, 659 F.2d 1140 (D.C. Cir. 1981), elaborated on the purposes served by Title VII of the Reform Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It was intended to serve a variety of purposes. Congress sought at least in part to strengthen the authority of federal management to hire and to discipline employees....&#8197;But the Reform Act was also aimed to strengthen the position of employee unions in the federal service. The statutory statement of congressional purpose asserts that "protection of the right of employees to organize [and] bargain collectively" "safeguards the public interest," "contributes to the effective conduct of public business," and "facilitates and encourages the amicable settlements of disputes...." Consistent with this view, the Reform Act replaced the Federal Labor Relations Council, which had been criticized as "defective" because its members "come exclusively from the ranks of management," with an independent and bipartisan FLRA. There was no suggestion that employee unions might not seek procedural protections against arbitrary or mistaken employee discharges. On the contrary, Representative Udall stressed that he intended his amendment "to meet some of the legitimate concerns of the Federal employee unions as an integral part of what is basically a bill to give management the power to manage and the flexibility that it needs." Other members articulated nearly identical sentiments during the floor debate. Endorsing the Udall amendment, Representative Ford agreed that "while considering the increased powers for management, we always had in mind that we would put together a totality here...that we hoped would represent a fair package of balanced authority for management, balanced with a fair protection for at least the existing rights the employees have."</p>
