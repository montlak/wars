<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-166"><span class="space">a.</span> Past Significance of Psychological Harm</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the 1993 decision in <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc.</span>, 510 U.S. 17, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, decisions concerning employees charged with sexual harassment under Title VII standards tended to focus on the egregiousness of the behavior coupled with its real or potential psychological effect upon the victim. <span class="Italic">Harris</span> eliminated psychological effects as a necessary element of a sexual harassment case. The pre-<span class="Italic">Harris</span> and some post-<span class="Italic">Harris</span> decisions are reviewed in the discussion that follows. The decisions are of some relevance to later appeals because they consider aspects of sexual harassment in addition to psychological impact.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Sexual harassment was reviewed by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Downes v. FAA</span>, 775 F.2d 288, 290-95 (Fed. Cir. 1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sexual discrimination in employment can take a variety of forms. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 USC 2000e-17, was designed to prevent discrimination in employment, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, because of sex, in the sense of <span class="Italic">gender</span>. However, because the statute prohibits discrimination with respect to an employee's "condition" of employment...the statute has been read as prohibiting sexual harassment by offensive behavior directed to one or more employees in the workplace. In such cases, "sex" is taken to mean "sexual" although, under the theory that such conduct has a disparate impact on one sex over the other, it continues to mean gender as well. Sexual harassment is used herein in the sense of offensive behavior of a sexual nature which is prohibited by Title VII.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The classic example of sexual harassment is the situation in which sexual demands are made by a supervisor to a subordinate in exchange for career advantages or under threats of adverse job consequences. Because tangible job consequences are involved, this type of offense has been characterized as "<span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span>" sexual harassment....&#8197;Sexual harassment has also been recognized because of offensive sexually related conduct which interferes with an employee's work performance or which creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment, irrespective of whether the complainant is threatened with actual economic consequences....&#8197;This appeal deals with sexual harassment of both types.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations embodying these concepts are found in 29 CFR 1604.11(a) and (b), which read as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;Harassment on the basis of sex is a violation of Sec. 703 of Title VII. Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when (1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment, (2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;In determining whether alleged conduct constitutes sexual harassment, the Commission will look at the record as a whole and at the totality of the circumstances, such as the nature of the sexual advances and the context in which the alleged incidents occurred. The determination of the legality of a particular action will be made from the facts, on a case by case basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These regulations are directed to determination of a formal claim for relief from sexual harassment by an employee. However, sexual harassment may also be the basis for adverse action against a federal employee. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Jackson v. VA</span>, 768 F.2d 1325 (Fed. Cir. 1985). In either case, the alleged violation must be judged by the same standard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-c"><span class="Italic">Quid Pro Quo</span> Harassment</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to clear Downes' record, we will adopt the government's view that charge 5 based on Section 1604.11(a)(2) was sustained, that is, that the board found that Downes used sexual favors as the basis for his decisions on advancement and other personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A single incident of <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> harassment under Section 1604.11(a)(2) may be sufficient to sustain that type of charge....&#8197;Here, however, all elements of that charge were not proved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Charge 5 was based on the following statements in an affidavit by Ms. Jones:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Fin has asked me if I have ever thought about trading favors to get ahead in the agency. He's also said, "Boy, if I had a body like yours, I'd really go places."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Jones affidavit, if accepted as true in all respects, contains no hint that sexual favors were "used as the basis for employment decisions." There is, indeed, no evidence that Downes requested sexual favors from any employee, including Ms. Jones....&#8197;There is no evidence of retaliation for denial of sexual favors. A necessary element of "<span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span>" harassment under Section 1604.11(a)(2)--that there be a reward or penalty from the alleged harasser--is lacking.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the record does not indicate the context in which the subject remark was made. There is no indication of what preceded or followed the alleged remark. There is no indication of when it occurred. One must even infer that he was her supervisor at the time. No failure can be attributed to Downes to develop the record on this point. It was part of the agency's case, and it is at this point that the Jones affidavit, the only evidence, is inadequate to sustain the charge.</p>

<p class="Body-Text-c">Intimidating, Hostile, or Offensive Environment</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a claim of sexual harassment for creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment, the decisions which have recognized a claim based on that type of misconduct have required at least two elements: (1) the offensive conduct must be sufficiently pervasive so as to alter the conditions of employment, and (2) be sufficiently severe and persistent to affect seriously the psychological well-being of an employee....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the aim of the U.S. government as employer should be to free its workplace of offensive sexual remarks entirely, the statute and the subject regulations do not create a claim of sexual harassment for each and every crude joke or sexually explicit remark made on the job by employees, even supervisors. The courts have uniformly held that a <span class="Italic">pattern</span> of offensive conduct must be proved which is perpetuated or condoned by an employer to such an extent that an employee's job performance or state of psychological well-being is adversely affected....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, proof of occasional, isolated, and/or trivial remarks of a sexual nature do not satisfy the first element of the claim under Section 1604.11(a)(3). The offensive conduct must be persistent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Downes...is charged with at most five incidents of sexually offensive conduct during that period [of more than three years]. The incidents were not shown by the agency or found by the presiding official to be representative of his conduct....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even discounting the trivial nature of some incidents, these few instances, which we assume to have occurred, do not establish a pattern of harassment directed to "female employees" or to a particular employee. They do not show that conduct has been repeated to the point where it is "routine" or "of a generalized nature," i.e., has become a "condition" of anyone's employment....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The context in which the statements by Downes occurred was not established by the agency, nor considered by the presiding official....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he offensiveness of conduct cannot be judged simply by proving that an incident involving sexual remarks occurred without considering the context.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A second element of offensive environment is proof that the misconduct <span id="Page_2657"></span>interfered with an employee's work or caused serious psychological damage. The agency's proof and argument, as well as the decision of the presiding official, exhibits no awareness that the requirement of an adverse impact on an employee is even a factor in the charge. Thus, the standard applied by the MSPB was wrong as a matter of law. The decision rests solely on the basis that some of the instances were proved to have occurred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Downes was not demoted for failing to perform his job as a supervisor, but on specific charges of sexual harassment under Section 1604.11(a). When such a charge is made, the agency must be held to the same standard as an individual or a class of complainants who might bring the charge. In this case, the agency did not meet that standard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit softened whatever distinction might lie between EEOC's definition of sexual harassment and agency definitions of that conduct, <span class="Italic">Howard v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 877 F.2d 952, 955-56 (Fed. Cir. 1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Howard contends that it is insufficient that the complainants testified that they found his conduct unwelcome and that his sexual conversations made them nervous and uncomfortable....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The complainants need not testify in express words that they felt sexually harassed. Their testimony clearly established that they viewed Howard's conduct as insulting, intimidating, and offensive. The evidence shows that Howard's behavior caused the women to avoid him, to demand that he stop touching them, and, in one complainant's case, it caused her to alter her work habits to avoid being alone in the halls with Howard. On this basis, we hold that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the board's determination of sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established that sexual harassment creating a "hostile environment" violates an employee's right, protected under 42 USC 2000e-16, "to work in an environment free from discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult." In addition, the Government has a right to remove employees whose conduct will subvert its employees' performance. The board found that the agency had demonstrated that Howard's conduct was unwelcome, sexual in nature, offensive, and likely to have an adverse effect on the agency's functioning.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Howard argues that the agency should have been required to establish the same elements of proof required of complainants bringing actions for sexual harassment under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, proof that sexually harassing conduct altered the conditions of employment or work performance of its employees. Howard contends that since he was not informed, in the notice of proposed removal, what regulation he was charged under, and since the notice of removal used the "same" language as the...EEOC under Title VII, Howard believed he was being charged with sexual harassment under Title VII and, therefore, these provisions should have been applied by the board. We are not persuaded by this argument.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a Title VII claim by an employee against an employer for a hostile work environment caused by sexual harassment, the complaining employee must allege and prove...that the harassment complained of affected a term, condition, or privilege of employment. An employee's "state of psychological well being is a term, condition, or privilege of employment within the meaning of Title VII." On the other hand, a complainant is not required to "file an EEOC action as a prerequisite to agency discipline of an employee whose actions are affecting the work environment." When disciplining an employee for sexually harassing conduct, the government must prove, at a minimum, that the conduct is "'sufficiently severe or pervasive' to 'create an abusive working environment.'"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the board found that "[a]lthough there [was] no evidence that any of the three complaining witnesses suffered any psychological damage as a result of [Howard's] conduct," the affected employees had begun to change their work habits in order to avoid contact with Howard. Additionally, the board found Howard's conduct, if allowed to continue, "would eventually create an atmosphere so offensive that it would affect the three witnesses' ability to perform their duties and, thereby adversely affect the functioning of the agency." We hold that for purposes of an adverse action an employee's conduct already impacting other employees' work habits can create "an abusive working environment" even though the other employees' psychological well being is not currently affected. The conduct, however, must be of such severity that, if allowed to continue, would seriously affect the psychological well being of the other employees. Such was the case here.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Howard</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Perry v. USPS</span>, 46 MSPR 425, 430 (1990), determining that an employee's conduct can create an abusive working environment, even though the other employees' psychological well-being is not currently affected, if the conduct is so severe that it would seriously affect the psychological well-being of other employees if continued. <span class="Italic">Perry</span> noted as to the appellant's argument that the agency's failure to report his conduct to the Inspector General demonstrated a lack of sexual harassment: "An agency...does not have to tolerate all behavior until the law has been violated before it enforces policy statements requiring certain workplace behavior."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The transition from a test based, in part, on actual or threatened psychological damage, to a test that examines the perceptions of a reasonable person, was reflected in <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Dept. of Army</span>, 29 MSPR 690, 692-93 (1986)--an appeal that commenced before, and concluded after, the <span class="Italic">Harris</span> decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Physical or verbal conduct of a sexual nature having the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment is a form of sexual harassment defined by 29 CFR 1613.11(a). To establish an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment, the evidence must show that the conduct is sufficiently pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and sufficiently severe and persistent to affect seriously the psychological well-being of an employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Downes v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 775 F.2d 288, 292 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The content of the conduct is also essential in determining sexual harassment....&#8197;The loss of tangible job benefits by the alleged victims is not a prerequisite for finding sexual harassment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bundy v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hillen</span> characterized events concerning several women. The appellant twice touched an employee's breast and thigh without her consent, and made some suggestive comments to the woman, leaving her upset enough that she complained to the Inspector General. A similar conclusion was reached about the complaint of another woman who said that the appellant touched her breast. The touching was unwelcome; the conduct was pervasive; and it affected her work performance to the extent that she avoided the appellant and would conduct her dealings with him through others. Another woman was not considered to have been harassed. The appellant invited her out for drinks, took what was considered an unusual interest in her career, and gave her suggestive looks. The woman said that she discussed the appellant's conduct with her supervisor and her parents, and she claimed to be afraid of the appellant. The conduct toward the woman "did have a sexual connotation but that the evidence fails to show that appellant's conduct affected [her] work performance or seriously affected her psychological well-being." The result was a remand to the AJ for reevaluation of the case. That led to another remand, with guidance on the proper resolution of credibility issues. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hillen v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that, to prove a charge of sexual harassment brought, as here, under 29 CFR 1604.11(a), an agency must meet the same requirements as a complainant bringing a charge of sexual harassment under the same regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hillen</span>....&#8197;Thus, the agency must prove by preponderant evidence that the alleged harassing conduct occurred, that it was unwelcome to the person to whom it was directed, that it was of a sexual nature, and that it unreasonably interfered with the individual's work performance or created an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment....&#8197;To prove that an intimidating, hostile, or offense working condition exists, the agency is required to demonstrate that the appellant's conduct is sufficiently severe and persistent to affect seriously the psychological well-being of an employee. <span class="Italic">See Carosella v. United States Postal Service</span>, 30 MSPR 199, 201 (1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 816 F.2d 638 (Fed, Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board visited <span class="Italic">Hillen</span> a third time. <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Dept. of Army</span>, 50 MSPR 293, 296-98 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Hillen III</span>). Again the Board corrected the AJ's analysis of sexual harassment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge failed to apply the legal guidelines for sexual harassment set forth in <span class="Italic">Hillen II</span>. Instead, he relied upon the appellant's denial of "sexual intent," which he considered credible. This was error.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment, the agency must show that the conduct is: (1) Sufficiently pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment; and (2) sufficiently severe and persistent to seriously affect the psychological well-being of an employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>, 106 S.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hillen</span> <span class="Italic">III</span> commented about the evidence before the AJ, including character evidence and comments about specific allegations, 50 MSPR at 301-05:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]here were statements from nearly forty individuals, many of them females, attesting to the appellant's character and the propriety of his conduct, and stating their appreciation for his interest and assistance in their career development. We conclude from this evidence that, despite Ms. Schaefer's suspicions regarding the appellant's motives, the evidence indicates that his attentions to her career development were most probably sincere.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also relied on Captain Daugherty's complaints that the appellant made a sexually suggestive telephone call to her....&#8197;Concerning the telephone incident, Captain Daugherty testified that...she answered her office telephone by saying "Cargo documentation, Captain Daugherty. May I help you sir?" and that the appellant, without identifying himself, responded with "What would you like to do?" According to Captain Daugherty's testimony, the appellant's tone of voice was suggestive, and he repeated his question before identifying himself and asking to speak to her supervisor. She stated that, if she had received the call at home, she would have hung up on the caller.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the telephone call incident, there is no evidence that other employees, whom the appellant testified he also addressed in this manner, objected to his remarks. Moreover, the remarks were non-sexual in nature, and essentially trivial. Proof of occasional, trivial remarks such as the appellant exhibited in the telephone call does not establish pervasiveness....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The other two incidents involve a touching. A touching by its nature must be considered serious, and sexual harassment will be found if the elements of the standard are satisfied. Not all touchings in an office environment are necessarily sexual harassment....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We note that Captain Daugherty's testimony regarding the uninvited and unwelcome nature of the appellant's conduct is unrebutted. The evidence clearly establishes, therefore, that the appellant's conduct was uninvited by Captain Daugherty, and that it was offensive to her. The appellant went out of his way to enter Captain Daugherty's office, and his touching of her, by his own admission, was not inadvertent. Further, it cannot in any way be considered necessary or proper.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, of the three specifications of sexual harassment of Captain Daugherty that were charged to the appellant, we find that only one...involved a deliberate and unwelcome touching that was of a sexual nature. We further find, however, that this single incident--which we find offensive, and do not condone--does not rise to the level of a Title VII violation, as charged by the agency, because it is not pervasive, nor is it of sufficient severity to seriously affect a reasonable employee's work or psychological well-being.[2] ...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Brady</span>, 924 F.2d 872, 878 (9th Cir. 1991) (the required showing of severity or seriousness of the harassing conduct varies inversely with the pervasiveness or frequency of the conduct), citing <span class="Italic">King v. Board of Regents of University of Wisconsin System</span>, 898 F.2d 533, 537 (7th Cir. 1990) ("[a]lthough a single act can be enough...generally, repeated incidents create a stronger claim of hostile environment, with the strength of the claim depending on the number of incidents and the intensity of each incident")...<span class="Italic">Henson v. City of Dundee</span>, 682 F.2d 897, 904 n.8 (11th Cir. 1982) (a single incident of sufficient severity may create a hostile environment).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the agency charged that the appellant's sexual harassment of female employees, "had the effect of unreasonably interfering with the work performance of the individuals involved and created an intimidating and offensive working environment." We find that the agency has not proven that effect here....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM petitioned the Board for reconsideration of <span class="Italic">Hillen III</span>. Turning down OPM's invitation for the Board to reverse or substantially modify its prior case law, the Board again explained the nature of its framework for analysis of sexual harassment charges, <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Dept. of Army</span>, 54 MSPR 58, 64-69 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Hillen</span> <span class="Italic">IV)</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner contends that the Board's decision has established a standard for proving sexual harassment based on a hostile working environment which is inconsistent with the standard enunciated by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 91 L. Ed.2d 49 (1986). According to OPM, the Board erred by adopting an earlier formulation of the standard for abusive environment claims from <span class="Italic">Downes v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 775 F.2d 288, 292 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The Board stated that an agency charging creation of a hostile environment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act must show that the employee's conduct was "(1) [s]ufficiently pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive environment; and (2) sufficiently severe and persistent to seriously affect the psychological well-being of an employee." <span class="Italic">Hillen III</span>, 50 MSPR at 297. OPM contends that this test is more exacting than the standard stated in <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>, which held that for sexual harassment to be actionable under Title VII, "it must be sufficiently severe or pervasive 'to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment.'" 477 U.S. at 67, quoting <span class="Italic">Henson v. City of Dundee</span>, 682 F.2d 897, 904 (11th Cir. 1982). In <span class="Italic">Meritor</span> the Court followed <span class="Italic">Henson</span> in requiring that the harassment be serious enough to alter the conditions of employment, but without discussion it appears to have modified the standard stated in <span class="Italic">Henson</span> to a disjunctive one requiring the conduct to be sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an abusive working environment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We believe that the Court's disjunctive language indicates that the required severity of the harassing conduct will vary inversely with the frequency or pervasiveness of its occurrence....&#8197;In subsequent cases, courts have stated that repeated incidents of harassment are generally necessary to create a hostile working environment, but a single act could be so egregious as to alter the conditions of the victim's employment....&#8197;As noted above, the Board's previous decision mistakenly recited the pre-<span class="Italic">Meritor</span> version of the standard for proof of hostile environment requiring pervasiveness in all cases, and we here correct that error. "When disciplining an employee for sexually harassing conduct, the government must prove, at a minimum, that the conduct is 'sufficiently severe or pervasive' to 'create an abusive working environment.'" <span class="Italic">Howard v. Department of Air Force</span>, 877 F.2d 952, 956 (Fed. Cir. 1989), <span class="Italic">quoting</span> <span class="Italic">Carosella v. US Postal Service</span>, 816 F.2d 638, 640 (Fed. Cir. 1987), <span class="Italic">quoting</span> <span class="Italic">Meritor</span>, 477 U.S. at 67, 106 S. Ct. at 2405.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding its recitation of the earlier standard, however, in <span class="Italic">Hillen III</span> the Board clearly applied the <span class="Italic">Meritor</span> standard to the only instance of unwelcome sexual conduct which it found. The Board held that this single incident (the touching at the coffee pot) did not rise to the level of the Title VII violation charged by the agency "because it [was] not pervasive, nor [was] it of sufficient severity to seriously affect a reasonable employee's work or psychological well-being." 50 MSPR at 304.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...OPM objects that the Board's formulation of the standard for hostile environment harassment is narrower than the wording of the EEOC Guidelines, which state that conduct constitutes sexual harassment if it "has the <span class="Italic">purpose</span> or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment." 29 CFR 1604.11(a)(3). The petitioner asserts that under the regulation conduct which has the purpose of creating an abusive environment is sexual harassment even if it fails to accomplish its purpose. The Board's decision does not address this portion of the regulation because its interpretation is not necessary to a decision in this case. Here the agency charged that the appellant's conduct had the effect of creating a hostile and intimidating environment. The Board is empowered to decide the cases before it, and it is prohibited by statute from issuing advisory opinions. 5 USCA 1204(h) (West Supp. 1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner also contends that the Board's previous decision should not stand because it is bereft of analysis and merely conclusory in finding that the agency failed to prove creation of a hostile working environment in violation of section 1604.11(a)(3). According to OPM, the Board's decision is defective for failing to explain why it determined that the sustained incident of unwelcome sexual conduct was not sufficiently pervasive or severe to interfere with a reasonable person's work performance or psychological well being. Despite this objection to the Board's determination, OPM's petition has itself failed to present reasons for reaching the contrary conclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner does assert that the Board's decision fails to identify the evidence which rebutted the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of sexual harassment which <span class="Italic">Hillen I</span> found that Captain Daugherty's testimony established. 29 MSPR at 694. However, the Board's decision notes that the administrative judge found the appellant, who testified subsequently, to be an extremely credible witness. Based on his testimony and all the evidence, the Board found that the agency failed to prove all but one of the incidents involving Captain Daugherty. <span class="Italic">Hillen I</span> did not find that the coffee pot incident alone constituted a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of hostile environment harassment, and in <span class="Italic">Hillen III</span> the Board found that this single incident was not so severe that it would have seriously affected a reasonable person's work or psychological well-being. 50 MSPR at 304.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The degree to which the coffee pot incident in fact affected Captain Daugherty is not clear. As the administrative judge found, although Captain Daugherty was upset at the time by the unwelcome touching, <span id="Page_2659"></span>she was not greatly concerned by this or other incidents until she learned of the appellant's placement in her chain of command. Even then, he found that she vacillated about whether to pursue the matter. Although she did file a complaint, it was based in part on other incidents which we have found she misperceived. The record offers little basis for finding that the coffee pot incident by itself was of such severity that it interfered with Captain Daugherty's work or had a serious effect on her psychological well-being.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our decision, however, is based on our determination that this single incident was not so severe that it would have had such an effect on a reasonable person.[4] OPM contends that this determination is impermissibly conclusory and violates the rule that an agency must give explanations for its decisions which are adequate enough to permit review. However, OPM's disagreement concerns what is in essence a matter of judgment based on the totality of the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1604.11(b) (whether conduct constitutes sexual harassment is to be determined on the record as a whole and the totality of the circumstances, on a case by case basis). It is notable that the Director's petition does not offer specific reasons why the Board, applying the <span class="Italic">Meritor</span> standard to its findings of fact, should have reached the contrary conclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;To find sexually harassing conduct created a hostile environment, the court must conclude both that the conduct adversely affected the victim and that it would have interfered with a reasonable person's work or psychological well being. <span class="Italic">Rabidue v. Osceola Relining Co.</span>, 805 F.2d 611, 620 (6th Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 481 U.S. 1041, 107 S. Ct. 1983, 95 L. Ed.2d 823 (1987). OPM is mistaken in suggesting that the unwelcomeness of the conduct to a reasonable person is an additional requirement; such a test is unnecessary in view of the required impact on a reasonable person under the test just cited.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor has OPM relied on judicial treatment of claims that similar conduct altered the conditions of employment and created an abusive working environment. The petition makes no reference to the cases evaluating single incidents of sexual touching in which the courts have found the conduct (sometimes more severe than the conduct here or accompanied by offensive verbal remarks) isolated and insufficiently severe to create a hostile and offensive environment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Scott v. Sears, Roebuck &#x0026; Co.</span>, 798 F.2d 210 (7th Cir. 1986) (during 12-week training period employee was slapped once on buttocks by coworker and received repeated implied propositions from employee trainer); <span class="Italic">Joyner v.

The only case finding a hostile environment where there was a single sexual touching also involved additional aggravating circumstances not found here. <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Kansas State University</span>, 780 F. Supp. 755 (D. Kan. 1991) (hostile environment found where supervisor slapped female employee on the buttocks and thereafter threatened to repeat the act and where employee's resulting psychological distress required counseling and produced physical symptoms).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Each case must be decided on its own particular facts, and we do not cite these cases as controlling here. Rather, we believe the rulings in these cases tend to confirm our judgment concerning the severity of the charged conduct by the appellant which we have sustained. Our decision should also not be misread to condone the appellant's actions as acceptable behavior or as too trivial to be subjected to discipline. Improper behavior in the workplace like the appellant's is not immune to discipline merely because it fails to create a hostile environment. An agency can punish such an uninvited sexual touching where its charge is properly framed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tyler v. Department of the Army</span>, 38 MSPR at 87, 90; <span class="Italic">Jordan v. US Postal Service</span>, 44 MSPR 225, 227-28 (1990). However, the appellant was charged with creating a hostile and intimidating environment in violation of 29 CFR 1604.11(a)(3), and the agency's evidence falls short of proving this charge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Undeterred, OPM pressed on and obtained review from the Federal Circuit in 1994 of the latest MSPB decision concerning the 1985 removal of Mr. Hillen. At issue was whether psychological injury need be proven to establish sexual harassment. In an extensive opinion, <span class="Italic">King v. Hillen</span>, 21 F.3d 1572, 1579-84 (Fed. Cir. 1994), the court concluded that, under the 1993 Supreme Court decision in <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, psychological injury was not essential to the charge; the totality of the circumstances must be considered:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues that Mr. Hillen, in the totality of his conduct, created a hostile and abusive working environment, in violation of Title VII as elaborated in the EEOC Guidelines and Supreme Court precedent. The Board and Mr. Hillen respond that since none of the five women suffered serious psychological injury and their work performance was not affected, the requirements of Title VII sexual harassment and the EEOC Guidelines were not met.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also suggests that its view of the law is entitled to deference. However, it is our appellate obligation to assure that the law is understood and applied correctly. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">EEOC Guideline 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11(a).</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, at 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-2(a)(1), makes it unlawful for an employer...to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of an individual's race, color, religion, sex or national origin.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is generally accepted that Title VII places the same obligations on federal as on private employers. <span class="Italic">McKinney v. Dole</span>, 765 F.2d 1129, 1138 n.19 (D.C. Cir. 1985). It is not disputed that the EEOC Guidelines apply to this case, and that there was adequate notice thereof. The Guidelines include the following definition:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11(a). Harassment on the basis of sex is a violation of section 703 of Title VII. Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when...(3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court discussed the EEOC Guidelines with approval in <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings.</span> The Court explained that unwelcome behavior based on the sex of the employee, if sufficiently severe or pervasive as to create an abusive working environment, constitutes discriminatory conduct. 477 U.S. at 67, 106 S. Ct. at 2405-06. The Court reaffirmed the <span class="Italic">Meritor</span> standard in <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.</span>, __U.S.__, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed.2d 295 (1993). Holding that psychological injury is not a necessary criterion of hostile environment sexual harassment, the Court cited, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the Federal Circuit's pre-<span class="Italic">Meritor</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Downes v. FAA as</span> having applied the incorrect standard. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift</span>, __ U.S. at __, 114 S. Ct. at 370.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the Board's <span class="Italic">Hillen</span> opinions the absence of serious psychological injury to the victims was a significant or controlling factor in the result. This criterion was placed in quite different perspective in <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift</span>, the Court stating that "while psychological harm, like any other relevant factor, may be taken into account, no single factor is required." __ U.S. at __, 114 S. Ct. at 371. The Court explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A discriminatorily abusive work environment, even one that does not seriously affect employees' psychological well-being, can and often will detract from employees' job performance, discourage employees from remaining on the job, or keep them from advancing in their careers. Moreover, even without regard to these tangible effects, the very fact that the discriminatory conduct was so severe or pervasive that it created a work environment abusive to employees because of their race, gender, religion, or national origin offends Title VII's broad rule of workplace equality. __ U.S. at __, 114 S. Ct. at 370-371.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sexual harassment will lie if the offensive conduct is based on the employee's sex, is unwelcome, and is sufficiently severe or pervasive to interfere with the employee's job performance or to create an abusive work environment. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Forklift</span>, __ U.S. at __, 114 S. Ct. at 370 (when the work environment is abusive, the conditions of employment have been altered by the sex-based actions)....&#8197;The Board's holding that to establish sexual harassment under the EEOC Guidelines there must be shown a serious effect on the employee's psychological well-being is incorrect as a matter of law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board further erred in determining for each incident, standing alone, whether it met the criteria of sexual harassment, and in failing to consider the effect on the workplace of the totality of the conduct, as we next discuss.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board, like the administrative judge, treated each separate incident in isolation, ignoring the totality of the circumstances. The EEOC Guidelines require that the entire conduct be considered:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11(b). In determining whether alleged conduct <span id="Page_2660"></span>constitutes sexual harassment, the Commission will look at the record as a whole and at the totality of the circumstances, such as the nature of the sexual advances and the context in which the alleged incidents occurred. The determination of the legality of a particular action will be made from the facts, on a case by case basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EEOC's "Policy Guidance on Sexual Harassment," 8 Fair Employment Practices Manual (BNA) 405:6681, 6689 (March 19, 1990) explains that consideration should be given to the type of conduct (verbal or physical), its frequency, its offensiveness, the hostility of the conduct, whether the harasser is a co-worker or a supervisor, and the number of persons at whom the harassment was directed. The Supreme Court elaborated upon these criteria in <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift:</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[W]hether an environment is "hostile" or "abusive" can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances. These may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance. The effect on the employee's psychological well-being is, of course, relevant to determining whether the plaintiff actually found the environment abusive. But while psychological harm, like any other relevant facts, may be taken into account, no single factor is required.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">__ U.S. at __, 114 S. Ct. at 371.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board had determined that each separate incident involving Mr. Hillen did not create a hostile working environment. Indeed, in the usual case an isolated offensive incident does not create an abusive or intimidating environment. However, by viewing each incident in isolation, as if nothing else had occurred, a realistic picture of the work environment was not presented. The frequency of the offensive conduct as well as its nature and its pervasiveness are all factors to be weighed in determining the abusiveness of the environment, as the courts discussed in <span class="Italic">Andrews v. Philadelphia</span>, 895 F.2d 1469. 1485 (3d Cir. 1990) and <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Brady</span>, 924 F.2d 872, 876-9 (9th Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is the overall, composite effect on the terms, conditions, and privileges of employment that is the focus of the law, whose target is workplace discrimination. When there are multiple incidents and victims, it is the cumulative effect of the offensive behavior that creates the working environment. In <span class="Italic">Hicks v. Gates Rubber Co.</span>, 833 F.2d 1406, 1415 (10th Cir. 1987) the court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The second question is whether incidents of sexual harassment directed at employees other than the plaintiff can be used as proof of the plaintiffs claim of a hostile work environment. The answer seems clear: one of the critical inquiries in a hostile environment claim must be the <span class="Italic">environment.</span> Evidence of a general work atmosphere...as well as evidence of specific hostility directed toward the plaintiff--is an important factor in evaluating the claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(Emphasis in original.) The EEOC Policy Guidance reflects this analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]ncidents of sexual harassment directed at other employees in addition to the charging party are relevant to a showing of hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">8 F.E.P. Manual at 405:6691 (citing <span class="Italic">Hall v.</span> <span class="Italic">Gus Constr. Co.</span>, 842 F.2d 1010, 1014-15 (8th Cir. 1988)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On this appeal the parties focus primarily on Captain Daugherty, for in its final consideration of all of the incidents, the Board found that "only one, the coffee pot incident, was a deliberate and unwelcome touching...of a sexual nature." The Board found that the coffee pot incident standing alone was not pervasive," and not "of sufficient severity to seriously affect a reasonable employee's work or psychological well-being." The Board declined to consider the elevator incident involving Captain Daugherty, having found that the touching of her breast was inadvertent and hence did not meet the "deliberate and unwelcome" standard; declined to consider Mr. Hillen's telephone remarks since they were "essentially trivial"; and declined to consider Mr. Hillen's "appraising looks" since they were "not of a sexual nature."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for Ms. Byars, the Board found that Mr. Hillen's actions "were not sufficiently pervasive so as to alter her conditions of employment, and were not sufficiently severe so as to seriously affect her psychological well-being." With respect to Ms. Schaefer, the Board found that the conduct "was not so severe as to alter the conditions of Ms. Schaefer's employment, nor was it severe and persistent, so as to seriously affect her psychological well-being. <span class="Italic">See Downes at</span> 292." As we have remarked, the Board recognized that <span class="Italic">Downes</span> was inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings</span>, yet continued to invoke the requirement of psychological injury.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These rulings all illustrate the errors in the Board's application of 29 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1604.11(a) and (b), for neither the absence of psychological injury, nor the lack of severity of a single incident or of actions toward a single victim, is the correct standard under the EEOC Guidelines. The Board erred similarly in its disposition of the incidents involving Ms. Ingerski and Ms. Parkinson. The Board had found in <span class="Italic">Hillen</span> <span class="Italic">I</span> that "appellant's conduct toward Ms. Ingerski did have a sexual connotation but that the evidence fails to show that appellant's conduct affected Ms. Ingerski's work performance or seriously affected her psychological well-being." The Board did not refer to this conduct after <span class="Italic">Hillen I</span>. The Board also found in <span class="Italic">Hillen I</span> that Mr. Hillen's "conduct did not affect Ms. Parkinson's work performance nor did it seriously affect her psychological well-being." In addition to having applied the incorrect standard, the incidents involving Ms. Ingerski and Ms. Parkinson were not considered as part of the totality of the work environment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board erred in its legal methodology, and reached the flawed conclusion that the "single sustained incident of unwelcome sexual conduct was not shown to have created a hostile environment in violation of Section 1604.11(a)(3)." <span class="Italic">Hillen IV</span>, 54 MSPR at 67. Upon remand the Board shall consider the totality of the circumstances, as required by 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11(b), including the entirety of Mr. Hillen's conduct toward Captain Daugherty and, as appropriate, Mr. Hillen's conduct toward Ms. Ingerski, Ms. Parkinson, Ms. Schafer, and Ms. Byars.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Hillen argues that his behavior would not have been offensive to a reasonable woman. The Court in <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift</span> touched on the subject of reasonableness, reflecting the analysis which requires both an objective reasonableness standard in evaluating the conduct and its effect on the work environment, and also considers the subjective perception of the victim:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Conduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment--an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive--is beyond Title VII's purview. Likewise, if the victim does not subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive, the conduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim's employment, and there is no Title VII violation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">__ U.S. at __, 114 S. Ct. at 370. The presence of both objective and subjective considerations in determination of sexual harassment is recognized in the EEOC Guidelines, 8 F.E.P. Manual 405:6690.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As in all judgmental standards of behavior, reasonableness of the conduct is a critical consideration of the law. Much has been written about the reasonableness standard in sexual harassment cases....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not enter this debate, for no principled argument supports the view that sex-based offensive behavior in the workplace is immune from remedy simply because it may be culturally tolerated outside of the workplace. The purpose of Title VII is not to import into the workplace the prejudices of the community, but through law to liberate the workplace from the demeaning influence of discrimination, and thereby to implement the goals of human dignity and economic equality in employment. The reasonableness of sex-based conduct is determined from the perspective of eliminating "the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women" in employment. <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings</span>, 477 U.S. at 64, 106 S. Ct. at 2404 (quoting <span class="Italic">Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart</span>, 435 U.S. 702, 707 n.13, 98 S. Ct. 1370, 1375 n.13, 55 L. Ed.2d 657 (1978) (quoting <span class="Italic">Sprogis v. United Air Lines</span>, 444 F.2d 1194, 1198 (7th Cir. 1971))).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found that Captain Daugherty "misperceived" most of the incidents that occurred:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Although [Captain Daugherty]...did file a complaint [about the coffee pot incident], it was based in part on other incidents which we found she misperceived.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Hillen IV</span>, 54 MSPR at 67. The Board appears to have substituted its own "perception" for that of Captain Daugherty, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Andrews v. Philadelphia</span>, 895 F.2d 1469, 1482 (3d Cir. 1990) (determining whether "the discrimination would detrimentally affect a reasonable person of the same sex in that position"), as well as having erred in its application of 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11(b), which requires that the perception of any one incident be determined in the context of all of the incidents. The EEOC regulation reflects the common-sense position that it is the totality of the workplace conduct that creates the working environment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also misapplied the fact that Captain Daugherty did not complain about the work environment until she learned that Mr. Hillen would be placed in her chain of command:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The degree to which the coffee pot incident in fact affected Captain Daugherty is not clear....&#8197;[A]Ithough Captain Daugherty was upset at the time by the unwelcome touching, she was not greatly concerned by this or other incidents until she learned of the appellant's placement in her chain of command.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Hillen IV</span>, 54 MSPR at 67. The position of the alleged harasser in relation to the employee is to be considered in evaluating the effect of the offensive actions on the employee's work environment. 8 F.E.P. Manual at 405:6689. It is indeed relevant if the harasser is more than simply an annoying presence, but is in a position to affect one's job. The Board erred in treating Captain Daugherty's heightened concern as diluting the force of her complaint, when in fact it was an exacerbating factor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2661"></span>The Board also erroneously required that the factfinder must "establish...by the preponderance of the evidence, that the conduct was of a sexual nature." <span class="Italic">Hillen III</span>, 50 MSPR at 298. Conduct that is based on the sex of the victim, whether or not the conduct is "of a sexual nature," is appropriately considered in determining whether an abusive or hostile environment has been created. "[S]ex-based harassment--that is, harassment not involving sexual activity or language--may also give rise to title VII liability...if it is 'sufficiently patterned or pervasive' and directed at employees because of their sex." 8 F.E.P. Manual at 405:6692 (quoting <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 833 F.2d at 1416). Application of this principle is seen in, <span class="Italic">e.g., Hall v.</span> <span class="Italic">Gus Constr.</span>, 842 F.2d at 1014, wherein the court observed that "[i]ntimidation and hostility toward women because they are women can obviously result from conduct other than sexual advances." In <span class="Italic">Bell v. Crackin Good Bakers, Inc.</span>, 777 F.2d 1497, 1503 (11th Cir. 1985) the court remarked that "[s]exual harassment can be...threatening, bellicose, demeaning, hostile or offensive conduct by a supervisor in the workplace because of the sex of the victim of the conduct."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That women who are the objects of discriminatory behavior because of their sex are able to maintain satisfactory job performance is not grounds for denigrating their concerns<span class="Italic">. Harris v. Forklift</span>, __ U.S. at __, 114 S. Ct. at 370-371. The criterion is not what a reasonable woman employee is capable of enduring, but whether the offensive acts alter the conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See McKinney v. Dole</span>, 765 F.2d 1129, 1138 (D.C. Cir. 1985) ("any harassment or other unequal treatment of an employee or group of employees that would not occur but for the sex of the employee or employees may, if sufficiently patterned or pervasive, comprise an illegal condition of employment under Title VII"); <span class="Italic">Carrero v. New York City Housing Authority</span>, 890 F.2d 569, 578 (2nd Cir. 1989) ("A complaining employee is required to prove...that the conduct was sufficiently pervasive to create an offensive environment antithetical to the priority of merit--not sex or some other prohibited criterion--in the workplace").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Offensive behavior when based on the sex of the employee is discriminatory and, when sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute an abusive or hostile work environment, violates Title VII and the EEOC Regulations. The Army Command was justified in applying a rigorous standard of workplace conduct to this senior executive, for Mr. Hillen's position of high authority at the Command could have contributed to the pervasiveness and severity of the behavior, and its perception as abusive and intimidating. This position, as Major General Small stated in the Army's decision, required strict observance of appropriate standards of conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As was reaffirmed in <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift</span>, psychological injury or interference with work performance are not predicate to a finding of sexual harassment. The Board erroneously required that these criteria be met. On remand the Board shall redetermine the correctness of the Army Command's removal action, in accordance with the EEOC Guidelines and Title VII, as discussed herein.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At the end of 1994, the Board issued its remand decision in <span class="Italic">Hillen</span>, imposing a 90-day suspension after considering various aggravating and mitigating factors. The Board again provided an extensive opinion summarizing the facts and the opinion of the Federal Circuit and explaining how sexual harassment could result from suggestive looks and other actions that cumulatively established a sexually hostile environment, <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Dept. of Army</span>, 66 MSPR 68, 74-75, 82, 84, 88-90 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Hillen V</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">--First, when an agency charges an employee with sexual harassment in violation of Title VII, as in this case, the agency is held to the same standard as an individual or a class of complainants who bring a sexual harassment case under Title VII. <span class="Italic">Downes v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We recognize that <span class="Italic">Downes</span> imposed a requirement that the appellant's conduct have seriously affected the alleged victim's psychological well-being, <span class="Italic">Downes</span>, 775 F.2d at 292, and that the Supreme Court subsequently ruled that this factor is not required for a finding of sexual harassment<span class="Italic">. Harris</span>, 114 S. Ct. at 371. Nothing in the <span class="Italic">Harris</span> decision, however, casts any doubt on an unrelated aspect of <span class="Italic">Downes</span>, i.e., the requirement that a federal agency that charges an employee with sexual harassment in violation of the EEOC regulations must meet the same standards as an individual who files a Title VII complaint charging sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">--Second, to establish a charge of sexual harassment under Title VII based on hostile environment, the agency must establish that the conduct was: offensive, based on the employee's sex, unwelcome, and sufficiently severe or pervasive to interfere with the alleged victim's job performance or to create an abusive work environment.[4] <span class="Italic"> See Hillen</span>, 21 F.3d at 1579.

<p class="Block-Quote1">--Third, in determining whether an environment is abusive or hostile, the totality of the circumstances must be considered. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11(b).

<p class="Block-Quote1">--Fourth, in evaluating the totality of the circumstances, it is error to view each charged incident of sexual harassment in isolation, because "in the usual case an isolated offensive incident does not create an abusive or intimidating environment." <span class="Italic">Hillen</span>, 21 F.3d at 1581.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although we conclude, <span class="Italic">infra</span>, that the appellant's conduct towards Ms. Ingerski and Ms. Parkinson did not constitute sexual harassment under Title VII, our finding that the appellant gave the four employees up-and-down looks is probative of the conclusion that his looks could be deemed offensive and/or sexually suggestive by a reasonable person.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant's manner of looking at Capt. Daugherty, standing alone, might not have created a hostile environment for a reasonable person, we find that the looks contributed to the hostility of her environment (and that of a reasonable person) when viewed in combination with his other conduct (the coffee pot incident, the elevator incident, and the phone calls). <span class="Italic">See Hillen</span>, 21 F.3d at 1582-83 (under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11(b), a reasonable person's perception of any one incident must be determined in the context of all of the incidents).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if we declined to limit the charges to those which the deciding official considered, we would not sustain the charge that the appellant's actions of frequently touching Ms. Byars on the shoulder(s) when speaking to her constituted sexual harassment. The evidence fully supports the administrative judge's findings that the appellant exhibited the same conduct toward male and female employees, and that Ms. Byars did not consider the appellant's touching of her shoulders to be sexual in nature....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a threshold matter, we find that the agency's charge that Mr. Hillen exhibited an "unusual interest" in Ms. Schaefer cannot, standing alone, state a cognizable charge of sexual harassment in violation of Title VII. Having an interest in something or someone is a passive mental activity. It is not until the interest manifests itself in conduct that a violation of Title VII can occur. The most reasonable interpretation of the agency's charge is that the appellant used his interest in Ms. Schaefer's career as a pretext to engage in conduct that constituted sexual harassment. Thus, the gravamen of the agency's charge is that the appellant sexually harassed Ms. Schaefer by giving her "sexually suggestive looks" while standing "very close" to her. Based on the language that the agency used in framing the charge and the testimony adduced in this case, it is evident that the appellant's action of standing close to Ms. Schaefer occurred at the same time that he gave her the allegedly sexually suggestive looks. We find, therefore, that the agency's allegations formed a single charge (that the appellant gave Ms. Schaefer sexually suggestive looks while standing very close to her) rather than two distinct charges or specifications. For the reasons given below, we sustain this charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's admissions, taken together with Ms. Schaefer's unrebutted <span id="Page_2662"></span>testimony, establish that he often gave her sexually suggestive looks that were unwelcome, that she experienced a hostile environment because of these looks, and that a reasonable person would have experienced such an environment. Although the appellant denied that his manner of looking at Ms. Schaefer was sexually suggestive, he admitted that he "may have looked at her up and down...." He also admitted that "it was possible that he had looked at some of the attractive women in the MTMC Headquarters in an up and down manner and that his looks may have made some of them uncomfortable." Ms. Schaefer's testimony that the appellant stood one to two feet away from her during these encounters was not rebutted by the appellant. The evidence establishes that the appellant's action of looking at Ms. Schaefer in an up-and-down manner occurred frequently (probably one to three times a week), and that these looks persisted over a year. In his own testimony, the appellant did not dispute Ms. Schaefer's testimony concerning the frequency and persistence of his "up and down" looks.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Schaefer's unrebutted testimony further establishes that the appellant's up-and-down looks made her very uncomfortable to the point where she changed her work habits to avoid any contact with him, e.g., she changed routes in the hallway if she saw him coming, sometimes diverting into other offices, or the stairway. Ms. Schaefer's statement that the appellant had not done anything to her which warranted a complaint does not resolve the issue of whether she experienced an abusive or hostile environment because of his conduct. As she explained in her testimony, she did not believe a complaint was warranted unless he touched her or "physically crossed that line...." Given the frequency and persistence of the appellant's up-and-down looks and their adverse impact on her work routine, we find that Ms. Schaefer experienced a hostile work environment because of the appellant's manner of looking at her, and that a reasonable person would have interpreted the looks as sexually suggestive and would have experienced a hostile environment because of the appellant's conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the agency's allegation that the appellant stood "very close" to Ms. Schaefer was not a separate specification but was an element of the appellant's conduct that occurred at the same time he was looking at her in an up-and-down manner. The definition of standing "very close" will vary not only from culture to culture but depending on the context. Under ordinary circumstances, we would not find that an appellant's practice of standing one to two feet from another employee while conversing could support a sexual harassment charge. Standing this distance apart during conversations is probably unremarkable in most work places under most circumstances. Ms. Schaefer's perception concerning how close the appellant stood to her, however, must be viewed in light of our finding that the appellant persistently gave her sexually suggestive looks during these encounters. <span class="Italic">Hillen</span>, 21 F.3d at 1583 ("the perception of any one incident [must] be determined in the context of all of the incidents"). Given the fact that the appellant was frequently engaging in sexually harassing behavior when he positioned himself one or two feet away from Ms. Schaefer, we find that a reasonable person would have experienced the distance between them as "very close" and that these circumstances would have contributed to a reasonable person's perception of a hostile or abusive environment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board denied OPM's motion to reconsider its decision mitigating Mr. Hillen's removal to a suspension. <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Dept. of Army</span>, 72 MSPR 369, 375 (1996); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Payne v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 419, 426 (1997) (in evaluating a sexual harassment charge, the Board considers the totality of circumstances rather than isolated offensive incidents, and the Board determines the cumulative effect of the conduct of the victim and the work environment); <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 72 MSPR 480, 486 (1996) ("A finding of whether a working environment is 'hostile' within the meaning of Title VII can only be determined by considering the totality of the circumstances.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, the Board recognized but avoided the question of when psychological evaluation as a discovery technique would be appropriate. Instead, the Board concluded that the effect could be presumed by the nature of the conduct or determined on the basis of the victim's testimony. Psychological harm need not be established if the sexual harassment had a demonstrably adverse effect on the employee's ability to perform her job. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Zimmerman</span>, 36 MSPR 274, 284 (1988) (psychological evaluation of victim was immaterial in religious harassment case; test was whether harassment would have adversely affected a reasonable person). Under <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Russell</span>, 32 MSPR 115, 120-22 (1987), an AJ considering a sexual harassment case properly refused inquiry during discovery into an employee's history of mental illness, or drug or alcohol addiction.
