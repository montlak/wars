<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-273"><span class="space">m.</span> Official Time</h5>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">UPTO and Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs, Northwestern Div.,</span> 64 FLRA 440, 441-42 (2010), explaining the availability of official time grants under the Statute and pursuant to contract, affirmed an award denying a grievance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the award is contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7102 and 7114 because it upholds the Agency's denial of official time. When an exception involves an award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews any question of law raised by an exception and the award <span class="Italic">de novo. See NTEU, Chapter 24, </span>50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Serv. v. FLRA, </span>43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). In applying a <span class="Italic">de novo </span>standard of review, the Authority assesses whether the arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">See NFFE, Local 1437, </span>53 FLRA 1703, 1710 (1998). In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7131 of the Statute sets forth the rights and restrictions associated with the use of official time.&#x2003;Subsections (a) and (c) guarantee union representatives official time for bargaining and certain Authority related activities, and subsection (b) bars the use of official time for internal union matters. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7131(a)-(c). The use of official time for all other types of representational activities is subject to negotiation under subsection (d), which provides that union representatives in the bargaining unit "shall be granted official time in any amount the agency and the exclusive representative public interest." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7131(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that the parties may negotiate all matters concerning use of official time under &#x00A7; 7131(d), including, as relevant here, which union officials may use official time. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Mine Warfare Eng'g Activity, Yorktown, Va.</span>, 39 FLRA 1207, 1213-14 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Navy</span>) (provision that official time allocated to union president cannot be allocated to other union officials is enforceable). Consequently, any entitlement to official time to engage in activities covered by &#x00A7; 7131(d) is a contractual, not statutory, entitlement. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Because any entitlement to official time to perform &#x00A7; 7131(d) activities flows only from the parties' agreement, the Authority has previously rejected the argument "that section 7114 of the Statute entitles an exclusive representative to perform representational activities of the type covered by section 7131(d) on official time." <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, 39 FLRA at 1214. Similarly, the <span id="page_2216"></span>Authority has stated that a limitation in the parties' agreement on the number of representatives entitled to official time "in no way constrains the Union in its statutory right to designate its representatives." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, HQ Air Force Materiel Command</span>, 49 FLRA 1111, 1120 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Air Force</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, there is no indication in the record, and the Union does not argue, that the DVP's official time requests were in order to negotiate or participate in Authority proceedings under subsections (a) or (c) of &#x00A7; 7131. Therefore, &#x00A7; 7131(d) applies, and any entitlement to official time in these circumstances must be based in the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">See Navy</span>, 39 FLRA at 1213-14<span class="Italic">. </span>Consequently, the Arbitrator's interpretation of the parties' agreement to find that the Agency properly denied the DVP's request for official time does not implicate the Union's right to choose its own representatives under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>, 49 FLRA at 1120. Accordingly, the Union provides no basis for finding that the award is contrary to law, and we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">B. The award draws its essence from the agreement.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reviewing an arbitrator's interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement, the Authority applies the deferential standard of review that federal courts use in reviewing arbitration awards in the private sector. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a)(2); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Council 220</span>, 54 FLRA 156, 159 (1998). Under this standard, the Authority will find that an arbitration award is deficient as failing to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement when the appealing party establishes that the award: (1) cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; (2) is so unfounded in reason and fact and so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the collective bargaining agreement as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator; (3) does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement; or (4) evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Labor </span>(<span class="Italic">OSHA</span>), 34 FLRA 573, 575 (1990). The Authority and the courts defer to arbitrators in this context "because it is the arbitrator's construction of the agreement for which the parties have bargained." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 576.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, Article 25.3 of the parties' agreement provides, in pertinent part, that "<span class="Italic">[i]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic">f </span>there is no Project Representative or Alternate at a project, at any given time, the [DVP]...may serve in the capacity of the Project Representative." The Arbitrator interpreted this wording to mean that a DVP may perform in the capacity of a Project Representative only when the Project Representative and Alternate positions are vacant. As one or more Project Representatives or Alternates were available, the Arbitrator found that the DVP was not entitled to official time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that nothing in the agreement makes a DVP ineligible for official time to perform project representational duties.&#x2003;In this regard, the Union argues that provisions other than Article 25.3 govern official time. With respect to the Union's reliance on Article 22, which addresses generally the Union's right to designate its representatives, the Arbitrator found that Article 25 limits the rights granted by Article 22. With regard to the remaining provisions cited by the Union, none of those provisions sets forth the circumstances under which a DVP is entitled to official time. <span class="Italic">See </span>Exceptions at 6-7 (citing Article 16.3 (delineating number of official time hours to be allotted); Article 16.5 (outlining official time request procedures and the basis by which the Agency can approve or deny official time); Article 25.1 (identifying procedure by which Union must notify the agency of employees designated as eligible to receive official time)). Thus, none of the cited provisions demonstrates that the Arbitrator's interpretation of Article 25.3 is irrational, unfounded, implausible, or in manifest disregard of the parties' agreement. Accordingly, the Union does not demonstrate that the award fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement, and we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 55 FLRA 322, 327 (1999), also summarized the scope of official time available to union officials and subject to review through grievance and arbitration procedures:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7131(b) of the Statute states that "[a]ny activities performed by any employee relating to the internal union business of a labor organization (including the solicitation of membership, elections of labor organization officials, and collection of dues) shall be performed during the time the employee is in a non-duty status." The legislative history of section 7131(b) indicates that this section of the Statute does not bar the granting of official time for representational and contract administration activities "related to the performance of labor-management functions contributing to the efficient administration of the agency[.]" S.

<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with Authority precedent, determining whether a union meeting concerns matters for which union officials may receive official time under section 7131(b), requires examining the "activities [associated with the meeting]...based on the particular facts and circumstances of each case." <span class="Italic">SSA General Committee,</span> 46 FLRA at 1123. In <span class="Italic">SSA, General Committee</span>, the Authority rejected the agency's contention that a union convention necessarily constitutes internal union business, and found that the arbitrator's factual findings that 1 day of the union meeting concerned internal union business, such as elections, and 4 days concerned general labor relations matters, such as representational issues, were sufficient under section 7131(b) to grant official time for the 4 days concerning general labor relations matters. <span class="Italic">See also National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, </span>38 FLRA 1366, 1368 (1991) (Department of the Treasury) (preparing records and reports required by Federal agencies is not internal union business); <span class="Italic">National Association of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, SEIU, AFL-CIO and Veterans Administration, Medical Center, Brockton/West Roxbury, Massachusetts, </span>23 FLRA 542, 543 (1986) (internal union business concerns the institutional structure of the union, but "[a]ctivities involving labor-management contacts, as well as preparation for them, are not internal union business"); <span class="Italic">Military Department of Arkansas,</span> <span class="Italic">Office of the Adjutant General, Arkansas National</span> <span class="Italic">Guard and Local 1671, National Federation of Federal</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, </span>23 FLRA 114, 115 (1986) (training in the conduct of union business constitutes internal union business); <span class="Italic">Fort Knox Teachers Association and Fort</span> <span class="Italic">Knox Dependent Schools, </span>19 FLRA 878, 885 (1985) (internal union business includes "union business meetings, communication with members, contracting for goods and services, payment of bills, and other similar and associated activities").</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 55 FLRA 322, 327-28 (1999), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, remanded the case for additional factual findings on the disputed issue of whether time spent by union officials at executive board meetings was compensable official time. The arbitrator's conclusion was supported by assumptions rather than factual findings as to how the time was spent.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA honors awards that interpret contract clauses that define official time entitlements, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 1929</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-024.html">61 FLRA 122</a>, 124-25 (2005),:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7131(d), parties may negotiate for the granting of "official time in any amount the agency and exclusive representative involved agree to be reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7131(d); <span class="Italic">see United States Small Bus. Admin., Washington, D.C.</span>, 42 FLRA 890, 900 (1991) (<span class="Italic">SBA</span>). In this case, the parties negotiated Article 7(A), which both parties agree provides that consistent with the Statute, local union presidents will normally be granted a reasonable amount of official time to perform appropriate labor relations duties, subject to workload requirements. Based on his interpretation and application of Article 7(A), the Arbitrator determined that the Agency violated Article 7(A) when it denied the grievant's disputed official time requests. The Agency fails to establish how this interpretation and application conflicts with &#x00A7; 7131 of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once the parties have agreed on the terms and conditions of &#x00A7; 7131(d) official time in their collective bargaining agreement, an issue of whether the parties have complied with the agreement becomes a matter of contract interpretation for an arbitrator, unless the contract provision is unenforceable. The Agency does not argue, and no basis is provided for finding, that Article 7(A) is unenforceable. Consequently, as interpreted by the Arbitrator, Article 7(A) is enforceable. As the Arbitrator was simply enforcing appropriate terms and conditions for granting official time under &#x00A7; 7131(d), the award is not contrary to &#x00A7; 7131. <span class="Italic">See SBA,</span> 42 FLRA at 900 (party failed to establish that the arbitrator's award enforcing his interpretation of parties' agreement of &#x00A7; 7131(d) official time was contrary to &#x00A7; 7131 of the Statute).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the Agency's public interest argument is misplaced. Parties in negotiating contract provisions for &#x00A7; 7131(d) official time must agree that the amounts of time to be granted under the provision are in the public interest. Section 7131(d) does not subject an arbitration award enforcing a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7131(d) to a public interest review. Accordingly, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">Considering the same contract article involved in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1929</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Chapter 249</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-22.html">71 FLRA 119</a>, 119-20 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting) vacated the award of an arbitrator who determined that the agency violated the contract by asking for information providing the reasons for a generally-stated official time request:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that &#x00A7; 7131(d) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statutes requires that an official-time request under that subsection provide sufficient information for an approving official to determine whether the request is consistent with an agreement that is <span id="page_2217"></span>"reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest." Because Arbitrator Benjamin Wolkinson's award absolved the grievant of the obligation to provide such information in this case, we set aside the award as contrary to &#x00A7; 7131(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background and Arbitrator's Award</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 7 of the parties' agreement (Article 7) states, in part, that "Union offic[ials]...will be authorized official time" for the matters listed in Section A.4, Subsections (a) through (h), such as investigating and preparing grievances, and representing the Union in labor-management meetings. Article 7 further provides that, except in circumstances not relevant here, a Union official must request official time from a supervisor in advance on the Agency's required form by designating the subsection that encompasses the relevant official-time activity, and providing the "estimated amount of time to be used." According to Article 7, the supervisor may approve or deny the request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union president (the grievant) requested sixty-four hours of official time. On the request form, the grievant listed Section A.4, and generally referenced Subsections (a), (b), (c), (e), and (f) as the reasons for the official time, but did not specify how much time he needed for each activity. While reviewing the request, the grievant's supervisor orally asked the grievant for additional information about the activities that the grievant would perform so that the supervisor could determine whether the amount of time requested was reasonable. When the grievant refused to provide any additional information, the Agency denied the request on the basis that the grievant requested an "excessive amount of time" without providing enough detail for management to determine how he would use the time. The Union filed a grievance over the denial.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, Arbitrator Benjamin Wolkinson found that Article 7 required the grievant to provide only the relevant subsections of Section A.4 in his official-time request. As such, the Agency could not ask the grievant for information, even informally, before deciding whether to approve his request. Consequently, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Article 7 when it denied the grievant's request as excessive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to law because it prevents the Agency from "gathering...very basic information" that the Agency needs to determine whether an official-time request should be approved.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7131(d) of the Statute states that, in order to perform the activities specified in that subsection--which include the activities at issue in this case--"any employee representing [a union]...shall be granted official time in any amount that agency and the [union] involved agree to be reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest." But, as relevant here, the parties' agreement does not allot the Union a fixed amount of official time for particular activities, or provide the grievant with a fixed percentage of his duty time as official time. Rather, Article 7 requires the grievant to specify which subsection of Section A.4 describes the activities that give rise to his official-time request, and to provide an estimate of the time needed. In turn, the article also provides that the Agency may approve or deny that request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even when parties have agreed to procedures for requesting official time, those procedures must allow an agency to gather the information necessary to make a reasoned determination about whether to grant or deny an official-time request.[10] Without sufficient information, an agency approving official cannot determine whether a request is consistent with &#x00A7; 7131(d). In this case, the Arbitrator denied the Agency's ability even to know how many hours of the grievant's official-time request would be used for each of the five broad categories of activities that the request included.[11] We find that, under &#x00A7; 7131(d), the Agency must be permitted to gather the information that it needs to determine whether an official-time request is reasonable.[12] To hold otherwise would render the act of <span class="Italic">requesting</span> official time superfluous.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cf. DOD, Def. Logistics Agency, Def. Depot Memphis</span>, 16 FLRA 1036, 1040, 1047-48 (1984) (although the parties' agreement specified how to record official time for certain activities, those procedures did not guarantee the union's vice president his desired amount of official time for union duties).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;In the award, the Arbitrator discussed at length previously issued awards by other arbitrators invoked by both parties that interpreted the agreement language at issue or official time requests generally. We note that while the Arbitrator considered these awards and found some to be persuasive, he did not conclude that any one award was binding upon him. <span class="Italic">See AFGE Local 2459</span>, 51 FLRA 1602, 1606-07 (1996). That is in keeping with the Authority's precedent that, in general, awards issued earlier by different arbitrators are not binding as precedent on later arbitrators or on the Authority. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Wash., D.C.</span>, 60 FLRA 966, 967 n.3 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;We note that this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">U.S. DHS, U.S. CBP, U.S. Border Patrol, El Paso, Tex</span>., 61 FLRA 122 (2005), in which the Authority denied a contrary-to-law exception based on &#x00A7; 7131(d) because the agency there did not argue that the arbitrator's interpretation of an official-time contract provision was unenforceable, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 125. In contrast, here, the Agency's exception is premised on its contention that, <span class="Italic">as interpreted by the Arbitrator in this case</span>, the parties' official-time provision is unenforceable because the interpretation is inconsistent with &#x00A7; 7131(d). Exceptions at 8-9, 12-14.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The decisions on which the dissent relies to criticize our holding are irrelevant.[13] Nor does this decision "violate[ ]" our precedent. It is for this Authority to interpret the Statute and, when needed, apply and clarify that interpretation. That this decision fills what appears to be a gap in our precedent is all the more reason why we must act. The award before us went so far as to effectively render null and unenforceable the agreement provision providing for the very act of <span class="Italic">requesting</span> official time, hence our decision today.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> Dissent at 6 nn.12-14, 7 nn.15 &#x0026; 21. Only one of those decisions even addressed whether an official-time provision, as interpreted by an arbitrator, was <span class="Italic">unenforceable</span>, and that decision had nothing to do with providing the information necessary to make a reasoned determination about whether to grant or deny an official-time request. <span class="Italic">Compare U.S. Dep't of Commerce, Nat'l Oceanic &#x0026; Atmospheric Admin., Nat'l Weather Serv</span>., 36 FLRA 352, 361-62 (1990) (rejecting argument that contract provision, as interpreted by arbitrator, was unenforceable because it allowed union representatives to receive official time without using "the most efficient means of transportation"), <span class="Italic">with Cong.

<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we grant the Agency's contrary-to-law exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">Reemphasizing that when a contract defines official time entitlements, the contract rather than the Statute is the arbitrator's proper point of reference, <span class="Italic">FCI Big Spring and AFGE Local 3809</span>, 62 FLRA 49, 50-51 (2007), declared:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Statute, parties may negotiate official time in "any amount" that they agree is "reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7131(d); <span class="Italic">see United States Small Bus. Admin., Wash., D.C., </span>42 FLRA 890, 900 (1991). "Once the parties have agreed on the terms and conditions of &#x00A7; 7131(d) official time in their collective bargaining agreement, an issue of whether the parties have complied with the agreement becomes a matter of contract interpretation for an arbitrator, unless the contract provision is unenforceable." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Homeland Sec., United States Customs and Border Prot., United States Border Patrol, El Paso, Tex.</span>, 61 FLRA 122, 125 (2005) (<span class="Italic">Customs</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, the parties' agreement contains several contract provisions governing official time. The Arbitrator did not specify which of those contract provisions she was applying.[3] However, the Arbitrator found that the parties' agreement precludes denials of official time that are "arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable or made in bad faith. Applying this standard, the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency's denial of the grievants' requests for official time was arbitrary and capricious because it was based exclusively on the advice of its attorney, who was also the Union's opposing counsel.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;We note that the Arbitrator's failure to specify the relevant contract provision does not render the award deficient. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Chemawa Indian Boarding School, Salem, Or.</span>, 49 FLRA 667, 677 (1994) (holding that the fact that an award does not address specific provisions of an agreement does not provide a basis for finding the award deficient).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency does not argue that the contractual standard for denying official time, which the Arbitrator applied, was unenforceable. Rather, the Agency claims that the remedy conflicts with Authority precedent because the grievants' requests for official time were not made in advance, with respect to the specific days and hours for which the Arbitrator ordered a remedy. Under Authority precedent, the prerequisites for awarding straight-time compensation to remedy a wrongful denial of official time are: (1) an employee requested official time to perform official time activities during the employee's regularly scheduled duty hours; (2) management wrongfully denied the request; and (3) the employee thereafter performed the official time activities on non-duty time. <span class="Italic">FAA,</span> 59 FLRA at 532. As Authority precedent does not establish specific requirements for official time requests, there is no legal support for the Agency's claim that, as a matter of law, the grievants' requests <span id="page_2218"></span>were not sufficient to support the Arbitrator's remedy. To the contrary, as previously explained, requirements governing official time requests must be negotiated and included in a collective bargaining agreement to be enforceable. In that situation, the Authority reviews an arbitrator's interpretation and application of such requirements under the essence standard, not as a matter of law. <span class="Italic">See Customs,</span> 61 FLRA at 125.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Arbitrator made all of the necessary findings to support her award of straight time compensation for the Agency's wrongful denial of the grievants' official time requests. Specifically, the Arbitrator found that the grievants requested official time to prepare for the EEOC hearing during their regularly scheduled duty hours; the Agency wrongfully denied the requests; and the grievants subsequently prepared for the hearing on non-duty time. Consequently, we conclude that the award complies with Authority precedent, and we deny the Agency's exception.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the instant case, we find that the award concerns matters pertaining to the amount of official time under section 7131(d). The Agency has not asserted or demonstrated the existence of an emergency or other special circumstances. Consequently, consistent with <span class="Italic">BATF</span> and <span class="Italic">MEPS</span>, the award does not impermissibly affect management's rights under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B)....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AAFES, Dallas and AFGE</span>, 53 FLRA 20, 24-25 (1997), also made the point that arbitrators' awards resolving official time disputes do not intrude on the right of management to assign work:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has specifically addressed in two different contexts the relationship between the work of an agency and an employee's performance of representational activities under section 7131(d) of the Statute. In both, the Authority determined that the performance of representational activities does not constitute the "work" of the agency within the meaning of section 7106 of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, in considering the meaning of the technology of performing work under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute, the Authority has held that performance of representational activities under section 7131(d) does not involve the performance of the work of an agency. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Council 214, AFL-CIO and Department of the Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command</span>, 31 FLRA 1259, 1261-62 (1988) (use of telephones during the performance of representational activities under section 7131(d) does not involve the technology of performing work within the meaning of 7106(b)(1)); <span class="Italic">accord Defense Logistics Agency Council of</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees Locals and Defense</span> <span class="Italic">Logistics Agency</span>, 32 FLRA 761, 763-64 (1988). Second, in considering proposals for the participation of unit employees as union representatives on joint labor-management committees for the purpose of making recommendations concerning conditions of employment, the Authority has concluded that such participation does not constitute the work of an agency because it does not involve the performance of official, prescribed duties. Accordingly, the Authority has held that such participation does not affect management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B). <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots, Marine Division, Panama Canal Pilots Branch and Panama Canal Commission</span>, 51 FLRA 333, 348-49 (1995); <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1482 and U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Mapping Agency, Hydrographic/Topographic Center, Washington, D.C.</span>, 44 FLRA 637, 676 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has also addressed the connection between the work of an agency and performance of representational activities under section 7131(d). In revising part 430 (Performance Management) of title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations, OPM rejected a suggestion that union officials be granted presumptive ratings of "fully successful." 60 Fed. Reg. 43,937 (1995). OPM concluded that it would be inappropriate to include the performance of representational activities in an appraisal of employee job performance. OPM explained that the appraisal of an employee must be based solely on the performance of work, duties, and responsibilities that accomplish the agency mission and for which the employee is accountable to the employing agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying these distinctions between the work of an agency within the meaning of section 7106, and the performance of representational activities under section 7131(d), we conclude that the awards in these cases are not contrary to management's right to assign work within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. To the extent the awards exempt the grievant from maintaining a fixed schedule for official time, this exemption involves time spent on representational duties only. Therefore, the awards do not affect management's right to assign work.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">When resolving exceptions alleging that an award violates management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, the Authority first determines whether the award affects a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Homeland Security, United States Customs and Border Protection</span>, 61 FLRA 113, 115 (2005). If it does, then the Authority applies the framework established in <span class="Italic">BEP</span>. Under prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either an applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a provision of the agreement that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. 53 FLRA at 153. Under prong II, the Authority considers whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done if it had not violated the law or provision in the agreement at issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 154.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the foregoing, we find that the Agency's exception fails to demonstrate that the award affects management's right to assign work. The Agency makes no attempt to show--and has not cited precedent showing--a connection--between the reporting requirement and management's right under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B). <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Transportation, FAA, Washington, D.C.</span>, 55 FLRA 322, 326 (1999) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>). Moreover, even if the right to assign work extends to requiring employees to report to supervisors before performing representational activities on official time, the Agency does not demonstrate--and cites no precedent demonstrating--that the right includes the determination of the methods by which the employee must report. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Agency's claim that the Arbitrator's award affects management's right to assign work, therefore, is a bare assertion and, under Authority precedent, will be denied. <span class="Italic">See VA Regional Office</span>, 58 FLRA at 552 n.3; <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Medical Ctr., Coatesville, Pa.</span>, 56 FLRA 966, 971 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Coatesville</span>); <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 55 FLRA at 326.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that the award affects management's right to assign work, as the Agency claims, the Agency has not shown that the award is deficient under either prong I or prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>. In this regard, the parties agree that the Arbitrator enforced the prohibition on discrimination in Article 16, Section 1 of the parties' agreement. The Authority has held that contract provisions substantively identical to Article 16, Section 1 constitute appropriate arrangements under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). <span class="Italic">See Coatesville</span>, 56 FLRA at 970 ("prophylactic provision designed to protect unit employees from discriminatory or retaliatory exercise of a management right based on union activity" found enforceable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3)). <span id="page_2219"></span>The Agency has provided no basis for the Authority to reach a contrary conclusion. Consequently, we find that the Arbitrator's award satisfies prong I. As to prong II, the award merely precludes management from enforcing the reporting requirement. Consequently, we find that the award constitutes a proper reconstruction and satisfies prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>. <span class="Italic">See Coatesville</span>, 56 FLRA at 971.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA found nothing objectionable with an award that enforced contract requirements concerning reporting of official time use, <span class="Italic">CREA and Library of Congress</span>, 64 FLRA 486, 490-91 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the award is contrary to law because the Arbitrator misinterpreted &#x00A7; 7131 of the Statute by requiring more detail in reporting official time than either the Statute or the parties' agreement requires The Union also claims that the Arbitrator's interpretation places a "chilling" burden on the Union's performance of its representational duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Union representatives are guaranteed official time for bargaining and certain Authority-related activities. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7131(a) and (c). Official time for other types of representational duties that are not specifically barred by &#x00A7; 7131(b) is subject to negotiation under &#x00A7; 7131(d), which provides that union representatives in the bargaining unit "shall be granted official time in any amount the agency and the exclusive representative involved agree to be reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest." The Authority has held that, in addition to the amount of time, &#x00A7; 7131(d) "makes <span class="Italic">all other matters </span>concerning official time for unit employees engaged in labor-management relations activity subject to negotiation...." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force. HQ Air Force Materiel Command</span>, 49 FLRA 1111, 1119 (1994) (quoting H.R Rep. No. 1403, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 59, <span class="Italic">reprinted in </span>Comm.

Print No. 96-7), at 705 (1979) (emphasis in <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>). Thus, parties are permitted to bargain over related contractual provisions; however, they are not required to do so. Once parties have agreed to the terms and conditions of &#x00A7; 7131(d) official time in their collective bargaining agreement, whether the parties have complied with the agreement is not a legal question; rather, it is a matter of contract interpretation to be resolved under the essence standard (unless the contract is unenforceable). <span class="Italic">DHS, </span>61 FLRA at 125.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Union has not asserted that Article XXXIV of the parties' agreement is unenforceable, the question is whether the Arbitrator's interpretation of this provision draws its essence from the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>As discussed above, the Union has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator's interpretation of Article XXXIV as requiring detailed official time reports fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement. The Union, accordingly, has not provided a basis for establishing that the award is deficient. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>(Authority denied party's contrary to law exception where party failed to establish that arbitrator's interpretation of provision dealing with &#x00A7; 7131(d) of the Statute failed to draw its essence from the parties' agreement or was otherwise unenforceable).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, consistent with Authority precedent, agency oversight of a union's time spent on representational duties does not necessarily chill or interfere with the union's exercise of its statutory rights. In an arbitration case where the parties had negotiated a fixed amount of official time for the union president, the Authority upheld an arbitrator's award that the union president was entitled to 100% official time, but "only if he can document that appropriate [u]nion business requires 100% of [the] work week." <span class="Italic">U.S. Small Business Admin., </span>30 FLRA 75, 78-79 (1987). Additionally, in the context of an unfair labor practice case, the Authority found that a supervisor was justified in asking employees who phoned a union steward at work whether their calls were related to business, the union, or personal matters, explaining that "this was a reasonable method of policing the contract which specifically limits the use of official time for Union activity to 'a reasonable amount.'" <span class="Italic">U.S. Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio </span>14 FLRA 311, 312, 329 (1984).</p>

<p class="noindent">An award may apply official time provisions that implicate working conditions of managers and supervisors. Those matters are permissive subjects of bargaining and, once negotiated, an arbitrator's interpretation and enforcement of a contract provisions may directly determine the working conditions of a manager or supervisor. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 66</span>, 59 FLRA 34, 36-37 (2003) (enforcing contract requirement that agency grant official time requests unless reasonable efforts have first been made to augment and reassign staff, including unit managers, in order to grant those requests).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the award is contrary to the Back Pay Act.&#x2003;When a party's exception challenges an award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews the exception <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 24</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">United States Customs Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). In applying the standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">See NFFE, Local 1437</span>, 53 FLRA 1703, 1710 (1998). In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1), an award of back pay is authorized only when an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the employee's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">See United States Dept' of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.</span>, 54 FLRA 1210, 1218 (1998) (<span class="Italic">DHHS</span>). An arbitrator's award of back pay must be supported by factual findings. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1219 n.9.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that the grievant suffered an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action as a result of the Agency improperly denying the grievant's official time requests. With regard to the second requirement for back pay, Congress has expressed its intent that the phrase "pay, allowances, or differentials" "cover everything" that an employee subjected to an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action "would have been entitled if the personnel action had not occurred." H.R. Rep. No. 32, 89th Congress, 1st Sess. 5 (1965). Consistent with this, the Office of Personnel Management Regulations implementing the Back Pay Act define "[p]ay, allowances, and differentials" as "pay, leave, and other monetary employment benefits to which an employee is entitled by statute or regulation and which are payable by the employing agency to an employee during periods of Federal employment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.803. Also, consistent with Congress' intent, the Authority has concluded that "pay" encompasses "legitimate employee benefits in the nature of employment compensation or emoluments[.]" <span class="Italic">DHHS</span>, 54 FLRA at 1221-22. In this regard, the Authority has determined that an award of "pay" includes restoration of regular pay, annual leave, and pay for missed overtime opportunities, but does not extend to reimbursement payments such as per diem. <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Ass'n of Gov't Employees, Local R4-6</span>, 52 FLRA 1522, 1527 n.3 (1997) (annual leave); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Med. Ctr., Coatesville, Pa</span>., 56 FLRA 829, 834 (2000) (missed overtime); <span class="Italic">Dep't of Def. Dependents Schs.</span>, 54 FLRA 259, 265 (1998) (per diem).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, there is no dispute that the grievant performed improperly denied official time during non-duty time and, thus, is entitled to straight-time pay pursuant to &#x00A7; 7131 of the Statute. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin., S.W. Region, Ft. Worth, Tex.</span>, 59 FLRA 530, 532 (2003) (&#x00A7; 7131 entitles an employee who is improperly denied official time to be paid for the amount of time the employee spent performing representational duties during non-duty time). As the grievant is entitled to this compensation under &#x00A7; 7131, such compensation is a monetary "benefit in the nature of employment compensation or emoluments[,]" and is not akin to a reimbursement payment. <span class="Italic">DHHS</span>, 54 FLRA at 1221-22; <span class="Italic">see also </span>H.R. Rep. No. 1403, 95th Congress, 2d Sess. 58 (1978) (describing official time as "paid time"). Further, the compensation at issue meets the definition of "pay" under the Back Pay Act because it is compensation to which the grievant is "entitled" by &#x00A7; 7131 of the Statute and which is payable to the grievant by the Agency. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.803. Based on the foregoing, we find that the compensation at issue constitutes "pay" within the meaning of the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to whether the grievant suffered a withdrawal or reduction of pay, the Arbitrator's findings, to which we defer, establish that the Agency improperly denied the grievant's requests to perform official time during duty time, that the grievant performed Agency work instead of duties on official time, and that the grievant also performed 25 hours of duties during non-duty time that properly should have been performed during duty time. The grievant was thus paid her regular pay for performing 25 hours of Agency work she should not have been required to perform and was not paid any amount for performing the 25 hours of duties for which she was improperly denied official time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that the grievant is entitled to be paid for the time she spent performing duties for which she should have been granted official time.&#x2003;As a result of the Agency's improper denials of the grievant's requests for official time, the grievant performed 25 hours of additional duties. By failing to pay the grievant for performing these duties, the Agency withheld pay to which the grievant was entitled under &#x00A7; 7131 of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Agency's violation of the parties' agreement constituted an unjustified and unwarranted personnel action that resulted in the grievant suffering a loss of pay. As there is a causal connection between the Agency's unjustified or unwarranted personnel action and the grievant's loss of pay, we find that the requirements of the <span id="page_2220"></span>Back Pay Act have been satisfied.[3] <span class="Italic">See Gen. Servs. Admin</span>., 55 FLRA 493, 496<span class="Italic"> </span>(1999). Accordingly,<span class="Italic"> </span>we deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;Because the Arbitrator properly awarded the grievant backpay under the Back Pay Act, the payment of interest on that backpay is required. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Def., Dependents Schs., Bulzbach Elementary Sch., Bulzbach, Germany</span>, 56 FLRA 208, 212 (2000). As the Agency did not contest the amount of interest to be paid, we do not address this issue further. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>In addition, for the same reason, the threshold requirements for an award of attorney fees under the Back Pay Act have been satisfied. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Def., Def.

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">USDA, FSIS and AFGE Nat'l Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals</span>, 62 FLRA 364, 368 (2008), sustained an award of restored leave and pay to union representatives who took leave to fulfill representational responsibilities when the agency disallowed the representatives from performing those duties in a telecommuting status:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator awarded restored leave and pay based on his conclusion that Union representatives used annual leave and LWOP to work at home as a "direct result" of the Agency's unjustified and unwarranted personnel action. This finding satisfies the causation requirement of the Back Pay Act. Contrary to the argument of the Agency, there is no rule that a remedy is limited to reinstating contract benefits, which in this case would involve only reinstating the past practice. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Justice, INS, San Diego, Cal., </span>51 FLRA 1094, 1098 (1996) (back pay awarded where agency violated contract provision excluding Sunday from basic workweek). Further, to the extent that the Agency's argument constitutes a challenge to the Arbitrator's factual conclusion that there was a direct connection between the Agency's violation and the Union official's use of annual leave or LWOP, the Agency provides no record support for its claims. It has, therefore, provided no basis on which to find the award deficient as contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent">In another telecommuting case involving official time, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 63 FLRA 157, 159-60 (2009), an arbitrator's back pay award was sustained, although FLRA suggested that a claim for incidental expenses could not be sustained without explicit statutory authorization:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator's Supplemental Award would provide overtime for nonduty time, which is unlawful under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5541, <span class="Italic">et seq</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that, when official time is wrongfully denied and representational activities are performed on nonduty time, &#x00A7; 7131(d) of the Statute "entitles the aggrieved employee to be paid at the appropriate straight-time rate[.]" <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Transp., FAA., Sw. Region, Fort Worth, Tex.</span>, 59 FLRA 530, 532 (2003). Applying the foregoing, the Authority has previously rejected arguments similar to those asserted by the Agency in this case. In particular, the Authority rejected an argument that<span class="Italic"> </span>backpay was inappropriate where an employee, who was denied compensation for official time that she worked on nonduty time, had performed and been compensated for her normal duties. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Agric., Rural Dev., Wash., D.C.</span>, 60 FLRA 527, 529 (2004) (<span class="Italic">Rural Dev.</span>) The Authority found that the employee was entitled to backpay because she performed "[twenty-five] hours of [a]gency work she should not have been required to perform and was not paid any amount for performing the [twenty-five] hours of duties for which she was improperly denied official time." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator found that employees who used nonduty time to perform representational activities were entitled to backpay because they were affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that resulted in a reduction in pay. There is no evidence or other basis on which to conclude that the Arbitrator's award of backpay encompassed overtime. Consistent with <span class="Italic">Rural Development</span>, any employee who performed representational duties during nonduty time and who has not been properly compensated for that work is entitled to backpay at the straight-time rate. <span class="Italic">See</span> 60 FLRA at 529-30. Accordingly, we find the award for backpay is not contrary to law and deny the Agency's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that any award that compensates employees for commuting expenses, or other personal expenses, would be contrary to law. The Agency concedes, however, that it "can only speculate" as to whether such expenses will be claimed in this case. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In this connection, the Union has not yet submitted information about claimed expenses, as ordered by the Arbitrator, because of the filing of the present exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Authority precedent, whether or not an expense may be awarded depends on factors such as whether there is a statutory basis for the award and whether the award is equitable rather than compensatory in nature. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Transp., FAA</span>, 52 FLRA 46, 50 n.6 (1996) (considering whether 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7901 and 8101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> permit payment for medical expenses under the Back Pay Act); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Transp., FAA, Nw. Mountain Region, Renton, Wash.</span>, 55 FLRA 293, 298-301 (1999) (discussing difference between legal and equitable monetary awards). The Authority will not uphold awards for legal remedies that are not allowed for by statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Serv., Los Angeles Dist., Los Angeles, Cal.</span>, 52 FLRA 103, 104-05 (1996). However, nothing in the Supplemental Award requires the Agency to reimburse Union representatives for expenses that are unlawful. In this regard, the Arbitrator merely required the Union to submit expenses and specifically acknowledged that if Union representatives "did not suffer any monetary loss, then there shall be no recovery." Accordingly, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator may not award compensation to union officers for official time beyond their regular duty hours unless there is a finding that they were precluded from using official time during their regular duty hours. Union officials cannot be paid "overtime," <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE Local 3369</span>, 52 FLRA 328, 330-31 (1996), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 52 FLRA 989 (1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has upheld awards of straight-time compensation when management wrongfully denies an employee's request for official time negotiated pursuant to section 7131(d) of the Statute, and the employee thereafter performs the official time activities on nonduty time. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Weather Service and National Weather Service Employees Organization</span>, 36 FLRA 352, 358 (1990). In these awards, the arbitrators found that: (1) an employee requested official time to perform official time activities during the employee's regularly scheduled duty hours; (2) management wrongfully denied the request; and (3) the employee thereafter performed the official time activities on nonduty time<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Local 1164, American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO and Social Security Administration Boston Region</span>, 19 FLRA 936, <span class="Italic">reconsideration</span> <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 20 FLRA 876 (1985); <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration and American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 3231</span>, 19 FLRA 932, <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 20 FLRA 876 (1985); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Headquarters Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 916</span>, 19 FLRA 890 (1985); <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration and American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO</span>, 19 FLRA 887, <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 20 FLRA 876 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In upholding these awards, the Authority stated that the fact that the activities for which compensation was sought were performed on nonduty time did not preclude an award of compensation because section 7131(d) does not require an employee to be in a duty status to be entitled to official time. However, the Authority found wrongful denials justifying compensation for official time performed on nonduty time only where official time activities <span class="Italic">would have been</span> <span class="Italic">performed during the employee's duty time</span>, but for management's denial of the official time request.[4] <span class="Italic">See Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, 2750th Air Base Wing</span> <span class="Italic">and American Federation of Government Employees, Local</span> <span class="Italic">No. 1138</span>, 23 FLRA 390, 394 (1986) (finding of a wrongful denial of official time was limited to the scheduled number of duty hours).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;The decision in [<span class="Italic">DHHS,</span>] <span class="Italic">SSA</span> [<span class="Italic">and AFGE</span>, 26 FLRA 12, <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 26 FLRA 781 (1987)], on which the Union relies, does not fully describe the circumstances concerning the finding of a wrongful denial of official time. To the extent that <span class="Italic">SSA</span> found a wrongful denial of official time where the official time activities would not otherwise have been performed during duty time, the decision is inconsistent with the otherwise uniform precedent on this issue, and we will no longer follow it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator found no denial by management of any request to perform official time activities during the scheduled duty hours of either grievant. Moreover, as each of the grievants was on 100 percent official time, there could be no such denial. In this regard, the Union's reliance on previous Authority statements that section 7131(d) does not require an employee to be in a duty status to be entitled to official time is misplaced. In the cases in which those statements were made, the grievants performed official time activities on nonduty time because their requests to perform the activities on duty time had been denied. Here, there was no such denial. Accordingly, we conclude that the Arbitrator's award of straight-time compensation is contrary to the Statute, and we strike that remedy from the award.</p>

<p class="noindent">An award of night pay was appropriate for Customs employees using official time, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU Chapter 160</span>, 68 FLRA 846, 848-50 (2015) (Member Pizzella concurring):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency makes a number of arguments that the award is contrary to law, all of which are premised on the proposition that it is unlawful for the Agency to pay night pay to officers for time that they spend performing representational activities. In response, the Union argues that COPRA permits the Agency to pay night pay for time that officers spend performing representational activities, so long as those activities occur during the officers' "regularly scheduled work hours."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Agency argues that COPRA "prohibits payment of night [pay] for representational activities." As discussed above, COPRA provides that customs officers are entitled to night pay "[i]f the majority of the hours of regularly scheduled work" of the officer occur during certain hours.[31] Although COPRA does not define "work,"[32] the Agency asserts that it defines "customs officer"[33] as an individual "performing those functions specified by regulation...for a customs inspector."[34] And the Agency argues that "functions specified by regulation"[35] means those functions found in the officers' position descriptions--not representational activities. For support, the Agency cites <span class="Italic">NTEU v. Weise</span> (<span class="Italic">Weise</span>).[38] In <span class="Italic">Weise</span>, however, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit explained that the premium-pay provisions of COPRA "turn on <span class="Italic">who</span> is performing the work," not "what functions" they perform.[39] In other words, the court held that customs officers are entitled to premium pay under COPRA and its implementing regulations based solely on their position and the hours that they work--not based on the functions that they perform during those hours.[40] Thus, <span class="Italic">Weise</span> does not support the Agency's argument. More importantly, the Agency fails to establish that representational activities that officers perform during their "regularly scheduled" night shifts cannot be considered "work" for purposes of night pay under COPRA.[41] Consequently, the Agency's argument provides no basis for finding the award deficient as contrary to law.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[41]&#x2003;19 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 267(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, the Agency argues that the Arbitrator improperly interpreted 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545 as authorizing night pay for official time. Section 5545 defines "nightwork" as "regularly scheduled work between the hours of 6:00 <span class="small-d">P.M</span>. and 6:00 <span class="small-d">A.M</span>.,"[43] but is silent as to the definition of "work."[44] According to the Agency, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.401(a), which implements &#x00A7; 5545, defines "hours of work" as "all time spent by an employee performing an act for the benefit of an agency and under the direction and control of the agency."[45] However, &#x00A7; 551.401(b) provides, in relevant part, that "hours of work" also includes "hours in a paid nonwork status,"[46] and &#x00A7; 551.401(d) provides that "[t]ime that is considered hours of work under this part shall be used <span class="Italic">only</span> to determine an employee's entitlement to minimum wages or overtime pay under the [FLSA], and shall not be used to determine hours of work for pay administration under...any other authority."[47] By its plain wording, &#x00A7; 551.401 neither defines hours of work for pay administration under COPRA (a different "authority") nor addresses representational activities.[48] Accordingly, the Agency provides no basis for finding that &#x00A7; 5545 or &#x00A7; 551.401 prevents the Agency from paying night pay for the time that officers spend performing representational activities during their "regularly scheduled" night shifts.[49] The Agency's argument, therefore, provides no basis for finding the award contrary to law.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[49]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that the award is contrary to law because the Arbitrator "wrongly concluded that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.424 implements COPRA." But the Arbitrator did <span class="Italic">not</span> find that &#x00A7; 551.424 implements COPRA. Instead, consistent with the Agency's acknowledgement that the meaning of "work" under COPRA is "undefined," the Arbitrator turned to other authorities, including &#x00A7; 551.424, to help guide her decision. Moreover, because the Agency has not demonstrated that <span class="Italic">COPRA</span> prohibits the Agency from paying the officers night pay, it is immaterial whether <span class="Italic">&#x00A7; 551.424</span> provides further support for the Arbitrator's interpretation of COPRA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Relatedly, the Agency argues that the award conflicts with Authority decisions concerning the entitlement to premium pay for official time, some of which discuss &#x00A7; 551.424. For example, the Agency cites <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2022</span> (<span class="Italic">Local 2022</span>),[53] in which the Authority held that, under &#x00A7; 551.424, "an agency may not schedule union representatives for overtime in order to permit them to conduct representational functions."[54] In <span class="Italic">Local 2022</span>, the Authority held that &#x00A7; 551.424 prohibits agencies from scheduling union representatives for overtime work if the only purpose for the overtime is to perform representational work.[55] And the Agency neither argues nor demonstrates that those circumstances exist here. Thus, <span class="Italic">Local 2022</span> does not demonstrate that the award conflicts with &#x00A7; 551.424. Moreover, as stated previously, &#x00A7; 551.424 provides that "'[o]fficial time' granted an employee by an agency to perform representational functions during those hours when the employee is otherwise in a duty status shall be considered hours of work."[56]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Agency argues that court and administrative decisions--including Authority case law--support finding that representational activities are not "work" for purposes of entitlement to night pay.[57] But none of the decisions that the Agency cites involve COPRA. Further, most of the decisions concern employees seeking premium pay for performing representational duties at times when they were not otherwise on duty.[58] For example, the Agency cites <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Transportation, FAA</span> (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>).[60] In <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, the Authority held that grievants were not entitled to premium pay for the performance of representational activities on Sundays and holidays.[61] But there is no indication in <span class="Italic">FAA</span> that the employees at issue worked on Sundays and holidays as part of their "regularly scheduled" administrative workweek.[62]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As mentioned previously, here, the Arbitrator found that the officers' official-time requests concerned periods when the officers "were otherwise in a duty status, during their regular working hours."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the decisions that the Agency cites to support this argument are inapposite in this case,[69] and provide no basis for finding the award contrary to law.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Authority has stated that official time is a type of time, distinct from regular duty time, in which an employee's activities are not directed by the agency but for which an employee is nevertheless entitled to compensation from the agency.[70] In this connection, the Authority has explained that both official time and regular duty time--unlike non-duty time such as periods of leave--"shall be considered hours of work."[71] Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court explained that "Congress used the term 'official time' [in &#x00A7; 7131 of the Statute] to mean 'paid time.'"[72] Applying the Court's reasoning, the Authority has explained that an employee "on official time under [&#x00A7;] 7131 is permitted to engage in particular activities, designated by the Statute, during the time when the employee otherwise would be in a duty status" because "[t]he purpose of official time is to permit employees to engage in these activities without loss of pay or leave."[73] And the Authority has found that official time "is time [that] counts toward the fulfillment of an employee's basic work requirement."[74]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, the Authority has held that employees who perform representational duties while on official time during their regularly scheduled work time are entitled to their regular compensation.[75] And the Authority has noted that an agency's failure to compensate employees fully for their use of official time has the foreseeable effect of chilling participation in representational activities.[76] This principle is particularly relevant in this case, as the Arbitrator found that the Agency's action "affect[ed] approximately two-thirds of the bargaining[-]unit employees..., who [were] no longer able to act in a representational capacity[ ] or seek the [U]nion's assistance to pursue grievances unless they...[were] willing to forego premium pay to which they are entitled." Thus, Authority decisions concerning official time support--rather than undermine--the Arbitrator's conclusion that the Agency could lawfully pay the officers night pay for official time under the circumstances of this case.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Agency argues that a different arbitrator found that <span class="Italic">FAA</span> forecloses night pay for the officers' official time.

<p class="noindent-1">In sum, none of the Agency's arguments establish that it is unlawful for the Agency to pay night pay to officers for time that they spend performing representational activities on their "regularly scheduled" night shifts.[84] Accordingly, we find that the Agency has not established that the award is contrary to law.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The award is not inconsistent with FLRA precedent and OPM regulations.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the award is inconsistent with the <span class="Italic">NTEU </span>cases [<span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 30 FLRA 690 (1987), <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 65</span>, 25 FLRA 373 (1987)]. The Agency claims, in this regard, that "the fact that a proposal may properly be the subject of...bargaining does not...render the proposal either meritorious or part of a contract." The Agency is correct that finding a proposal negotiable, as in the <span class="Italic">NTEU </span>cases, does not require agreement on the proposal. However, the Agency does not demonstrate how this fact renders the award deficient.

<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, we find that other Authority cases cited by the Agency for the proposition that the term "work" does not include the performance of representational duties on behalf of a union are inapposite in this case. Specifically, in none of those decisions did the Authority address whether employees may earn credit hours while performing duties on official time. For example, in <span class="Italic">AFGE National Council of HUD Locals 222, AFL-CIO</span>, 60 FLRA 311, 313-14 (2004), the Authority determined that an arbitrator's award finding that union representatives are not authorized to telecommute while on official time was not deficient. In so holding, the Authority found the union's reliance on <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 65 </span>to be misplaced because the issue of whether credit hours could be earned on official time was not before it. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 314.

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Article 2 by imposing additional requirements as preconditions to granting requests for official time and by denying such requests where those requirements were not met.&#x2003;Further, the Arbitrator ordered that grievants who could make a reasonable showing that they used nonduty time for Union representational activities after their requests to perform those activities on duty time were denied receive one hour of discretionary official time for each hour of official time denied, up to a maximum of 20 hours. In sum, the Arbitrator found that the Agency wrongfully denied employees' requests for official time to perform Union representational activities on duty time and afforded an equivalent amount of official time for hours spent performing those activities on nonduty time, up to 20 hours.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency's exception, the Arbitrator did not require the Agency to afford official time to grievants for performing Union representational activities on nonduty time that they would not otherwise have performed on duty time. The Arbitrator did err, however, in ordering that the grievants be granted official time, instead of straight-time compensation, for each hour of wrongfully denied official time<span class="Italic">. See Northeastern Region</span>, 47 FLRA at 1323. Consistent with Authority practice, therefore, the remedy will be modified to provide for straight-time compensation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Overtime compensation may be paid for representational work if the grievant is ordered or induced by the agency to continue work into the overtime hours, as <span class="Italic">FDIC Atlanta and NTEU</span>, 58 FLRA 623, 625 (2003), explained in the context of EEO representation that warranted official time under 29 CFR 1614.605(b):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542(a) permits overtime only for "hours of work officially ordered or approved." If reduced to writing, a directive or order to perform work beyond the standard forty hour workweek is officially ordered or approved<span class="Italic">. Crowley v. United States</span>, 53 Fed. Cl. 737, 789 (2002). However, even when there is no explicit directive or order requiring work outside the forty hour workweek, overtime work may be considered officially ordered or approved if the employee was induced to perform overtime<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the grievant, under <span class="Italic">Baylor </span>[<span class="Italic">v. United States</span>, 198 Ct. Cl. 331 (1972)], was entitled to overtime if her "overtime is incurred as a result of a regulation." The Arbitrator, however, misstated the standard for overtime entitlement articulated in that case. In <span class="Italic">Baylor</span>, the court stated, "if there is a regulation specifically requiring overtime promulgated by a responsible official, then this constitutes 'officially ordered or approved'...." 198 Ct. Cl. at 344. Thus, in that case, the court required the agency to compensate a group of employees for time spent performing certain pre- and post-shift tasks mandated by agency regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.605(b) does not require employees serving as representatives in an EEO matter to perform any tasks outside of their regular working hours. Instead, it merely establishes official time for employees who assume such representational responsibilities and contains no order or directive to any employee that requires that he or she perform work outside of his or her normal working hours. Accordingly, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.605(b) alone does not provide the basis for the awarding of overtime and the Arbitrator's ruling that it provided the necessary inducement is contrary to law<span class="Italic">. See Puissegur v. Runyon</span>, 1995 WL 242687 (1995) (29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.605(b) does not require agency to pay EEO representative overtime).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, there is no "officially ordered or approved" overtime in this case. However, the award is not contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542(a) if the grievant was induced by the Agency to attend the mediation session. In that regard, the Arbitrator's award is too ambiguous to resolve the inducement question. While the Arbitrator stated that he would not make a decision as to whether the Agency induced the grievant to attend the mediation session because his award based upon regulatory grounds mooted the need to resolve the credibility issue, he also stated that the grievant failed to meet her burden of proof on the issue of inducement. However, the latter conclusion cannot be reached absent a credibility determination concerning whether or not the Deputy Regional Director requested that the mediation session be continued beyond normal working hours in order to accommodate his travel plans on the following day. As the existence of that fact is central and integral to resolving the inducement issue, the Arbitrator's failure to reach that issue results in an ambiguous record that precludes our ability to determine if the award is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For this reason, we remand the case to the parties for re-submission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for a determination as to whether the Agency induced the grievant to attend the mediation session.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator cannot award compensation for official time denied if official-time activities were not performed, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 1929</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-024.html">61 FLRA 122</a>, 125-26 (2005):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the remedy is deficient because the Arbitrator failed to find that on the days he awarded compensation or recrediting of annual leave, the grievant performed 8 hours of official-time activities on nonduty or leave time. We conclude that the remedy is deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When official time authorized by a collective bargaining agreement is wrongfully denied and the representational activities are performed on nonduty time, &#x00A7; 7131(d) of the Statute "entitles the aggrieved employee to be paid at the appropriate straight-time rate" when the following requirements are met:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;An employee requested official time to perform official-time activities during the employee's regularly scheduled duty hours;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;Management wrongfully denied the request; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;The employee thereafter performed the official-time activities on nonduty time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin., SW. Region, Fort Worth, Tex.,</span> 59 FLRA 530, 532 (2003) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the compensation remedy meets the first and second requirements, but not the third. The Union argues that the record supports the remedy because the grievant testified that he had no choice but to do his best to accomplish the work on his own time. We disagree that this testimony demonstrates that the third requirement is met.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To support the compensation remedy, the Arbitrator needed to find, or the record would need to demonstrate, that on 43 workdays in a 6-month period, the grievant worked his regular schedule and thereafter performed 8 hours of official-time activities. The extent of the Arbitrator's findings in support of his compensation remedy is as follows: "On these dates [the grievant] requested official time, it was denied, and he reported to work on his regular schedule." The Arbitrator did not find that, on each of the dates on which he awarded 8 hours of compensation, the grievant performed "the official[-]time activities on nonduty time." <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 59 FLRA at 532. Similarly, the record, including the grievant's testimony, also fails to establish that the grievant performed 8 hours of official-time activities on nonduty time on each of the 43 workdays on which the Arbitrator awarded compensation. Accordingly, we vacate the award of compensation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because under &#x00A7; 7131(d) the only way a union representative may receive compensation while processing a grievance is to be on official time, an arbitrator's award was set aside that directed the agency to compensate the union officials involved in a grievance without charge to official time under their contract. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3615 and SSA</span>, 17 FLRA 955, 956 (1985). An award was set aside that granted administrative leave as a remedy for what the arbitrator construed to be an improper denial of official time for preparation for a grievance hearing. The now-defunct FPM did not permit the use of administrative leave for that purpose. The arbitrator should have awarded official time and not compensatory time or administrative leave. If official time is wrongfully denied and representational functions are then performed on other than official time, 7131(d) entitles the employee to be paid for the amount of time that should have been official time. <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE</span>, 19 FLRA 887, 889 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 55 FLRA 322, 326 (1999) (denying exception to award of back pay involving official time with observation that "[a] violation of a collective bargaining agreement constitutes an unjustified and unwarranted personnel action, within the meaning of the Back Pay Act."); <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v27/27-054.html">27 FLRA 391</a>, 399-400 (1987) ("In this case, the Arbitrator with respect to each bench decision essentially found that the denial of official time was in violation of the parties' agreement which had been negotiated consistent with the Statute. Thus, the Arbitrator effectively found that all of the conditions of section 7131(d) had been met including that there had been a wrongful denial of official time. Consequently, the Agency has failed to establish that the bench awards granting the grievants compensation for the amount of time performing representational activities which the Arbitrator ruled should have been performed on official time are contrary to law."). An award was set aside that granted administrative leave for union officials to attend union training pertaining to internal union business. Any activities of employees relating to internal union business must be on nonduty time. Because administrative leave constitutes an excused absence without charge to leave, an employee is not in a nonduty status and so cannot use administrative leave for internal union business. <span class="Italic">Office of Adjutant Gen., Arkansas NG and AFGE Local 1671</span>, 23 FLRA 114, 115 (1986).</p>

An arbitrator may order an agency to cease and desist from denying proper requests for official time in accordance with its collective bargaining agreement. The award does not affect management's rights to direct and assign employees, to assign work, to establish tours of duty, or to determine the numbers, types, and grades of employees. Section 7131(d), providing for negotiation of official time, constitutes an exception to management's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">AFGE and SSA</span>, 29 FLRA 1568, 1571-72 (1987).

If the contract provides a mechanism for resolving disputes over official time entitlement relative to workload requirements, the arbitrator's effort to establish a different procedure for addressing entitlement to official time will be set aside because the process established by the arbitrator does not draw its essence from the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 59</span>, 60 FLRA 506, 507-08 (2004).</p>

A supervisor may restrict use of official time by challenging the use of time previously granted and precluding its use if it is reasonably suspected that it is not being used for labor-management activities.

<p class="noindent">An award was upheld that directed that an employee be allowed official time and travel expenses so that he could attend a meeting and arbitration hearing concerning his grievance.

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that Article 10, section 4 of the parties' collective bargaining agreement "fairly clearly provides for official time" for employees who are participating in an arbitration hearing....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Agency acknowledged before the Arbitrator, section 7131(d) of the Statute authorizes a union and an agency to negotiate a provision granting official time for the time that employees who are union witnesses spend traveling to and from an arbitration hearing. Section 7131(d) does not require an employee to be in a duty status to be entitled to official time.... Employees are not entitled to overtime pay or compensatory time off for time spent attending an arbitration hearing as union witnesses, however, because that activity is not the performance of work officially ordered or approved so as to constitute overtime work under the Federal Employees Pay Act of 1945, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542(a).... Additionally, time spent by a union representative on nonduty time, outside of regular work hours, representing an employee at a grievance meeting is not hours of work under the Fair Labor Standards Act which would entitle the employees to overtime pay or compensatory time off under the FLSA.... Therefore, the performance of representational (labor-management relations) activities on nonduty time (outside regular working hours) is not overtime work....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, where official time, authorized by provisions of a collective bargaining agreement consistent with section 7131(d) of the Statute, is wrongfully denied and the covered activities are thereafter performed on nonduty time, section 7131(d) entitles the aggrieved employees to be paid for the amount of time that should have been official time.... The Authority has found that when an arbitrator finds a violation of the official time provisions of a collective bargaining agreement and awards official time to a grievant for the period that the grievant performed labor-management relations activity on his own time during nonduty hours, that award does not constitute a grant of overtime compensation which is inconsistent with law.... An award of official time under these circumstances only entitles the employee to compensation at the appropriate straight-time rates....</p>

<p class="noindent-1">...The Arbitrator's award of official time does not in any way affect the Agency's right to direct employees--that is, supervise and guide employees in the performance of their duties on the job....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award...does not directly interfere with the Agency's exercise of its right to schedule employees for travel or to assign work.... Rather, the award concerns whether, under the terms of the parties' agreement, the Agency wrongfully denied the Union's witnesses official time to engage in activities for which official time is authorized under section 7131(d).... Moreover, the Agency has not shown that it was impracticable to schedule travel during the employees' hours of work....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, an arbitrator's award enforcing the official time provisions of a collective bargaining agreement negotiated pursuant to section 7131(d) is not inherently deficient because the award affects management's right to assign work.

<p class="noindent">Official time disputes are resolved on their individual circumstances. FLRA declined to set aside an award that remedied the denial of official time for purposes of attending a union convention. FLRA rejected the agency's assertion that the award was deficient because all activities associated with a union convention necessarily constitute internal union business. Instead, FLRA accepted the analysis of the arbitrator that some of the time was compensable because it involved "general labor relations or representational matters" supporting official time grants. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE, SSA Gen.

<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Award is Not Contrary to the Hatch Act</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Hatch Act prohibits Federal employees' participation in certain political activities. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7321 <span class="Italic">et</span> <span class="Italic">seq.</span> Relevant legislative history indicates that Congress' underlying rationale in enacting the Hatch Act was to establish a nonpartisan civil service. <span class="Italic">See</span> S.

Consistent with Congress' intent, and as pertinent here, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7324(a)(1) provides that Federal employees "may not engage in political activity" while on duty. The Hatch Act's implementing regulations define "political activity" as "an activity directed toward the success or failure of a <span class="Italic">political</span> <span class="Italic">party</span>, candidate for <span class="Italic">partisan</span> <span class="Italic">political office</span>, or <span class="Italic">partisan</span> <span class="Italic">political</span> <span class="Italic">group</span>." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 734.101 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the Hatch Act prohibits only Federal employees' participation in political activities while on duty. In this regard, the Arbitrator made factual findings that the 1996 conference encompassed representational lobbying and training during duty hours, a political endorsement by the Union and reelection speech by the Vice-President during duty hours, and various PAC activities during non-duty hours. With regard to the 1997 conference, the Arbitrator made factual findings that lobbying and training on representational matters took place during duty hours, a "[PAC] function was scheduled outside normal <span id="page_2225"></span>working hours," and "there is no indication of any time being devoted to political endorsements." The Arbitrator awarded official time only for the duty hours that he found constituted lobbying and training on representational matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Agency challenges the findings underlying the Arbitrator's award, the Authority accords deference to an arbitrator's factual findings because the parties bargained for the facts to be found by an arbitrator chosen by them. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lowry</span>, 48 FLRA at 593-94. In view of the Arbitrator's factual findings, to which the Authority defers, the Agency has not established that the activities for which official time was awarded by the Arbitrator were "directed toward the success or failure of a political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 734.101. As such, the Agency has not demonstrated that any of the official time awarded by the Arbitrator encompassed activities falling within the definition of "political activity" set forth in the Hatch Act's implementing regulations. Accordingly, we conclude that the award is not inconsistent with the Hatch Act and, therefore, we deny this exception. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers</span>, 52 FLRA at 926-27.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Award is Not Contrary to 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3231</span>, 11 FLRA 7 (1983), the Authority rejected an agency argument that 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 prohibits Union representatives from conducting lobbying activities on official time. More recently, in <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers</span>, 52 FLRA 920, the Authority once again examined whether 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 prohibits the use of official time for union officials to lobby Congress. After considering the plain wording of the statute, its legislative history, relevant court decisions, and the administrative opinions of the Department of Justice and the General Accounting Office, the Authority concluded that authorizing official time for union officials to lobby on representational issues does not violate 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913. Specifically, the Authority determined that section 7131(d) of the Statute constitutes an express authorization to grant official time for representational lobbying and, therefore, section 7131(d) is an exception to the prohibition against lobbying contained in 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913. In <span class="Italic">Office of the Adjutant General, New Hampshire National Guard, Concord, New Hampshire</span>, 54 FLRA 301, 307 (1998) (<span class="Italic">New Hampshire National Guard</span>), the Authority affirmed its holding, regarding the use of official time for representational lobbying under 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913, in <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency has not provided any new arguments supporting a conclusion that the granting of official time to Union officials to lobby Congress violates 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913. Therefore, for the same reasons set forth in <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers</span>, and reaffirmed in <span class="Italic">New Hampshire National Guard</span>, the award is not contrary to 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913. Accordingly, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 61 FLRA 176, 177-79 (2005), reiterated, in the context of exceptions to an arbitrator's award, limitations of negotiability law imposed on use of official time of employees of one unit (the ATC bargaining unit) to serve the interests of employees of another unit (unit of support staff specialists):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7131(d) states, as relevant here, that "any employee representing an exclusive representative" shall be granted official time in any amount the agency and the exclusive representative involved agree to be reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest. It is undisputed that the <span class="Italic">matter</span> for which official time was sought in this case--the performance of representational activities--is a matter that can be negotiated under &#x00A7; 7131(d) of the Statute.[5] Rather, the only issue presented in this case is <span class="Italic">who</span> can receive official time under &#x00A7; 7131(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Accordingly, the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Council, </span>39 FLRA 546, which addressed whether &#x00A7; 7131(d) barred parties from negotiating over official time for matters other than labor-management relations activities, but did not address <span class="Italic">who</span> could receive official time under &#x00A7; 7131(d), is not relevant to the issue in this case. As such, the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Council </span>is misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue of who can receive official time as an "employee representing an exclusive representative" under &#x00A7; 7131(a) and &#x00A7; 7131(d) has been the subject of numerous Authority and court decisions. As the following discussion demonstrates, these decisions establish that employees who are not members of the bargaining units for which they seek to perform representational functions may not receive official time for the performance of those functions under either &#x00A7; 7131(a) or &#x00A7; 7131(d).[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Section 7131(a) of the Statute authorizes official time for "[a]ny employee representing an exclusive representative" in the negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement. Similarly, &#x00A7; 7131(d) applies to "any employee representing an exclusive representative[.]" The Authority has recognized that, under general rules of statutory construction, there is a presumption that the same words used twice in the same statute have the same meaning. <span class="Italic">See NLRB</span>, 38 FLRA 506, 520 (1990) (citing 2A <span class="Italic">Sutherland Statutory Construction</span> &#x00A7; 46.06, at 104 (Norman J.

Applying that principle here, where the same words are in related subsections of the same statutory provision, it is appropriate to consider relevant Authority and judicial precedent addressing both &#x00A7; 7131(a) as well as that addressing &#x00A7; 7131(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">United States Air Force, 2750th Air Base Wing Headquarters, Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio</span>, 7 FLRA 738 (1982) (<span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson AFB</span>), the Authority held that "official time entitlement under section 7131(a) accrues only to an employee, serving as a representative of an exclusive representative, who is a member of the bargaining unit to which the right to negotiate the bargaining agreement applies." 7 FLRA at 741-42 (footnote omitted). In so holding, the Authority considered "the overall scheme of the Statute" (including specifically &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101, 7103(a)(12), 7111 and 7112) and concluded that "[i]t is apparent...that the official time provision of section 7131(a) is intended to apply in the context of collective bargaining in an appropriate unit in an agency between the agency and employees representing the exclusive representative over conditions of employment which affect employees <span class="Italic">in that unit</span>." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 741 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, in <span class="Italic">United States Naval Space Surveillance Sys., Dahlgren, Va.</span>, 12 FLRA 731 (1983) (<span class="Italic">Naval Space Surveillance Sys.</span>), the Authority found that an agency has no obligation under &#x00A7; 7131(d) of the Statute to negotiate concerning official time for an employee to represent a union in a different collective bargaining unit in a different employer. The Authority's decision was affirmed in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2096 v. FLRA, </span>738 F.2d 633 (4th Cir. 1984). In finding that the Authority's decision "was wholly correct[,]" the court reviewed &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101(a)(1), 7103(a)(12), 7111(a), and 7131(a) and stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">It is apparent that the plain language and overarching statutory intent of the [Statute] are designed to emphasize the rights of employees within a given bargaining unit. Thus, the entitlement to official time under section 7131(a) properly applies only to employee-negotiators who are themselves members of the unit, and who are working to negotiate reasonable solutions to conditions of employment that directly affect the unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">738 F.2d at 635-36.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the court rejected the union's claim that the agency had a duty to bargain on the issue of official time for non-unit negotiators under &#x00A7; 7131(d). In this regard, the court reiterated that "a commonsense reading of the [Statute] reveals the congressional focus upon the employee unit/employer nexus as setting the stage for productive collective bargaining." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 636.<span class="Italic"> </span>Further, the court stated that &#x00A7; 7131(d) "appears on its face to expand the types of activities for which official time may be granted, not the classes of employee-negotiators who may receive reimbursement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.[7] In sum, the court found that "while management and labor are both free to establish and employ their own cadres of professional negotiators at their own expense, the [u]nion in this case may not use the official time provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7131(a) or (d) to compel employer subsidization of non-unit negotiators." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 637.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;The court reiterated this point about types of activities in its subsequent decision in <span class="Italic">United States Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 4 F.3d 268 (4th Cir. 1993). There, in rejecting an agency's argument that &#x00A7; 7131(d) specifies the only two situations for which an agency and a union may agree to provide for official time, and no other activities are subject to negotiation, the court stated that &#x00A7; 7131(d) "is not exclusive" as to the activities that it covers. 4 F.3d at 272 n.6.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;In addition, the court noted that "one can imagine a scenario in which there would develop a group of federal employees who did nothing but negotiate contracts, moving from unit negotiation to unit negotiation while being reimbursed for official time all along. While this result may be desirable from a policy standpoint, there is no indication that Congress ever intended such a result." 738 F.2d at 637 n.8 (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1592 v. FLRA, </span>744 F.2d 73 (10th Cir. 1984), <span class="Italic">aff'g Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command, Ogden Logistics Ctr., Hill AFB, Utah, </span>10 FLRA 245 (1982), the court agreed with both the Authority and the court's decision in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2096 v. FLRA</span> that &#x00A7; 7131(a), when read in conjunction with other provisions of the Statute, "adopts a unit approach to collective bargaining[ ]" and that it "precludes granting official time to non-unit negotiators." 744 F.2d at 75, 76. The court emphasized that "employees are entitled to have a voice in<span class="Italic"> their own</span> working conditions at government expense, not the working conditions of every federal employee.... [W]hile union negotiators need not be barred from participating in collective bargaining on behalf of units other than their own, we do not believe that the [agency] must absorb the cost." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 76 (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority subsequently applied these decisions and their reasoning <span id="page_2226"></span>in finding that employees who are not members of the bargaining units for which they seek to perform representational functions may not receive official time under &#x00A7; 7131(d) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NFFE, Local 405</span>, 20 FLRA 354, 356 (1985) ("section 7131(d) does not authorize bargaining" on a proposal to grant official time for union representatives employed in one bargaining unit to represent employees employed in a different bargaining unit);<span class="Italic"> AFGE, Local 1698</span>, 17 FLRA 557, 559 (1985) ("section 7131(d) does not authorize bargaining" on a proposal that would grant official time for a bargaining unit employee to conduct representational functions in other bargaining units);<span class="Italic"> NAGE, Local R7-23</span>, 16 FLRA 650, 652 (1984) (a bargaining proposal to grant an agency employee who is a member of one bargaining unit to represent employees who are included in another unit in the agency "does not pertain to conditions of employment of unit employees and...section 7131(d) does not operate to otherwise permit bargaining over official time for non-unit employees"); s<span class="Italic">ee also</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Defense, Dep't of the Air Force, San Antonio Air Logistics Ctr., Kelly Air Force Base, Tex.</span>, 15 FLRA 998 (1984) (agency was not obligated to bargain over granting official time to an employee who was not a member of the unit for which the representational functions were to be performed); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy, Naval Constr. Battalion Ctr., Port Hueneme, Cal.</span>, 14 FLRA 360 (1984) (same).[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;In some of these cases, the different bargaining units were in different agencies; in other cases, the different bargaining units were in the same agency. This distinction is not dispositive for purposes of analysis because the focus under &#x00A7; 7131 of the Statute is on the relationship of the employee representative to the bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, Authority and judicial precedent applying &#x00A7; 7131 confirms that Congress adopted a unit approach to official time for representational activities, and in so doing prohibited the granting of official time under &#x00A7; 7131(d) for union representatives employed in one bargaining unit to represent employees employed in a different bargaining unit. Consequently, the Statute precludes enforcement of a contractual provision which would authorize official time under &#x00A7; 7131(d) for an employee to perform union representational activities, when the employee is not a member of the bargaining unit to be represented.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the official time provided by Article 2 pertains to union representational activities performed by a union representative, the interpretation and enforcement of Article 2 to entitle a nonunit union representative to &#x00A7; 7131(d) official time for representational activities is inconsistent with &#x00A7; 7131 of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For these reasons, the award is deficient as contrary to the Statute and will be set aside.[10]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;Finally, as stated above, the Agency acknowledged that the Union has the right to designate the employee as its regional office representative. We emphasize that nothing in this decision should be read as affecting the Union's right to so designate the employee. Moreover, nothing in this decision precludes the employee from using non-duty time to represent the SSS bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award did not violate sovereign immunity or require an improper expenditure of appropriated funds that directed the parties to negotiate over costs or compensation that the union incurred as a result of the agency's refusal to permit the grievant to work in the union office. <span class="Italic">SSA Baltimore and AFGE Council 220</span>, 60 FLRA 32, 34 (2004) (case evolved from dispute over allocation of "national office bank time" under negotiated agreement).</p>
<p class="noindent">Compensation is the usual predicate of an official time dispute. Arbitrators may address other matters. <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 138 and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 61 FLRA 642 (2006), considered whether contract provisions permitted a union official on 100% official time to avoid wearing a uniform during his tour of duty, including times when he was engaged in union-related duties. [Concerning entitlements of union officials to forms of compensation for time spent on representational duties, refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-17-274.html#sec9-271">Statutory Pay Systems; Statutory Pay Premiums; Bonuses</a>"; refer to <a href="0100-2023-11-001.html#sec3-1">Chapters 3</a> and <a href="0100-2023-12-001.html#sec4-1">4</a> concerning statutory and negotiated grants of official time.] Many decisions in this section were issued before E.O. 13,837 in May 2018 (revoked by President Biden in January 2021), curtailing official time and allowable expenses for union representatives.
