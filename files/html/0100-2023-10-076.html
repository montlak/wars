<h5 class="h5" id="sec3-76"><span class="space">b.</span> Bifurcated Hearing</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ controls receipt of evidence to avoid unduly long hearings as long as the parties are provided due process. In an appeal involving a large number of charges, the Board considered unobjectionable an AJ's order that the hearing be "bifurcated." The agency was told to choose three or four specifications it wished to prove under each charge. If the AJ did not sustain the charge based on the chosen specifications, the agency would then be allowed a subsequent opportunity to present evidence on additional specifications to prove the charge. <span class="Italic">Wildberger v. SBA</span>, 63 MSPR 338, 347-48 n.6 (1994) (112 specifications of alleged misconduct). Following remand and a second PFR, the Board provided some elaboration on bifurcation, <span class="Italic">Wildberger v. SBA</span>, 65 MSPR 673, 677-78 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also requests that the Board clarify his "right to present evidence and testimony on all charges and specifications, as they relate to his affirmative defenses," which right would be abrogated by allowing the administrative judge to "bifurcate" this appeal. The Board previously held that the administrative judge did not abuse her discretion in ruling that she would "bifurcate" this appeal by allowing the agency to choose three or four specifications it wished to prove under each charge, and, if she did not sustain the charge based on the chosen specifications, allowing the agency a subsequent opportunity to present evidence on additional specifications to prove the charge. <span class="Italic">Wildberger,</span> 63 MSPR at 347 n.6. The Board noted in this regard that this appeal involved 112 specifications of misconduct under five charges and that such a bifurcation may become unnecessary on remand "depending on the extent to which the issues are limited by the parties' stipulations or by other means." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The appellant contends that such a "bifurcation" would be unfair to him because, in the event his affirmative defenses related to the specifications of charges not initially selected by the agency, he would be deprived of the opportunity to prevail initially based on his affirmative defenses and would be forced to depend on the agency's selection of particular specifications to present, and prevail on, his affirmative defenses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It appears from the record that the appellant's affirmative defenses consist of claims of procedural error, improper motivation of the proposing and deciding officials, retaliation for union activity, and reprisal for whistleblowing activity. Although the affirmative defenses the administrative judge would be willing to entertain may change based on the appellant's prehearing submissions filed below or as subsequently supplemented, it appears that the affirmative defenses the appellant intends to raise relate to the removal action as a whole and not to particular specifications of the charges. Nor does he specify on petition for review the affirmative defenses he intends to raise and whether they pertain to particular specifications of charges rather than the removal action as a whole. We therefore find that the appellant's general argument in this regard is without merit. Nonetheless, we instruct the administrative judge to exercise caution in the event she "bifurcates" this appeal, so as to avoid depriving the appellant of an opportunity to present any and all nonfrivolous affirmative defenses in the first proceeding.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dick v. VA</span>, <a href="https://openjurist.org/290/f3d/1356/dick-v-department-of-veterans-affairs">290 F.3d 1356</a>, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (partially overruled on other grounds, <span class="Italic">Garcia v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-federal-circuit/1143912.html">437 F.3d 1322</a> (Fed. Cir. 2006) (bifurcated, or limited merits, hearing is appropriate for the Board, following authority granted to federal judges under federal civil procedure rules allowing separate trials of particular issues)<span class="Italic">. But see</span> <span class="Italic">Chlodnicki v. Dept. of Army</span>, 39 MSPR 376, 378-79 (1989) (appeal remanded after the AJ limited the agency to proof of no more than half of 44 specifications supporting five charges comprising rudeness, discourtesy, failure to follow instructions, AWOL, loafing, and failure to learn the job; the AJ should have allowed the agency to prove all the specifications supporting its charges).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Additional guidance concerning bifurcation of hearings arrived with <span class="Italic">Stein-Verbit v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 72 MSPR 332, 338-42 (1996), warning AJs to approach bifurcation with caution in adverse action appeals and to be mindful of the distinction between charges and specifications supporting charges:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, during a November 9, 1995 prehearing conference, the administrative judge informed the parties that she would bifurcate the hearing, and she directed the agency to select fewer than all of the charges on which to present evidence. The administrative judge explained that, if she determined that the charges selected by the agency were not sustained, she would order a second hearing to allow the agency to present evidence on additional charges. The agency selected five out of its thirteen charges. The Board has previously approved of a similar procedure in <span class="Italic">Wildberger v. Small Business Administration</span>, 65 MSPR 673, 677-78 (1994), in which the agency brought five charges containing 112 specifications of misconduct and the administrative judge directed the agency to select three or four specifications that it wished to prove under each charge. For the following reasons, we find that the decision to bifurcate a Board appeal is a matter committed to the sound discretion of an administrative judge in accordance with the guidance set forth below, and that the administrative judge in this appeal abused her discretion by ordering bifurcation under the circumstances of this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bifurcation first became available as a judicial procedure in 1938 with the enactment of Rule 42(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Doyle W. Curry &#x0026; Rosemary T. Snider, <span class="Italic">Bifurcated Trials: How to Avoid Them--How to Win Them</span>, Trial, Mar. 1988, at 47. Rule 42(b), as amended in 1966, provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The court, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any claim...or of any separate issue...always preserving inviolate the right of trial by jury....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fed.R.Civ.P. 42(b). The Advisory Committee Note to the 1966 amendment of the rule stated that bifurcation "is not to be routinely ordered." 12 Charles A. Wright &#x0026; Arthur R. Miller, <span class="Italic">Federal Practice and Procedure</span> app. C at 475 (1973). Separate trials have been found to be appropriate where a single issue may be dispositive of the case or is likely to lead the parties to negotiate a settlement, such as in the separate adjudication of liability and damages. 9 Wright &#x0026; Miller &#x00A7; 2388 (1995). It has also traditionally been found appropriate to bifurcate issues of jurisdiction and timeliness from the merits of an action. Commercial and Federal Litigation Section, New York State Bar Association, <span class="Italic">The Mini-Trial: Bifurcation as an Efficient Device to Promote the Resolution of Civil Cases</span>, 53 Albany L.Rev. 19, 21 (1988). In contract and commercial law, issues such as the capacity to contract, the authenticity of a signature, and third-party beneficiary status, to name a few examples, have been identified as amenable to bifurcation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 22.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The principal policies underlying Rule 42(b) are to further the convenience of the parties and the court, to avoid prejudice to any party, and to minimize expense and delay. Underlying these policies is the principal goal of determining which procedures will more likely result in a just and expeditious final disposition of the litigation. 9 Wright &#x0026; Miller &#x00A7; 2388.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has found bifurcation to be appropriate in actions based on unacceptable performance brought under 5 USC ch. 43. In such cases, an agency may demote or remove an employee for unacceptable performance by showing that the employee failed to meet established performance standards in one or more critical elements of his position<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4301(3), 4303(a). We have held that an agency need only prove by substantial evidence that the employee failed to perform acceptably in one critical element. <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Department of the Army</span>, 50 MSPR 412, 421 (1991). Further, the Board has held, with court approval, that we lack the authority to mitigate an agency's penalty determination in Chapter 43 cases. <span class="Italic">Lisiecki v. Federal Home Loan Bank Board</span>, 23 MSPR 633, 643-46 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 769 F.2d 1558 (Fed. Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 475 U.S. 1108, 106 S. Ct. 1514, 89 L. Ed.2d 913 (1986). Thus, in chapter 43 performance cases, an agency's submission of substantial evidence showing that the employee's performance was unacceptable in one bifurcated critical element will result in a final disposition of the case. The failure to consider performance under other critical elements has no impact on the disposition of the appeal because there is no possibility of mitigation and, hence, no need to consider cumulative evidence of unacceptable performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, bifurcation is an appropriate and efficient means of adjudicating issues of timeliness and jurisdiction. A decision that an appeal is untimely <span id="Page_1373"></span>or that there is no jurisdiction over the appeal is a final disposition of all aspects of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, bifurcation of charges in adverse action appeals brought under 5 USC ch. 75 is not so clearly appropriate. Unlike chapter 43 performance appeals, there is no basis in an adverse action appeal for finding that sustaining only one misconduct charge will render other charges irrelevant or nondispositive. Instead, if the administrative judge finds that the agency sustained the charges that went to hearing, the charges that did not go to hearing are neither dismissed nor withdrawn; they remain on an employee's record as if they were sustained when, in fact, they were not adjudicated at all. Nor is there any basis for considering an employee's request for a correction of his personnel record to indicate which charges were sustained and which were not adjudicated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, unlike a chapter 43 performance appeal, the Board has the authority to mitigate an agency's penalty determination in a chapter 75 adverse action appeal. Bifurcation of charges, therefore, may complicate the Board's evaluation of an agency's penalty determination because the agency's penalty determination was made on the basis of all of the charges, not merely those that were ultimately sustained by the Board. <span class="Italic">See White v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 71 MSPR 521, 526 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are certainly cases in which an agency may be able to show that its penalty determination is warranted based on only those charges which it pursues in a bifurcated hearing, even though its determination was originally based on the deciding official's consideration of all of the charges. It would seem, however, that bifurcation prevents mitigation unless all of the charges are eventually heard. In a hypothetical situation, in which an agency brings ten charges, the administrative judge issues a bifurcation order directing the agency to select five of its charges to take to hearing, and the agency proves its five charges but the administrative judge (or even the Board on petition for review) determines that the penalty is excessive for those five charges, the agency would then have to be afforded the opportunity to prove more charges in order to show that its penalty determination was appropriate. In such circumstances, any efficiency initially achieved by bifurcation is negated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, bifurcating charges in a chapter 75 adverse action appeal has important implications for an appellant's right to a hearing. Rule 42(b) specifically states that the rule must be applied in such a way as to preserve inviolate the right to trial by jury. Fed.R.Civ.P. 42(b). Convenience and economy are not permitted to cut off fundamental rights. Bifurcating charges in cases such as the instant one gives the administrative judge the discretion to tell the appellant that she may have a hearing on only <span class="Italic">some</span> charges and the agency and the administrative judge will decide <span class="Italic">which</span> charges are to be heard. Bifurcation, as the administrative judge has applied it in this appeal, therefore denies the appellant's right to a hearing on the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are circumstances in which bifurcation would be an appropriate and efficient way to adjudicate cases involving many specifications of misconduct. <span class="Italic">Wildberger v. Small Business Administration</span>, 65 MSPR 673 (1994), was such a case. However, in <span class="Italic">Wildberger,</span> the agency was permitted to submit evidence to prove each of its five charges, although not all 112 of its specifications. In this appeal, by contrast, the administrative judge ordered the agency to choose only some of its charges, leaving eight charges unprosecuted but not formally withdrawn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The distinction between charges and specifications is significant because an agency can prove a charge simply by proving one specification under that charge. <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Department of the Army</span>, 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990). On the other hand, proving ten specifications under a single charge proves only that single charge; any remaining charges that the agency was required to abandon remain unproven. For these reasons, the penalty and mitigation concerns noted above are less significant in cases involving the bifurcation of specifications as opposed to the bifurcation of entire charges. Likewise, as we recognized in <span class="Italic">Wildberger</span>, there are some instances in which bifurcation could prejudice an appellant's ability to meet her burden of proof on any affirmative defenses she elected to raise, particularly if an affirmative defense is in the nature of a rebuttal to a specific charge that the agency elected not to pursue. <span class="Italic">Wildberger</span>, 65 MSPR at 678.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We discern nothing to support the administrative judge's decision to bifurcate the charges in this proceeding other than any efficiencies achieved by simplifying the hearing. However, such simplification may be illusory in view of the possibility of mitigating the penalty inherent in any appeal, and of the appellant's inability to seek correction of her personnel records. We find, therefore, that the interest in simplifying the hearing in this case is outweighed by the incursion on the appellant's right to present a full defense and to have a meaningful right to a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the decision to bifurcate is within the discretion of the administrative judge, administrative judges should exercise caution in ordering bifurcation.[3] We find that the administrative judge abused her discretion by bifurcating the charges under the circumstances of this case. We therefore vacate the administrative judge's ruling bifurcating the hearing in this appeal. On remand, the administrative judge shall afford the appellant a hearing on all of the charges brought by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Department of the Army,</span> 30 MSPR 119 (1986), in reference to the administrative judge's prehearing request that the agency proceed only on the most serious charges, the Board held:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">To the extent that this request can be construed as directing the agency to not present evidence on all the charges, it was error: an agency has the right to present evidence on all its charges subject to the presiding official's discretion to exclude evidence which is unduly repetitious.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 122 n.2. To the extent that <span class="Italic">Lizut</span> can be read to forbid bifurcation in all circumstances, that decision is hereby clarified. Nevertheless, consistent with the guidance announced in this decision, we expect that bifurcation will not be routinely ordered.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit concluded there was no abuse of discretion in an AJ's bifurcation of a case involving jurisdictional issues, <span class="Italic">Crockett v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP No. 02-3274):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Crockett's arguments about the excluded witnesses fail to persuade us that they were relevant to whether or not she made protected disclosures. Nor has she shown prejudice. To the extent that evidence excluded pertained to questions other than the protected disclosures, even assuming that the AJ abused his discretion, such error would be harmless because we have affirmed the AJ's findings of no protected disclosures (as explained above). Moreover, since every tribunal must assure itself of its jurisdiction before reaching the merits, it was not an abuse of discretion under the circumstances of this case to exclude witnesses or other evidence on the merits, pending the AJ's ruling on jurisdiction....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act significantly restricted the Board's ability to bifurcate components of a whistleblowing case. Before the legislation the Board allowed AJs to permit an agency to put on proof first in an IRA case showing that the agency would have taken the challenged action notwithstanding whistleblowing under a "clear and convincing" evidentiary standard. If the agency met the burden, that was the end of the appeal. Under the 2012 legislation, the appellant should be able to put in his or her case first, including all evidence of reprisal, and the agency then rebuts the appellant's case through the "clear and convincing" evidentiary showing or other defense to the appeal. [Refer to Chapter 4, "<a href="0100-2023-11-010.html#sec4-11">Erroneous Exclusion of Evidence</a>," and in Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-111.html#sec16-110">Damages; Regulation Governing Recovery</a>," concerning 5 CFR 1201.201 and the use of bifurcation and addendum proceedings to determine compensatory and consequential damages; refer to Chapter 13, "<a href="0100-2023-20-093.html#sec13-85">Variations in Order of Proof; Necessity to Develop Evidence, Consider Entire Record; <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span></a>," for order of proof in whistleblowing reprisal IRA appeals.]</p>
