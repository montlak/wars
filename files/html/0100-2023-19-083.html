<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-79"><span class="space">12.</span> Suggesting Nonapparent Accommodation; Duty of Reasonable Inquiry</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The burden is on the employee to identify the nature of his disability with sufficient clarity to enable the agency to initiate an inquiry into whether appellant's specific disability may be accommodated without undue hardship. Often the facts necessary to a determination concerning the viability of reasonably accommodating a disabled employee are particularly within the knowledge of the agency. It is then the agency's responsibility to ascertain what avenues of job restructuring would enable it to comply with accommodative requirements. If possible accommodations are not apparent, especially if an agency has in good faith but unsuccessfully attempted some accommodation, the appellant should articulate additional possible accommodations that he believes will enable him to perform the essential functions of his position. <span class="Italic">Ziemba v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 7 MSPR 28, 31-32 &#x0026; n.3, 6 MSPB 638 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Henson v. USPS</span>, 110 MSPR 624, 628 &#x00B6; 7, 2009 MSPB 38 (2009) ("Our examination of the record likewise does not show that the appellant ever articulated any accommodation. Accordingly, he failed to meet his burden of proof on the affirmative defense of disability discrimination."). A request for a return to work with restrictions on lifting or other activities to meet medical requirements or limitations that are made known to the employer is a request for accommodation. <span class="Italic">Simpson v. USP</span>S, 113 MSPR 346, 353 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16, 2010 MSPB 43 (2010); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">McDermott v. USPS</span>, SF-0752-13-0633-I-1 (NP 10/13/2015) ("We also agree with the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's request that the agency cease its use of a newly implemented color coding system due to his colorblindness was a request for accommodation, despite the appellant's assertion on review that he did not request or want accommodation. ID at 17; HCD (testimony of the deciding official); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Paris v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 17 (2006) (finding that an employee need only let his employer know in general terms that he needs accommodation for a medical condition).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A performance case, <span class="Italic">White v. VA</span>, 120 MSPR 405, 410-14 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-15, 2013 MSPB 97 (2013), explained the importance of an employee's articulation of a specific accommodation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency is required to make a reasonable accommodation to the known physical and mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability unless the agency can show that accommodation would cause an undue hardship on its business operations. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.9(a). Reasonable accommodation includes modifications to the manner in which a position is customarily performed in order to enable a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential job functions. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Notice No. 915.002, <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> (2002) (EEOC Guidance).[4] In order to establish disability discrimination, an employee must show that: (1) he is an individual with a disability, as defined by 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g); (2) he is a qualified individual with a disability pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m); and (3) the agency failed to provide a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Emory v. Jackson</span>, Appeal No. 0120112078, 2013 WL 3435860, *9 (E.E.O.C. June 27, 2013).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;This guidance can be accessed at the EEOC public website: <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-reasonable-accommodation-and-undue-hardship-under-ada">http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html</a> [now at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-reasonable-accommodation-and-undue-hardship-under-ada#requesting">https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-reasonable-accommodation-and-undue-hardship-under-ada#requesting</a>]. As a federal employee, the appellant's claim of disability discrimination arises under the Rehabilitation Act. However, the standards under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) have been incorporated by reference into the Rehabilitation Act. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791(g). Further, the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), Pub. L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553 (2008) (codified at 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 12101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>), applies to this appeal because the incidents in question occurred after the January 1, 2009 effective date of the ADAAA. Although the ADAAA changed the interpretation of the law with respect to the existence of a disability, it did not affect the requirements of the law as to reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 22, &#x00B6; 11 n.4 (2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the appellant failed to establish his affirmative defense of disability discrimination, the administrative judge found, among other things, that: (1) the appellant is an individual with a disability; (2) although the appellant requested a different shift or a reassignment to a position in San Antonio as a reasonable accommodation for his medical conditions, he conceded that no physician ever told him he needed to work a different shift or at a different location in order to perform his job successfully, and he never provided any documentation stating that he needed to be moved to a different shift or duty station; (3) although the appellant claimed that the agency could have reassigned him to other positions, he did not allege that any such positions were vacant; and (4) the appellant failed to provide the information requested by the agency in response to his request for reasonable accommodation. The administrative judge also cited with approval agency witnesses' testimony regarding the lack of vacancies to which the appellant could have been reassigned. On review, the appellant disputes the judge's finding that he failed to adduce evidence of positions to which he could have been reassigned that would have accommodated his disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge's determination that the appellant is an individual with a disability as defined by 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g), i.e., a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of his major life activities. The question of whether an individual's impairment is a covered disability should not demand extensive analysis. 29 C.F.R. <span id="Page_3472"></span>part 1630 Appendix. Assuming without deciding that the appellant also established that he is a qualified individual with a disability under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m), i.e., that he can perform the essential functions of his position with or without reasonable accommodation, we conclude, as discussed below, that the appellant failed to establish that the agency violated its duty of reasonable accommodation because the appellant failed to fulfill his obligations in the interactive accommodation process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An accommodation is "reasonable" if it "seems reasonable on its face, i.e., ordinarily or in the run of cases," i.e., if it appears to be "feasible" or "plausible." EEOC Guidance (General Principles section). While an individual with a disability may request a modification to the work environment or adjustments in how and when a job is performed due to a medical condition, this request does not necessarily mean that the employer is required to provide the requested modification or adjustment. A request for reasonable accommodation is the first step in an informal, interactive process between the individual and the employer. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (Q&#x0026;A item 1). The employer may ask the individual relevant questions that will enable it to make an informed decision about the request. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (Q&#x0026;A item 5). This includes asking what type of reasonable accommodation is needed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. When the disability and/or the need for accommodation is not obvious, the employer may ask the individual for reasonable documentation about his disability and functional limitations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (Q&#x0026;A item 6). The employer is entitled to know that the individual has a covered disability for which he needs a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Where the existence or nature of a reasonable accommodation is not obvious, and the employee fails to respond to the employer's reasonable request for medical information or documentation, an agency will not be found to have violated its duty to provide a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Howerton v. McHugh</span>, Appeal No. 0120113177, 2013 WL 3149195, *3-4 (E.E.O.C. June 12, 2013) (no showing that the agency failed to reasonably accommodate the employee's disability where the employee did not provide evidence that the accommodation he requested would have been effective in accommodating his attendance issues); <span class="Italic">Miller v. Shinseki</span>, Appeal No. 0120110565, 2013 WL 2368677, *2-3 (E.E.O.C. May 22, 2013) (no showing that the agency failed to reasonably accommodate the employee's disability where, among other things, the employee failed on two occasions to provide sufficient medical documentation to support her accommodation request).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the appellant requested an accommodation on April 24, 2012, he cited several conditions, including sleep apnea, insomnia, hypertension, ulcers, post-traumatic stress disorder, and back conditions, and he included numerous items of medical documentation with his request. In its May 3 response to the appellant's request, the agency's Reasonable Accommodation Committee stated that it needed additional information before it could act on the appellant's request for accommodation. It noted that the appellant's medical documentation did not identify essential duties he was unable to perform because of his conditions, nor the position(s) to which he desired to be reassigned. The Committee noted that it had not received a request from the appellant for a shift change. It further observed that the appellant had responded to a December 2011 request for volunteers interested in rotating to teams on a daytime shift, but that employees with more seniority were selected, and that the appellant had not responded to a February 2012 request for volunteers to work on the same shift. The appellant did not reply to the agency's May 3 response.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency's response to the appellant's request for accommodation was reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. Whether and the degree to which the appellant's ability to perform the essential duties of his position was adversely affected by his medical conditions, and whether or how a modification to his work duties or schedule or a reassignment would have enabled him to better perform those duties were not obvious and had not been addressed in the medical documentation he provided with his request for accommodation. Unless and until the appellant provided the requested information and documentation, the agency could not be expected to modify the appellant's work duties or schedule or to reassign him to another position, and the agency could not be said to have failed to satisfy an obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation. That being the case, the existence or absence of vacant positions to which the appellant could have been reassigned does not affect the correct disposition of the appellant's claim of disability discrimination.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;We note in this regard that reassignment is the reasonable accommodation of last resort, which is only required after it has been determined that there are no effective accommodations that will enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his current position, or that all other reasonable accommodations would impose an undue hardship. EEOC Guidance (Q&#x0026;A item 24).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the request for accommodation he filed on April 24, 2012, the appellant asserted below and refers in his petition for review to three requests for a "hardship transfer" to San Antonio as previous occasions on which he had requested accommodation for his disabilities. The appellant's first two requests for hardship transfer could not be considered requests for accommodation because they did not mention any medical condition from which he suffered; they focused on the hardship caused to his family by their separation (the appellant was working in Waco, while his wife and children were living in San Antonio). The final request cited the same concerns, but also stated that the appellant was "[e]xperiencing personal problems and medical at current duty station" and that, as "outline[d] in my last request need to be closer home to help with sick child and take care of my own medical needs." In context, it is understandable that the agency did not view or treat the appellant's third request for a hardship transfer as a request for reasonable accommodation.[6] Like the first two requests, the third request focused on the hardship created by the appellant's separation from his family. Although the third request also mentioned a personal medical condition (but did not describe it), it did so in the context of implying that the appellant would be better able to manage that condition if reunited with his family. The appellant gave no indication in this request that he needed or wanted any sort of accommodation in order to perform his job duties. Accordingly, we find no basis for concluding that the agency committed disability discrimination by failing to grant the appellant's January 2012 request for a hardship transfer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;We note that a request for accommodation need not be in writing, but the employee must generally inform the employer that an accommodation is needed. EEOC Guidance (General Principles section and Q&#x0026;A item 3). The appellant has not cited any conversations he had with supervisors prior to his request of April 24, 2012, in which he advised them that he needed an accommodation for his medical conditions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"The appellant bears the burden of articulating, to the extent possible, a reasonable accommodation under which she believes she could perform the essential duties of her position." <span class="Italic">Holderness v. Defense Commissary Agency</span>, 75 MSPR 401, 405 (1997) (overruled on other grounds by <span class="Italic">McCauley v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MCCAULEY_LINDA_DC_0752_09_0694_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER__612104.pdf">116 MSPR 484</a>, 489-90 &#x00B6; 10, 2011 MSPB 59 (2011)). If no accommodation can be made, the appellant is not a qualified disabled employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Morgan v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 676, 682 (1988) (appellant failed to request that the agency permanently restructure her position or modify her work schedule in a manner consistent with her medical restrictions; the request for assignment to a vacant position was not specifically based on her disabling condition, but upon unspecified "slight handicaps" and "stress"); <span class="Italic">Nealen v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 24 MSPR 578, 582 (1984) ("He does not state what training he needs and the regulations he cites merely repeat that the agency must reasonably accommodate handicapped employees.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The shifting demands of accommodative requirements were exemplified by <span class="Italic">Cason v. NASA</span>, 37 MSPR 261, 267-69 (1988). Had the agency made a substantive inquiry of its supplier of respirators, the agency would have determined that a respirator was available that met the appellant's needs. By failing to conduct a reasonable inquiry into the availability of equipment necessary to accommodate the appellant, the agency failed to rebut the appellant's case of disability discrimination based on respiratory difficulties resulting from the inhalation of dust and toxins. The appellant was entitled to provide hearing evidence of available accommodations that had not been provided to the agency during the reply process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant met his burden of articulating a reasonable accommodation that would enable him to perform the essential duties of his position, i.e., wearing a full face respirator. Prior to his removal and in response to the agency's inquiries, the appellant's physician informed the agency that the appellant's condition could be protected if he were to avoid the material to which he was allergic. The agency was further informed, in response to its questions to Dr. Custalow on May 19, 1986, that the respirators that it provided were inadequate because they put pressure on the bridge of the appellant's nose and caused his nose to stop up. Dr. Custalow did not state that a respirator would not work; he simply stated that those provided by the agency were, for a reason unrelated to its ability to protect the appellant against the substances to which he was allergic, not sufficient. We find, therefore, that the issue of respirators was squarely raised prior to the appellant's removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant testified that one week before the hearing he found a full face respirator that would allow him to perform his duties.[5] The appellant testified that it has been on the market for several years and is continually upgraded. Although Mr. Brown, an industrial hygienist working under contract for the agency, testified that the model the appellant had at the hearing was one of the newer ones made by that company, that testimony referred to the substance of which it was made; he testified that the newer ones are made of silicon rubber and are more comfortable than the older ones which were made of a different substance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;He testified that he recently undertook a study of respirators. He called several companies and visited one to explain his problem to them. They showed him full face respirators and he found one that fit his face and did not put pressure on his nose.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3473"></span>The appellant testified that the respirator costs about $116 and that Dr. Custalow told him that he could work if he wore it. He further testified that the full face respirator is made by one of the same companies that manufactures the respirators provided by the agency, and that the respirator uses the same cartridges as the agency's respirators.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the proposed removal notice, however, the proposing official stated that he found that the substances to which the appellant should not be exposed were common to his profession as a Modelmaker, and that such substances could not be eliminated from the work environment of the shop to which he was assigned. The record does not reflect that the agency inquired whether there were any respirators that would not apply pressure to the nose and that would protect the appellant from the allergic substances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that a full face respirator is manufactured by the very same company that manufactures the respirators currently provided by the agency is telling: had the agency simply inquired about the availability of a respirator that would not apply pressure to the bridge of the appellant's nose, it would have found such a respirator. That the appellant did not discover the existence of such a respirator until one week before the hearing does not defeat his entitlement to the accommodation.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The Board has repeatedly recognized that its scope of review is not limited to consideration of the administrative record established before the agency; under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(a) and (b), the Board is mandated to conduct a hearing if requested by the appellant, and to consider <span class="Italic">de novo</span> all the relevant evidence whether offered at a hearing or transmitted as a part of the administrative record. <span class="Italic">See Foster v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> 18 MSPR 339, 341-42 (1983); <span class="Italic">Zeiss v. Veterans Administration,</span> 7 MSPB 516, 8 MSPR 15 (1981); <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 6 MSPB 343, 6 MSPR 404, 412-14 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having articulated a reasonable accommodation that the appellant believed would enable him to perform the essential duties of his position, the burden of production shifts to the agency to show a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its action. The agency has failed to show that the appellant was not able to perform the essential duties of his position with the full face respirator[7] or that providing such a respirator would be an undue hardship in light of the relatively minor cost involved. <span class="Italic">See Mallard v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Navy,</span> 28 MSPR 27, 32 (1985) (cost of additional chairs needed to accommodate handicapped employee not an "undue" hardship).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;We find that the agency did not produce any evidence showing that the appellant would not be able to perform the essential duties of his position with the full face respirator. Although the agency offered rebuttal testimony by Mr. Brown, an industrial hygienist working under contract for the agency, to challenge whether wearing the full face respirator would enable the appellant to perform, Mr. Brown testified that he did not know if it would protect the appellant. As noted earlier, Dr. Custalow did not indicate that the agency's respirators would not protect the appellant; rather, he informed the agency that the appellant could not use them because they rested on his nose. The appellant testified that Dr. Custalow told him that he could work if he wore the full face respirator and Dr. Custalow's most recent statement indicated that the appellant could be exposed to the allergens beyond the time period previously noted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the appellant met his burden of proving that he could perform the essential functions of his position with reasonable accommodation. His removal must therefore be reversed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency must make reasonable, but apparently not exhaustive, accommodative efforts. <span class="Italic">Conti v. Dept. of Army</span>, 34 MSPR 272, 278 (1987), observed that "[I]n accommodating a handicapped employee, an agency is not required to exert its resources pursuing every conceivable accommodation when there is little or no likelihood that the accommodation will correct the performance deficiencies claimed to be caused by the handicap."</p>
