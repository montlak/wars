<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-96"><span class="space">1.</span> Submission of Designation</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Finch v. OPM</span>, 72 MSPR 221, 223-28 (1996), decided that under CSRS the lump sum designation of beneficiary must be received by OPM before the date of the employee's death, and distinguished treatment of the same process under FERS, when receipt by the employing agency of the designation is sufficient if before the employee's death:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 2, 1994, Robert H. Finch signed a Designation of Beneficiary (DOB) form naming the appellant, his mother, as the beneficiary of his CSRS lump-sum benefits. Later that day, he delivered the form to the personnel office of the Veterans Administration Medical Center (VAMC) where he was employed. On July 2, 1994, Mr. Finch died. On July 22, 1994, the appellant filed an application for CSRS lump-sum benefits. OPM denied the appellant's application because it did not receive the June 2, 1994 DOB form until August 22, 1994, after Mr. Finch's death.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, the appellant contended that the DOB form was timely delivered to the VAMC and that VAMC should be held accountable for not promptly delivering the form to OPM. She argued that she was entitled to the CSRS lump-sum benefit because it was her son's clear intention to designate her as beneficiary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have reopened this case, however, to address OPM's response to our order and recent case law cited in its response.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In our order, we noted that the statutory provisions governing the filing requirements for DOBs for lump-sum benefits under the CSRS and the FERS both require the forms to be filed with OPM. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8342(c) and 8424(d). Thus, we requested OPM to explain why its regulations interpreting those statutory provisions require CSRS employees to file the forms with OPM but allow FERS employees to file the forms with their employing agencies. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> 5 C.F.R. 831.2005(a) with &#x00A7; 843.205(a). We noted that the same difference in filing requirements exists with respect to the CSRS and FERS disability retirement regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM responded that it has statutory authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(a) to issue regulations to administer CSRS and under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(b) to issue regulations for DOBs specifically. It contends that the only issue in this case is whether OPM's regulation requiring CSRS employees to file the DOB forms with OPM, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2005(a), is consistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c). OPM asserts that it is, and that the Board has already addressed this issue in <span class="Italic">Petersen v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 388 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 16 F.3d 422 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). OPM cites <span class="Italic">Petersen</span> as holding that receipt of a CSRS DOB by the employing agency does not satisfy the statutory requirement that the DOB be received by OPM before the employee's death. OPM further cites the recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Deerinwater v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 78 F.3d 570 (Fed. Cir. 1996), as supporting its decision in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Deerinwater,</span> a former federal employee filed a FERS disability retirement application with her former employing agency pursuant to the agency's instructions and its assurances that it would timely file the application with OPM. The agency, however, did not timely file the application, and OPM rejected it as untimely under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8453. The court noted that the statutory provision, its implementing regulation, and the application form all provided that OPM must receive a former employee's application within one year of her separation, and thus found that her former employing agency gave her incorrect advice. It found, however, that under <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond,</span> 496 U.S. 414, 416, 434 (1990), this incorrect advice could not estop OPM from denying her application as untimely filed. 78 F.3d at 571-73.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court acknowledged the employee's argument that OPM abused its discretion in promulgating a regulation that distinguishes between classes of disability retirement applicants, specifically, that provides that persons who apply for disability retirement while still employed by the government must submit their applications to their employing agencies, but that former employees' applications must be received by OPM within one year of separation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 573; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.201(a)(1). It found, however, that, as related to the situation here, OPM's regulation was entirely consistent with the statute because both the regulation and the statute require that applications from former employees be filed with OPM within one year of separation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Citing <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</span> 467 U.S. 837, <span class="Italic">reh'g denied,</span> 468 U.S. 1227 (1984), it found that Congress had directly spoken to the precise question at issue and that, as far as former government employees were concerned, OPM's regulation conformed precisely to the statute. 78 F.3d at 573. Accordingly, it rejected the employee's argument that OPM's regulation was an abuse of discretion, and affirmed the Board's final decision sustaining OPM's reconsideration decision rejecting the employee's application as untimely filed. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 573-74.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We regrettably agree with OPM that the rationale set forth and the decisions cited in <span class="Italic">Deerinwater</span> implicitly approve its decision in this case. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c), a DOB of CSRS lump-sum benefits must <span id="Page_4211"></span>be "a signed and witnessed writing received in the Office [of Personnel Management] before [the employee's] death." Thus, Congress has spoken to the question at issue, that is, the deadline for filing a DOB form with OPM. Because the intent of Congress appears clear from the face of the statute, and OPM's implementing regulation in this instance is in accord with this apparent intent, we must find that OPM has construed the statute in a permissible manner. <span class="Italic">See Deerinwater,</span> 78 F.3d at 573.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM acknowledges that its regulation establishing the filing requirements for DOBs under FERS allows current employees to file the DOBs with their employing offices even though the statutory provisions governing the regulation requires the DOBs to be filed with OPM. However, OPM contends that, because this case involves a filing under the CSRS, it is not an appropriate case for the Board to address any difference between statutory and regulatory filing requirements for FERS employees. OPM asserts that, under analogous circumstances, the court in <span class="Italic">Deerinwater,</span> 78 F.3d at 573, declined to address the issue of whether OPM abused its discretion in promulgating a regulation allowing employing agencies to accept disability retirement applications for current employees but not for former employees. OPM cites the court's conclusion that the regulation at issue in <span class="Italic">Deerinwater</span> was consistent with the statute, and the regulation that was not consistent had no effect on the case before it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Again, under the reasoning set forth in <span class="Italic">Deerinwater</span> as explained above, we are compelled to agree with OPM's conclusion that this is not an appropriate case for the Board to address the difference between the statutory and regulatory filing requirements for FERS employees. However, <span class="Italic">Deerinwater</span> does not preclude us from disagreeing with OPM's decision to treat two groups of employees, those under CSRS and those under FERS, differently in its regulations. OPM explains that the difference in its regulations concerning filing requirements for CSRS and FERS DOBs is based on administrative considerations, not statutory interpretation. Thus, OPM apparently did not feel constrained by statutory language as expressed in the FERS statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8424(d), to require, in its regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 843.205(a), that FERS DOBs be received by OPM prior to the employee's death. If OPM, the agency charged with implementing the statute, believes that it is not required to follow the letter of the statute to carry out Congressional intent in that instance, it would appear that OPM does not believe that designating the place of filing for DOBs was Congress's main intent in enacting the statutory provisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, our review of the legislative history indicates that the main intent of Congress in enacting the statutory provision in regard to CSRS was to provide for an order of precedence. Originally, the Civil Service Retirement Act did not allow federal employees to designate beneficiaries to receive lump-sum benefits. <span class="Italic">See</span> the Act, ch. 349, &#x00A7; 12(c), 46 Stat. 468, 476 (1930). The Act provided only that the employee's lump-sum benefit be returned to his legal representative in the event of death. <span class="Italic">See</span> 46 Stat. at 476-77. The 1934 amendments to the Act provided that federal employees could designate beneficiaries "in writing...and recorded on his individual account." Act of June 22, 1934, ch. 709, &#x00A7; 1, 48 Stat. 1201. The amendments also established an order of precedence for the payment of the CSRS lump-sum benefit. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1950, Congress amended the Act to require federal employees to submit their DOB forms to the CSC prior to death. Act of June 14, 1950, ch. 240, &#x00A7; 1, 64 Stat. 214, 216. The amendment also substantially changed the order of precedence for the receipt of the CSRS lump-sum benefit. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The amendment's legislative history is silent, however, with respect to the requirement that the CSC receive designations prior to the death of the designator. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 2163, 81st Cong., 2nd Sess. (1950), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1950 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2486. Thus, the legislative history indicates that Congress's intent in providing for the filing of DOBs was to respect the wishes of deceased employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unfortunately, in this case, we are unable to honor the wishes of Mr. Finch. We are bound by the wording of the statute governing the filing of CSRS DOBs and OPM's implementation of that statute in its regulation, even though OPM has chosen to implement the statute governing the filing of FERS DOBs in a different manner. Thus, while we sympathize with the appellant's situation in this case, we find that OPM's reconsideration decision denying her request for lump-sum benefits is correct under the law as it currently stands, despite Mr. Finch's timely delivery of his DOB form to VAMC. It is up to OPM to change its regulation implementing this law. Or, as Judge Plager noted in his concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">Deerinwater,</span> 78 F.3d at 574, it is up to Congress to change the law itself.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Davis v. OPM</span>, 76 MSPR 423, 425-26 (1997), citing <span class="Italic">Finch,</span> arrived at the same result concerning an agency's receipt from the employee of a designation of a lump sum beneficiary and receipt of the designation by OPM after the employee's death:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Finch v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 221, 224-28 (1996), the Board applied these statutory and regulatory provisions to circumstances substantially similar to those in this appeal and found that under OPM's interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c), as set forth in its regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2005(a), that statutory provision does not provide that an employing agency may be deemed the agent for OPM in receiving designation of beneficiary forms under the CSRS. We find in this appeal, as in <span class="Italic">Finch</span>, that the Board is bound by the wording of the statute governing the filing of a designation of beneficiary under the CSRS and OPM's implementation of that statute in its regulation. OPM's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2005(a) is consistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c). Regrettably, the fact that Mr. Johnson was unable to oversee the handling of his designation form personally because he was hospitalized and terminally ill does not sufficiently distinguish this appeal from <span class="Italic">Finch</span>. Although OPM's regulatory interpretation of the statute gives rise to an arguably unfair result in this appeal, it is up to OPM to change its regulation implementing the law, or it is up to Congress to change the law itself. <span class="Italic">See Finch</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. at 228.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Davis</span> was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Davis v. OPM</span>, No. 98-3095 (Fed. Cir. 1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Davis argues, second, that OPM should be deemed to have received the designation form in satisfaction of section 8342(c), as of its receipt at the hospital by the employing agency representatives, who Davis maintains should be deemed acting as OPM's <span class="Italic">de facto</span> agents. Davis relies on the official business nature of their hospital visit for his contention that Johnson had a reasonable expectation that Johnson's lump-sum beneficiary had been changed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although actions can sometimes create an agency relationship between private parties, ordinarily they cannot do so in the case of government agencies, and certainly not in direct contravention of explicit statutory requirements. <span class="Italic">See Holder v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 47 F.3d 412, 414 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Dock v. United States,</span> 46 F.3d 1083, 1089 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Here, the statute expressly specifies that OPM itself must receive the written designation before the employee's death in order for it to be effective. No authority is given to OPM to establish an agent or to provide some alternate location for receipt of the designation forms or to waive the deadline, the date of death. Therefore, under the express terms of section 8342(c), OPM has no discretion to pay benefits to anyone other than the properly designated beneficiary on file with OPM itself at the time of the employee's death, regardless of the employee's intent or receipt of the designation form by representatives of another agency. As stated in <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. 414, 432 (1989), the express terms of a statute cannot be ignored based on the facts of individual cases. Davis's argument on this issue must fail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Davis contends, finally, that the employing agency's mishandling of Johnson's designation form was improper and that the Board's decision was therefore wrong. However, because an agency error does not constitute a basis for granting an application for benefits that does not meet statutory requirements, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 416, 434, Davis's argument on this issue must also fail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we are sympathetic to Davis's arguments, we are bound by the statutory prerequisites to entitlement set forth in section 8342(c). Therefore, we conclude that receipt of the designation form by the employing agency representatives cannot be considered substantial compliance with the statute, nor can the employing agency be considered the agent of OPM, nor are the circumstances beyond the scope of the statutory and regulatory requirements.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brown v. OPM</span>, 65 MSPR 380, 383-88 (1994), determined that a guardian may make an election of a lump sum benefit for an employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue, which is whether a legally appointed guardian may elect an alternative annuity on behalf of an incompetent employee. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8343a(b) provides that OPM "shall by regulation provide for such alternative forms of annuities as [OPM] considers appropriate, except that among the alternatives offered shall be...an alternative which provides for payment of the lump-sum credit to the employee or Member...and payment of an annuity to the employee or Member for life, with a survivor annuity payable for the life of the surviving spouse." Congress has provided that no payment shall be made from the Retirement Fund unless an application for benefits based on the service of an employee or Member is received in the OPM before the one hundred and fifteenth anniversary <span id="Page_4212"></span>of his birth. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(i)(1). Payment due a minor, or an individual mentally incompetent or under other legal disability, may be made to the person who is constituted guardian or other fiduciary by the law of the State of residence of the claimant or is otherwise legally vested with the care of the claimant or his estate. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(e).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court has said that "[i]f Congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill, there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation."<span class="Italic">Parker v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 974 F.2d 164, 166 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (quoting <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,</span> 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984)).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Post-hoc rationalizations by an agency, however, will not create a statutory interpretation deserving of deference. <span class="Italic">See Parker,</span> 974 F.2d at 166<span class="Italic">.</span> In <span class="Italic">Parker,</span> 974 F.2d at 165<span class="Italic">,</span> the statute at issue required that claims for disability retirement be "filed with" OPM before the employee or Member was separated or within 1 year thereafter. OPM's regulations contained the words "must submit" and "shall file," and thus provided no interpretive guidance. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 167. OPM claimed that it had a longstanding policy that required such applications to be received by OPM within 1 year of separation. The Court found, however, that OPM had failed to "establish the existence of a regular, long-honored policy of public record."<span class="Italic">Parker,</span> 974 F.2d at 166<span class="Italic">.</span> The Court declined to defer to OPM's statutory interpretation "[i]n the absence of meaningful guidance, [or] substantial evidence of a consistent policy, either internally applied or publicly announced...."<span class="Italic">Parker,</span> 974 F.2d at 168<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Except under circumstances not relevant here, Congress has provided that OPM shall prescribe such regulations as are necessary and proper to carry out title 5, chapter 83, subchapter III. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(a). The regulation relied upon by OPM in its reconsideration decision, however, does not address the precise question at issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2203(a) (providing that "an employee or Member whose annuity entitlement commences after June 5, 1986...may elect an alternative form of annuity instead of any other benefits under the subchapter."). Rather, we find that OPM's regulation essentially "parallels" the statutory language and offers no interpretive guidance on the issue of whether a guardian may elect an alternative annuity on an employee's behalf. <span class="Italic">Cf. Parker,</span> 974 F.2d at 167<span class="Italic">.</span> OPM asserted in its response to the appellant's appeal that its "policy" is that the right to elect a retirement benefit such as an alternative annuity is "so personal a right as to preclude the delegation of authority, even to an authorized agent (e.g., court appointed guardian, power of attorney, etc.) to make such an election for the annuitant."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that OPM has not shown that this policy is a regular, long-honored policy of public record. <span class="Italic">Cf. Parker,</span> 974 F.2d at 165-66 (OPM submitted an affidavit in an attempt to support its alleged longstanding policy). OPM first accepted the appellant's election of an alternative annuity, which the appellant had filed in accordance with the oral instructions of an OPM employee. OPM later informed the appellant that she could not make such an election.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, OPM is inconsistent in its application of this policy. Although OPM asserts that the right to elect an alternative annuity is "personal" to an employee or Member, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2203(f) provides that an annuitant who dies before the date of "final adjudication" is deemed to have made an affirmative election of an alternative annuity. In effect, OPM will "elect" an alternative annuity for an employee who dies before the date of final adjudication, but it will prevent an employee's guardian from making such an election on the employee's behalf when the employee becomes incompetent before the date of final adjudication. We do not agree that OPM's election of an alternative annuity on behalf of a deceased annuitant is "personal," while an election by the legally appointed guardian of an annuitant who is still alive is not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, although we have found no express authorization by Congress allowing personal representatives or guardians to file timely applications for survivor or disability retirement benefits,[1] OPM permits such applications to be filed by personal representatives and guardians. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.619(a) (a survivor may file an application "personally or through a representative"); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1203(a)(4)-(5) (an agency shall file an application for disability retirement for an employee where, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the employee has no personal representative, guardian, or immediate family member who is willing to file an application on his or her behalf); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 918 F.2d 944, 946 (Fed. Cir. 1990) ("by recognizing that a survivor may find it difficult or impossible because of mental or physical impairment to personally [file an application], the OPM regulations...provide limited relief by saying that the application may be filed 'personally or through a representative.'"); <span class="Italic">Peters v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 364, 365-67 (1986) (a guardian filed an application for disability retirement with OPM on an employee's behalf within 1 year of the employee's removal). Because we find that OPM has failed to provide meaningful guidance or substantial evidence of a consistent policy, either internally applied or publicly announced on this issue, we do not defer to its interpretation. <span class="Italic">See Parker,</span> 974 F.2d at 168; <span class="Italic">see also Lichtman v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 785 F.2d 299, 303 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (there can be no valid reliance on the general principle that courts should give deference to an agency's reasonable construction of a statute where there has been no prior or consistent agency interpretation). Rather, we discern no reason to treat guardians who elect an alternative annuity differently from those representatives permitted by OPM to file applications for other retirement benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;We note that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(b), which deals with disability retirement applications, provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">A claim may be allowed under this section only if the application is filed with the Office before the employee or Member is separated from the service or within 1 year thereafter. This time limitation may be waived by the Office for an employee or Member who at the date of separation from service or within 1 year thereafter is mentally incompetent, if the application is filed with the Office within 1 year from the date of restoration of the employee or Member to competency or the appointment of a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This provision does not, as the administrative judge found, "specifically provide[&#8197;] that an appointed fiduciary may file, on behalf of an individual who is mentally incompetent, an application for a disability retirement annuity." ID at 4. Rather, it addresses the circumstances under which the time limit for filing a disability retirement application may be waived. Section 8337(b) does not specifically address whether a guardian can file a disability retirement application on behalf of a mentally incompetent employee within the statutory time limit. Nevertheless, OPM has permitted such applications to be filed by guardians. <span class="Italic">See Peters v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 364, 365-67 (1986)<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As previously noted, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(e) provides that payment due a minor, or an individual mentally incompetent or under other legal disability, may be made to the person who is constituted guardian or other fiduciary by the law of the State of residence of the claimant or is otherwise legally vested with the care of the claimant or his estate. While we recognize that this section does not specify who may apply for an alternative annuity on an employee's behalf, <span class="Italic">see Oshiver,</span> 896 F.2d at 542, we believe that this provision, when construed with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8337(b) and 8345(i)(1), supports a finding that a guardian may elect an alternative annuity on an incompetent employee's behalf.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress has implicitly recognized by the plain language of section 8337(b) that fiduciaries may act on behalf of incompetent employees. Otherwise, it would not make sense for the statute to commence the running of the period for filing a disability retirement application on the date of the appointment of a fiduciary. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(b). This provision appears to reflect Congress' recognition of the general legal principle that a fiduciary, such as a guardian, may care for the person and property of a ward by taking possession of and managing the estate of one who is unable to act for himself. <span class="Italic">See</span> 39 C.J.S. Guardian &#x0026; Ward &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2, 3 (1976). Although Congress could have placed restrictions on the filing of an application for Federal retirement benefits by a personal representative or guardian, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(i)(1) merely requires that an application for benefits "based on the service of an employee or Member" be received by OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we find that OPM's construction of section 8343a would lead to an anomalous result under which a guardian would be authorized to receive, under section 8345(e), an alternative annuity that is due an individual who is mentally incompetent or under other legal disability, but be unable to apply for such an annuity on the individual's behalf. Thus, OPM's interpretation is contrary to the rule of statutory construction that all provisions of a statute be given meaning and that no part be rendered superfluous or insignificant. <span class="Italic">See Bonggat v. Department of the Navy</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 175, 179 (1993); <span class="Italic">Caddell v. Department of Justice</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 529, 532 (1992). OPM's interpretation is also unreasonable and contrary to public policy because it discriminates against disabled individuals by depriving them of the opportunity to elect a benefit to which they may otherwise be entitled. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Evans v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 94, 104 (1993) (while the Board ordinarily gives deference to OPM's interpretation of a statute that OPM is charged with implementing, the Board will not follow OPM's interpretation when there are compelling reasons to conclude that it is erroneous or unreasonable or contrary to the law that it purports to interpret).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of section 8343a sheds little light on Congressional intent, but we see nothing therein to indicate that the payment of an alternative annuity was intended to be narrowly and arbitrarily restricted <span id="Page_4213"></span>to those individuals with the physical and mental ability to elect such a benefit on their own behalf. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 166, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1985), H.R. Cong. Rep. No. 606, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1405, 1508. Rather, the statutory language reasonably should be interpreted as permitting the election of an alternative annuity by a legal guardian. Such an interpretation would be more consistent with the purposes of the FERSA, which include enhancing the portability of retirement assets earned as an employee of the Federal government and providing options for Federal employees with respect to retirement planning. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 99-335, &#x00A7; 100A, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. (100 Stat.) 514, 516. We therefore believe that Congress did not intend to extinguish an employee's right to receive an alternative annuity merely because he becomes mentally incompetent or under other legal disability before he can make such an election.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our determination is not inconsistent with the decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Oshiver</span> and <span class="Italic">Davis,</span> which OPM has relied upon to support its belief that the right to elect an alternative annuity is "personal" and may not be exercised by a guardian. The administrative judge in this appeal found that the Court in <span class="Italic">Oshiver</span> "upheld a determination by the OPM disallowing an application for a civil service annuity by a temporary trustee on behalf of a missing employee." The Court, however, identified the issue in <span class="Italic">Oshiver</span> as whether an application for civil service retirement benefits may be filed on behalf of a "missing" annuitant by someone <span class="Italic">not</span> duly-appointed as the "missing" annuitant's personal representative. <span class="Italic">Oshiver,</span> 896 F.2d at 541<span class="Italic">.</span> The Court affirmed the Board's denial of a retirement application made by Oshiver's wife, who was not Oshiver's personal representative. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 541-42.

The Court did not decide whether Oshiver's daughter, as temporary trustee, could file an application on Oshiver's behalf, because the daughter's application was not considered by OPM, the administrative judge, or the Board. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 542; <span class="Italic">see also Lazarski v. Office of Personnel Management</span> (the Court in <span class="Italic">Oshiver</span> reserved the question of whether a retirement application could be filed by a guardian or trustee on behalf of an employee who was declared a missing person). In this regard, we agree with the Court that the issue of whether a trustee or guardian may file an application for retirement benefits was not properly before us in <span class="Italic">Oshiver.</span> Thus, our statement in that case that the right to file an application for civil service retirement benefits cannot be delegated to a trustee or guardian of a missing person must be regarded as dicta. <span class="Italic">See Oshiver v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 38 M.S.P.R. 191, 194-95 (1988), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 896 F.2d 540 (Fed. Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Davis</span> is distinguishable. In <span class="Italic">Davis,</span> 938 F.2d at 1284-85<span class="Italic">,</span> the Court found that the administratrix of her husband's estate could not file an application for a disability retirement annuity on behalf of her deceased husband. The Court reasoned that certain annuity rights do not accrue automatically but only upon a claim being made by the claimant while alive. <span class="Italic">Davis,</span> 938 F.2d at 1285. The Court explained that the question it had reserved in <span class="Italic">Oshiver</span> "related to an employee with whom such [a guardian or trustee] relationship could be established, namely a presumably living (albeit missing) person."<span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the appellant was entitled to elect an alternative annuity as her husband's guardian, and that OPM has therefore failed to show by preponderant evidence that an overpayment occurred. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1407(a).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Lack of clear information concerning OPM mail-handling and date-stamping procedures led the Board to apply some presumptions regarding delivery of mail in "due course" to establish timely submission to OPM of lump sum death benefit designations in <span class="Italic">Stracquatanio v. Walkama,</span> 54 MSPR 529, 534 (1992) (dissenting opinion by Chairman Levinson).</p>
