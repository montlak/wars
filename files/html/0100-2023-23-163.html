<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-161"><span class="space">f.</span> Security Clearance Problem</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A particular job may depend on the employee's ability to hold a security clearance. The lack of a clearance constitutes a compelling reason not to return an employee to a job requiring a clearance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">LaBatte v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 58 MSPR 586, 594 (1993). The agency satisfies its compliance responsibilities if the Board reverses a removal based on loss of a clearance by assigning the employee to a substantially similar position that does not require the clearance. <span class="Italic">Gray v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 29 MSPR 281, 283-84 (1985). <span class="Italic">Pistilli v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, NY-0752-11-0001-C-1 (NP 11/20/2013), demonstrated the Board's inability to address the clearance problem involved in the employee's reinstatement, although the employee continued employment in a job that did not require a clearance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a nonprecedential final order dated December 14, 2011, we reversed the appellant's removal and ordered him reinstated to employment, finding that the agency could not establish its charge that the appellant failed to meet the requirements of his position based upon his inability to obtain a security clearance. The agency returned the appellant to employment on January 3, 2012. Rather than return him to his position of record as criminal investigator (CI) at the agency's office in Melville, New York, however, the agency assigned the appellant to its CI office in Hauppauge, New York, where he would not have access to classified information and where he had been on a detail assignment during the year preceding his removal after his interim security clearance was denied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a petition for enforcement challenging, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, his reinstatement to employment. The administrative judge issued a compliance initial decision denying the appellant's petition for enforcement in which he concluded that the agency returned the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> by restoring him to the detail assignment he was performing immediately prior to his removal which did not require access to classified information. The appellant has filed a petition for review arguing that he should have been returned "to the position I was fired from and not from a sham position" and that he should be returned to the agency's Garden City office location....The agency has filed an opposition to the appellant's petition for review arguing that he cannot be reinstated to his CI position in Melville, New York because he still does not hold the required security clearance to work at that location handling classified information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the Board finds a personnel action unwarranted, the aim of the Board is to place the appellant, as nearly as possible, in the situation he would have been in had the wrongful personnel action not occurred. <span class="Italic">Tubesing v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 393, &#x00B6; 5 (2009). The agency bears the burden to prove its compliance with a Board order and the appellant's return to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Among the elements of <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief is the reinstatement of the employee to his former position prior to his removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 6. When an employee is not returned to his prior position and prior duties, the agency first must present a strong overriding interest or compelling reason for not doing so, and, second, must demonstrate that it has reassigned the employee to a position that is substantially similar to his prior position. <span class="Italic">Gorny v. Department of the Interior</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 520, &#x00B6; 6 (2011). In analyzing such an issue, the Board must look beyond the title and grade of the positions involved and must compare the scope of the actual duties and responsibilities of the new position with those of the former position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has considered similar scenarios involving the intersection of a Board-ordered reinstatement to employment and a security clearance requirement. In <span class="Italic">King v. Department of the Navy</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 547, &#x00B6; 18 (2005), the Board held that the agency complied with the Board's reinstatement order when it offered the appellant a security specialist position, but required that the appellant complete certain "in-processing" steps to obtain a security clearance. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">LaBatte v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 586, 594 (1993), the Board held that the lack of a security clearance constitutes a compelling reason not to return the appellant to his prior position and found the agency in compliance based upon the appellant's detail to a position which did not require a security clearance.[4] Lastly, in <span class="Italic">Doe v. Department of Justice</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 198, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15 (2003), the Board held that the agency demonstrated a compelling reason for not returning the appellant to his prior position due to concerns expressed by several U.S. Attorney's Offices about the appellant's ability to perform his role as a criminal investigator. Equating these concerns to the denial of a security clearance, the Board held that the agency demonstrated a compelling reason for not returning him to his prior position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In reaching this conclusion, the Board noted that the agency had taken steps to reactive the appellant's security clearance. <span class="Italic">LaBatte</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. at 594. <span class="Italic">LaBatte</span> is thus slightly different from the instant case because the appellant in that case had, and then lost, his security clearance; in the present matter, the appellant never held a security clearance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Combined, these cases stand for the proposition that an agency can establish a compelling reason for not returning an employee to his prior position when it demonstrates that the employee must hold a security clearance in order to assume such a position. <span class="Italic">See King</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 547, &#x00B6; 19; <span class="Italic">LaBatte</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. at 594. The Board, moreover, does not have the authority to review whether an agency may subject a position to a security clearance requirement. <span class="Italic">See Skees v. Department of the Navy</span>, <span id="Page_5005"></span>864 F.2d 1576, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1989) ("If the Board cannot review the employee's loss of security clearance, it is even further beyond question that it cannot review the Navy's judgment that the position itself requires the clearance."). Nor can the Board direct that an employee be granted access to classified information or be granted a security clearance. <span class="Italic">See King</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 547, &#x00B6; 20; <span class="Italic">LaBatte</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. at 594.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency's argument that the appellant must hold a security clearance in order to resume his CI position appears to contradict the Board's prior decision--something which our decisions would not permit, <span class="Italic">see Briggs v. National Council on Disability</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 296, 302 (1995) (an agency cannot refuse to comply with a Board reinstatement order based on reasons that were rejected by the Board in the decision reversing the action)--there is a difference between an agency taking an adverse action against an employee for his failure to hold a security clearance and an agency's imposition of a security clearance requirement; while the former falls within the ambit of the Board's jurisdiction, the latter does not, <span class="Italic">see Schnedar v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 246, &#x00B6; 8 (2013) (The Board may only determine whether: the appellant's position required a security clearance; his security clearance was denied; transfer to a nonsensitive position was not feasible; and he was provided with the procedural requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513.); <span class="Italic">see also Skees</span>, 864 F.2d at 1578. Thus, the Board is without authority to order the appellant into a position which the agency has determined requires the appellant to hold a clearance which he does not possess.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances of this case, the Board's enforcement authority is confined to ordering the appellant restored to duty in a position similar to that which he held prior to his removal. <span class="Italic">See Tubesing</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 393, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10; <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 198, &#x00B6; 17; <span class="Italic">LaBatte</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. at 594. The agency has returned the appellant to the detail assignment he held prior to his removal performing similar duties, thus satisfying the Board's reinstatement order. The appellant has not challenged the similarity of his duties before and after his reinstatement to this assignment. We have considered the remainder of the appellant's arguments on review and find that they do not support reversal of the administrative judge's compliance initial decision....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the employee loses eligibility for a clearance because of problems postdating discharge and prior to reinstatement, the agency is obligated to assign the employee, on reinstatement, to the nonsensitive position that is as near as possible to the job held at the time of dismissal. The agency may then be under a continuing obligation to reinstate the appellant to her original position once she becomes eligible for a security clearance. <span class="Italic">Hill v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 49 MSPR 271, 276 (1991) (majority opinion was joined by a concurring opinion by Chairman Levinson raising some questions about the measure of due process required when an agency determines that the employee cannot hold the sensitive position because of a pending objection to and inquiry into her ability to hold a clearance). The Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy v. Egan</span>, <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/484/518.html">484 U.S. 518</a> (1988) [discussed in Chapter 8 under "<a href="0100-2023-15-082.html#sec8-82">Review of Agency Determination; <span class="Italic">Egan</span>; Constitutional Due Process</a>"], placed limitations on the Board's ability to treat security clearance issues arising in compliance cases. For law predating these limitations, refer to <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Dept. of Army</span>, 30 MSPR 112 (1986); <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Dept. of Army</span>, 30 MSPR 119 (1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board recapitulated some of its law concerning reinstatement of an employee who seeks renewed access to sensitive information, <span class="Italic">Tyacke v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SF-0752-10-0968-C-1 (NP 6/19/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the chief administrative judge found, and the record reflects, that the appellant required access to classified information in her former position, and that she no longer has such access. The appellant lacks access because she was administratively debriefed from Sensitive Compartmented Information when she resigned, and the agency thereafter submitted a Security Access Eligibility Report to its Central Adjudication Facility noting information that it was obliged to report concerning her tenure at her prior position and beforehand that called into question her ethical fitness for access to national security information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision required the agency to reverse the appellant's termination. It did not, nor, contrary to the appellant's argument, could it, order the agency to reinstate her access. <span class="Italic">Cf. Department of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 530-31 (1988) (in an appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 based on the denial or revocation of a security clearance, the Board does not have authority to review the substance of the underlying security clearance determination)<span class="Italic">.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has found that compelling reasons for not returning an employee to her former position exist under various circumstances, including where the appellant lost the security clearance required for the position he held prior to a reversed removal action, <span class="Italic">LaBatte v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 586, 594 (1993), <span class="Italic">Gray v. Department of the Navy</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 281, 283-84 (1985); and where a border patrol agent lacked a government drivers' license needed for his former position, <span class="Italic">Marren v. Department of Justice</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 285, 287 (1987). <span class="Italic">See also Tubesing v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 393, &#x00B6; 10 (2009) (where state official's determination not to work with the appellant rendered him unable to perform the duties of his former position); <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 198, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-17 (where the U.S. Attorneys Offices indicated that they would not allow the appellant to testify in criminal proceedings because they believed that he had perjured himself, thereby jeopardizing prosecutions). The Board has stated that the common thread in these cases is that an outside event or determination rendered the appellant incapable of performing the duties of his former position, <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 198, &#x00B6; 13, and that, as long as that incapacity exists, the agency is not obligated to restore the appellant to his prior position. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These cases support the chief administrative judge's finding that the agency has a strong overriding interest in not returning the appellant to her former position or any other position that requires access, and that, while it continues to search for such a position, its placing the appellant on administrative leave constitutes compliance with the Board's order.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">While the agency offered the appellant a GS-11 security specialist position, before she could report for duty the agency required that the appellant complete certain "in-processing" steps. Specifically, the agency required that before reporting for duty the appellant obtain an interim security clearance and complete the process to obtain a top secret security clearance. The appellant essentially counters that the imposition of the security clearance requirement constitutes a withdrawal of the employment offer and thus shows that the agency is not in compliance with the Board's order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that at the time of her separation from the agency the appellant's position required a security clearance. Furthermore, the record also shows that all civilian positions at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard require a security clearance. Thus, we discern nothing improper in the agency's imposition of such a requirement on the appellant in order for her to return to duty. To hold otherwise would place the appellant in a better position than she would have been in had she not been absent from the agency. Such is not required. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sherrod v. Department of the Navy</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 347 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13, 17 (2001) (where a personnel action is cancelled, the appellant is entitled to <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief, but is not entitled to a better position than she was in at the time of the agency action); <span class="Italic">Covert v. Department of the Navy,</span> 31 M.S.P.R. 376, 383 (1986) (same); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Raicovich v. United States Postal Service,</span> 675 F.2d 417, 424 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (while they are not to suffer any loss of rights or benefits, injured workers are "not to be accorded greater rights than they would have had had employment been continuous.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that the Board has no authority to review the substance of an agency's decision to grant, deny, or suspend a security clearance.[8] <span class="Italic">Norrup v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Navy</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 444 &#x00B6; 4 (2001); <span class="Italic">see Department of the Navy v. Egan,</span> 484 U.S. 518, 530-31 (1988). It is equally well settled, however, that the Board has the authority to enforce compliance with its decisions and orders. <span class="Italic">See</span> U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2) (authorizing Board to order compliance with "any order or decision issued by the Board under the authority granted under" section 1204(a)(1)); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(1) (authorizing Board to adjudicate and take final action on "matters within the jurisdiction of the Board..."); <span class="Italic">Cloutterbuck v. Department of Labor</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 1 &#x00B6; 4 (2001). Thus, in the context of this compliance proceeding, while we cannot examine the substance of the agency's decision not to grant the appellant a security clearance, we will determine whether the agency has failed to return the appellant to duty in good faith.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Where a disciplinary action is based on the denial or revocation of a clearance, however, the Board may determine whether the clearance was denied and whether transfer to a nonsensitive position was feasible. <span class="Italic">Blagaich v. Department of Transportation,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 619 &#x00B6; 16 (2001), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 63 Fed. Appx. 476 (Fed. Cir. 2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant has not answered two questions on the SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions.[9] The agency argues that without a completed SF-86 it cannot complete the appellant's in-processing, cannot grant an interim security clearance, cannot forward her security clearance package to the Office of Personnel Management for action, and cannot allow her to report for duty. The appellant provides nothing to cause us to doubt the agency's assertions. Furthermore, the SF-86 is a widely-used standard government form and nothing in the record suggests that there is anything unusual or improper in the agency's requirement that the appellant complete it. The appellant asserts that she did not understand the two questions at issue here and that the agency's refusal to clarify the questions constituted noncompliance. That argument is not persuasive. Agency security specialist Janet Thompson stated in a declaration made under penalty of perjury that of the thousands of people she has interviewed regarding <span id="Page_5006"></span>security clearances, the appellant is the only individual she can recall who refused to answer the two questions at issue here because they purportedly did not understand the questions. Furthermore, we have reviewed the questions at issue and fail to discern why either question was difficult for the appellant, a former security specialist for the agency and now an attorney, to answer. In sum, we find that the agency has not acted in bad faith and its actions do not constitute noncompliance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;The first question the appellant refuses to answer asks whether the appellant has previously had a security clearance revoked or if her access to security information was removed. The second question asks whether the appellant has been a party to any public record civil court actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant makes three additional arguments regarding the requirement that she obtain a security clearance before reporting for duty. First, she asserts that the requirement that she obtain a clearance was improper because she possessed a security clearance when she worked for the agency in the early 1990s and the agency never complied with the procedures necessary to revoke it. She also asserts that the agency failed to comply with the procedures to withdraw its June 14, 2004, offer based on her lack of a security clearance. Finally, she asserts that the agency failed to look for positions that did not require a security clearance to which she could be assigned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not persuaded by the appellant's assertions. Thompson states in her September 21, 2004 declaration, and the appellant, a former security specialist, does not disagree, that a new clearance is required when an individual has more than a two-year break in federal service. Here, the appellant last worked for the federal government in 1992. We are aware of nothing about her status as an employee fully recovered from a compensable injury that eliminates the requirement for an updated clearance. Regarding the appellant's allegation that the agency withdrew its June 14, 2004 offer, as discussed above, there is no evidence to support this claim. Finally, in the context of this case, the agency was not obligated to look for a position that did not require a clearance and, in any event, as noted above, all positions at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard require a clearance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Norrup,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 444 &#x00B6; 4; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Egan,</span> 484 U.S. at 530-31.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Permanent loss of a clearance may moot enforcement proceedings challenging the adequacy of an agency's restoration efforts, <span class="Italic">Hicks v. Dept. of Navy</span>, AT-0752-13-7338-X-1 (NP 5/17/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...It is well settled that the Board lacks authority to review the substance of an agency's determination that an employee is ineligible for a secret security clearance or to occupy a noncritical sensitive position. <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 530-31 (1988); <span class="Italic">Kaplan v. Conyers</span>, 733 F.3d 1148, 1158-60 (Fed. Cir. 2013); <span class="Italic">see also King v. Department of the Navy</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 547, &#x00B6; 20 (2005) (finding that, in the context of a compliance proceeding, the Board cannot examine the substance of an agency's decision not to grant a security clearance to an appellant), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 167 F. App'x. 191 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The Board also lacks authority to order the agency to place the appellant into a position that requires him to possess a security clearance or to be eligible for access to classified information or assignment to sensitive duties, when he does not hold such a clearance or possess such eligibility. <span class="Italic">See LaBatte</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. at 594; <span class="Italic">Hill</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. at 275; <span class="Italic">Gray</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. at 283-84....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, under the circumstances at issue, we find that the agency is not required to reassign the appellant to a different position that did not require him to maintain or obtain a security clearance or to be eligible for access to classified information and/or assignment to duties that have been designated national security sensitive. Although the compliance initial decision stated that if the agency had compelling reasons to do so, it could restore the appellant to "another position which has duties and responsibilities that are substantially equivalent in scope and status to those of the position the appellant previously held," the compliance initial decision was issued prior to both the DODCAF's revocation or denial of the appellant's eligibility for access to classified information and/or assignment to duties that have been designated national security sensitive, and the PSAB's affirmance of the DODCAF's revocation or denial.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has asserted, and the appellant does not dispute, that the agency does not have a policy requiring it to reassign him to nonsensitive duties following the loss of a security clearance. When a security clearance is a requirement of an appellant's position, and an appellant has lost eligibility for such a clearance and there is no agency regulation or policy requiring an agency to reassign employees who lose their security clearances to nonsensitive positions, the Board lacks authority to inquire into the feasibility of an appellant's transfer to an alternative position. <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 864 F.2d 1579, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Putnam v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 532, &#x00B6; 13 (2014). Thus, if the agency had never removed the appellant from his Engineer Technician based on his guilty plea in the first instance, the Board would lack authority to order the agency to reassign him to a different position after his eligibility for access to classified information and/or assignment to duties that have been designated national security sensitive was revoked.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Status quo ante</span> relief does not entitle the appellant to be placed in a better position than he would have enjoyed if he had not been removed. <span class="Italic">See Sink v.

Thus, to be in compliance with the Board's final order, the agency was not required to reassign the appellant to an alternative position following the revocation of his eligibility for access to classified information and/or assignment to duties that have been designated national security sensitive. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., King</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 547, &#x00B6; 23 (finding that an agency was not required to search for a position that did not require a security clearance to be in compliance with a Board order requiring that the agency afford the appellant priority consideration for a position).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find the circumstances at issue here to be distinguishable from Board decisions finding that agencies properly complied with orders to reinstate appellants by detailing them to alternative positions while their security clearances were in the process of being reinstated or were temporarily suspended. <span class="Italic">See LaBatte</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. at 594-95 (finding an agency in compliance with an order to reinstate an appellant when it detailed him to a different position that did not require a security clearance while the reinstatement of his security clearance was pending); <span class="Italic">Hill</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. at 274-75 (finding an agency in compliance with an order to reinstate an appellant when the agency detailed her to a different nonsensitive position while her security clearance was temporarily suspended). Here, the DODCAF's revocation or denial of the appellant's eligibility for access to classified information and/or assignment to duties that have been designated national security sensitive was not temporary, and was affirmed by a PSAB on appeal. Neither the Board's nonprecedential final order nor the compliance initial decision immunizes the appellant from a second removal based on his subsequent failure to meet the requirements of the Engineer Technician position. <span class="Italic">See Sink</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 153, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-23 (finding that a Board's decision that an appellant's retirement was involuntary did not prevent the agency from acting on a separate pending proposal to remove him for refusal to accept a directed reassignment).</p>
