<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-47"><span class="space">b.</span> EEO Complaint, Allegations</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The filing of an EEO complaint does not constitute whistleblowing activity protected under 5 USC 2302(b)(8), although reprisal against an individual who files an EEO complaint is a violation of 5 USC 2302(b)(9), as well as a violation of the antidiscrimination statute furnishing the basis for the underlying complaint. Under <span class="Italic">Young v. MSPB</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20200611166">961 F.3d 1323</a>, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2020):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Young also contends that she was retaliated against and subjected to a hostile work environment for filing EEO complaints. Allegations of retaliation for exercising a Title VII right, however, do not fall within the scope of section 2302(b)(8) of the Whistleblower Protection Act and are therefore not proper subjects for inclusion in an IRA appeal on that ground. <span class="Italic">See Serrao v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 95 F.3d 1569, 1575-76 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Spruill v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 978 F.2d 679, 689 (Fed. Cir. 1992). Nor do such allegations fall within the list of other prohibited personnel practices for which the Board can grant corrective action in an IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 ("WPEA"), Pub. L. No. 112-199, 126 Stat. 1465-76, Congress expanded the list of prohibited personnel practices for which the Board can grant corrective action to include those set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), and (D). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a). Section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i) covers retaliation for exercising any appeal, complaint, or grievance right relating to whistleblowing, i.e, retaliation for seeking to remedy a violation of section 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See Hicks v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 819 F.3d 1318, 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2016).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 2302(b)(9)(A)(ii), which is not included in the list of prohibited personnel practices for which the Board can issue corrective action, covers retaliation for exercising any appeal, complaint, or grievance right other than one seeking to remedy a violation of section 2302(b)(8). Retaliation for filing those other types of complaints is remediable through different mechanisms, and not by an IRA appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Hansen v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 746 F. App'x 976, 981 n.6 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (reporting allegations of sexual harassment does not constitute a whistleblowing disclosure); <span class="Italic">Garvin v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 737 F. App'x 999, 1004 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (filing union grievances and EEO complaint do not fall within the WPEA); <span class="Italic">Nuri v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 695 F. App'x 550, 553 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (filing EEO complaint, unfair labor practice complaint, or grievance is not within Board's IRA jurisdiction because they did not seek to remedy an act of whistleblower reprisal); <span class="Italic">Coulibaly v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 709 F. App'x 9 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (filing a race discrimination complaint is not a whistleblower disclosure); <span class="Italic">Daniels v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 832 F.3d 1049, 1055 &#x0026; n.13 (9th Cir. 2016) (in enacting the WPEA, Congress intended to protect only disclosures of the kind of misconduct listed in section 2302(b)(8)); <span class="Italic">Mudd v.

For that reason, Ms. Young's contention that she was removed in part in retaliation for making EEO complaints about the agency's failure to accommodate her disability does not present an issue over which the Board has jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, we must determine whether the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation of a protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) or engaged in protected activity described under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D). <span class="Italic">Salerno</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 230, &#x00B6; 5. Reprisal for exercising an EEO right is a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), not 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Linder v.

As relevant here, protected activity under section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i) includes "the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation...<span class="Italic">with regard to remedying a violation of [section 2302(b)(8)]</span>." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i) (emphasis added). Section 2302(b)(8) provides, in relevant part, that it is unlawful for an agency to take or fail to take a personnel action with respect to any employee or applicant for employment because of any disclosure of information that he reasonably believes evidences any violation of any law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A).

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant matter, the administrative judge found that the appellant engaged in protected activity under section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i) when he filed an EEO complaint in which he disclosed a reasonable belief that DHS violated the regulatory "waiting period" for promotions by giving him a GS-9 step increase and a promotion to GS-11 on the same day in 2006. However, the appellant's EEO complaint did not seek to remedy alleged whistleblower reprisal under section 2302(b)(8); rather, he repeatedly alleged that DHS unlawfully promoted him and "black listed" him in retaliation for his prior EEO activity. As discussed above, to constitute protected activity under section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), the substance of an appeal, complaint, or grievance must concern remedying a violation of whistleblower reprisal under section 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Mudd</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6; 7. A nonfrivolous allegation regarding just one part of section 2302(b)(8)--such as, as here, a disclosure of one of the categories of wrongdoing specified in section 2302(b)(8)(A) without any allegation of whistleblower reprisal--is insufficient to constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of protected activity under section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i). <span class="Italic">See Mudd</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6; 7.

Mr. Edwards alleged reprisal--his reassignment--after he protested to management discriminatory patterns of behavior in the workplace and discriminatory treatment of an individual employee. Edwards did not allege that he was <span id="Page_3716"></span>discriminated against. His concerns were about the treatment of others. He also attempted to protest management's discriminatory practices through the EEO complaint process. The decision described the events:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The essential facts, as set forth in the initial decision and not contested on review, are that the appellant was a GS-15 Deputy Director of the agency's Employment and Training Administration, Office of Information Systems and Technology, when he verbally "disclosed and protested" to his supervisors their alleged failure to provide opportunities and assignments to African American employees because of their race. He also disclosed to his supervisors their alleged discrimination when they refused to promote one of the appellant's subordinates to a vacant supervisory position for which he had competed, allegedly because of the subordinate's race (African American). At about the same time, the appellant filed complaints of systemic race discrimination against African American employees under the agency's Harassing Conduct Policy and with the agency's Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Office. Within a few months after these actions, the agency reassigned the appellant to a nonsupervisory GS-15 position and posted his former position for recruitment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) alleging that his reassignment was in reprisal for his disclosures. After OSC closed its investigation, the appellant filed a timely IRA appeal alleging, among other things, that the Board had jurisdiction over his appeal pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) and 2302(b)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>

As explained below, while the appellant appears to have been admirably motivated in seeking to remedy perceived discrimination in his agency, we find that he failed to meet his jurisdictional burden, and that the proper forum for his allegation of retaliation for filing an EEO complaint is with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Board found that it did not lack jurisdiction to hear and decide an IRA appeal simply because the disclosure was made in a FECA claim, the nature of Ms. Von Kelsch's disclosure of a purported title VII violation divested the Board of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 508-09.

The Board found that, even if the disclosures were made outside of the grievance or EEO processes, such disclosures did not constitute protected whistleblower activity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) because they pertain to matters of discrimination covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1)(A). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, Ms. Redschlag's disclosures of title VII-related matters--that she purportedly made to her Congressman, the agency's Criminal Investigation Division, and while participating in the Secretary of the Army's Focus Panel on Sexual Harassment--were not protected under section 2302(b)(8).<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> The decision in <span class="Italic">Redschlag</span> cited the Board's previous decision in <span class="Italic">Nogales v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decisions are consistent with the decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit). In <span class="Italic">Spruill v.

In <span class="Italic">Serrao v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 95 F.3d 1569, 1575 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">When confronted with the issue of whether a title VII matter is within the scope of the whistleblower protection statutes, the regional circuits that have addressed the issue have agreed with the Federal Circuit.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Historically, the Board has been bound by the precedent of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on this issue. However, as a result of changes initiated by the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (Pub. L.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed a decision by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky which determined that an employee's claims of sexual harassment, race discrimination, and associated retaliation were not appropriately categorized as whistleblower claims, holding that "when dealing with issues of employment discrimination, the WPA/WPEA is displaced and preempted by [t]itle VII." <span class="Italic">Carrethers v.

Similarly, in a case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, an employee attempted to contest adverse actions based on his religion and national origin within the context of a WPA claim. The court held that "for [F]ederal employees claiming discrimination on the basis of religion and national origin (as well as reprisal for complaining about discrimination), [t]itle VII is the exclusive judicial remedy." <span class="Italic">Malekpour v. Chao</span>, 682 F. App'x 471, 475-76 (7th Cir. 2017). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit also has agreed with the "Federal Circuit's longstanding precedent, which Congress has been aware of but has never overturned," that "employees who specifically complain about discrimination against <span id="Page_3717"></span>them (or retaliation against them for having filed a discrimination claim) are not covered by the general whistleblower provisions and thus fall outside the Board's whistleblower jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Coulibaly v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 709 F. App'x 9, 10 (D.C. Cir. 2017). Further, prior to the passage of all circuit review, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit concluded that, while reprisal for EEO activity can form the basis of a title VII claim, it "generally does not encompass whistleblowing activity, which usually involves disclosures outside established procedures." <span class="Italic">Fleeger v. Principi</span>, 221 F. App'x 111, 117 (3d Cir. 2007) (citing <span class="Italic">Spruill v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 978 F.2d 679 (Fed. Cir. 1992)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to finding that allegations of discrimination in violation of title VII cannot be brought under the whistleblower protection statutes, courts have also found that the reverse is true; allegations of reprisal for whistleblowing cannot be brought under title VII. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. James</span>, 597 F. App'x 983, 987 (10th Cir. 2015) (finding that the plaintiff failed to establish that she opposed conduct prohibited by title VII because she alleged in her EEO complaint that she was actually retaliated against for whistleblowing about timecard fraud); <span class="Italic">see also Jamil v. Department of Defense</span>, 910 F.2d 1203, 1207 (4th Cir. 1990) (explaining that title VII is not a general "bad acts" statute, and "only addresses discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, and national origin, not discrimination for whistleblowing"). Indeed, courts have long adopted the proposition that claims of discrimination in Federal employment are to be addressed solely through title VII. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. General Services Administration</span>, 425 U.S. 820, 835 (1976) (stating that title VII "provides the exclusive judicial remedy for claims of discrimination in [F]ederal employment"); <span class="Italic">see also Pretlow v. Garrison</span>, 420 F. App'x 798, 801 (10th Cir. 2011) (explaining that "[i]nsofar as [a Federal employee] complains of discrimination and associated retaliatory conduct, his exclusive remedy is provided by [t]itle VII"); <span class="Italic">Mlynczak v. Bodman</span>, 442 F.3d 1050, 1057 (7th Cir. 2006) (referring to title VII as the "exclusive judicial remedy for claims of discrimination in [F]ederal employment"). Thus, it is clear that separate remedies exist for redress of claims of discrimination and claims of reprisal for whistleblowing, and that claims must be brought under the appropriate statutory scheme. This further supports the conclusion that allegations of discrimination may not be brought under the whistleblower protection statutes.</p>

The Board agreed with the administrative judge that corrective action was not warranted in the Board appeal because the agency established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action absent the protected disclosures, but the Board specifically addressed whether Mr. Kinan's disclosures were protected and whether he established that one or more of the disclosures was a contributing factor to the personnel action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10. In addressing whether the disclosures were protected, the Board explained that it found without merit the agency's argument that the disclosures were not protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) because they related to EEO and grievance matters under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9). <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 13 n.2.

As in <span class="Italic">Armstrong</span>, however, the <span class="Italic">Kinan</span> decision failed to discuss or even acknowledge the Board and court precedent set forth above regarding the scope of the coverage of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), and the reasoning the Board offered was inconsistent with established precedent.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;In support of the holding, the Board in <span class="Italic">Kinan</span> cited the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Ellison v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on review that, under the WPEA, the scope of the whistleblower protection statutes was expanded to include allegations of wrongdoing that fall within the purview of title VII. To bolster this argument, the appellant cites the WPEA's legislative history, which generally supports broadly interpreting the statutory scheme's protections.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree that Congress intended the coverage of the whistleblower protection statutes to be broad. Nevertheless, the coverage is not boundless. Nothing in the statute or legislative history of the WPEA addresses <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>, or their progeny. Thus, despite expanding the scope of whistleblower protection in other ways, nothing suggests that the WPEA altered the long-standing administrative and judicial interpretation that title VII-related claims are excluded from protection under the whistleblower protection statutes. Moreover, following the enactment of the WPEA, the circuit courts have reaffirmed that this interpretation is still controlling.[8] <span class="Italic">See Young</span>, 961 F.3d at 1327-28; <span class="Italic">Coulibaly</span>, 709 F.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPEA expanded the scope of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B) to afford the Board jurisdiction in IRA appeals over allegations of reprisal for "testifying for or otherwise lawfully assisting any individual in the exercise of any" "appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation." WPEA &#x00A7; 101(b)(1)(A); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)-(B). On review, the appellant argues that his disclosures and protests about racial discrimination constituted "lawful assistance" because "it is a regulatory requirement that employees disclose abuse to appropriate authorities," and "discrimination, whether against oneself or others in the workplace, is a form of abuse which, when reported, deserves all available protection against reprisal." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.101(b)(11) (stating that Federal employees "shall disclose waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption to appropriate authorities").

The statute provides that the Board has jurisdiction under section 2302(b)(9)(B) only when the individual for whom the appellant is testifying or is otherwise lawfully assisting in exercising "any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation." Accordingly, the Board has held that neither testifying on behalf of a coworker as part of an administrative investigation, nor filing a motion to dismiss a criminal indictment, were protected under section 2302(b)(9)(B) because these activities were not the exercise of an appeal, complaint, or grievance right by another employee, as they did not constitute initial steps toward taking legal action against the agency for perceived violations of employment rights.[9] <span class="Italic">Graves v.

DOD</span>, 46 MSPR 549, 552-54 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This controversy turns on what Congress intended when it made section 2302(b)(8) applicable to disclosures concerning violations of "any law."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit addressed a similar issue in <span class="Italic">Horner v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 815 F.2d 668 (Fed. Cir. 1987). In that case the Board had exercised jurisdiction over a complaint filed by the Special Counsel alleging the illegal receipt of gifts from subordinates by a federal employee. Although the governing statute did not specifically authorize the Special Counsel to bring a disciplinary action against an employee for the illegal receipt of gifts, it did authorize the Special Counsel to investigate and prosecute violations of "any civil service law, rule, or regulation." 5 USC 1206(e)(1)(D) (West Supp. 1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court, however, reversed the Board's decision. Noting that where the language is clear and the provision consistent with the rest of the statute, preference must be given to the plain meaning of the statute, the court held that "where other provisions of the statute raise significant questions about the plain meaning of the subsection, it is necessary to analyze the statute as a whole and to consult the legislative history." <span class="Italic">Horner</span> at 673.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its analysis of the Special Counsel's jurisdiction, the court reached conclusions that apply to the statute in question here. First the court noted that several provisions of section 1206 granted the Special Counsel authority in very specific areas, such as the authority to investigate Hatch Act violations, the authority to investigate arbitrary withholding under the Freedom of Information Act, and the authority to investigate personnel actions involving prohibited discrimination. The court then held that to construe subparagraph (D)--providing for the investigation of violations of "any civil service law, rule, or regulation"--as broadly as the Board had, would encompass, and would be incompatible with, the narrow authority granted by its neighboring provisions. This interpretation would render the other provisions superfluous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, should the Board interpret section 2302(b)(8) as applying to the filing of an EEO complaint, the specificity of section 2302(b)(9) protecting the filing of appeals (including EEO complaints) would be rendered superfluous. If the employee filing a grievance, complaint, or appeal were protected against reprisal by section 2302(b)(8), there would be no need for the section 2302(b)(9) protections.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court in <span class="Italic">Horner</span> also noted that because the overall construction of section 1206 is detailed and specific, "section 1206(e)(1)(D) should not be given a literal construction such that it broadly overrides or makes redundant other provisions, particularly those within the same section of the statute."... The same problem is present here. Section 2302 delineates specific prohibited personnel practices in a detailed manner. To interpret section 2302(b)(8) literally would both broadly override and make redundant the provisions of section 2302(b)(9). It must therefore be concluded that such an interpretation was not intended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the very wording of sections 2302(b)(8) and 2302(b)(9) suggests protection for distinctly different activities. The filing of an appeal, complaint, or grievance, is the exercise of a statutory or regulatory right. It is the initial step toward taking legal action against an employer. The employee who exercises this option seeks vindication for the perceived violation of his or her rights. The wording of section 2302(b)(8), protecting "a disclosure of information," suggests a different type of activity not necessarily based on a personal grievance that distinguishes it from "the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation." This adds additional force to the argument that section 2302(b)(8) was not intended to apply to the filing of an EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, there is evidence in the legislative history of the statute that suggests that Congress paid specific attention to limiting the applicability of section 2302(b)(8). An earlier version of the statute, the WPA of 1987, contained an early version of section 1221 for seeking a stay of a personnel action taken "as a result of any prohibited personnel practice."... The Senate subcommittee hearing at which this version of the statute was presented featured the testimony of several witnesses, including that of Special Counsel Mary F. Wieseman. In her testimony, the Special Counsel expressed concern about granting an individual right of action to employees who had at their disposal the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as an avenue to seek redress for alleged discrimination.... She suggested limiting the individual right of action provided by section 1221 to cases of reprisal based on whistleblowing....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A revised version of the Act was presented by the subcommittee in a subsequent report, in which it was stated that numerous changes were made in the statute in response to suggestions made at the aforementioned hearing, and during subsequent discussions with representatives of concerned federal agencies.... Among the changes in the revised version is a limitation of the individual right of action, including the right to seek a stay, to the subject of a personnel action taken "as a result of a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)(8)."... The final version of the statute includes this revision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This clear narrowing of the applicability of the statute indicates a desire by Congress to limit stays to the specific case of whistleblower reprisals. Section 2302(b)(9), however, which indisputably applies to the filing of EEO complaints, is not mentioned in the revised section 1221. This omission underscores the intention to limit the individual right of action to reprisals for whistleblowing, as distinct from those for the filing of complaints.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Other pre-WPEA decisions follow. Because the Board's IRA jurisdiction is limited to whistleblowing, allegations of age discrimination or constitutional violations are not within that jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Lucas v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 63 MSPR 455, 459 n.3 (1994) (probationary termination). The Board's analysis concerning the categorization of EEO complaints for purposes of WPA jurisdiction was confirmed, <span class="Italic">Spruill v. MSPB</span>, 978 F.2d 679, 689-92 (Fed. Cir. 1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The jurisdictional issue in this case presents a straightforward question of statutory interpretation. The question is whether the filing of an EEOC complaint which alleged discriminatory treatment by the employer in violation of Title VII constitutes 'whistleblowing' within the scope of 2302(b)(8). Spruill argues that his EEOC claim is a "disclosure of information by an employee...which the employee...reasonably believes evidences a violation of any law...." (Title VII) within the meaning of those phrases in 2302(b)(8), and therefore the MSPB has jurisdiction under the IRA. In contrast, the MSPB argues that the filing of the EEOC claim is "the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law" within the terms of 2302(b)(9)(A), which section does not carry with it MSPB jurisdiction under the IRA. EEOC complaints must be excluded from 2302(b)(8), the MSPB argues, for to do otherwise would eviscerate 2302(b)(9)(A)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Spruill's argument is that his EEOC complaint, facially coming under 2302(b)(9)(A), necessarily is based upon allegations of a violation of law, rule, or regulation, thus facially coming under 2302(b)(8). But this superficial reading does not withstand closer analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, in enacting the CSRA Congress chose in these two subsections to differentiate between reprisal based on disclosure of information and reprisal based upon exercising a right to complain. Only the former--described in 2302(b)(8)--was termed "whistleblowing" in the debates, although that term was neither employed nor defined in the original statute itself. This understanding of the term was subsequently formalized in the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. Congress in the Findings and Purpose section of the Act noted that one of the functions of the CSRA and the OSC was "to protect <span class="Italic">whistleblowers</span> (those individuals who make disclosures described in such section 2302(b)(8)) from reprisal." 103 Stat. 16, 2(a)(3) (codified at 5 USC 1201, note (Supp. 11 1990)). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> 135 Cong. Rec. H750 (daily ed. March 21, 1989) (joint explanatory statement of S. 508, reintroduced in support of S. 20).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Spruill argues that we should not read too much into this use of two distinct subsections since many of the subsections of 2302(b) clearly overlap amongst themselves and with provisions of other statutes, and <span id="Page_3720"></span>Congress was well aware of this. This argument is not persuasive. Unless Congress makes it evident that one provision is intended to subsume another parallel provision, we construe the statute to give meaning to each part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, in crafting the IRA provision of the WPA, Congress clearly intended that it be available to only <span class="Italic">some</span> victims of reprisal, not all victims. We know this from the express language of 1221(a) of the IRA, limiting its reach to allegations falling within 2302(b)(8) and <span class="Italic">not</span> 2302(b)(9). And we know it from the title of 1221 itself--"Individual right of action in <span class="Italic">certain</span> reprisal cases."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This selectivity was intended. The initial House and Senate versions of the WPA extended the IRA to <span class="Italic">all</span> victims of the prohibited personnel practices listed in 2302(b)(1) through (11). H.R. 25, 100th Cong. 1st Sess. 1221 (1987); S. 508, 100th Cong. 1st Sess. 1221 (1987). That broad grant of jurisdiction was later changed to eliminate not only the non-reprisal based prohibited personnel actions, but reprisal stemming from 2302(b)(9) prohibited actions as well. Testimony of the unwieldiness of the proposed system preceded the amendment. To read the scope of 2302(b)(8) as including activities squarely within 2302(b)(9)(A) would have the effect of reversing this carefully considered Congressional decision...and would render 2302(b)(9)(A) largely irrelevant, if not completely superfluous....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This distinction between the two subsections has been recognized in the case law as well. <span class="Italic">In re Frazier</span>, 1 MSPB 159, 1 MSPR 163 (1979), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> <span class="Italic">sub</span> <span class="Italic">nom.</span> <span class="Italic">Frazier v. MSPB</span>, 672 F.2d 150 (D.C. Cir. 1982), four officials complained to the OSC that they had been transferred in reprisal for whistleblowing and also for the filing of EEOC complaints. The OSC, the MSPB, and the D.C. Circuit all agreed that the disclosures to two Congressmen of general mismanagement, harassment, and discrimination constituted whistleblowing under 2302(b)(8). On the other hand, the EEOC complaints were treated as falling <span class="Italic">solely</span> within 2302(b)(9)(A), despite the phrasing of 2302(b)(8). 1 MSPR at 190-92; 672 F.2d at 156.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Spruill argues that since filing EEOC complaints fits within the terms of 2302(b)(8), we should go no further unless we are convinced that that interpretation leads to "absurd results."... And, he argues, to determine whether a result is "absurd," one must test it against the known intent of Congress regarding that statutory provision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Essentially, then, Spruill argues that we must accept his interpretation unless the legislative history proves a negative--that Congress did <span class="Italic">not</span> intend for EEOC complaints to be within the plain language of 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that a crabbed approach. When the CSRA was enacted in 1978, it provided whistleblower protection not only through 2302(b)(8), but also through the creation of the OSC. This provided protections for whistleblowers for the first time, protections thought necessary to encourage potential whistleblowers to come forward since prior to the CSRA they did so only at their peril....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At that same time, however, the issue of discrimination was a known and abhorred evil that had long been of concern to Congress. Years before, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to combat discrimination. That Act set up the EEOC, Pub. L. 88-352, Title VII, 705(a)-(d), (f)-(j), July 2, 1964, 78 Stat. 258, 259 (codified at 42 USC 2000e-4 (1988)), and established procedures to encourage the disclosure of discriminatory practices. Upon passage of the CSRA, enforcement and related functions regarding discrimination in Federal employment were placed with the EEOC. Exec. Order No. 121026, 44 F.R. 1053 (1978) (reprinted in 42 USCA 2000e-4, Note 1 (West 1981 &#x0026; Supp. 1992)). This executive action "place[d] the Commission at the center of equal employment opportunity enforcement...[giving] coherence and direction to the government's efforts by developing strong uniform enforcement standards to apply throughout the government: standardized data collection procedures, joint training programs, programs to ensure the sharing of enforcement related data among agencies, and methods and priorities for complaint and compliance reviews." Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978, 43 F.R. 19807, 92 Stat. 378 (message of the President) (reprinted in 42 USCA 2000e-4, note (West 1981 &#x0026; Supp. 1992)). Employees who filed EEOC complaints were protected from reprisal. 42 USC 2000e-3(a) (1988); 5 CFR 1613.261. Thus, when Congress enacted the CSRA with a provision in it to protect whistleblowers, the deficiencies as far as reprisal for discrimination complaints were concerned had already been addressed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is good reason for Congress to have structured the act in the manner it did. As the OSC noted in its response to Spruill, investigative and remedial measures are available to Spruill through the EEOC. The OSC policy of avoiding duplication of effort by referring discrimination matters to the EEOC conserves governmental resources and avoids potentially conflicting procedures or outcomes. It acknowledges the EEOC role as an expert agency in discrimination matters, facilitates EEOC consolidation of important statistical data, and provides an efficient division of decisionmaking labor. In short, it promotes efficiency and economy. Our conclusion today reinforces Congress' efforts to provide the MSPB with a workload that is within its resources and to provide the EEOC with a continuing leadership role in the ongoing battle to eradicate discrimination.</p>

Whether the Board would have jurisdiction to review Employee X's performance rating as an IRA appeal depends on whether his previous Board appeal involved a claim of retaliation for whistleblowing.

If the previous appeal did not involve a claim of retaliation for whistleblowing, there might be a prohibited personnel practice under subsection (b)(9)(A)(ii), but Employee X could not establish jurisdiction over an IRA appeal.

The amendments are not clear as to their effect and the legislative history is unclear as to their intent. <span class="Italic">See and compare</span> 5 USC 2302(b)(9), 5 USC 1214(a)(3), and 5 USC 1221(a). <span class="Italic">Foo v. USDA,</span> SF-1221-15-0133-W-1 (NP 6/3/2015), stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the appellant's allegations of reprisal for filing an EEO complaint, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a), as amended by the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, Pub. L. No. 112-199, 126 Stat. 1465 (WPEA), section 101(b)(1)(A), an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment may, with respect to any personnel action taken, or proposed to be taken against such employee, former employee, or applicant for employment, as a result of a prohibited personnel practice described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) or &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D), seek corrective action from the Board. Among other things, the WPEA expanded the scope of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), to include:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;with regard to remedying a violation of paragraph (8); or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;other than with regard to remedying a violation of paragraph (8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, of those two categories, the WPEA only extended the Board's IRA jurisdiction to claims arising under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i) but not to those arising under (b)(9)(A)(ii). <span class="Italic">See</span> WPEA section 101(b)(1)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant's failure to claim that his EEO complaint involved remedying a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), precludes finding Board jurisdiction over this IRA appeal on that basis. The only documentation in the record regarding the substance of the appellant's EEO complaint does not indicate that he sought therein to remedy whistleblower reprisal, and it was therefore not a protected disclosure under the WPEA, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Reed v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 165, &#x00B6; 13 (2015). Thus, we agree with the administrative judge that the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider such a claim in this IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But <span class="Italic">Gray v. MSPB</span>, 650 Fed. Appx. 775, 777 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP), offered an unqualified reading of the 2012 amendment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With the enactment of the WPEA, Congress significantly increased the whistleblowing protections available to federal employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 1 (2012), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 2012 U.S.C.C.A.N. 589, 589 (explaining that the WPEA was intended to "strengthen the rights of and protections for federal whistleblowers so that they can more effectively help root out waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government"). The WPEA expanded the IRA appeal right provided under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a) to include claims for corrective action based not only on the prohibited personnel practices described in section 2302(b)(8), but also for those described in sections 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), and (D). <span class="Italic">See</span> WPEA &#x00A7; 101(b)(1), 126 Stat. 1465-66; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3). Of relevance here, under the WPEA an aggrieved employee now has the right, under certain circumstances, to seek corrective action from the board when he or she suffers reprisal as a result of filing an EEO complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i) (prohibiting an agency from retaliating against an employee for "the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right" related to whistleblowing).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For the record, 5 USC 1221(a) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section and subsection 1214(a)(3), an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment may, with respect to any personnel action taken, or proposed to be taken, against such employee, former employee, or applicant for employment, as a result of a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D), seek corrective action from the Merit Systems Protection Board</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 2302(b)(9) describes as a prohibited personnel practice:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to such authority--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(9)&#x2003;take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, any personnel action against any employee or applicant for employment because of--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003; with regard to remedying a violation of paragraph (8); or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003; other than with regard to remedying a violation of paragraph (8);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; testifying for or otherwise lawfully assisting any individual in the exercise of any right referred to in subparagraph (A)(i) or (ii);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003; cooperating with or disclosing information to the Inspector General of an agency, or the Special Counsel, in accordance with applicable provisions of law; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(D)&#x2003; for refusing to obey an order that would require the individual to violate a law, rule, or regulation[.]</p>
