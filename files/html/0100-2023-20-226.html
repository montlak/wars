<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-218"><span class="space">8.</span> OSC and Agency Disciplinary Case Against Individual Charged With Reprisal</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Disciplinary cases involving reprisals take two forms. An agency may bring its own case against an employee. OSC may bring a disciplinary action against an employee. A case brought by OSC against an employee may be coupled with a corrective action case against an agency, and different burdens of proof may be applied to each case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act established a statutory burden of proof in an OSC disciplinary case under 5 USC 1215(a)(3)(B):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(B)&#x2003;In any case brought under paragraph (1) in which the Board finds that an employee has committed a prohibited personnel practice under section 2302(b)(8), or 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D), the Board may impose disciplinary action if the Board finds that the activity protected under section 2302(b)(8), or 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D) was a significant motivating factor, even if other factors also motivated the decision, for the employee's decision to take, fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take a personnel action, unless that employee demonstrates, by preponderance of evidence, that the employee would have taken, failed to take, or threatened to take or fail to take the same personnel action, in the absence of such protected activity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The case law that follows predates the WEPA. The 2012 statute did not affect the analysis of a disciplinary case brought by an agency against its own employee. [Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-207.html#sec8-206">Invidious Discrimination; Offensive Remark or Conduct; Preferential Treatment; Reprisal</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the 2012 amendments, there was no statutorily-defined burden of proof for an OSC disciplinary case. Disciplinary cases were proved, according to the cases, by demonstrating that reprisal was a significant or important factor, not that it was but a contributing or tangential factor. Motivation must be analyzed. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Costello</span>, 75 MSPR 562, 613 (1997) ("The appropriate test for reprisal is whether OSC has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that retaliation was a significant factor in the actions at issue."); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Santella</span>, 65 MSPR 452, 458 (1994) ("we conclude that the term 'significant factor,' as that term is used in Special Counsel disciplinary cases, should be used only to refer to a factor that played an important role in the allegedly retaliatory action").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The significance of distinguishing difficult personnel decisions involving complex events from tainted personnel actions was emphasized in <span class="Italic">Harvey v. MSPB</span>, 802 F.2d 537, 548 (D.C. Cir. 1986), involving a (successful) appeal by the appellant from an OSC disciplinary action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Formulating an adverse opinion of an employee, based upon what he has written and thereby not recommending him for certain jobs, is not the same as taking action against an employee in an attempt to thwart his exercise of his protected rights. If it were, it would mean that one in an executive position can never exercise his considered judgment in making personnel recommendations when asked to do so when that judgment is based on anything even tangentially related to the exercise of protected conduct. <span class="Italic">See</span>,<span class="Italic"> e.g.</span>,<span class="Italic"> Starrett</span>, 792 F.2d at 1253 n.12.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Starrett,</span> the Fourth Circuit observed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[S]uch a difference, valid as it may be in some contexts, may not support the use of a standard of causation which inadequately protects personnel...who are forced to make scores of personnel decisions which may peripherally or accidentally involve situations where employees have engaged in protected practice. The Act was designed to prohibit retaliation or reprisals by personnel because of improper consideration of protected actions. The standard of proof used must insure that the motivation for the adverse action was an improper one. There is no support in the legislative history of the Act for any particular standard of causation, but the standard used by the Board for any action under the Act, whether a "corrective action" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1206(c)(1)(B) or a "disciplinary action" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1206(g), must not be so loose or weak as to punish those not motivated by improper purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1253 n.12.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The tangled evolution of the pre-WEPA formulation of the burden of proof best starts at the beginning. The first disciplinary action case was decided by the Board in <span class="Italic">Acting Special Counsel v. Sullivan</span>, 6 MSPR 526, 531, 6 MSPB 442 (1981). The respondent, the SBA Associate Deputy Director, formerly Executive Director of the Democratic National Committee, was charged with political manipulation and geographic reassignment of district directors of the SBA. The Board's conclusions after an 11-day hearing were summarized:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[P]etitioner produced a mass of largely circumstantial evidence which left us with the sense that she had mistaken smoke for fire. While she pointed to a few sparks suggesting the possibility of a fire, we must conclude that the evidence simply did not establish that Sullivan committed the violations charged by anything approaching the required preponderant standard. In light of Sullivan's consistent and unshaken testimony that he had legitimate reasons for his actions and an ample amount of corroborating evidence, we cannot conclude otherwise.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board declined to link Sullivan with past patronage problems in SBA based on his own political background, stating that in a legal proceeding contemplating serious penalties, linkage cannot be forged through supposition. His actions were directed by the SBA Administrator, who felt that a rotation policy would lessen political influence and enhance the managerial talents of district directors. Sullivan had considerable influence over the rotation policy, even if he did not make specific decisions implementing it, and was therefore accountable as an individual with authority to recommend, take, or approve a personnel action. However, he was found to have engaged in no wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The 1989 WPA altered burdens of proof. The question became whether the altered burdens of proof applied to lighten OSC's evidentiary burden in disciplinary cases. The Board decided that the modified burden of proof carried over to an OSC disciplinary case, but the Federal Circuit, in the <span class="Italic">Eidmann</span> litigation, subsequently discussed, disagreed and concluded that pre-WPA burdens of proof applied to OSC disciplinary cases.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Marple</span>, 49 MSPR 528, 532 (1991) (imposing a two-year demotion to a nonsupervisory position upon a manager who recommended that an employee not be reassigned in reprisal for the individual's testimony before a Senate Subcommittee), explained as to the initial evolution of the burden of proof in an OSC disciplinary case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the CSRA this had to be established by preponderant evidence...the same standard that such a showing must meet under the WPA.... The standard to be met by the agency to show that reprisal was not a factor in the action in question is, however, more stringent. Previously, the agency had merely to establish that it would have taken the action even if the employee had not engaged in protected conduct by preponderant evidence.... Under the WPA, however, such a defense by the agency must be shown by clear and convincing evidence, a higher standard. 5 USC 1214(b)(4)(B)(ii)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These new burdens mean essentially, that it is easier for a petitioner to show retaliatory conduct, and more difficult for a respondent to rebut such a showing....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Marple</span> determined, without extensive analysis, that the revised burdens of <span id="Page_4039"></span>proof in the WPA applied across the board to all actions involving alleged violations of 5 USC 2302(b)(8)(A). The revised burden of proof defined in <span class="Italic">Marple</span> was the product of more extensive analysis in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Hathaway</span>, 49 MSPR 595 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Hathaway v. MSPB</span>, 981 F.2d 1237, 1239-40 &#x0026; n.3 (Fed. Cir. 1992), reviewing allegations of reprisal against an individual who made disclosures to his agency's Inspector General. The Federal Circuit specifically noted in its decision that it was not reviewing or approving the Board's formulation of the burden of proof. The Board's <span class="Italic">Hathaway</span> decision explained the WPA burden of proof in a disciplinary case, 49 MSPR at 601-02:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before addressing the parties' exceptions to the first four counts, it is necessary to discuss the effect of the recently enacted WPA on the issue of proof in disciplinary cases involving 2302(b)(8). The CALJ adopted the Special Counsel's argument that the evidentiary standards used to determine (b)(8) violations in corrective action cases under 5 USCA 1214(b)(4)(B), a section enacted as part of the WPA, should also be used to determine (b)(8) violations in disciplinary cases brought pursuant to 5 USCA 1215. The respondent does not contest this finding, and the Board agrees that the CALJ employed the proper standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1215 of 5 USCA sets out the procedures to be followed when the Special Counsel brings a disciplinary action against an employee for committing a prohibited personnel practice. Such practices are defined only in 5 USCA 2302(b). Section 2302(b)(8) sets forth the definition of a prohibited reprisal for whistleblowing. Under this section, a violation does not occur unless it is proven that the personnel action taken or threatened was "because of" the protected disclosure. This section, however, does not explain how the element of causation, and thus proof of a statutory violation, is to be established. But section 1214(b)(4)(B), the corrective action provision of the WPA, provides a framework for determining causality.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under section 1214(b)(4)(B), the Special Counsel may establish that a whistleblower reprisal has taken place by showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the personnel action. 5 USCA 1214(b)(4)(B)(i); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> 135 Cong. Rec. H747 (daily ed. Mar. 21, 1989) (Explanatory Statement on Senate Amendment S. 20). However, a finding of a (b)(8) violation may be avoided, even if whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the personnel action, if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the same action would have been taken in the absence of the whistleblowing. 5 USCA 1214(b)(4)(B)(ii); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 135 Cong. Rec. H749 (daily ed. Mar. 21, 1989) (Joint Explanatory Statement). The Board finds that where reprisal for whistleblowing is at issue, this standard should be applied in disciplinary cases as well as corrective action cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The definition of reprisal contained in (b)(8), including the causal connection requirement, is exclusive and only permits one interpretation. Therefore, the definition of a (b)(8) prohibited personnel practice must be the same regardless of whether a claim of prohibited reprisal is made in the context of a corrective action or a disciplinary action. Because section 1214 contains the only statutory standard explaining how the causal connection element in (b)(8) may be proven, it follows that the 1214 standard must also be used in adjudicating disciplinary actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Previously, the Board applied different standards in corrective action and disciplinary cases. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Harvey</span>, 28 MSPR 595, 609 (1984) <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 802 F.2d 537 (D.C. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Starrett</span>, 28 MSPR 60 (1985), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 792 F.2d 1246 (4th Cir. 1986). However, <span class="Italic">Harvey</span> and <span class="Italic">Starrett</span>, were issued prior to the enactment of the WPA. In the WPA, Congress, for the first time, set out a standard for determining the causal connection in (b)(8). 5 USCA 1214. Given the fact that Congress has now set out a standard for determining (b)(8) violations, it is no longer appropriate to have different standards for disciplinary and corrective action cases. Accordingly, the different standards for disciplinary and corrective action cases, approved in <span class="Italic">Harvey</span> and <span class="Italic">Starrett</span>, are inapplicable to post-WPA cases.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board applied the "contributing factor" analysis in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Eidmann</span>, 49 MSPR 614, 626-27 (1991), concluding that retaliation was established by the timing of disclosures and discipline and by the absence of an articulation of reasons other than retaliation for the termination of the probationary employee. <span class="Italic">Eidmann</span> was the subject of judicial review in <span class="Italic">Eidmann v. MSPB</span>, 976 F.2d 1400, 1404-08 (Fed. Cir. 1992), and the Federal Circuit determined that, although the Board reached a proper result, the burden of proof on OSC in a disciplinary case arising after the WPA was to show that reprisal was a "significant factor" in the disciplinary decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court must next consider the proper standard of causation for disciplinary actions under WPA. Section 2302 of title 5 prohibits employees in authority from taking or threatening personnel actions against other employees "because of" protected whistleblowing. 5 USC 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 5 authorizes the OSC to take two separate actions when reprisals against whistleblowers occur. Under 5 USC 1214 (Supp. II 1990), the OSC may seek from the Board appropriate corrective action to prevent the reprisal from causing the whistleblower any detriment. Under 5 USC 1215, the OSC may seek from the Board disciplinary action, including removal or grade reduction, against employees who commit reprisals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under section 1214, the corrective action section, the Board may restore benefits if "Special Counsel has demonstrated that a disclosure described under section 2302(b)(8) was a contributing factor in the [prohibited] personnel action...." 5 USC 1214(b)(4)(B)(i). The Board, however, may not order corrective action if the agency shows by "clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of [whistleblowing]." 5 USC 1214(b)(4)(B)(ii); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 USC 1221(e)(1)-(2) (Supp. II 1990) (providing for same standard in individual right of action cases brought by employee rather than OSC).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For section 1215, the disciplinary action section, the WPA gives no standard of causation similar to the "contributing factor" standard of section 1214. In the absence of any statutory language, this court must determine the proper causal standard for disciplinary actions as severe as removal or debarment from federal service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRA, WPA's predecessor, lacked a standard of causation for both corrective and disciplinary whistleblower actions. The Board developed a "significant factor" standard for both disciplinary and corrective action cases brought under the CSRA. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Brown</span>, 28 MSPR 133, 137 (1985) (disciplinary actions); <span class="Italic">In re Frazier</span>, 1 MSPB 159, 188, 1 MSPR 163, 196 (1979) (corrective actions), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Frazier v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 672 F.2d 150 (D.C. Cir. 1982). This standard required the OSC to show that the protected conduct was a "significant factor" in the prohibited personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With comment about the higher quantum of proof required by the "significant factor" causal standard in the Senate Report, <span class="Italic">see</span>, S. Rep. No. 413, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 13 (1988), Congress enacted the "contributing factor" standard for corrective actions in section 1214. In the neighboring section 1215 for disciplinary actions, however, Congress declined to change the Board's causal standard. Indeed Congress's amendment to section 1214 highlights its decision to provide no different causal standard for section 1215. Thus, this court determines that disciplinary actions under section 1215 continue to require that the whistleblowing activity be a "significant factor" in the reprisal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The overall context of the WPA shows that Congress deliberately distinguished section 1214 from section 1215 actions. The hallmark of this distinction is the lower causal standard for corrective actions than for disciplinary actions, but the WPA memorializes that distinction in other ways as well. Because a disciplinary action is punitive in contrast to the remedial and restorative character of a corrective action, section 1215 provides procedural protections for accused reprisers. Section 1215 provides, for example, a reasonable time to respond to the complaint, entitlement to an attorney, a hearing before the Board, or an administrative law judge, a transcript of the hearing, and a written decision. 5 USC 1215(a)(2)(A)-(E).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In declining to alter the causal standard of section 1215, Congress apparently recognized the practical difficulties of supervisors "who are forced to make scores of personnel decisions which may peripherally or incidentally involve situations where employees have engaged in protected practice." <span class="Italic">Starrett v. Special Counsel</span>, 792 F.2d 1246, 1253 n.12 (4th Cir. 1986). Congress did not enact a lenient causal standard which could force supervisors to bet their careers whenever recommending a personnel action tangentially related to protected conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board erred by applying the "contributing factor" causal standard not found in section 1215 to discipline Mr. Eidmann. <span class="Italic">Eidmann</span>, 49 MSPR at 625. As noted, section 1215 does not authorize use of the "contributing factor" standard to determine whether an employee is subject to disciplinary action for taking a personnel action because of whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next this court must consider whether the Board erred by not requiring the OSC to prove that Mr. Eidmann knew that the WPA protected Mr. Levin's disclosures. The Board did not require proof that Mr. Eidmann had actual knowledge of the protection for Mr. Levin's disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Harvey v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 802 F.2d 537, 547 (D.C. Cir. 1986), the District of Columbia Circuit suggested that the CSRA required the OSC to prove that the retaliating official actually or constructively knew that section 2302 protected the subordinate employee's activity. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">In re Frazier</span>, 1 MSPB 159, 179, 1 MSPR 163, 186 (1979) ("to establish retaliation, it must be shown that the official accused of taking the retaliatory action against the whistleblower had knowledge that the protected disclosure has been made and by whom."), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Frazier v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 672 F.2d 150 (D.C. Cir. 1982). As a CSRA case, <span class="Italic">Harvey</span> does not bind this court's consideration of the WPA. Section 2302(b)(8) says nothing about the state of mind of the retaliating official. The law simply does not require proof that the retaliating official knew or should have known that the WPA protected the whistleblower's disclosures. The WPA does require an inquiry to determine whether the whistleblower "reasonably believes" the disclosure reveals a legal violation, gross mismanagement, or a safety hazard. 5 USC 2302(b)(8). The Act does not require any inquiry into the retaliator's knowledge or beliefs about the protections due to <span id="Page_4040"></span>the whistleblower. <span class="Italic">See also</span> S. Rep. 413, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 15 (1988) (criticizing <span class="Italic">Harvey</span> requirement of proof of official's state of mind).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, section 1215 permits imposition of disciplinary sanctions on employees who violate section 2302(b)(8) under a "significant factor" causal standard. In order for a protected disclosure to become a "significant factor" in a supervisor's decision to take a prohibited personnel action, the supervisor would need some knowledge of the disclosure. The WPA does not require, however, that the supervisor know that the disclosure was protected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The language of the WPA clarifies that the Board did not err in finding a prohibited personnel practice without evidence that Mr. Eidmann had knowledge that the WPA protected Mr. Levin's disclosures. The WPA does not require proof of such knowledge to show a prohibited personnel practice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court next examines the Board's application of the WPA. Section 2302(b) of title 5 sets forth the prohibited personnel practice of whistleblower reprisal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to such authority--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(8)&#x2003;take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, a personnel action with respect to any employee or applicant for employment because of--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;any disclosure of information by an employee or applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">if such disclosure is not specifically prohibited by law and if such information is not specifically required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, to establish a violation of 5 USC 2302(b)(8), the OSC must prove: (1) the acting official has the authority to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action; (2) the aggrieved employee made a disclosure protected under section 2302(b)(8); (3) the acting official used his authority to take, or refuse to take, a personnel action against the aggrieved employee; (4) the acting official took, or failed to take, the personnel action against the aggrieved employee because of the protected disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To satisfy the first element, OSC must prove that Mr. Eidmann had the authority to "take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action." 5 USC 2302(b). The Board found that Mr. Eidmann had the authority required by the statute. For instance, Mr. Eidmann was state director Gouryeb's chief advisor on personnel issues, including employee-management relations. <span class="Italic">Eidmann</span>, 49 MSPR at 624. Substantial evidence supports the Board's conclusion that Mr. Eidmann possessed sufficient authority for responsibility under section 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second element under section 2302(b)(8) requires the OSC to prove that Mr. Levin made disclosures protected by the WPA. For protection under the WPA, whistleblowers must reasonably believe the disclosure reveals legal violations, gross mismanagement, or substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. The record supports the Board's finding that Mr. Levin reasonably believed his disclosures uncovered violations of both FmHA and General Services Administration (GSA) smoking regulations. <span class="Italic">Eidmann</span>, 49 MSPR at 622-23. The text of the smoking regulations, which ban smoking in general office areas, <span class="Italic">see</span> 41 CFR 10120.105-3 (1991), shows the reasonableness of Mr. Levin's belief. Thus, the WPA protected Mr. Levin's disclosures to Messrs. Eidmann, Pope, and Evans.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The third element requires OSC to show that Mr. Eidmann used his authority to take, or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, a personnel action against Mr. Levin. "Personnel action," includes "an action under chapter 75 of...title[5] or other disciplinary or corrective action." 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii). The record shows that Mr. Eidmann recommended Mr. Levin's firing to Mr. Gouryeb. The record also shows that Mr. Eidmann helped Mr. Gouryeb draft Mr. Levin's termination letter. These actions satisfy the third element. As a probationary employee, Mr. Levin qualified for protection. Section 2302(b)(8) specifically protects even applicants for employment from whistleblower retaliation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fourth element requires the OSC to prove that Mr. Eidmann acted to terminate Mr. Levin "because of" protected disclosures. 5 USC 2302(b)(8). As discussed above, the OSC must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the protected disclosures were a "significant factor" in the personnel action Mr. Eidmann took against Mr. Levin. Although it applied the wrong causal standard, the Board found sufficient facts for this court to ascertain that Mr. Levin's whistleblowing was a significant factor in the termination decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows, and the Board correctly found, that when Mr. Eidmann and Mr. Gouryeb drafted Mr. Levin's termination letter in early August, Mr. Eidmann knew of two protected disclosures--Mr. Levin's call to Mr. Eidmann on June 20, 1988, and Mr. Levin's contact with Mr. Evans on July 21, 1988. As the Board noted, a "short time...elapsed between [Eidmann's] awareness of Mr. Levin's disclosures in June and July and his action of drafting the termination letter...." <span class="Italic">Eidmann</span>, 49 MSPR at 626. Moreover the termination letter itself specifically listed as a cause of termination Mr. Levin's contact with "agency and non-agency officials outside [his] supervisory channels [which] raises concerns about the compelling importance [he] attach[es] to personal, non-program matters." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The record supports the Board's finding that Mr. Eidmann acted against Mr. Levin because of protected whistleblowing. Moreover, the record shows that Mr. Levin's whistleblowing was a significant factor in the decision to terminate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the record supplies substantial evidence to support the Board's findings that Mr. Eidmann's conduct fell within each of the elements for a violation of 2302(b)(8). Although it applied the incorrect causal standard, the Board found sufficient facts to permit this court to affirm its judgment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally this court must consider whether the Board's penalty was excessive. The Board affirmed the chief administrative law judge's decision to demote Mr. Eidmann two grades for two years.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC 1215(a)(3) the Board "may impose disciplinary action" against an employee who has committed a prohibited personnel practice. This statute gives the Board discretion in imposing a penalty. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 1215(a)(3). This court "will not disturb a choice of penalty within the agency's discretion unless the severity of the agency's action appears totally unwarranted in light of all the factors." <span class="Italic">Mings v. Department of Justice</span>, 813 F.2d 384, 390 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (citing <span class="Italic">DeWitt v. Department of Navy</span>, 747 F.2d 1442, 1445 (Fed. Cir. 1984), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 470 U.S. 1054, 105 S. Ct. 1759, 84 L. Ed.2d 822 (1985)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPR 280, 305-06 (1981), the Board set forth a list of twelve factors relevant to penalty determination. However, the Board need not specifically address each and every <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor in assessing a penalty. <span class="Italic">Nagel v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 707 F.2d 1384, 1386 (Fed. Cir. 1983) ("neither statute nor regulation <span class="Italic">requires</span> an agency to demonstrate that it considered all mitigating factors").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the Board considered several relevant factors. For instance, the Board weighed Mr. Gouryeb's command influence over Mr. Eidmann as a mitigating factor. <span class="Italic">Eidmann</span>, 49 MSPR at 627. The Board also noted that Mr. Eidmann's duties as a personnel officer required detailed knowledge of civil service laws and regulations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 627-628. The Board pointed out that Mr. Eidmann recommended Mr. Levin's termination despite endorsements of Mr. Levin's performance by his supervisors. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 628. Finally, the Board considered the seriousness of reprisals against whistleblowers. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board concluded that the penalty was proper. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board carefully considered the relevant factors for imposition of a penalty. The Board did not abuse its discretion by imposing the penalty. This court finds no cause to disturb the Board's discretionary decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board adopted the court's <span class="Italic">Eidmann</span> analysis in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Santella</span>, 65 MSPR 452 (1994). The effect of these decisions is that it is not up to the employee to disprove the charge by filling OSC's evidentiary void. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harvey v. MSPB</span>, 802 F.2d 537 (D.C. Cir. 1986). <span class="Italic">Gores v. VA</span>, 68 MSPR 100, 113 (1995), also applied <span class="Italic">Eidmann</span> through an extensive factual analysis when an agency, rather than OSC, took disciplinary action against one of its own who engaged in whistleblowing reprisal against an employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Having eschewed the "contributing factor" (and its associated "clear and convincing" evidentiary rebuttal standard), and adopted the "significant factor" burden of proof in an OSC disciplinary case, the Federal Circuit did not resolve in <span class="Italic">Eidmann</span> whether a <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> defense should be available to the errant manager. The availability of that defense was the subject of commentary by the Board in disciplinary cases preceding the WPA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> presented hurdles to the prosecution of an OSC disciplinary case. In <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Cummings</span>, 20 MSPR 625, 649-51 (1984), Board Member Devaney argued in dissent that the test should not apply to an OSC disciplinary action. In a disciplinary case the parties are OSC and the manager accused of wrongdoing. The issue is whether any degree of reprisal is acceptable by a manager making personnel decisions. Devaney argued that the Reform Act was not intended to shield errant managers. Devaney's argument was reconsidered and addressed in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Brown</span>, 28 MSPR 133, 137-38 (1985). OSC sought disciplinary action against a manager alleged to have taken (or to have failed to take) a personnel action to punish an audit chief for filing an ADEA complaint and for testifying in an MSPB case. The personnel action involved a requested waiver of a policy requiring the rotation of auditors to new assignments every five years. The Board determined that the <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> analysis should not apply in OSC disciplinary actions. At issue <span id="Page_4041"></span>was whether the protected conduct was a significant factor in the personnel decision--disciplinary action would not be imposed if reprisal played a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> role in an otherwise legitimate personnel decision. Personal animus toward the employee was not a necessary element of the offense, although it could provide circumstantial evidence of a causal connection if direct proof did not exist. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Starrett</span>, 28 MSPR 60, 70 (1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Harvey</span>, 28 MSPR 595, 609 (1984), rejected the availability of a <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> defense in an OSC disciplinary proceeding:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude further that had Gorsey's performance been a significant factor in the actions Harvey took against him, Harvey could not escape a finding that he committed a prohibited personnel practice. Judge Reidy held that the analysis in <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy School</span> <span class="Italic">District v. Doyle,</span> 429 U.S. 274, 97 S. Ct. 568, 50 L. Ed.2d 471 (1977), should apply to disciplinary actions under section 1207. The Board does not agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> case holds that when an employee establishes that an adverse action was taken against him for protected conduct, the employer will then have an opportunity to show that the action "would" have been taken even if there had been no protected conduct. The Court's express purpose in permitting an agency to show that a challenged action would have been taken despite protected conduct is to prevent the employee from escaping from warranted discipline. As the Court stated, the employee who has engaged in conduct deserving discipline should not be in a favored position because he also engaged in protected conduct. <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> 429 U.S. at 285, 97 S. Ct. at 575.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has applied this principle where the issue is whether the agency's action against an employee may be sustained (<span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Gerlach v. FTC,</span> 8 MSPB 599, 9 MSPR 268 (1981) (affirmative defense to adverse action under section 7513)) or must be corrected <span class="Italic">(see Special Counsel v. Department of State [Rohrmann]</span> <span class="Italic">,</span> 9 MSPB 14, 9 MSPR 363 (1982) (request for corrective action to provide relief for an employee against whom an adverse action has been taken.))</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, our concern here is not whether the actions taken against Gorsey were effected on legitimate grounds, would have been taken despite protected activity, and should be allowed to stand. Our concern in a disciplinary action under section 1207 is whether a respondent should escape discipline for a prohibited personnel practice even if there is a lawful reason for taking the personnel action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Fourth Circuit had another view of the Board's approach to the causation standard in Special Counsel disciplinary cases. <span class="Italic">Starrett v. Special Counsel</span>, 792 F.2d 1246, 1253 n.12 (4th Cir. 1986), reversed the Board's determination that the proof met the standard. Although the court rejected the Board's standard, it did not provide an interpretation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note in passing that we simply refrain from assessing the merits of Starrett's argument that the Board should use a standard of causation similar to that advanced in the context of reprisals for constitutionally protective activity.... While deference is normally given by the courts to a "consistent and long-standing interpretation by the agency charged with administration of the Act"...the "significant factor" test by the MSPB here is neither "consistent" nor "long standing."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Act was designed to prohibit retaliation or reprisals by personnel because of improper consideration of protected actions. The standard of proof used must insure that the motivation for the adverse action was an improper one. There is no support in the legislative history of the Act for any particular standard of causation, but the standard used by the Board for any action under the Act, whether a "corrective action" under 5 USC 1206(c)(1)(B) or a "disciplinary action" under 5 USC 1206(g), must not be so loose or weak as to punish those not motivated by improper purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The impact, if any, of such considerations in cases involving the propriety, <span class="Italic">vel non</span>, of a standard of causation employed by the MSPB must await another day.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another day appeared in sight but not in reach as the Board skirted the <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> issue in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Mongan</span>, 33 MSPR 392, 396 (1987), a disciplinary case involving failure to promote in reprisal for protected disclosures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two United States Circuit Courts have recently questioned, but not ruled upon, the Board's decision not to apply the <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> test in such cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Starrett v. Special Counsel</span> 792 F.2d 1246, 1253, n.12 (4th Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Harvey v. MSPB</span>, 802 F.2d 537, 548, n.5 (D.C. Cir. 1986). As a result, it would be appropriate for us to consider specifically in this proceeding whether the respondent would have denied [the] promotion on the basis of the alternative reasons he put forward at the hearing. We have, therefore, independently reviewed the record in order to determine whether the respondent established, by preponderant evidence, that he would have denied the promotion because of his concern that she was unable to maintain confidential information, or because of his concern over the "grade bulge." We find that he did not.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The new day may have been on the horizon, but it did not arrive before the WPA. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Zimmerman</span>, 36 MSPR 274, 292 n.15 (1988). Following the enactment of this legislation, the Federal Circuit called for a "significant factor" analysis in OSC disciplinary cases, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Eidmann v. MSPB</span>, 976 F.2d 1400 (Fed. Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and the Board then merged the <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> analysis into OSC's burden of proof in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Santella</span>, 65 MSPR 452 (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Santella</span> determined that in a WPA disciplinary case, the analytical standard is whether OSC shows, by preponderant evidence, that retaliation was a significant factor in the action or actions at issue. The term "significant factor" was to refer to a factor that played an important role in the allegedly retaliatory action. The "significant factor" test was not met unless "the motivation for the...action was an improper one." <span class="Italic">Santella</span> explained the application of the "significant factor" test and the merger into this test of the <span class="Italic">Mt</span>. <span class="Italic">Healthy</span> analysis on the theory that a finding that improper motivation constitutes an important role excludes an alternative finding of a permissible motivation for an action, 65 MSPR at 456-60:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Mount Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle</span>, 429 U.S. 274, 285-87 (1977) (hereinafter <span class="Italic">Mount</span> <span class="Italic">Healthy)</span>, the U.S. Supreme Court held that an employee whose exercise of his constitutional rights played a substantial part in the failure to renew his employment contract was not entitled to remedial action if the board responsible for the employment decision showed by preponderant evidence that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the employee's protected conduct. The respondents in the case now before the Board have argued that the Board should apply this <span class="Italic">"Mount Healthy</span> defense" if it finds that evidence of reprisal meets the appropriate threshold test. They have argued further that, under the <span class="Italic">Mount Healthy</span> analysis, no disciplinary action is appropriate because, even if retaliation has been shown to have been a "substantial or motivating factor" in the personnel actions at issue, they have shown that those actions were legitimate management decisions that would have been taken without regard to any retaliatory intent. We find, for reasons stated below, that a proper "significant factor" analysis makes a separate analysis based on the <span class="Italic">Mount Healthy</span> defense unnecessary in Special Counsel disciplinary cases such as this.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By holding that the <span class="Italic">Mount Healthy</span> defense analysis should be conducted in certain cases in which retaliation was found to be a "substantial factor" the Supreme Court indicated that retaliation could be a "substantial factor" even though the allegedly retaliatory action would have been taken in the absence of any retaliatory motive. In <span class="Italic">Gerlach v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 9 MSPR 268, 275 n.7 (1981), the Board indicated, in effect, that retaliation could constitute a "significant factor" under the same circumstances. It did so by indicating that the term "significant factor" had the same meaning as the term "substantial factor," as the latter term was used in <span class="Italic">Mount Healthy</span>. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. We note, however, that <span class="Italic">Mount Healthy</span> and <span class="Italic">Gerlach</span> (as well as <span class="Italic">In</span> <span class="Italic">re Frazier</span>, the decision cited in the relevant part of <span class="Italic">Gerlach</span>) differ from the present case in that they were not Special Counsel disciplinary action cases. A single term may have different meanings when used in different contexts. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> 82 C.J.S. <span class="Italic">Statutes</span> &#x00A7; 315 (1953) (definitions in one statute are persuasive, but not conclusive, in construing such terms in another statute on the same or a related subject); <span class="Italic">Trafton v. Heckler</span>, 575 F. Supp. 742, 745 (D. Me. 1983) (construing term "significant" in "the present context").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are persuasive reasons for construing the term "significant factor," as it is used here, as meaning a factor of greater weight than that attached to the same term in <span class="Italic">Gerlach</span>. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in addressing the Board's application of the "significant factor" test in a Special Counsel disciplinary action case, has expressed concern about "the use of a standard of causation which inadequately protects personnel...who are forced to make scores of personnel decisions which may peripherally or incidentally involve situations where employees have engaged in protected practice." <span class="Italic">Starrett v. Special Counsel</span>, 792 F.2d 1246, 1253 n.12 (4th Cir. 1986). In the same decision, that court stated that the "standard of proof used must insure that the motivation for the adverse action was an improper one," and it held that "the standard used by the Board for any action under the [Civil Service Reform] Act, whether a 'corrective action' under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1206(c)(1)(B) or a disciplinary action, under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1206(g), must not be so loose or weak as to punish those not motivated by improper purposes."<span class="Italic"> Id</span>. The same concerns have been reiterated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In <span class="Italic">Harvey v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 802 F.2d 537, 548 &#x0026; n.5 (D.C. Cir. 1986), that court, in addition to referring with apparent approval to the part of <span class="Italic">Starrett</span> cited above, expressed its concern about a standard under which "one in an executive position [could] never exercise his considered judgment in making personnel recommendations when asked to do so when that judgment [was] based on anything even tangentially related to the exercise of protected conduct."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We believe the <span class="Italic">Starrett</span> and <span class="Italic">Harvey</span> courts have addressed a very real concern. If federal managers could be disciplined for actions only "tangentially related to the exercise of protected conduct"--including actions that would have been taken in the absence of any protected disclosures--they could very well react to this situation by avoiding actions that sound management principles would otherwise dictate be taken. While the extent to which federal managers may avoid taking proper remedial action against whistleblowers would be difficult or <span id="Page_4042"></span>impossible to measure, we have no doubt that many officials, when faced with the circumstances described here, would decline to take action they know is needed. We also note that it is entirely possible, under those circumstances, that the Board could sustain the officials' actions, finding them warranted and reasonable, while disciplining the officials for taking the actions. While we recognize the important role of Special Counsel disciplinary actions in deterring reprisal, we note that the Board's function in disciplinary cases such as this is to deter prohibited personnel practices, not to deter prohibited personnel thoughts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances described above, we conclude that the term "significant factor," as that term is used in Special Counsel disciplinary cases, should be used only to refer to a factor that played an important role in the allegedly retaliatory action, <span class="Italic">see Webster's New International Dictionary of the English</span> <span class="Italic">Language</span> 2335 (2d ed. 1957) (defining "significant" as "important"). Furthermore, we hold that the "significant factor" test is not met in these cases unless "the motivation for the...action was an improper one," <span class="Italic">see Starrett</span>, 792 F.2d at 1253 n.12, and that evidence that the allegedly retaliatory action was merely "tangentially related to the exercise of protected conduct," <span class="Italic">see Harvey</span>, 802 F.2d at 548, would not meet this test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that, if the "significant factor" test has been met, the respondent in a Special Counsel disciplinary case will necessarily be unable to present a successful <span class="Italic">Mount Healthy</span> defense. That is, if a respondent would have taken the allegedly retaliatory actions in the absence of any protected disclosures, the part those disclosures played cannot meet the definition of "significant factor."[3] The "significant factor" test therefore subsumes the <span class="Italic">Mount</span> <span class="Italic">Healthy</span> defense and makes a separate analysis of evidence presented in connection with such a defense unnecessary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In its post-hearing submission in this case, the Special Counsel contends that the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Marple</span>, 49 MSPR at 531-32, erroneously suggested that the Special Counsel was required to prove that retaliation was the predominant factor in corrective action and disciplinary action cases. To the extent that <span class="Italic">dictum</span> in <span class="Italic">Marple</span> can be read as misstating the applicable standard, we here correct any such error. Reprisal may be a significant factor in an action even if it is less important than another factor or factors. All that is needed to meet the "significant factor" test is a showing that nonretaliatory motives would not have been sufficient, in the absence of the retaliatory motive, to cause the action to occur. <span class="Italic">Cf. In re</span> <span class="Italic">Frazier</span>, 1 MSPR at 195-96 (indicating that the "significant factor" test in corrective action cases may be met without showing that reprisal was the agency's primary or dominant motive). For this reason, the dissenting opinion's references to this test as one requiring proof that retaliatory motives were "<span class="Italic">the</span> determinative" cause, or the "predominant" cause, of the action at issue...do not characterize the test accurately.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In connection with the latter point, we note that <span class="Italic">Mount Healthy</span> seems to require a two-part test in certain "dual motivation" cases (i.e., in certain cases in which the actions at issue were motivated partly by proper factors and partly by improper factors). <span class="Italic">See Mount Healthy</span>, 429 U.S. at 285 ("[a] rule of causation which focuses solely on whether protected conduct played a part, 'substantial' or otherwise, in a decision not to rehire, could place an employee in a better position as a result of the exercise of constitutionally protected conduct than he would have occupied had he done nothing"). The decision should not be interpreted, however, as requiring a two-part test in Special Counsel disciplinary cases. The undeserved "windfall" the Supreme Court sought to avoid by applying the <span class="Italic">Mount Healthy</span> defense is not an issue in these cases, and the similarly undesirable effect of punishing employees for taking actions they would have taken even in the absence of the protected disclosures will be avoided under the approach described here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that our holdings regarding this issue will not deprive respondents in Special Counsel disciplinary cases of the opportunity to present evidence such as that they would have presented in connection with a <span class="Italic">Mount Healthy</span> defense--i.e., evidence regarding their motives in taking the allegedly retaliatory actions. Instead, they will be able to present this evidence in connection with the "significant factor" test. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harvey</span>, 802 F.2d at 547-48 &#x0026; n.5 (court found, based in part on considerations addressed above, that protected activity had not been shown to be a significant factor in the action at issue); <span class="Italic">Starrett</span>, 792 F.2d at 1253-55 &#x0026; n.12 ("significant factor" test found not satisfied after court considered matters addressed above).[5]</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Board summarized the "significant factor" test, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Nielson</span>, 71 MSPR 161, 171 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...To impose disciplinary action under section 1215(a)(3), the Board must find that (1) the respondent had the authority to take or recommend the personnel action at issue against the employee; (2) the aggrieved employee engaged in protected activity; (3) the respondent took or failed to take the personnel action because of the employee's protected activity; and (4) the protected activity was a significant factor in the adverse personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Eidmann v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Santella</span> the Board explained the relationship between the significant factor test and the <span class="Italic">Mt.

While <span class="Italic">Santella</span> did not find that respondents could rely on the <span class="Italic">Mount Healthy</span> defense to defeat a disciplinary action, it nevertheless held that this defense and the significant factor test were interrelated. Specifically, the Board found that if the Special Counsel was able to establish that an employee's protected conduct played a significant role in the adverse personnel action taken by the respondent, the respondent "will necessarily be unable to present a successful <span class="Italic">Mount Healthy</span> defense." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 458.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Costello</span>, 75 MSPR 562, 611 (1997), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Costello v. MSPB</span>, 182 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 1999), <span class="Italic">post</span>, reiterated the analysis of the burden of proof in an OSC disciplinary case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast to a corrective action, in a disciplinary action, OSC must carry a much higher initial burden of proof. It must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that whistleblowing was a significant factor in the allegedly retaliatory action. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Santella</span>, 65 MSPR 452, 456 (1994). A significant factor refers to a factor that played an important role in the allegedly retaliatory action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 458.

The significant factor test is not met however, if the respondents would have taken the allegedly retaliatory action in the absence of the protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 456-60.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On review in the Federal Circuit, the result in <span class="Italic">Costello</span> was set aside. The court declined to become embroiled in the parties' dispute over the proper burden of proof. The court conducted a detailed review of the facts and determined that OSC failed to produce substantial evidence of reprisal, particularly because OSC failed to demonstrate that Costello had any motive to retaliate against the individuals who claimed to be victims of whistleblowing, <span class="Italic">Costello v. MSPB</span>, 182 F.3d 1372, 1373-78 (Fed. Cir. 1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the time of the events in this case, the Inspector General's Office of the Department of Veterans Affairs (Department) had a field office in Los Angeles and a regional office in Seattle, Washington, which was subordinate to the Los Angeles office. James Steen was a special agent in the Seattle office, and George Strehle was the special agent in charge of the Los Angeles office. Strehle supervised Steen and the other agents in the Seattle office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1989, apparently because of complaints about Strehle from the Seattle agents, James Cole, another agent with the Inspector General's office, investigated employee morale in the Seattle office. In January 1990, Cole interviewed Steen who, under a promise of confidentiality, alleged that Strehle (1) used profanity regularly, a violation of the Department code of conduct, and (2) abused his authority by harassing and intimidating employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Cole submitted a written report, concluding that the accusations made by Steen (and the other Seattle agents) were true. The Department took no action, however, and in April 1990 so informed Steen and the other Seattle agents.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In August of 1990, Stephen Trodden was appointed the new Inspector General. In November, the appellant Costello was hired as the Assistant Inspector General for Investigations. Costello was based in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In January, 1991, Costello received a letter from Steen and the other <span id="Page_4043"></span>Seattle agents asserting that "the Seattle office is now a victim of micromanagement and retaliation" from Strehle. The letter, which summarized the Cole investigation, closed as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Strehle stated that he knows everything that was said about him [in the Cole report], and he knows who provided that information. Another comment that Strehle has made is that he can take action against us at any time, because we are only human and we make mistakes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Strehle has carried through with his threats and initiated retaliatory action against the Seattle staff in various forms. We are now asking that you intervene and redress this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After discussing the Cole investigation with his staff and reviewing the Cole report, Costello met with Strehle and told him about the complaints. Strehle responded that he was often critical of the Seattle Office's performance and that this criticism may have caused the agents' complaints. Costello told Strehle that while he had no problem with hard taskmasters, if Strehle was "a ranting raving lunatic that screams and yells and demeans and curses.... I don't tolerate that."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In April 1991, Costello met with the agents in Seattle and discussed their complaints about Strehle. Costello told Steen and the others that he would take action against Strehle for any incidents that occurred after he took office--after November of 1990--but that he would not take action for anything occurring before that time, including the incidents described in the Cole report. After listening to the agents' complaints about Strehle's alleged retaliation for their cooperation in the Cole investigation, Costello concluded that Steen and the others "didn't provide me with anything that smelled of retaliation, as far as I was concerned. They gave me specifics which you might term micromanagement."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Costello then proposed to mediate the dispute between the Seattle agents and Strehle. He concluded that all the agents except Steen approved the proposal, stating in his meeting notes that "Steen is [the] most disgruntled," but he left the meeting believing that "if the whole office decided to [go for the mediation], Jim Steen would probably come around."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In early May, however, the agents wrote Costello that while they "appreciate[d his] efforts and concern in addressing this matter," they rejected the proposed mediation because "any meeting of this type would only result in Mr. Strehle increasing his retaliation against the staff of the Seattle office."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In January 1992, Peter Baci and Walter Burleson, both with the Washington, D.C. Inspector General's staff, performed an annual review of the Los Angeles and Seattle offices (and of the other field offices). Their report--a draft of which Costello received by March 22 1992, and which was released a month later--concluded that the Seattle Office was overstaffed and the Los Angeles office understaffed. It recommended "that two [Seattle] positions, the GM-13 [Steen's position] and the recently vacated secretarial position, be reassigned to Los Angeles."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Five days after receiving the draft, Costello wrote Steen "to advise [him] that [he was] transferred from the Seattle Resident Agency to the Los Angeles Field Office," effective June 30, 1992. In the letter, Costello informed Steen of the conclusions and recommendations of the Baci and Burleson report and told Steen that he was chosen for reassignment because his "position [was] listed as one designated as a reassignment position."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Steen called Jon Wooditch, Inspector General Trodden's executive assistant, and complained that if thus transferred, he would be subject to retaliation from Strehle. Wooditch informed Trodden, who suggested that a location other than Los Angeles be found for Steen, because Steen "could be considered a whistle-blower." Wooditch instructed Costello to do so and Costello found only one other vacancy at Steen's GM-13 level, in New York City. Wooditch offered Steen the position as an alternative to Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A week later, Steen called Wooditch and, in Wooditch's words, complained "that he did not want to go to New York, because it was too expensive and that he did not want to live there." Wooditch, however, concluded: "Since the [Department] made a sincere effort to accommodate Mr. Steen's concern by providing him with a viable alternative, I considered the issue closed." Steen also wrote Costello, telling him that a transfer to New York would subject him to a "serious financial hardship." Costello responded that no such hardship would exist because, if Steen selected reassignment to New York, he would receive a sixteen percent salary differential along with substantial overtime.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The position Steen preferred was in the Houston office, which already had a GM-13, but had a vacancy at the GM-9, 11, or 12 level. Steen was willing to take a demotion. Although Wooditch told him to ask Costello to transfer him there directly, Steen did not do so. Instead, he applied for the vacancy on his own. Costello became aware of Steen's application, but did not transfer him there. He did not mention, or criticize Steen to Kenneth Atkins, the special agent in charge of the Dallas field office, who was responsible for filling the vacancy. Atkins did not select Steen and later testified that "he would not have selected Steen even if Steen was the only candidate."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Costello eventually decided that Steen should not be transferred to Los Angeles and reassigned him to New York. Shortly thereafter, Steen sent a memorandum to the Director of the Department's Human Resources Division--with a copy to the Office of Special Counsel--stating that he "consider[ed] this forced relocation [to New York] to be retaliation against me resulting from my providing information to the VA Office of Inspector General during an official internal inquiry." Then, before he was due to report to New York, Steen took sick leave for "situational depression." He was on sick leave for more than a year--in November 1992 he filed for workmen's compensation--until Costello proposed his separation. In the interval Costello sought out and offered him other positions, which Steen rejected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following an investigation, the Office of Special Counsel filed complaints with the Board against Costello and Strehle, seeking disciplinary actions (under 5 USC 1215) against them for alleged violations of the Whistleblower Protection Act, 5 USC 2302(b)(8), and other statutes not relevant to this appeal. The complaint alleged that Costello and Strehle had retaliated against Steen for his complaints about Strehle. The Special Counsel also filed a complaint under 5 USC 1214 against the Department, seeking corrective action on behalf of Steen (and another Seattle agent whose situation is irrelevant here). At the Special Counsel's request, the Board stayed Steen's reassignment and separation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After a hearing, the administrative law judge recommended that the complaints be dismissed. In a 200-page opinion, he determined that Steen's disclosures about Strehle were not protected by the Whistleblower Protection Act (or any of the other statutes the Special Counsel relied upon) and that, in any event, Costello's actions were not taken in retaliation for the disclosures. With regard to the reassignment to Los Angeles, he held that he could not "find sufficient cause on this record to hold that any alleged disclosures by Steen, protected or otherwise, were a factor in the March 1992 directed reassignment of Steen." Regarding the transfer to New York, he concluded that there was "insufficient evidentiary support to sustain the contention that the reassignment of Steen to New York was based, even in a small part, on a retaliatory intent. To the contrary, the record evidence supports the proposition that Trodden and Costello tried to accommodate Steen when his views against being assigned to work directly under Strehle were brought to their attention and that the selection of New York was a reasonable alternative and in the best interest of Steen and the agency." Finally, the judge found that Costello's refusal to reassign Steen to Houston was based on "a managerial determination that he...did not want two grade 13s at a resident agency."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the Special Counsel's appeal, the Board affirmed in part and reversed in part. The Board upheld the charges against Costello. It ruled that both Steen's initial disclosures to Cole and his reiteration of those complaints to Costello during the April 1991 meeting and in his workmen's compensation filing in the fall of 1992 were protected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the corrective action complaint, the Board ruled that the Special Counsel had proved that Steen's complaints were a "contributing factor" in Steen's reassignments to Los Angeles and to New York, and in Costello's refusal to reassign Steen to Houston, and that the Department had not clearly and convincingly shown that these actions would have been taken anyway. It found that all three employment actions were unreasonable and that Costello's justifications for them were pretextual.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board determined that Costello's reliance on Baci and Burleson's recommendation to reassign Steen to Los Angeles was a pretext because the Department's policy governing reassignments provided that "reassignments will normally be made with the employees preference and with their concurrence" and that, in any event, given Costello's knowledge of Steen's relationship with Strehle, it was unreasonable to follow the recommendation. It found that Costello's explanation that he reassigned Steen to New York because he would be useful there was a pretext because New York had no greater need for an agent than any other office. Finally, the Board found that Costello's explanation for his refusal to reassign Steen to Houston--that he did not want two GM-13s in the same office and that he did not want to interfere with the hiring process--made no sense in light of Steen's willingness to accept a downgrade and Costello's directed reassignments of Steen to Los Angeles and New York. The Board accordingly reversed the administrative judge's decision and ordered corrective relief for Steen.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the disciplinary complaint--the only issue before us--the Board noted that the Special Counsel "must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that whistleblowing was a significant factor in the allegedly retaliatory action." The Board noted that it had already</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">concluded that the reasons on which Costello based the reassignment of Steen to Los Angeles were not supported in the <span id="Page_4044"></span>record. Although the Baci/Burleson report recommended the reassignment of Steen, the report was only in draft form at the time of the reassignment and the recommendation was based on an incorrect interpretation of the [Inspector General's] personnel policy manual. Further, Costello knew about Steen's clearly expressed fears of retaliation by Strehle because of his disclosures. Similarly, we found unpersuasive and not supported by record evidence Costello's reasons for subsequently reassigning Steen to New York and for failing to reassign him to Houston.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Based on our review of the record and our findings made in this decision, we conclude that the evidence does not show that Costello would have made the same personnel decisions in the absence of protected conduct. Therefore, Steen's protected disclosures were a significant factor in Costello's decisions to take the personnel actions at issue here. Accordingly, the disciplinary action is warranted for Costello.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board concluded that an appropriate penalty for the violations it held Costello had committed was to suspend him for 30 days, which it did.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Whistleblower Protection Act provides that no personnel action may be taken against an employee or applicant</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">because of...any disclosure to the Special Counsel, or to the Inspector General of an agency or another employee designated by the head of the agency to receive such disclosures, of information which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences...a violation of law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC 2302(b)(8). For purposes of a disciplinary complaint, a personnel action is taken "because of" a protected disclosure where "the protected disclosure[] w[as] a 'significant factor' in [the decision to take] the personnel action." <span class="Italic">Eidmann v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 976 F.2d 1400, 1407 (Fed. Cir. 1992). Although the parties disagree about the proper interpretation of the "significant factor" test, we need not decide the question because on this record Steen's disclosures were not shown to have been a "significant factor" in Costello's decisions under any of those interpretations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its brief the Special Counsel accurately described the Board's reasoning as follows: "[G]iven the fact of Mr. Steen's whistleblowing, Mr. Costello's expressed bitterness towards Mr. Steen, and the lack of any legitimate reason for Mr. Costello's actions, the [B]oard...drew an inference that a significant factor in Mr. Costello's actions towards Mr. Steen was retaliation for whistleblowing." Under the facts of this case, the inference cannot stand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence here does not show that Costello's decisions to transfer and refuse to transfer Steen had anything to do with Steen's disclosures about Strehle. When Steen made his original disclosures to Cole in January 1990, Costello was not even an employee of the Department. He was not appointed as Assistant Inspector General until November 1990, 10 months after those disclosures. Indeed, Costello's boss, Trodden, was not even the Inspector General at the time of the disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no evidence that Costello was a friend of Strehle, the subject of the disclosures. Nor does the record suggest any other reason why Costello would want to support or defend Strehle.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When confronted with the complaints regarding Strehle, Costello took appropriate action. He met with Strehle and told him that he had no problem with hard taskmasters but would not tolerate "a ranting raving lunatic that screams and yells and demeans and curses." He then met with the Seattle agents (including Steen), who merely repeated their prior complaints about what Steen had done before Costello joined the agency. Although he declined to take action on complaints preceding his tenure, Costello proposed to act as a mediator in the agents' dispute with Strehle. While it was not the relief they desired, the agents expressed their appreciation for Costello's efforts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Costello's initial transfer of Steen, the reassignment to Los Angeles, did not take place until March 1992, more than two years after Steen had made his protected disclosures to Cole. Although Steen repeated his charges against Strehle at the meeting between Costello and the agents in April 1991 and in his application for workmen's compensation benefits in November 1992, the primary focus in determining whether Costello acted in retaliation against the disclosures should be on the basic disclosure, not its subsequent repetition. A two-year gap between the disclosures and the allegedly retaliatory action is too long an interval to justify an inference of cause and effect between the two, especially when Costello transferred Steen only after receiving a draft of the Baci-Burleson report, recommending that because the Seattle office was overstaffed, Steen's position and one other should be transferred to Los Angeles. Although the Board discounted that fact because the final report was not issued until a month later, the fact that the document Costello received was only a preliminary draft is irrelevant in determining the reason for Costello's decision to transfer Steen to Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Costello's subsequent transfer of Steen to New York did not even originate with Costello. It occurred after Steen had complained to Wooditch (the Inspector General's executive assistant) about the Los Angeles transfer, the Inspector General suggested that another location be found for Steen, and Wooditch instructed Costello to do so. New York apparently was the only office other than Los Angeles with a vacancy at Steen's grade.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Steen never asked Costello for a transfer to Houston. Although Costello did not reassign Steen there, he remained neutral and did not prevent Steen from seeking the job. It was the Houston office that rejected Steen's application for the position there.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board and Special Counsel rely on snippets of evidence that allegedly show that in transferring and refusing to transfer Steen, Costello was acting in reprisal for Steen's disclosures to Cole. These include Costello's testimony that he recalled the meeting with the Seattle agents "bitterly" and testimony by John Clarkson (the Deputy Assistant Inspector General for Investigations) that Costello said that it was "New York or nothing" for Steen and that Costello was "jerking [Steen] around" when he refused to transfer him to Houston. Although these statements may indicate that Costello was annoyed with Steen and was treating him firmly (or even harshly), they do not support the conclusion that the reason for that attitude and treatment was Steen's disclosures to Cole. The fact that the disclosures were made before Costello joined the agency and the lack of any documented reason why Costello would have wanted to punish Steen for whistleblowing not against himself but against a subordinate whom Costello was not shown to have favored, all point in the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Costello's actions with respect to transferring and refusing to transfer Steen might be criticized as reflecting poor management judgment, but on this record they cannot properly be viewed as taken in retaliation for Steen's disclosures to Cole. The Board's finding that Costello's asserted reasons for his transfer actions were pretextual does not justify the inference that those actions were taken in retaliation for Steen's protected disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the Board's determination that Costello transferred Steen to Los Angeles and New York and refused to transfer him to Houston "because of" Steen's protected disclosures about Strehle, is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Spears</span>, 75 MSPR 639, 660-61 (1997), provided another opportunity for the Board to summarize <span class="Italic">Santella</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a disciplinary action under 5 USC 1215, OSC must prove that the protected whistleblowing activity was a significant factor in the alleged reprisal action. <span class="Italic">Eidmann v. MSPB</span>, 976 F.2d 1400, 1405 (Fed. Cir. 1992). Petitioner must show that the respondent would not have taken the allegedly retaliatory actions in the absence of the protected disclosure, and the "significant factor" test is not met unless the respondent's motivation for his actions is shown to have been an improper one. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Santella</span>, 65 MSPR 452, 456-58 (1994)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although, under <span class="Italic">Santella</span>, an OSC disciplinary case requires motivational analysis, OSC need not, to meet its burden of proof in a disciplinary case, prove intent under 5 USC 2302(b)(12) [formerly 2302(b)(11)], involving violations of laws, rules, or regulations implementing merit system principles. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recently set forth its interpretation of the "significant factor" standard described by the court in <span class="Italic">Eidmann. See Special Counsel v. Santella &#x0026; Jech</span>, 65 MSPR 452, 456-60 (1994). It concluded that the term "significant factor," as that term is used in OSC disciplinary cases, should be used only to refer to a factor that played an important role in the allegedly retaliatory action. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 458. The Board further held that the "significant factor" test is not met in such cases unless the motivation for the action was an improper one; it stated that evidence that the allegedly retaliatory action was merely tangentially related to protected conduct would not be sufficient under this test. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 458-59. Finally, it found that evidence that respondents in such cases would have taken the allegedly retaliatory actions absent the protected disclosures would mean that the role that those disclosures played did not meet the definition of "significant factor." <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Such evidence should therefore be considered as part of the "significant factor" analysis and not as a separate defense to the allegation of reprisal. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 459-60. We adopt that analysis here in evaluating a disciplinary proceeding brought by the agency rather than OSC, for the reasons stated in our discussion of the standard of review announced by the court in <span class="Italic">Eidmann</span>.</p>
