<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-137"><span class="space">C.</span> Effect of District Court Review</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant proceeds to court on an otherwise appealable mixed-case adverse action before taking the case to the Board, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appeal, <span class="Italic">Atkins v. DOJ,</span> AT-0752-11-0513-I-1 (NP 1/19/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant correctly contends on review that the Board generally has jurisdiction over a removal action, the administrative judge properly dismissed this appeal because the appellant had challenged his removal in a U.S. district court before filing this appeal with the Board. <span class="Italic">See Connor v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 15 F.3d 1063, 1065-66 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (an appellant cannot simultaneously litigate the same case in the United States courts and in the administrative process; the Board lacks jurisdiction over a mixed-case appeal when prior to the appeal the appellant filed a civil complaint in a U.S. district court challenging the same action based on the same discrimination allegations); <span class="Italic">see also Williams v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 244 F. App'x 345, 346 (Fed. Cir. 2007) ("[A] claimant cannot pursue relief in the district court and then pursue the same relief at the MSPB."); <span class="Italic">Leahy v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 2000 WL 1810021 at *1 (Fed. Cir. 2000) ("[t]he statutes and regulations provide no scenario in which an employee may file a mixed case appeal with the Board after filing a district court action for discrimination."); <span class="Italic">Hill v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 1995 WL 151022 at *2 (Fed. Cir. 1995) ("By electing the district court option, Hill gave up the right to pursue an appeal to the MSPB, and his subsequent effort to take an appeal to the MSPB was therefore ineffective."); <span class="Italic">cf. Williams v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 144, 149 (1997) (distinguishing <span class="Italic">Connor</span> because the appellant filed a complaint in U.S. district court <span class="Italic">after</span> he had filed a Board appeal). Thus, the appellant's arguments on review regarding the merits of the removal action and the procedures the agency used to take the action may not be addressed in the absence of Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Cf. Wren v. Department of the Army</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 1, 2 (1980) (prohibited personnel practices under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b) are not an independent source of Board jurisdiction), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 681 F.2d 867, 871-73 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">What occurs if an appellant seeks relief in district court before the Board completes its examination of a pending appeal? By law, an appellant may sue in a mixed case if he does not receive a final Board decision within 120 days from the date he files his appeal with the region. 5 USC 7702(e)(1)(B). <span class="Italic">McGovern v. EEOC</span>, 28 MSPR 689, 691 n.1 (1985), determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The parties agree that there is no statutory requirement, or proscription, of the Board's going forward with its adjudication of the appellant's entire appeal, despite his District Court filing on the Title VII aspects of his claim. There is nothing in law or regulation that divests the Board of appellate jurisdiction because of the appellant's District Court filing, and we decline the agency's suggestion that we dismiss the pending petition for review, thereby deferring adjudication of this case to the District Court as a matter of "administrative discretion." We believe that by so doing, the Board would in effect abdicate to the District Court the duties and responsibilities it was legislated to perform as congressionally-mandated Federal personnel law specialists. The fact that Section 7702(e)(1)(B) allows the appellant to go to District Court if he does not have a decision within 120 days of his appeal to the <span class="Italic">regional</span> <span class="Italic">office</span> does not lead us to conclude that the presiding official's initial decision constitutes a final and reviewable Board order in this case. Rather, that section provides the appellant with an alternative and additional route of appeal of his discrimination claims, simultaneous, but not necessarily superior, to [the] Board appeal. Inasmuch as the initial decision is not a final Board decision if, as here, a petition for review has been filed within 35 days...we do not believe the District Court can be said to have primary jurisdiction over this case until the Board has issued a final Opinion and Order addressing that petition.</p>

The result is open to criticism if only a Title VII (and not a civil service issue) is in dispute. Congress meant for civil rights plaintiffs to have a speedy remedy. If the Board could not act quickly, the courts, in theory, would: Title VII permits litigation of discrimination cases to take precedence over certain other litigation. U.S. Attorneys will likely argue that if the Board has jurisdiction, court action should be delayed pending administrative exhaustion. For the Board to imply that its possession of a PFR should delay district court consideration because there has been no final decision is contrary to congressional intent. It is a waste of time. If the district court actively pursues the case during the simultaneous Board adjudication, the Board's final decision will be without meaning if it is issued after or happens to be contrary to a district court result on a Title VII claim. Even the Board has acknowledged (albeit in a RIF case arising before the Reform Act) that once a court issues its decision, the Board lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the case. <span class="Italic">Van Gilder v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 10 MSPR 337, 412 (1982).

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McGovern, supra,</span> may not be reliable as precedent. One appellant pursued EEO issues into court through Title VII procedures and at the same time raised related defenses to an adverse action case heard by the Board. The Board concluded that because it has no special expertise or authority to determine EEO (accommodation) claims, and because a district court is a "court of appeal" as to EEO issues, the Board may abstain from ruling on the EEO issues and defer to adjudication by the federal district court, a result that the Board considered to be supported by notions of comity and efficiency of litigation, <span class="Italic">Key v. USPS</span>, 31 MSPR 197, 198-200 (1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant filed formal Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) complaints on March 14 and July 5, 1984, alleging discrimination, retaliation, and failure to accommodate his handicapping condition, based on events occurring prior to July 3, 1984. The Postal Service removed appellant on December 10, 1984. He appealed this removal to the Merit Systems Protection Board and received a favorable decision from the Philadelphia Regional Office on April 22, 1985. Appellant's EEO claims were not decided by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission within the prescribed 180-day limit, and appellant filed an amended complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on September 9, 1985. That complaint states six causes of action based on the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Constitution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The situation of nearly identical EEO issues being addressed in two forums at the same time rarely occurs because Board regulations provide adequate procedures to avoid duplication of effort and to ensure consistency of decisions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.151, <span class="Italic">et seq.; Christo v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 667 F.2d 882 (10th Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Dugger v. Department of Justice,</span> 3 MSPB 194, 3 MSPR 78, 80 (1980). Here, however, the identical issue has arisen before both the court and the Board because the cases are based on separate causes of action--the Board case concerns appellant's removal, and the court case primarily concerns claims under the Rehabilitation Act. Both cases have developed so that the central issue is now the question of the adequacy of the agency's accommodation of appellant's handicapping condition. The record shows that appellant has vigorously disputed the accommodation issue in both forums, and the March 3, 1986, settlement agreement concerns accommodation almost exclusively. As part of the agreement, appellant agreed to drop his enforcement petition with the Board. The issues in the two forums are thus so closely related as to be considered identical.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's claim that the Board lacks statutory authority for deferring to a federal court is unavailing. It has been clearly established that the Board is a quasi-judicial body and that the concerns of judicial administration "to prevent redundant and unnecessary litigation" are appropriate for consideration by the Board. <span class="Italic">Chisholm v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 3 MSPB <span id="Page_3571"></span>273, 3 MSPR 171 (1980) (regarding the Board's use of the collateral estoppel doctrine). <span class="Italic">See also Payer v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">When a district court is confronted with a suit that has also been filed in another district court, the district judge should generally defer "to prevent duplication of judicial effort in two separate court(s)...and to confine the litigation to the forum able to take the most comprehensive disposition." <span class="Italic">Calvert Fire Insurance Co.</span> <span class="Italic">v. American Mutual Reinsurance Co.,</span> 600 F.2d 1228, 1233 (7th Cir. 1979).

Further, we note that the Board has no special expertise or authority to determine accommodation claims, and that the District Court of the District of New Jersey is the probable court of appeal on this issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2); <span class="Italic">Christo,</span> 667 F.2d at 883.</p>

Department of Justice, INS,</span> 711 F.2d 267, 273 (D.C. Cir. 1983). We find, therefore, that litigation of the identical issues before both the District Court and the Board would needlessly complicate and encumber the process of both bodies. We shall, therefore, abstain and defer to the District Court's ruling on the issue of the Postal Service's accommodation of appellant's handicap.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Does this mean that the Board will also defer on civil service issues? We must await additional decisions to find out. <span class="Italic">Connor v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 588, 591 (1992), concluded that the AJ should have retained jurisdiction when a district court dismissed an EEO case after the agency canceled a removal action that the appellant had also appealed to the Board. The Board retained jurisdiction because the appellant challenged the agency's assertion that it completely restored the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> following cancelation of the removal. <span class="Italic">Connor</span> resulted in a remand to the Board AJ for a determination of the timeliness of the appeal. When the Board later concluded the appeal was untimely, the appellant pursued the case on that issue to the Federal Circuit. The circuit court then avoided resolution of the timeliness issue and found that the Board improperly asserted jurisdiction over the case. Jurisdiction of the Board was preempted by the appellant's earlier resort to court. Distinguishing <span class="Italic">McGovern</span>, <span class="Italic">Connor v. USPS</span>, 15 F.3d 1063, 1064-66 (Fed. Cir. 1994), stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Postal Service (Agency) removed Connor from his position as Superintendent, Station Operations, Farmers Branch Station, Dallas, Texas, due to his inability to perform the functions of his job, effective 31 July 1987. The Agency notified Connor by letter of decision dated 15 July 1987 that he had two alternate routes of appeal: either (1) to the Board, or (2) through the Agency's internal appeal procedures. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1), (2) (1988); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(a) (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Connor followed the latter procedure of filing an appeal through the Agency's internal procedures in July 1987. With regard to his removal, Connor in addition filed a formal complaint of discrimination with the Postal Service Equal Employment Opportunity Office (EEO complaint) on 26 October 1987.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While his EEO complaint was still pending with the Agency, Connor on 16 February 1988, amended a complaint, which he previously had filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, to include a count based on the removal. On 16 June 1988, Agency counsel notified the EEO complaint processing office of Connor's district court action. On 23 June 1988, the Agency issued a written final decision, notifying Connor that the processing of his EEO complaint had been terminated, pursuant to 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.283, .513 (1988), because of the filing of the amended complaint (and therefore the pendency of a district court action). He appealed this decision to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Thereafter, the EEOC decision issued on 19 September 1988, affirming the Agency's action, and stating that "the correct ground for complaint cancellation in such a situation is that the EEO complaint is the basis of a pending civil action in a United States District Court. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.215(a)(3); 52 Fed. Reg. 41923 (October 30, 1987)."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Connor on 19 August 1988, over six months after amending his complaint in District Court, filed an appeal with the Board challenging his removal. In that first appeal the administrative judge dismissed Connor's appeal for lack of jurisdiction in an initial decision of 16 December 1988. She reasoned that Connor's "right to appeal the removal action to the Board [was] extinguished by his raising the issue in the previously filed civil action." The administrative judge also relied on 29 CFR 1613.283 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A full panel of the Board reversed and remanded the case to the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">Connor v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 588 (1992) ("<span class="Italic">Connor I</span> "). The full panel, citing <span class="Italic">McGovern v. EEOC</span>, 28 MSPR 689, 691 n.1 (1985), erroneously reasoned that the Board was not precluded from adjudicating the removal action despite the pendency of a civil action involving the removal before the United States district court. The panel instructed the administrative judge to address, on remand, timeliness of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the rationale of <span class="Italic">Connor I</span>, Connor cannot simultaneously "litigat[e] the same case in the United States Courts and in the administrative process." <span class="Italic">Colon v. Chairman of Bd. of Directors of Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp.</span>, 723 F. Supp. 842, 844 (D.P.R. 1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, upon exercising his election to file in district court the third amended complaint on 16 February 1988, Connor's EEO complaint became "the basis of a pending civil action in a United States District Court." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.215(a)(3) (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Connor had the option of <span class="Italic">either</span> filing an appeal with the Board <span class="Italic">or</span> filing a civil action in United States district court if the Agency had not issued a judicially reviewable decision within 120 calendar days of the date he filed his mixed case complaint. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.405(e)(2)(ii) (1988). Before the Agency had issued a final decision, and before Connor had waited the required 120 days, his third amended complaint in district court terminated the Agency's processing of his mixed case complaint on 16 February 1988 in accordance with 29 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1613.283, .513 (1988), and on 23 June 1988 the Agency properly and officially notified Connor of such termination. Consequently, there is no statute or regulation granting jurisdiction to the Board over Connor's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">McGovern.</span>[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;28 MSPR 689 (1985). <span class="Italic">McGovern</span> has been criticized on policy grounds. <span class="Italic">See</span> Peter B. Broida, <span class="Italic">A Guide to Merit Systems Protection Board Law &#x0026; Practice</span> 1458-59 (9th ed. 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">In McGovern</span>, the MSPB ruled it had jurisdiction over that mixed case appeal, but because appellant had not received a judicially reviewable final decision from the Board within 120 days of his filing with the regional office, he was able to file suit in federal district court under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1)(B). 28 MSPR at 691 n.1. This action is explicitly permitted by 29 CFR 1613.421(h) (1993), which states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An individual who has a complaint processed pursuant to 5 CFR 1201.151 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> and these regulations is authorized by 5 USC 7702, to file a civil action based on the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board in an appropriate U.S. District Court:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(h)&#x2003;After one-hundred and twenty (120) calendar days from the date of filing an appeal with the Merit Systems Protection Board if the Merit Systems Protection Board has not yet made a decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By contrast, in the present case, Connor amended his pending district court action to include the substance of his mixed complaint on 16 February 1988, <span class="Italic">prior</span> to filing his appeal to the Board on 19 August 1988. Therefore, there was <span class="Italic">already</span> a pending district court action at the time that Connor filed his mixed case appeal with the MSPB. Under 29 CFR 1613.405(e)(2)(ii) (1988), Connor had the <span class="Italic">option of either</span> filing an appeal with the Board <span class="Italic">or</span> filing a civil action in the district court. Here, <span class="Italic">he effectively elected</span> the district court action due to his amendment. Therefore, the option of a subsequent Board appeal was foreclosed by the regulation. Thus, in this case, unlike in <span class="Italic">McGovern</span> where the MSPB filing preceded the district court filing, the Board never had jurisdiction over the mixed case appeal in the first instance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Merit Systems Protection Board did not possess subject matter jurisdiction over Connor's mixed case appeal regarding his removal from the Agency where, prior to his appeal to the Board, he had amended a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas to include a cause of action challenging his removal based on the same discrimination allegations. Accordingly, we vacate the order and remand this case to the Merit Systems Protection Board with instructions to dismiss Connor's appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Connor</span> was reaffirmed by <span class="Italic">Hill v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 94-3671):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In December 1993, Hill filed an administrative complaint with the EEOC contending that the termination of his employment was the result of unlawful discrimination by the agency. In February 1994, while his administrative complaint was pending with the EEOC, Hill amended his district court complaint to include a claim based on his termination. Two months later, before the EEOC had acted on his administrative complaint, Hill filed a "mixed case" appeal with the MSPB (i.e., an appeal in which employment discrimination is alleged as a basis for an adverse action over which the MSPB has jurisdiction). Hill contended in his MSPB appeal that his retirement was involuntary (and thus constituted a constructive removal) and that his termination was the product of unlawful conduct by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found it unnecessary to consider whether Hill's retirement was involuntary or the agency's conduct unlawful. Because <span id="Page_3572"></span>Hill had challenged his termination in district court by amending his discrimination complaint to include allegations with regard to his removal, the administrative judge held that the MSPB lacked jurisdiction over Hill's appeal. The administrative judge relied principally on this court's decision in <span class="Italic">Connor v. USPS</span>, 15 F.3d 1063 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Connor</span>, the court held that a petitioner who filed a discrimination action in district court and then sought to take a mixed case appeal to the MSPB could not proceed simultaneously in both the district court and the MSPB. The court based its ruling in part on 29 CFR 1613.405(e)(2)(ii), which the court interpreted to allow an employee to pursue a mixed case appeal before the MSPB or a discrimination action in a district court, but not both.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations relied on by the <span class="Italic">Connor</span> court have been superseded and do not apply to this case. Effective October 1, 1992, 29 CFR 1613 was replaced by 29 CFR 1614, which now governs administrative complaints and appeals alleging employment discrimination filed by federal employees and applicants for federal employment. 57 Fed. Reg. 12,634 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the pertinent regulations have been changed, the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Connor</span> nevertheless applies in the present case. Like the petitioner in <span class="Italic">Connor</span>, Hill sought relief by filing a complaint within his agency. Hill therefore had the option of filing an appeal with the MSPB or seeking relief in district court if the agency failed to issue a judicially reviewable decision within 120 days of the filing of his mixed case complaint. But he was not entitled to pursue both remedies simultaneously. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.302(d)(1)(i).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Connor</span> was also followed in <span class="Italic">Urban v. MSPB</span>, 244 Fed. Appx. 362 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), involving an appeal by an air traffic control specialist from a reduction in force. The employee earlier joined a class action lawsuit challenging as discriminatory on the basis of age the agency's determination to eliminate various positions. Although the appellant withdrew from the class action after he filed his Board appeal, the Federal Circuit determined that, under <span class="Italic">Connor,</span> the appellant had elected his remedy as to the contention in his MSPB appeal that the RIF discriminated against him on the basis of age. However, the court remanded the case to the Board to determine what jurisdiction the Board concluded it had over claims by the appellant challenging the validity of the RIF for reasons other than discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Leahy v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 99-3144) ("[A]lthough it may seem anomalous, the statutes and regulations provide no scenario in which an employee may file a mixed case appeal with the Board after filing a district court action for discrimination.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant simultaneously pursues a Board and a court case under Title VII and the court determines the action, under <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> the court's determination may bar further litigation by the Board, <span class="Italic">Hooker v.

When an appellant exercises the right set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(e)(1)(B), the U.S. district court has jurisdiction to consider both the discrimination and nondiscrimination claims. <span class="Italic">See Bonds v.

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 332, 337 (1995). The U.S. district court was a forum with competent jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(e)(1)(B), as set forth above, and the court's determinations were final judgments on the merits. <span class="Italic">See Bernstein v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that, even if the elements for applying collateral estoppel have been met in this case, a redetermination of his removal is warranted because there is reason to doubt the quality, extensiveness, and procedural and substantive fairness of the U.S. district court's adjudication. The appellant also asserts that he has not yet had an opportunity to address his case under the <span class="Italic">Davis</span> factors, as required in the Board-ordered remand, and that the administrative judge violated his right to a fair hearing because the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal. The appellant submits with his petition for review the transcript of two depositions in his EEO complaint that were taken in 2010, which he contends support the merits of his retaliation claims. These arguments do not affect our determination to dismiss this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we have found that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> applies in this case, we need not address whether there is a reason not to apply collateral estoppel, such as a reason to doubt the quality of the prior adjudication. <span class="Italic">See Milligan v.

Although the appellant contends that he has not yet had an opportunity to address the <span class="Italic">Davis</span> factors in his Board appeal, any such lack of opportunity is the result of his election under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(e)(1)(B) and the district court's issuance of its decisions on the merits. The appellant's claim that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal does not affect our determination to apply <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. <span class="Italic">See Hicks v.

In these cases, however, the appellants filed timely petitions for review with the Board and our decision was that we would not relinquish that jurisdiction which we properly had simply because the appellants also filed a civil action as permitted by 5 USC 7702(e) which allows the appellant to file an action if more than 120 days have passed without a final decision of the Board. 5 USC 7702(e), however, does not authorize an action for judicial review of a Board decision; instead, it only authorizes an employee "to file a civil action to the same extent and in the same manner as provided in section 717(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC 2000e-16(c)), section 15(c) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 USC 633a(c)), or section 16(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 USC 216(b))." Thus, in a 7702(e) action, an appellant is not seeking review of a final Board decision, but is instead seeking judicial enforcement of the discrimination claims which were part of the mixed case pending before the Board. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Mays v. USPS</span>, 995 F.2d 1056, 1059-60 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (recognizing discrimination claims and adverse action claims as separate causes of action). The appellant thus does not surrender his right to have his adverse action claims adjudicated by the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, when an appellant seeks judicial review of a final Board decision under 5 USC 7703, as the appellant did here, he "surrenders his right to appeal to the Board" and the Board "simply lack[s] jurisdiction to reopen a final and fully adjudicated decision." <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 967 F.2d at 578, 579. <span class="Italic">See also McGovern v. EEOC</span>, 28 MSPR 689, 691 n.1 (1985) (that 5 USC 7702(e)(1)(B) allows the appellant to seek judicial review if he has not received a final decision within 120 days does not make the initial decision a final and reviewable Board order; inasmuch as there is no final Board decision, the district court cannot be said to have primary jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances, we find that the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider the appellant's request for review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wilson v. VA</span>, 102 MSPR 70, 73 n.2, 2006 MSPB 127 (2006) ("The administrative judge correctly found that, despite the filing of the district <span id="Page_3573"></span>court action, the Board retained jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lynch v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 447, 449 (1994) (although the filing of a district court action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703 seeking review of an initial decision that has become final divests the Board of jurisdiction over a petition for review of that decision, the filing of an action that does not seek review of such a decision does not have that effect."). [Refer to <a href="0100-2023-12-040.html#sec5-41">Effect of Judicial Review on PFR</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-12-072.html#sec5-72">Effect of Judicial Review on Petition to Reopen</a>" in Chapter 5; refer to Chapter 17 for discussion of judicial review involving MSPB mixed cases.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On the remedial side, it is possible for a district court to determine that an individual was the object of discrimination, but for after-acquired evidence then to demonstrate that termination was justifiable despite the finding of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Castle v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 68 MSPR 417, 421 (1995), concluded that a back pay remedy ordered by a district court would not necessarily demonstrate that an individual was improperly terminated for purposes of MSPB jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the agency's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and upon the appellant's motion to amend judgment, the court addressed the arguments which the appellant raises again upon petition for review. The court stated: "At bottom, the Plaintiff now argues that federal courts lack any discretion whatsoever to fashion equitable relief in cases involving federal employees who, at the time the after-acquired evidence was discovered, would have finished their probationary period and attained the right to appeal any adverse employment decision to the MSPB. Under such circumstances, the Plaintiff suggests, a court's only option is to award reinstatement with full backpay [with subsequent termination based on the after-acquired evidence]." <span class="Italic">See Castle v. Bentsen</span>, 872 F. Supp. 1055, 1060 (D.D.C. 1995) ("<span class="Italic">Castle</span> <span class="Italic">II</span>"). Citing both the language of Title VII and Supreme Court interpretation of the statute, however, the court emphatically rejected that suggestion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. It stated that "[N]either the language of the statute nor the case law thereunder...place[s] any such severe restriction on the Court's discretion to determine equitable relief under Title VII." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court added that although the "'make whole' purpose of Title VII is evident by the legislative history, it unquestionably does not compel the award of reinstatement and back pay in every case...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1062, citing to <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Company v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 420-21, 95 S. Ct. 2362, 2373, 45 L. Ed.2d 280 (1975).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Supreme Court stated a week after the issuance of <span class="Italic">Castle II</span>, neither reinstatement nor front pay would be an appropriate remedy in an after-acquired evidence case. "It would be both inequitable and pointless to order the reinstatement of someone the employer would have terminated, and will terminate, in any event and upon lawful grounds." <span class="Italic">McKennon</span> [<span class="Italic">v. Nashville Banner Publishing Co.</span>], __U.S.__, 115 S. Ct. [879,] at 886, [130 L. Ed.2d 852 (1995)] . "The employee's wrongdoing must be taken into account...lest the employer's legitimate interests be ignored." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sellers v. Mineta</span>, 358 F.3d 1058, 1063-66 (8th Cir. 2004) (extensive discussion of the effect of after-acquired evidence upon liability for front pay; also discussing duty of mitigation and factors affecting duration of front pay, including the plaintiff's age, education, proximity to normal retirement age, and efforts to secure other employment); <span class="Italic">Castle v. Rubin</span>, 78 F.3d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (declining to interfere with the district court decision limiting the remedy based upon after-acquired evidence of wrongdoing and declining to require bifurcation of the case in court to permit the MSPB to assess the remedy on the theory that, had employee not been improperly terminated, she would have been a tenured employee with rights to MSPB review).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee takes an MSPB case to EEOC, where the EEOC Office of Federal Operations makes the decision, and if the employee then takes a favorable OFO decision into court, claiming that the remedy structured by OFO is insufficient, the employee may have to prove <span class="Italic">de novo</span> the merits of her discrimination case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Laber v. Harvey</span>, 438 F.3d 404 (4th Cir. 2006) (district court can enforce an OFO decision without <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, but when the OFO remedy is challenged as insufficient, the employee places the employing agency's discrimination at issue). The Board noted that one appeal was dismissed as premature because the appellant previously filed a complaint in federal court on the "same issue." The court then dismissed the complaint for failure to exhaust Board administrative remedies. The Board remanded the case to the regional office for hearing because "the appeal [was] now ripe for review." <span class="Italic">Day v. USDA</span>, 22 MSPR 258, 259 (1984).
