<h3 class="h3" id="sec1-60"><span class="space">C.</span> COMPETITIVE SERVICE EMPLOYEES</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">For the competitive service, the statutory definition for the employee with standing to appeal an adverse action is 5 USC 7511:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;For the purpose of this subchapter--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;"employee" means--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;an individual in the competitive service--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(i)&#x2003;who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(ii)&#x2003;who has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less;...</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The importance of distinctions between the excepted and competitive services diminished in 1990 because of statutory amendments granting appeal rights to many nonveteran excepted service employees. However, there remain distinctions in appeal rights, and those distinctions require an understanding of the characteristics of each species of appointment. For some history of the Veterans Preference Act and the provisions, now incorporated into the Reform Act, extending appeal rights to both veterans and nonveterans, refer to <span class="Italic">Richardson v. TVA</span>, 12 MSPR 319, 321 (1982), and <span class="Italic">Dodd v. TVA</span>, 770 F.2d 1038, 1041 n.7 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Discussion begins with the definition of the competitive service. The statutory and regulatory definitions of the competitive service rival tax code provisions in their opacity. 5 USC 2102 defines competitive service to include all civil service positions (defined at &#x00A7; 2101 to be all appointive positions other than military) in the executive branch except for positions specifically exempted by statute from the competitive service. "Civil service positions in the executive branch are in the competitive service unless one of three exceptions applies. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2102(a)(1)." <span class="Italic">Humme v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 109 MSPR 678, 682 &#x00B6; 11, 2008 MSPB 205 (2008).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The definition is not simplified by OPM regulations. 5 CFR 212.101(a)(1) (2022), partially defines the competitive service to include "[a]ll civilian positions in the executive branch...not specifically excepted from the civil service laws...by the President, or by the Office of Personnel Management, and not in the Senior Executive Service." The competitive service is also defined by 5 CFR 212.401 (2022) to include individuals who have competitive status through appointments in competitive positions under nontemporary appointments. A "competitive position" is defined as a "position in the competitive service." 5 CFR 212.101(b) (2022). Competitive status is acquired upon completion of a probationary period in a career or career-conditional appointment through competitive examination or through appointment authorized by statute, Executive Order, or civil service rules to be made without competitive examination. 5 CFR 212.301 (2022). OPM excepts positions from the competitive service if it determines that appointments to the positions are not practicable through examination. 5 CFR 6.1(a) (2022). OPM assigns final determinations to itself, under 5 CFR 212.102 (2022), stating that "OPM determines finally whether a position is in the competitive service." Because OPM created rules so abstruse that no one else understands them, that is probably just as well.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is no easier to define competitive service by defining its counterpart, the excepted service. 5 CFR 1.4(b) (2022) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Excepted service</span> shall have the same meaning as the words "unclassified service," or "unclassified civil service," or "positions outside the competitive civil service" as used in existing statutes and executive orders.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The best that can be said is that everything is competitive unless an OPM regulation, Executive Order, or a statute states it is not. Adjudicators have attempted to provide explanations concerning distinctions between excepted and competitive service appointments. The Supreme Court proffered in <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 108 S. Ct. 668, 670 n.1 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRA divides civil service employees into three main classifications that can be generally described as follows: "Senior Executive Service" employees are those who occupy high-level positions in the Executive Department, but for whom appointment by the President and confirmation by the Senate is not required. "Competitive service" employees are all other employees for whom nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate is not required, and who are not specifically excepted from the competitive service by statute or by statutorily authorized regulation. "Excepted service" personnel are the remainder--those who are in neither the competitive service nor the Senior Executive Service....

<p class="Block-Quote1">"Civil service" is defined as all Federal appointive positions except uniformed services. 5 USC 2101. The civil service is composed of the "competitive service," the "excepted service," and the "Senior Executive Service." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 2102, 2103. All Executive Branch appointive positions not requiring Senate confirmation and not in the Senior Executive Service are to be in the competitive service unless "specifically excepted from the competitive service by or under statute." 5 USC 2102. Congress authorized the President, when warranted by "conditions of good administration," to make "necessary exceptions of positions from the competitive service" within the executive branch. 5 USC 3302. Subsequently, the President delegated this authority to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Exec. Order No. 10577, 5 CFR 6.1(a). OPM thereafter divided excepted service positions into three categories: Schedules A, B, and C. 5 CFR 6.2. Schedule A, which allows exception of "positions other than those of a confidential or policy-determining character for which it is impracticable to examine," 5 CFR 213.3101, specifically includes "attorneys." 5 CFR 213.3102(d)....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">An overview of those regulations governing the hiring of civil service <span id="Page_65"></span>employees is necessary for our disposition of this appeal. Civil service employees are members of either the "competitive service"[1] or the "excepted service."[2] An employee typically becomes a member of the "competitive service" by taking an examination administered by the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM"). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 3304 (1976 &#x0026; Supp. V 1981). An applicant who meets the minimum requirements for entrance to an examination, and who receives a rating of 70 or more on the examination, is known as an "eligible." 5 CFR 210.102(b)(5), 337.101(a) (1983). OPM is required to enter on a civil service "register"[3] the names of all eligibles in accordance with their numerical rankings. 5 CFR 332.401 (1983).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;A "register" is defined as a "list of qualified applicants compiled in order of relative standing for certification." 5 CFR 210.102(b)(14) (1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency seeking to hire an employee must submit a request to OPM for a "certificate" of eligibles.[4] When OPM receives a request for certification of eligibles, it prepares a certificate by selecting names from the head of the appropriate register. This certificate consists of a sufficient number of names to permit the agency to consider three eligibles for each vacancy, 5 CFR 332.402 (1983), the so-called "rule-of-three."[5] A hiring official from the agency, known as the "appointing officer," 5 CFR 210.102(b)(1) (1983), is obliged to fill each vacancy "with sole regard to merit and fitness" from the three eligibles ranking highest on the certificate who are available for appointment. 5 CFR 332.404 (1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;A "certificate" is defined as a "list of eligibles from a register submitted to an appointing officer so that he may consider the eligibles for appointment." 5 CFR 332.102(a) (1983).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">With a few exceptions not here relevant, eligibles appointed from a register become "career-conditional" employees. 5 CFR 315.301(a) (1983). These career-conditional employees may become "career" employees upon the completion of a three-year period of "creditable service." 5 CFR 315.201(a)(b) (1983). Those employees who successfully complete the first year of the three-year service period generally have greater procedural rights than those who do not. For example, prior to the completion of the first year of a career-conditional employee's service period--the "probationary period"--the employee may be dismissed "if he fails to demonstrate fully his qualifications for continued employment." 5 CFR 315.803 (1983). During this period such an employee is accorded limited procedural rights, and may seek review of a dismissal only on the grounds that the dismissal was discriminatory or effected by improper procedures. Career employees (and career-conditional employees in their second or third years of service), in contrast, enjoy the much greater procedural protections of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act.[9] <span class="Italic">See generally Sampson v. Murray</span>, 415 U.S. 61, 80-82, 94 S. Ct. 937, 948-949, 39 L. Ed.2d 166 (1974).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;Lloyd-LaFollette Act, ch. 389, &#x00A7; 7, 37 Stat. 539, 555 (1912), as amended by the Back Pay Act, ch. 447, &#x00A7; 6, 62 Stat. 354, 355 (1948) (codified as amended at 5 USC 5595-96, 7501 (1976 &#x0026; Supp. V 1981)). These provisions are implemented by 5 CFR 752 (1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Members of the "excepted service" are subject to less rigorous entrance requirements, and are accorded fewer procedural protections, than are members of the competitive service. Among the members of the excepted service are employees appointed for a definite term of employment, or "term employees." These employees do not acquire competitive status by virtue of their term appointment.[10] Term employees may be appointed for terms of one to four years when the needs of the service so require. 5 CFR 316.301 (1983). Unlike members of the competitive service, who must generally submit to competitive examinations, term employees may bypass the rigors of the competitive process if OPM so authorizes. 5 CFR 316.302(b) (1983).[11] Term employees, on the other hand, are accorded none of the procedural protections of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act,[12] and only limited procedural rights by regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 316.303(a) (1983) ("[a]term employee does not acquire a competitive status on the basis of his term appointment").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;5 CFR 316.302(b) (1983) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">The office may authorize an agency to make term appointments outside a register when there are insufficient eligibles on the appropriate register.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">OPM may also authorize temporary appointments for less than one year, or "temporary limited appointments." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 316.401-402 (1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7501(1) (Supp. V 1981) (defining "employee" as an individual "in the competitive service....").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In general, there are no provisions for the conversion of term employees to career-conditional employees.[14] A term employee who wishes to acquire competitive status must therefore make use of the ordinary procedures for entering the competitive service. Those procedures include taking a competitive examination, obtaining a position on a civil service register, being certified as one of the three highest rated applicants for each vacancy, and being selected by an appointing officer with sole regard to merit and fitness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[14]&#x2003;The provisions for conversion of employees to career or career-conditional employment are contained in 5 CFR 315 subpart G (1983). Section 315.703(a) of subpart G permits the conversion of employees whose names were once included on a certificate and who have been continuously employed since that time....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The excepted service is also defined to include positions specifically excepted from the competitive service by statute, by the President, or by OPM. 5 CFR 213.101(a) (2022). The excepted service, a residual classification of federal employees, is sizable, encompassing more than a million employees in three branches of government. Postal Service appointees make a sizable contribution to the ranks of excepted service personnel; a smaller group includes medical professionals within the Department of Veterans Affairs. For an excellent description of the evolution and scope of the excepted service, refer to the GAO study: <span class="Italic">The Excepted Service: A Research Profile</span> (Staff Study, 05/01/97, GAO/GGD-97-72). <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/ggd-97-72.pdf.">https://www.gao.gov/assets/ggd-97-72.pdf</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The excepted service is subdivided as to types of appointments under OPM regulations. The Federal Labor Relations Authority explained the nature of excepted service appointments, also referred to as "schedule" appointments, <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS Region V, Chicago</span>, 25 FLRA 1110, 1110-11 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Most positions in the Federal civil service are in the competitive service or the excepted service.... Generally, the competitive service includes positions for which examinations are given. 5 USC 3304. Some positions in the civil service are excepted from the competitive service and are placed in one of three "excepted service" schedules: (1) Schedule A, which includes positions other than those of a confidential or policy-determining character for which it is impractical to hold any examinations; (2) Schedule B, which includes positions other than those of a confidential or policy-determining character for which it is not practicable to hold a competitive examination; and (3) Schedule C, which includes positions of a confidential or policy-determining character. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR Part 213. Attorney positions in the civil service are included in Schedule A of the excepted service. 5 CFR 213.3102(d).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board tried its hand at explaining the system, as to a Schedule A (confidential or policy-making) excepted service employee, <span class="Italic">Bey-Ali v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 51 MSPR 207, 209-11 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has only the jurisdiction that pertinent statutes and regulations give to it. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Manning v. MSPB</span>, 742 F.2d 1424 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Godfrey v. VA</span>, 40 MSPR 438, 441 (1989). In order to appeal to the Board under 5 USC chapter 75, at the time the removal in this appeal was effective, May 4, 1990, an individual must have been in the competitive service or a preference eligible in the excepted service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7511(a)(1); <span class="Italic">Meyers v. Dept. of Army</span>, 35 MSPR 417, 420 (1987). Here, it is undisputed that the appellant is not a preference eligible. Nor was his position in the competitive service; rather, it was properly in the excepted service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For purposes of title 5, United States Code, the "excepted service" consists of civil service positions which are not in the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 2103(a). Positions may be specifically excepted from the competitive service by or under statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 2102(a)(1)(A). Pursuant to its statutorily delegated authority, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is generally empowered to regulate personnel management functions in the Federal Government, to conduct competitive service examinations, and to ensure compliance with all civil service laws, rules and regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 1104(a)(1), (b)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under this authority, OPM has issued regulations defining positions in the competitive service, 5 CFR part 212, and in the excepted service, part 213. These regulations provide, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that OPM shall decide whether the duties of any particular position are such that it may be filled as an excepted position under Schedule A, B, or C. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 213.102. "Schedule A, B, and C appointing authorities available for use by all agencies shall be published as regulations in the Federal Register and the Code of Federal Regulations." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 213.103(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Schedule A, relevant to this appeal, contains "[p]ositions other than those of a confidential or policy-determining character for which <span id="Page_66"></span>it is impracticable to examine." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 213.3101. Under specific authorization by OPM, agencies may make appointments to such schedule A positions. For each such authorization, OPM shall assign an identifying number from 213.3102-213.3199 to be used by the appointing agency in recording such appointments. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 213.3101(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the applicable excepted service appointing authority is 5 CFR 213.3101(d), "Military Sealift Command, (1) All positions on vessels operated by the Military Sealift Command." <span class="Italic">See</span> 55 Fed. Reg. 39090 (Sept. 24, 1990). The agency avers that the appellant was a Utilityman aboard a Military Sealift Command vessel. The appellant does not dispute this fact. Inasmuch as the appellant's position was specifically included in the excepted service by regulation and because he is a nonpreference eligible employee in the excepted service, he does not meet the definition of an employee eligible to appeal to the Board under 5 USC 7511. Accordingly, the appeal was properly dismissed for lack of Board jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For additional explanation of Schedule A appointing authority, refer to <span class="Italic">NTEU v. Helfer</span>, 53 F.3d 1289 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (sustaining the authority of the FDIC to hire liquidation-grade employees without competitive examination). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thompson v. DOJ</span>, 61 MSPR 364, 368-69 (1994) (explaining the distinctions among excepted service appointment schedules).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are distinctions between employees serving probationary or trial periods in the competitive service and excepted service. OPM regulations defining the maximum amount of nonpay absences that a probationer can incur and still serve a full year probationary period do not apply to the calculation of the full year of current continuous service needed by an excepted service preference eligible to qualify for a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tom v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 32 MSPR 126, 130 (1987) (no break in service; the appellant's placement in nonpay status did not remove him from agency rolls or otherwise disrupt his continued employment). A court reiterated the distinctions between new appointees in the excepted and competitive services in <span class="Italic">Frantz v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3205).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When the Board considers whether the appellant is in the competitive or excepted service, and the issue is of jurisdictional significance, the Board examines appointment documents and affidavits. A hearing on the jurisdictional issue is not required unless testimony would materially add to the record. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lowe v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 27 MSPR 223, 225-26 (1985). [Refer to Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-218.html#sec2-215">Hearing on Jurisdictional Issue</a>."]</p>
