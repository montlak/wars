<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-209"><span class="space">b.</span> Pay System Conversion; Grade Reduction</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee is placed in a different pay system, the possibility that future pay raises may not equal those in the past does not confer appellate jurisdiction on the Board. <span class="Italic">Wilcox v. Arms Control &#x0026; Disarmament Agency</span>, 6 MSPR 310, 311-12, 6 MSPB 264 (1981). If an employee is reclassified from Wage Grade to General Schedule, no appeal right exists. The final determination of whether a position should be in the General Schedule lies with OPM. <span class="Italic">See Leary v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 60 MSPR 529, 532 (1994) (no jurisdiction over an agency's action classifying a particular position as a GS or GM position); <span class="Italic">cf. Bosco v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 6 MSPR 471, 473-74, 6 MSPB 398 (1981) (pay retention benefits precluded Board jurisdiction following the appellants' reclassification from Wage Grade to General Schedule; "if the benefits are received, the Board does not have jurisdiction over a subsequent appeal based on the reclassification of a position, regardless of the arguments which are raised on the merits").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming a claim of a pay reduction resulting from a conversion from one pay system to another, the representative rate on the date of the action (for example, a shift from the General Schedule to Wage Grade) controls adverse action rights. <span class="Italic">Hetrick v. Dept. of Army</span>, 19 MSPR 638 (1984) (Table). The representative rate also controls whether a shift out of a competitive level from a job in one pay system to another following reorganization constitutes a demotion that should have been processed through RIF procedures. <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 61 MSPR 99, 102-04 (1994), elaborated on pay system conversions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Broderick v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 52 MSPR 254 (1992), as in the present appeal, the appellants were assigned from positions under one pay method category to positions under another. The Board noted in its decision that, under those circumstances, the representative rates of pay for the positions at issue--not the appellants' actual rates of pay--determined whether the appellants had been demoted. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 259 n.6. It noted further that, unless representative rates were compared, it would be impossible to determine whether employees' grades had been reduced or increased<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulatory aut authority on which the Board relied in the part of <span class="Italic">Broderick</span> cited above, 5 CFR 536.201, does not apply to Office of Thrift Savings employees such as the appellant, since those employees are not subject to chapters 51 and 53 of title 5, U.S. Code, 12 USC 1462a(g). The rule stated in <span class="Italic">Broderick</span>, however, is consistent with 5 CFR 210.102(b)(4), which defines the term "demotion," as including "a change of an employee, while serving continuously within the same agency[,] ...[t]o a position with a lower rate of pay when...the old and the new positions...are in different pay method categories." This regulatory definition is applicable generally under regulations promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management, and is not limited to employees or positions covered by chapters 51 and 53. We therefore extend, to employees not subject to chapters 51 and 53 of title 5, the principle that an assignment to a position in a different pay system constitutes a demotion if the representative rate of the position to which the employee is assigned is lower than that of the employee's former position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 CFR 532.401, the representative rate of a General Schedule grade <span id="Page_332"></span>is the fourth step of that grade. We know of no similar provision defining the representative rate of a grade in the pay system that included the appellant's former position. We note, however, that that system was similar to the General Schedule in that it included 10 steps. For this reason, and in the absence of any indication that a different method should be used to determine the representative rate of the grade of the appellant's former position, we find that that rate was that of the fourth step of the grade, or $50,662. According to the notice informing the appellant of the assignment at issue here, the pay scale for the appellant's new position was $35,779 to $50,241. Since the top rate of the new position's grade was less than the representative rate of the appellant's former grade, it follows that the representative rate of the grade of the new position was lower than the representative rate of the grade of the appellant's former position. We therefore find that the appellant was demoted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency acknowledges that the appellant's assignment occurred as a result of a reorganization. By demoting the appellant, the agency released her from her competitive level. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 351.403(a) (competitive level includes certain positions at a single grade level). An employee who has been released from her competitive level by demotion as a result of an agency's reorganization, and who is covered by the RIF regulations, is entitled to appeal the demotion to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 351.201(a)(2), 351.901. We see no indication that the appellant in this case, a civilian employee of the executive branch of the federal government, is not covered by the RIF regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 351.202(a) (5 CFR part 351 applies to "each civilian employee in...[t]he executive branch of the Federal Government..."). We therefore find that the appellant's demotion constitutes an appealable RIF action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that employees covered by the RIF regulations are entitled to certain protections provided under those regulations. These include protections related to their retention in or release from their competitive levels and, in the case of competitive service employees such as the appellant, protections related to assignment rights. The record shows, however, that the agency did not follow the RIF regulations in effecting the appellant's demotion.

An employee who was a GS-14 Supervisory Management Analyst, entered the National Security Personnel System (NSPS) with various pay adjustments, and emerged as a GS-13, suffered an appealable reduction in grade, although there was no pay reduction, in <span class="Italic">Arrington v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 117 MSPR 301, 306-08 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-13, 2012 MSPB 6 (2012), reversing the grade reduction for lack of due process protections:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also has jurisdiction over an employee's reduction in grade. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(3), 7513(d). Grade means "a level of classification under a position classification system." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(3). OPM's regulations similarly define "grade" as "a level of classification under a position classification system." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant was not reduced in grade from GS-14 to GS-13 while she was within the NSPS pay system. At no point while she was subject to NSPS did the appellant occupy a position at any level of classification within the General Schedule. Moreover, the appellant's movement within the NSPS apparently was consistent with the principles behind the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-136, 117 Stat. 1621 (2003), which authorized the creation of the NSPS to replace the perceived limitations of the traditional federal pay and classification system with a broader pay-banding structure, thus allowing agencies to move employees more freely between positions without being bound by narrowly described work definitions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree that the appellant's conversion from a YC-02 position within NSPS to a GS-13 position within the General Schedule did not, standing alone, result in an appealable reduction in grade. Neither 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 nor 5 C.F.R. part 752 indicates how a reduction in grade, i.e., a level of classification "under a classification system," is to be determined where, as here, there is movement with no reduction in pay across or between position classification systems.[3] <span class="Italic">Cf. Peele v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 6 M.S.P.R. 296, 299 (1981) (finding no reduction in grade when a position was moved from the General Schedule to a position not under a position classification system). Nor is there any language in the 2009 Act or elsewhere in the NSPS statutes or regulations to indicate that the appellant's conversion, standing alone, would constitute an appealable reduction in grade under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, explaining the purposes of the "reduction in grade" language included in chapter 75, does not answer this question either. <span class="Italic">See Russell v. Department of the Navy,</span> 6 M.S.P.R. 698, 706-07 (1981). The legislative history does reflect, however, Congress's belief that determinations of whether an appealable "reduction in grade" has occurred would be based on objective criteria that would be relatively easy to apply, e.g., an employee's grade is reduced from GS-14 to GS-13.<span class="Italic"> See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Nor do we find any language in the 2009 Act or elsewhere in the NSPS statutes and regulations that would provide an independent basis for Board review of the appellant's conversion from NSPS to the General Schedule. The NSPS regulations provide that movement from a non-NSPS personnel system to an NSPS position determined to be at a lower level of work may constitute a reduction in band, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 9901.103, but there is no comparable provision defining reduction in band for purposes of conversion from NSPS to a non-NSPS position. The appellant has not alleged that she was reduced in band as a result of her conversion to NSPS or her reassignments between pay-banded positions within NSPS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The crucial fact in this case, however, is that the appellant initially occupied a position at one level of classification within the General Schedule, GS-14, and was later placed involuntarily at a lower level, GS-13, under that same classification system.[5] This sequence of events constitutes an appealable "reduction in grade" as the term is defined under chapter 75 and its implementing regulations.[6] While it is true that this reduction in grade was not recorded on any one Standard Form 50, the cumulative effect of the personnel actions effected in this case was the appellant's reduction in grade from a GS-14 position to a GS-13 position. Under the unique circumstances surrounding the institution of NSPS and its subsequent repeal, we conclude that the appellant suffered an appealable reduction in grade from GS-14 to GS-13, effective April 25, 2010.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The agency argues that the appellant voluntarily accepted one or more reassignments while in the NSPS that significantly changed her duties and position description. These reassignments took place prior to the repeal of NSPS, however, and there is no indication that the appellant voluntarily accepted a reduction in grade from a GS-14 position to a GS-13 position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;We note that the downgrading of an employee pursuant to a position reclassification is not appealable to the Board where the employee is eligible for and receives retained grade and pay pursuant to 5 U.S.C. chapter 53. <span class="Italic">Atwell v. Department of the Army,</span> 2 M.S.P.R. 484 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 670 F.2d 272, 282-86 (D.C. Cir. 1981). However, the appellant in this case did not receive, nor was she eligible for, either retained grade or retained pay under chapter 53. Moreover, her downgrading to a GS-0343-13 Supervisory Management Analyst position resulted from reclassification of the YC-0343-02 position she held immediately prior to her conversion to the General Schedule, and not from reclassification of the GS-0343-14 Supervisory Management Analyst position she held prior to her conversion to NSPS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;We noted in paragraph 12 and footnote 4, <span class="Italic">infra,</span> that nothing in the language of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, the 2009 Act, or other NSPS statutes or regulations expressly provides for Board review of an appellant's conversion from the NSPS to the General Schedule. However, our conclusion that an appealable reduction in grade has been effected here, in the unique circumstances involving the NSPS, is consistent with &#x00A7; 1113(c)(1)(A) of the Act. With exceptions not applicable here, the 2009 Act provides for the conversion of all NSPS employees and positions to the "statutory pay system and all other aspects of the personnel system that last applied to such employee or position (as the case may be) before the [NSPS] applied." One aspect of the General Schedule personnel system that "last applied" to the appellant before she was converted to the NSPS was her GS-14 grade level. Although the language of Act is not dispositive of the meaning of a "reduction in grade" appealable to the Board pursuant to the unchanged 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(3) and 7513(d), it does suggest a broad Congressional intent that employees not be harmed when their positions are converted from the NSPS to the General Schedule.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Arrington</span> was followed by many nonprecedential Board decisions summarily reversing or affirming appeals, depending on whether the conversion process resulted in an actual grade reduction from the level before and after placement in NSPS. An employee who entered and exited from NSPS at the same grade did not have an appeal within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Copeland v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We next address the agency's claim that <span class="Italic">Arrington</span> does not apply because, unlike the appellant in <span class="Italic">Arrington</span>, the appellant in this case did not move within the same agency, but rather from one federal entity to another. It is true that the Department of the Air Force is a military component of the Department of Defense (DOD), whereas DLA is one of DOD's combat support agencies. However, the appellant's movement from the Department of the Air Force to DLA was consistent with the principles behind the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 which authorized the creation of the NSPS to replace the perceived limitations of traditional federal pay and classification system with a broader pay-banding structure, thus allowing agencies to move employees more freely between positions. <span class="Italic">Arrington</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 301, &#x00B6; 11. The agency has pointed to nothing in <span class="Italic">Arrington</span> that suggests that it only applies when the employee held a higher-graded position in the same agency before converting to the NSPS. Moreover, as the administrative judge points out, the SF-50 showing the appellant's appointment to the position in DLA states that the action is a "Voluntary Reassignment in NSPS," and a "reassignment" is a change of an employee, while serving within the same agency, from one position to another without promotion or demotion. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(12). We therefore agree with the administrative judge that, because the Department of the Air Force and DLA are both components under DOD and because the NSPS did not exclude any part of DOD from its application, <span class="Italic">Arrington</span> still controls.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">No Board appeal existed for an employee who believed that his rate of pay should have been higher following his exit from NSPS when he did not have a previous General Schedule appointment, <span class="Italic">Ellis v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 27, 2009, the appellant received an appointment to the position of YA-0301-02 Range and Training Planner within the National Security Personnel System (NSPS). On October 28, 2009, the President signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-84, 123 Stat. 2190, 2498, which repealed the statutory authority for the NSPS and called for the conversion of all employees and positions under NSPS to the pay system and all other aspects to the personnel system that applied prior to conversion to NSPS, or that would have applied had NSPS never been established. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00A7; 1113(b)-(c). Effective June 20, 2010, the agency converted the appellant's position to GS-0301-12 Range and Training Planner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an appeal in which he alleged that the agency reduced him in pay and grade, violated the terms of his appointment, and failed to comply with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 9901.372 in converting him to the General Schedule. The administrative judge found that the appellant did not make a nonfrivolous allegation that he had been reduced in pay or grade, and he dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The appellant petitions for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see no reason to disturb the administrative judge's determination that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction over his appeal as a reduction in pay. We also find that the appellant has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that he was reduced in grade.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By statute, the Board has jurisdiction over an employee's reduction in grade. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(3), 7513(d); <span class="Italic">Arrington v. Department of the Navy</span>, 2012 MSPB 6, &#x00B6; 10.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As we found in <span class="Italic">Arrington</span>, the appellant's conversion from a YA-02 position within the NSPS to a GS-12 position within the General Schedule did not result in an appealable reduction in grade. Neither 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 nor 5 C.F.R. part 752 indicates how a reduction in grade is to be determined where, as here, there is movement with no reduction in pay across or between position classification systems. <span class="Italic">Arrington</span>, 2012 MSPB 6, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">cf. Peele v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 296, 299 (1981) (finding no reduction in grade when a position was moved from the General Schedule to a position not under a position classification system). Nor is there any language in the 2009 Act repealing the NSPS or elsewhere in the NSPS statutes or regulations to indicate that the appellant's conversion, standing alone, would constitute an appealable reduction in grade under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. Additionally, we find nothing in the 2009 Act or elsewhere in the NSPS statutes and regulations that would provide an independent basis for the Board review of the appellant's conversion from the NSPS to the General Schedule. Thus, the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that his conversion from NSPS to the General Schedule constituted an appealable reduction in grade.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that we reached a different result in <span class="Italic">Arrington</span>, 2012 MSPB 6. In that case, the appellant occupied a GS-14 position before the NSPS was created, was converted into the NSPS, and then was converted back into the General Schedule at the GS-13 level when the NSPS was abolished. The Board found that, under the unique circumstances surrounding the institution of the NSPS and its subsequent repeal, and given the broad Congressional intent that employees not be harmed when their positions were converted back into the General Schedule, the cumulative effect of the personnel actions effected in that case was a reduction in grade from a GS-14 position to a GS-13 position. <span class="Italic">Arrington</span>, 2012 MSPB 6, &#x00B6; 13 &#x0026; n.7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, however, the appellant was hired into the NSPS. There is no evidence that the appellant ever occupied a GS-13 position prior to his conversion to GS-12, and there is no cumulative series of transactions to consider as there was in <span class="Italic">Arrington</span>. Although the appellant contended that the agency designated his position as a GS-13 "equivalent," he did not provide any evidence in support of his assertion until he filed his petition for review. Because he has neither explained why he did not submit this evidence below nor shown that the evidence is material to the outcome of this case, we have not considered it. <span class="Italic">See Russo v. Veterans Administration</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 345, 349 (1980); <span class="Italic">Avansino v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 211, 214 (1980). Further, while 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 9901.372 provides for the calculation of a "virtual" General Schedule grade, the "virtual grade" is used solely for pay-setting purposes. Thus, there is no merit to the appellant's apparent claim that the virtual General Schedule grade plays a role in determining whether there has been a reduction in grade when a position is converted from a YA pay band under the NSPS to a General Schedule position. Therefore, we find that the analysis in <span class="Italic">Arrington</span> does not apply here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's allegation that the agency failed to comply with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 9901.372 is likewise unavailing, as there is no indication in the applicable statute or regulations that an agency's alleged violation of &#x00A7; 9901.372 is appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Shifflett v. Department of the Navy</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 472, &#x00B6; 5 (1999) (an allegation that an agency failed to follow its own procedures is not independently appealable). To the extent that the administrative judge analyzed the appellant's reduction in grade claim under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 9901.372, she properly concluded that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that he was reduced in grade and, therefore, any adjudicatory error did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights. <span class="Italic">Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's challenge to the process by which the agency classified his position and its determination that the proper level was a GS-12 also provides no basis for a finding of jurisdiction. The Board has not been granted jurisdiction over cases concerning the proper classification of a position, either by statute or regulation. <span class="Italic">Pierce v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 242 F.3d 1373, 1375-76 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Beaudette v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 353, &#x00B6; 12 (2005). Likewise, absent jurisdiction over the underlying appeal, the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider the appellant's vague claim that the agency violated unspecified merit system principles. <span class="Italic">See Davis v.

Department of the Navy</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 511, &#x00B6; 8 (2012).

<p class="Body-Text">A claim to an equivalent higher grade in NSPS before conversion was insufficient to support demotion jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Vilders v. Dept. of Navy</span>, DC-0752-12-0377-I-1 (NP 4/4/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that he was appointed to a YA-02 position in the National Security Personnel System (NSPS) with the Department of the Army (Army), which was equivalent to a GS-13 position, before he transferred to a YA-02 position with the Department of the Navy (Navy), which then transitioned him to a GS-12 position upon the repeal of the statutory authority for the NSPS. The appellant contends that a demotion is defined under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.203 as a change from one General Schedule (GS) grade level to a lower GS grade level, that a "virtual" GS grade should be used for more than just pay-setting purposes, and that the agency therefore effected an appealable reduction in grade. The appellant further claims that the Navy should have clarified the GS equivalent of his position, and that a reasonable person would have surmised that his position at the Navy was at least a GS-13 equivalent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge found, the Board in <span class="Italic">Ellis v. Department of the Navy</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 511, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-8 (2012), held that the appellant in that case did not make a nonfrivolous allegation that he was reduced in grade because he was hired into the NSPS and never occupied a GS-13 position before his conversion to a GS-12 position, and that any "virtual" GS grade played no role in determining whether there had been a reduction in grade when the position was converted from a YA pay band under the NSPS to a GS position. Here, as in <span class="Italic">Ellis</span>, the appellant was hired into the NSPS and never occupied a GS-13 position before his conversion. The Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Arrington v. Department of the Navy</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 301, &#x00B6; 13 (2012), therefore, in which the "crucial fact" in finding a reduction in grade was a cumulative series of transactions under which the appellant initially occupied a position within the GS, and was later placed involuntarily at a lower GS level under that same classification system, is distinguishable from this case. Any virtual GS grade associated with the appellant's YA-02 position with the Army plays no role in determining whether he suffered a reduction in grade. <span class="Italic">See Ellis</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 511, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations cited by the appellant fall under subpart B of part 531, "Determining Rate of Basic Pay," or relate to grade retention eligibility when an employee under a covered pay system is placed in a lower grade, and do not address the criteria for determining whether there has been a reduction in grade under 5 U.S.C. ch. 75 for purposes of Board jurisdiction. Moreover, even if the Navy had set forth a GS equivalent for the appellant's YA-02 position, as set forth above, such a virtual GS grade would play no role in determining whether the appellant suffered a reduction in grade. The appellant has not otherwise shown by preponderant evidence that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">This case, however, is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Arrington</span>, and instead is more closely analogous to <span class="Italic">Ellis v.

Had the appellant in this case not applied for the permanent civil engineer position in the NSPS, he could have remained in his term appointment as a GS-13, and he would have been terminated when his term expired unless he obtained another appointment.

<p class="Body-Text">On facts similar to <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, <span class="Italic">Ellis</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Wachala v. DOD</span>, DC-0752-13-0195-I-1 (NP 9/19/2013). <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Army</span>, DA-0752-12-0521-I-1 (NP 5/30/2013) ("We see no reason to disturb the administrative judge's determination that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction over her appeal as a reduction in grade and that she was therefore not entitled to a hearing. The appellant's allegations of involuntariness relate to her movement between positions in the National Security Personnel System (NSPS), prior to its repeal. Even though the appellant moved from the Department of the Air Force to the Department of the Army, such movement apparently was consistent with the principles behind the National Defense Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2004 (the Act). The Act authorized the creation of the NSPS to replace the perceived limitations of the traditional federal pay and classification system with a broader pay-banding structure, thus allowing agencies to move employees more freely between positions without being bound by narrowly described work definitions. <span class="Italic">Arrington v. Department of the Navy</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 301, &#x00B6; 11 (2012). The appellant's challenge to the voluntariness of her movement between positions while in the NSPS, and her argument that one of the reassignments changed her duties and her position description, are not matters that the Board can review. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6; 6. At no point while she was subject to the NSPS did the appellant occupy a position at any level of classification with the General Schedule.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ellis</span> was not controlling, and the Board determined that <span class="Italic">Arrington</span> required a finding of grade reduction in <span class="Italic">Blackburn v. Dept. of Army</span>, DA-0752-12-0376-I-1 (NP 5/17/2013), involving some position changes while the appellant was in NSPS, with the result that there was a reduction in grade before and after entry into and discontinuation of the system:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective January 21, 2007, the appellant, a GS-0318-10 Secretary, was converted to a YB-0318-02 Secretary under the National Security Personnel System (NSPS). She applied, and was selected, for the position of Administrative Support Technician, YB-0303-02, which was in the same pay band, and she was reassigned to that position, effective October 12, 2008. Following repeal of the NSPS, she was reassigned to the position of Administrative Support Technician, GS-7, effective June 20, 2010.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an initial decision based on the written record, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. He considered the appellant's claim that her case was controlled by <span class="Italic">Arrington v. Department of the Navy</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 301 (2012), wherein the Board found that, under the unique circumstances surrounding the institution of the NSPS and its subsequent repeal, the cumulative effect of the personnel actions effected in that case was a reduction in grade from GS-14 to GS-13. <span class="Italic">Arrington</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 301, &#x00B6; 13. However, the administrative judge found that <span class="Italic">Arrington</span> did not control in this case because the appellant's voluntary act of accepting a reassignment to a position of less responsibility and historically lower pay while in the NSPS severed her claim to an appealable action. Instead, he found the appellant's situation analogous to that in <span class="Italic">Ellis v. Department of the Navy</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 511 (2012), where the appellant was hired into the NSPS to a position that had historically been classified at the GS-13 level but, when NSPS ended, was classified as a GS-12. In dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, the Board in <span class="Italic">Ellis</span> found no independent basis to review a conversion from one system to the other. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not persuaded that this case is, in fact, distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Arrington</span>. First, we note that the administrative judge's description of the facts in <span class="Italic">Arrington</span> is somewhat inaccurate. He stated that "Arrington entered NSPS at a certain grade but, after no interim changes, returned to the GS system at a lower grade." In fact, she was reassigned several times while in the NSPS. <span class="Italic">Arrington</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 301, &#x00B6; 3. It is true that the appellant in this case voluntarily applied for the position of Administrative Support Technician, YB-0303-02. However, in <span class="Italic">Arrington</span>, the Board addressed that issue, responding to the agency's claim that the appellant voluntarily accepted one or more reassignments while in the NSPS that significantly changed her duties and position description. The Board found that the reassignments took place prior to the repeal of the NSPS and that there was no indication that the appellant voluntarily accepted a reduction in grade from a GS-14 position to a GS-13 position. <span class="Italic">Arrington</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 301, &#x00B6; 13 n.5. Similarly, in this case the appellant's reassignment within the NSPS took place prior to its repeal, and there is no indication that she voluntarily accepted a reduction in grade from a GS-10 position to a GS-7 position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, in <span class="Italic">Arrington</span>, the Board examined certain language in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-84, 123 Stat. 2190, which we find instructive. Specifically, the Board stated that, "[w]ith exceptions not applicable here, the 2009 Act provides for the conversion of all NSPS employees and positions to the 'statutory pay system and all other aspects of the personnel system that last applied to such employee or position (as the case may be) before the [NSPS] applied.'" <span class="Italic">Arrington</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 301, &#x00B6; 13 n.7. The Board found that one aspect of the General Schedule personnel system that "last applied" to the appellant before she was converted to the NSPS was her GS-14 grade level. Further, in finding that a reduction in grade occurred, the Board stated that the statutory language suggested a broad Congressional intent that employees not be harmed when their positions were converted from the NSPS to the General Schedule. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the administrative judge's reliance on <span class="Italic">Ellis</span> is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Ellis</span>, unlike the instant case, the appellant was hired into the NSPS and was simply converted from that position to a position in the General Schedule. <span class="Italic">Ellis</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 511, &#x00B6; 2. In concluding that no reduction in grade occurred, the Board found that there was no evidence that Ellis ever occupied a position in the General Schedule before his conversion <span id="Page_335"></span>to a GS-12 position and that therefore there was no cumulative series of transactions to consider as there was in <span class="Italic">Arrington. Ellis</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 511, &#x00B6; 8. In the instant case, as noted, the appellant occupied a GS-10 Secretary position before she was converted to a position in the NSPS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor do we find it significant that the appellant in <span class="Italic">Arrington</span> was a GS-14 Supervisory Management Analyst before she entered the NSPS and was converted to the same position after repeal, albeit at a GS-13, whereas, in this case, the appellant was a GS-10 Secretary before she entered the NSPS but was converted to a GS-7 Administrative Support Technician after repeal. In <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of the Navy</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 393 (2012), the appellant was a GS-12 Program Analyst before he entered the NSPS and was converted to a GS-11 Instructional Systems Specialist after repeal. <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 393, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 3. Notwithstanding, the Board found, "[c]onsistent with <span class="Italic">Arrington</span>...that the agency subjected the appellant to an appealable reduction in grade from GS-12 to GS-11." <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 393, &#x00B6; 7. The Board did not appear to attach any significance to the fact that Miller encumbered positions with different titles before the NSPS and after its repeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we conclude that, consistent with <span class="Italic">Arrington</span>, the appellant suffered an appealable reduction in grade. However, the Board's regulations require that an appeal must be filed no later than 30 days after the effective date, if any, of the action being appealed, or 30 days after the date of receipt of the agency's decision, whichever is later. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). The regulations further provide that, if a party does not submit an appeal within the applicable time limit, it will be dismissed as untimely filed unless a good reason for the delay is shown. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(c).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appealable pay reduction did not occur when an individual was moved from one pay system to another, but there was no determinable diminution in present or future pay at the time of the change, <span class="Italic">Phillips v. MSPB</span>, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 590 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP No. 2008-3251):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Phillips worked in the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS" or "agency") as a Supervisory Revenue Agent, IR-05, when, on May 13, 2007, she was reassigned to a position as an Internal Revenue Agent, GS-13. Phillips, alleging that her reassignment was an involuntary demotion, appealed her reassignment to the Board....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction is limited to appeals of certain enumerated adverse actions, including removals, suspensions for more than 14 days, reductions in grade, reductions in pay, and furloughs of 30 days or less. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. When an employee is reassigned to a different position, "the Board ordinarily possesses jurisdiction only if the agency's action resulted in a reduction in grade or pay." <span class="Italic">Walker v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 106 F.3d 1582, 1584 (Fed. Cir. 1997). In this case, the Board concluded that Phillips's reassignment from the IR-05 position to the GS-13 position did not result in a reduction of either grade or pay. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "pay" is defined as "the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(4). A "reduction in pay" is "an ascertainable lowering, at the time of the personnel action, of an employee's present or future pay." <span class="Italic">Chaney v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 906 F.2d 697, 698 (Fed. Cir. 1990). No such reduction occurred in this case. Phillips's "Notification of Personnel Action," Standard Form 50 ("SF-50"), indicates that her adjusted basic pay was $79,481 at her prior IR-05 position and is now $80,343 (thus, higher) at her GS-13 position. Moreover, the maximum pay rate for both grades is the same: $87,039. Accordingly, the Board correctly found that Phillips incurred no ascertainable lowering of either present or future pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "grade" is defined as "a level of classification under a position classification system." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(3). To determine whether Phillips's reassignment resulted in a reduction in grade, the Board compared the "representative rate," as per 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 351.203 and 536.103(2), for both positions under the IR and GS classifications, and determined that the IR-05 pay band solely encompasses the GS-13 pay grade. It also found that the maximum pay rate for both grades is $87,039. Based on these undisputed facts, the Board held that Phillips did not incur a reduction in grade.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Phillips asserts that her prior IR-05 position allowed for future promotions to senior management positions, whereas her new GS-13 position does not. But even assuming that her new position involves less responsibility and less potential for future advancement, "[a] reduction in responsibility without a concurrent reduction in grade or pay...is not appealable to the Board," <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 807 F.2d 1577, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1986), and "[a] reduction in pay must be ascertainable <span class="Italic">at the time of the personnel action</span>, not at some future date," <span class="Italic">McEnery v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 963 F.2d 1512, 1514 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (emphasis in original). In this case, even if Phillips is eventually promoted to the top of her GS-13 pay grade, her maximum pay rate would be $87,039--the exact same rate she would have earned at the top of her previous IR-05 pay band. Any potential for future advancement beyond the GS-13 pay grade is speculative at this time, and it could not have been ascertained at the time of her reassignment. Thus, Phillips's allegations, even if true, do not suffice to establish an ascertainable reduction in pay or grade at the time of her reassignment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Fallacaro v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, PH-0752-12-0132-I-1 (NP 12/27/2012) (considering <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, inapplicable and stating "[o]ur reviewing court has held that a reduction in pay must be ascertainable at the time of the personnel action, not at some future date. <span class="Italic">McEnery v.

Here, the appellant's advancement to the maximum rate of pay as a GS-14 Program Analyst is purely speculative--it cannot be ascertained 'without reference to anticipated future developments.' <span class="Italic">McEnery</span>, 963 F.2d at 1515 (quoting <span class="Italic">Garbacz</span>, 656 F.2d at 633).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If there is a pay conversion that could represent a reduction, the appellant must be within the Board's personal jurisdiction before the Board acquires jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Meyers v.

<p class="Body-Text">Continuation of assignment of higher-level duties following cessation of a temporary promotion does not equate to an appealable grade reduction, <span class="Italic">Shik v. GSA,</span> NY-3443-16-0034-I-1 (NP 4/18/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant claims that the agency permanently reassigned him to a GS-14 position but has not compensated him accordingly. We have reviewed the record and find that there is no evidence supporting the appellant's contention that he was permanently promoted. The promotion of a Federal employee cannot occur unless an official with the appropriate authority took, authorized, or ratified an action that could reasonably be said to have resulted in a promotion. <span class="Italic">Hoever v. Department of the Navy</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6; 8 (2011). The record reflects that both the appellant and the agency understood that the appellant's promotion was temporary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that he continues to perform the duties of the GS-14 position he occupied during his temporary promotion. Even if the appellant were performing the duties previously performed by a GS-14 employee, performance of those duties is insufficient to establish that he was permanently promoted. <span class="Italic">See Phillips v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 229, &#x00B6; 5 (2006) (finding that, even if an appellant proved that he performed the duties of a higher-graded position and the agency failed to document or compensate him for the performance of those duties, he had not made a nonfrivolous allegation of the Board's jurisdiction). The return of an employee to his permanent position after a temporary promotion is not an action appealable to the Board, and the appellant did not show that he was duly appointed to the GS-14 position. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.102(f)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the issue in his appeal should not be confused with a classification issue. However, his claim is, in effect, that the agency improperly has failed to reclassify his GS-13 position to a GS-14 level after he returned to his former GS-13 job and the agency required him to continue performing the duties of the GS-14 position. As properly found by the chief administrative judge, the Board does not have jurisdiction over claims that a position has been classified incorrectly. <span class="Italic">See Beaudette v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 353, &#x00B6; 12 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee is deemed to have suffered a constructive demotion only when he was reassigned from a position that, due to the issuance of new classification standards or a correction of a classification error, was a higher grade, and he was reassigned to a position classified at a lower-grade level. <span class="Italic">Beaudette</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 353, &#x00B6; 13. A constructive demotion claim cannot be based on an allegation that a position could have been or should have been reclassified upward; rather, a constructive demotion claim can succeed only if the appellant's former position "has actually been reclassified upward." <span class="Italic">Marcheggiani v. Department of Defense</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 212, &#x00B6; 8 (2001). We agree with the chief administrative judge's finding that the appellant has failed to nonfrivolously allege that he suffered a constructive demotion because he has not argued that his former position was "actually...reclassified upward."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_336"></span>The appellant also alleges that the agency erred by transferring him into a GS-14 position without competition and violated the Office of Personnel Management's regulations by not returning him to his position of record after the temporary promotion concluded. As discussed above, the appellant was not permanently reassigned to a GS-14 position, and agencies are authorized to temporarily promote an employee for 120 days or less without competition. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(i). Again, the appellant's claim that he is performing GS-14 duties while encumbering a position classified as a GS-13 is a classification issue and is not within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Saunders v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 757 F.2d 1288, 1290 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (stating that the Board has not been granted appellate jurisdiction over cases concerning the proper classification of a position). Therefore, we find that the chief administrative judge appropriately dismissed this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
