<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-83"><span class="space">c.</span> Past Practice</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Past practice may inform contract interpretation, <span class="Italic">Buffkin v. DOD</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20200501285">957 F.3d 1327</a>, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2020):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The conduct of the parties confirms this interpretation. The Supreme Court has noted that "[t]he labor arbitrator's source of law is not confined to the express provisions of the contract, as the industrial common law--the practices of the industry and the shop--is equally a part of the collective bargaining agreement although not expressed in it." <span class="Italic">United Steelworkers of Am. v. Warrior &#x0026; Gulf Navigation Co</span>., 363 U.S. 574, <span id="Page_5298"></span>581-82 (1960); <span class="Italic">see also Muller</span>, 809 F.3d at 1383 ("[P]ast practices can supplement a collective bargaining agreement."); <span class="Italic">Cruz-Martinez v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., 410 F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2005). In <span class="Italic">Cruz-Martinez</span> we upheld an arbitrator's dismissal of an employee grievance because his union waited longer than a year after invoking arbitration to request an arbitrator and schedule a hearing, in violation of an established practice of the parties. 410 F.3d at 1367, 1372. We found that the past practice there created a binding, consequential deadline even in the absence of express language in the collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1370. "Clear and long-standing practices of the parties--in other words, 'past practices'--can establish terms of the agreement that are as binding as any specific written provision." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We held that "[t]he arbitrator's reliance on the sixteen years of the union's acquiescence in the past practice [wa]s substantial evidence supporting the arbitrator's decision" to dismiss the employee's claim. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it appears to have been common practice for the parties to hold a second mediation session. The parties had settled sixty-one grievances in 2015, which were discussed in mediations in 2012 and 2015. In at least two other arbitrations, based on grievances mediated in both 2012 and 2015, the agency did not object to the union's submitting a request for arbitration in 2014. In this case, the agency did not consider the grievance "resolved" after the first mediation. The agency also did not object to the union's invoking arbitration when the union submitted its request or during the selection of arbitrators. Not until January 31, 2018, over three years after the union submitted its request for arbitration, did the agency file a request to the arbitrator requesting to bifurcate the hearing and adjudicate arbitrability. The agency's conduct and past practices indicate that it did not think the union's request for arbitration was untimely.[4] The parties' conduct supports the interpretation that the last day of the second mediation session constituted "the last stage of the grievance procedure" under the agreement. The union did not invoke arbitration too late under the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;We thus need not reach the issue of whether the government's conduct also constitutes waiver under <span class="Italic">Gunn v. Veterans Admin. Med. Ctr., Birmingham, Ala</span>., 892 F.2d 1036 (Fed. Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of past practice as an aid to contract interpretation, interpreting a timeliness requirement in a labor contract, <span class="Italic">Muller v. GPO</span>, 809 F.3d 1375, 1382-83 (Fed. Cir. 2016), determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, there is no past practice between the parties suggesting that the agreement should be interpreted to require dismissal for failure to comply with the deadline when the matter was submitted to the arbitrator in time for a hearing to be held within the four-month period. The arbitrator found, and the government now argues, that past practice of the GPO should lead to an interpretation of the master agreement under which failure to comply with the four-month deadline requires dismissal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that past practices can supplement a collective bargaining agreement. The Supreme Court has noted that "[t]he labor arbitrator's source of law is not confined to the express provisions of the contract, as the industrial common law--the practices of the industry and the shop--is equally a part of the collective bargaining agreement although not expressed in it." <span class="Italic">United Steelworkers of Am. v. Warrior &#x0026; Gulf Navigation Co.</span>, 363 U.S. 574, 581-82 (1960); <span class="Italic">see also Cruz-Martinez v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.</span>, 410 F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2005). In <span class="Italic">Cruz-Martinez</span> we upheld an arbitrator's dismissal of an employee grievance because his union waited longer than a year after invoking arbitration to request an arbitrator and schedule a hearing, in violation of an established practice of the parties. 410 F.3d at 1367, 1372. We found that the past practice there created a binding, consequential deadline even in the absence of express language in the collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1370. "Clear and long-standing practices of the parties--in other words, 'past practices'--can establish terms of the agreement that are as binding as any specific written provision." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. "The arbitrator's reliance on the sixteen years of the union's acquiescence in the past practice is substantial evidence supporting the arbitrator's decision" to dismiss the employee's claim. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The past practice evidence in the record here consists of eight letters from the GPO to the union dismissing grievances because no arbitration hearing had been held within four months of invocation of arbitration. In each of the letters, the agency sought to dismiss a grievance because the union had failed to select an arbitrator within the four-month window. The letters therefore evidence an established practice of closing arbitration when the union was not diligent in selecting an arbitrator before the four-month deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Muller's situation is different. Even if the union were dilatory up to the point that the arbitrator was selected, there is no question that Mr. Muller's grievance was submitted to the arbitrator in sufficient time to schedule and conduct a hearing within four months. The GPO and the union jointly selected Mr. Feldman as arbitrator in April of 2014, and the union informed FMCS of the selection on May 9. FMCS notified the arbitrator of his selection on May 29, three weeks prior to the four month deadline of June 19, 2014. At oral argument, Mr. Muller's counsel indicated that the hearing would likely have taken a few days, and the government conceded that the hearing could have been held within the three week period. Unlike the eight letters cited by the government, here the union succeeded in getting the grievance into the arbitrator's hands within the four-month limit. At that point, under the terms of Section 10.d.(4), the duty to proceed diligently to hearing was not the union's alone but was instead shared among the arbitrator, the agency, and the union.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the government conceded at argument, there is no evidence in the record of past practice germane to the situation here, where an arbitrator was timely selected and the case was in his hands comfortably before the four month deadline. There is accordingly no basis in past practice to support dismissal of Mr. Muller's claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Cited in <span class="Italic">Muller</span> was <span class="Italic">Cruz-Martinez v. DHS</span>, 410 F.3d 1366, 1367-72 (Fed. Cir. 2005), having no difficulty crediting an arbitrator's determination that past practice barred a grievance that was not actively prosecuted and declining to credit the appellant's contention that the contract precluded consideration of extrinsic evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 29, 2000, the agency issued a proposal to remove Cruz-Martinez from his position as a Special Agent for the agency for conduct unbecoming an officer of the service, improper admission of aliens, failure to follow the instructions of a supervisor, and for improper release of sensitive information. Cruz-Martinez responded in a written reply on November 8, 2000, and in an oral reply on November 30, 2000. Thereafter, the agency advised Cruz-Martinez by letter that he was being removed and that his removal was effective upon receipt of the letter. The letter also explained Cruz-Martinez's right to contest his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 12, 2001, the union notified the agency by letter that it was invoking arbitration as to the removal. Subsequently, on May 14, 2001, the agency advised the union that it wished to schedule arbitration proceedings, but the union did not respond. Over thirteen months after the union's letter invoking arbitration, on May 29, 2002, the agency informed the union by letter that "[s]ince the Union is the moving party in this matter and has not acted on this case in over a year, the case is closed in accordance with past practice." The letter further informed the union that it should contact the agency "with any concerns." Almost fifteen months later, on August 15, 2003, the union responded for the first time, demanding that the agency schedule the grievance for arbitration. The agency agreed to schedule the grievance, but maintained that the grievance was not arbitrable based on an established past practice that barred arbitrations that were not advanced for over a year.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the arbitrator, the union maintained that the grievance was arbitrable because the union had fulfilled all of its obligations by invoking arbitration in conformance with relevant contractual provisions. The union further argued that there was no language in the collective bargaining agreement directing an arbitrator to dismiss the grievance under these circumstances, noting that the agency's "closeout" policy had been an issue in previous separate arbitrations. Additionally, the union argued that it had challenged this policy in unfair labor charges filed with the Federal Labor Relations Authority ("FLRA") in 2000 and in 2001.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency, on the other hand, maintained that the grievance was not arbitrable because the grievance case had been closed in accordance with the agency's long-standing past practice of closing out cases where the union has taken no action to advance the grievance to arbitration in over a year. Conceding that the parties' collective bargaining agreement was silent on any requirement regarding advancing grievances after arbitration has been invoked, the agency maintained the existence and consistent application of a long-standing practice beginning in the mid-1980s, supporting its position of a clear past practice with past arbitration awards, unrebutted testimony, and past close-out letters averaging twenty-five to thirty per year. Acknowledging that the union did challenge the policy in 2000 and 2001 in its filing of two unfair labor practice charges with the FLRA, the agency noted that the FLRA dismissed the charges on the basis that the practice of closing out cases existed well before the filing of the charges and thus those charges before the FLRA were themselves untimely. The agency further relied on the union's conduct with respect to this case, pointing out that it took the union almost fifteen months to object or respond to the agency's notification that it was closing this case after one year of inaction<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After hearing the evidence and argument from both sides, the arbitrator held that the grievance was not arbitrable. First, the arbitrator found that the agency had clearly and consistently implemented a "closeout" policy since the mid-1980s, finding that the "[a]gency <span class="Italic">dismissed</span> such grievances for over <span class="Italic">17 years</span> while averaging between approximately 25 and 30 dismissals each year."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the arbitrator found that the union clearly had notice of the agency's close-out policy, noting that "[t]he evidence is also undisputed that the Agency regularly and routinely notified the local unions of its decisions dismissing these grievances under the closeout policy." Thus <span id="Page_5299"></span>the arbitrator concluded that "there is no doubt that the union and its various local unions in the Eastern District were aware of this policy."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, the arbitrator found that the union by its action or inaction over this period assented to the agency's close-out policy. Hence, the arbitrator rejected the union's argument that it objected to the agency's practice of dismissing cases that were abandoned for over a year, relying on the evidence regarding case processing since the mid-1980s, including this one. The arbitrator noted that "there was no evidence, in this record, other than counsel's statements that the union objected to the dismissal of this grievance until counsel's request/demand that the grievance be scheduled for arbitration--14 months after the case had been closed out." Additionally, the arbitrator relied on the fact that the union offered no evidence of "having successfully grieved <span class="Italic">this issue</span> to arbitration again <span class="Italic">weakened</span> the union's assertions that it has repeatedly objected to these dismissals." According to the arbitrator,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the union's consent is implied by the fact that essentially none of the local unions nor the union's Eastern Regional formally or successfully protested these actions through the grievance procedure; that the two protests to the FLRA were denied; and that, in this record, there was no demonstration that the union ever filed any other formal grievance specifically challenging the 'close-out' policy or that the policy was ever found to be in violation of the collective bargaining agreement, at least up until this grievance, some 17 years after the fact.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 16; <span class="Italic">see also id.</span> at 15 (finding that "the FLRA declined to issue complaint concluding that the close-out policy had been in existence for some time"). In sum, the arbitrator held that the weight of the evidence supported the agency's position regarding a binding past practice, and the union offered no substantial evidence to rebut it. This petition for review ensued.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have jurisdiction to review arbitration decisions regarding removal from federal service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Clear and long-standing practices of the parties--in other words, "past practices"--can establish terms of the agreement that are as binding as any specific written provision. As the Supreme Court has stated, "[t]he labor arbitrator's source of law is not confined to the express provisions of the contract, as the industrial common law--the practices of the industry and the shop--is equally a part of the collective bargaining agreement although not expressed in it." <span class="Italic">United Steelworkers of Am. v. Warrior &#x0026; Gulf Navigation Co.,</span> 363 U.S. 574, 581-82, 80 S. Ct. 1347, 4 L. Ed.2d 1409 (1960). Generally, factors relevant to a finding of a binding past practice are the duration and consistency of its application and the parties' acquiescence in it. Therefore, as a preliminary matter, we note that the arbitrator evaluated the duration of the agency's close-out policy and the union's acquiescence in this policy, and conclude that the arbitrator considered the correct criteria in analyzing whether a binding past practice of closing out cases after one year existed. We further conclude that the arbitrator's finding that each of the factors had been met was supported by substantial evidence. The arbitrator's reliance on the sixteen years of the union's acquiescence in the past practice is substantial evidence supporting the arbitrator's decision. Moreover, we find that the union's filing of two unfair labor charges with the FLRA, where those charges were dismissed, is not sufficient to preclude the arbitrator's finding of a binding past practice here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Cruz-Martinez's related argument that the plain meaning of the agreement precludes the consideration of extrinsic evidence to show a contrary binding past practice has been rejected by the Uniform Commercial Code and the Restatement (Second) of Contracts. U.C.C. &#x00A7; 2-202 cmt. 1(b) (1998) (rejecting the premise that there is a plain meaning, or a "meaning attributable to such language by rules of construction existing in the law rather than the meaning which arises out of the commercial context in which it was used"); Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 212, cmt. b (1981) (making admissible extrinsic evidence because "meaning can almost never be plain except in a context"); Carlton J. Snow, <span class="Italic">Contract Interpretation: The Plain Meaning Rule in Labor Arbitration,</span> 55 Fordham L.Rev. 681, 682 (1987). We find that the arbitrator was correct that, on the facts in this case, the collective bargaining agreement does not preclude the consideration of extrinsic evidence to show a binding past practice. This is particularly the case here where the past practice does not contradict any written provision in the collective bargaining agreement, but simply defines the course of dealing between the parties in an area where the contract is silent, i.e., the past practice fills a gap in the contract.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we also reject Cruz-Martinez's argument, which he appears to raise for the first time on appeal, that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment is implicated by a binding past practice that bars a claim as not arbitrable for untimeliness. Under Cruz-Martinez's reasoning, nothing short of a constitutional amendment could bar cases from being heard on the merits for untimeliness. The Supreme Court has stated, however, that "[t]he State may erect reasonable procedural requirements for triggering the right to an adjudication, be they statutes of limitation, or, in an appropriate case, filing fees. And the State certainly accords <span class="Italic">due</span> process when it terminates a claim for failure to comply with a reasonable procedural or evidentiary rule." <span class="Italic">Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co.,</span> 455 U.S. 422, 437, 102 S. Ct. 1148, 71 L. Ed.2d 265 (1982) (citations omitted). We thus find that the arbitrator's decision that a binding past practice bars this action from being arbitrable on the merits does not implicate the Due Process Clause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, less than three weeks before this case was scheduled to be heard on the briefs, Cruz-Martinez submitted a two-page "Supplement To Petitioner's Reply Brief." There, he argued for the first time that <span class="Italic">Gunn v. Veterans Administration Medical Center,</span> which held that abandonment requires a showing of (1) inexcusable delay on the part of the union and (2) prejudice to the union, applied to his case. 892 F.2d 1036, 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Accordingly, that case and the principles enumerated therein were not considered or discussed by either the arbitrator in his opinion or the government in its brief on appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if this argument were properly before this court, we would reject it. In <span class="Italic">Gunn,</span> the union timely invoked arbitration and a month later the parties met and selected an arbitrator for the grievance at hand. <span class="Italic">Gunn,</span> 892 F.2d at 1036. The arbitrator sent a letter to both parties, proposing several dates for a hearing. <span class="Italic">Gunn,</span> 892 F.2d at 1036-37. After not receiving any response from either party, the arbitrator contacted both parties six months later to determine the status of the case. <span class="Italic">Gunn,</span> 892 F.2d at 1037. Thereafter, the parties scheduled a hearing, but at the hearing the agency maintained for the first time that the grievance was not arbitrable for two reasons: (1) the union's delay in selecting an arbitrator was outside the time allowed by the collective bargaining agreement; and (2) the union's delay in scheduling a hearing date was sufficiently long to establish abandonment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The arbitrator agreed with the agency that the grievance was not arbitrable, but this court reversed and remanded the case. <span class="Italic">Gunn,</span> 892 F.2d at 1040. As to the first ground, this court found that the agency did not make a "<span class="Italic">timely</span> objection" and "the Union was clearly prejudiced by a surprise defense." <span class="Italic">Gunn,</span> 892 F.2d at 1039. This court held that "[o]n this record, we are compelled to conclude that, if the parties did not actually agree to the delay in selection, the government at least waived any objection." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> As to the second ground for finding nonarbitrability, this court held that there was not sufficient evidence to support the arbitrator's finding of unreasonable delay and prejudice, which the government agreed were necessary to sustain a defense of abandonment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast to the circumstances in <span class="Italic">Gunn,</span> the agency does not argue abandonment here, but instead relies on a binding past practice which it argues, and the arbitrator agreed, allowed the agency to close this case after one year of inaction. Thus, <span class="Italic">Gunn</span> does not apply in this case. Whether abandonment, which requires a finding of unreasonable delay and prejudice, can be shown as a separate and independent theory for barring this action is not before us. Instead, a past practice, like a regulation, statute, or contractual provision, is the binding restriction which bars this action from being arbitrable in this instance. Hence, because we affirm the arbitrator's finding of a binding past practice, we need not address the question dealt with in <span class="Italic">Gunn</span> of whether the union also abandoned the grievance. We thus conclude that even if the argument based on <span class="Italic">Gunn</span> were properly before us, it does not apply in this case.</p>
