<h4 class="h4" id="sec7-88"><span class="space">10.</span> Mandatory Penalty</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Early decisions implied that if a mandatory penalty was imposed by statute, the Board lacked mitigation authority. <span class="Italic">See Fields v. VA</span>, 21 MSPR 176 (1984) (vehicle misuse); <span class="Italic">Stronko v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 14 MSPR 596, 599 (1983) (AJ erred by converting a suspension for vehicle misuse to LWOP: "The penalty for unauthorized use of an official vehicle is a statutory minimum."); <span class="Italic">Schapansky v. FAA</span>, 13 MSPR 589, 595 (1982) (a violation of the federal no-strike law, 5 USC 7511(3), with a mandatory removal penalty) (citing <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dukes</span>, 8 MSPR 549 (1981) (Hatch Act), <span class="Italic">on reconsideration</span>, 16 MSPR 509, 511 (1983) (permitting voluntary dismissal), and <span class="Italic">Woody v. GSA</span>, 6 MSPR 486, 487, 489 &#x0026; n.2, 6 MSPB 410 (1981) (vehicle misuse in violation of 31 USC 638a(c)(2) [now 31 USC 1349(b)] )).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Schapansky</span>, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> involved a strike. The Board withheld decision on whether mitigation is foreclosed under 5 USC 7311(3), a statute that could be read to require removal; instead, the Board determined there were no factors suggesting that mitigation of removal was appropriate. The Board observed, <span id="Page_2402"></span>at footnote 10 of the Opinion that because of the nature and gravity of the offense, its direct effect on the ability of the agency to perform its mission, and the criminal sanctions and statutory prohibition against striking, the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors concerning length of service and quality of past performance would not be considered in a strike case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Woody</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, involved 31 USC 638(a)(c)(2) [now 31 USC 1349(b)], requiring at least a 30-day suspension for willful misuse of a government vehicle. The Board concluded that to the extent that the agency failed to comply with the statute in another case, the disparity was not a sufficient basis for violating the statutory requirement as to the appellant. The Board also noted, however, that it did not reach whether arbitrary enforcement of a statute violates the principle of like penalties for like offenses. The agency adequately rebutted the allegation of selective enforcement by showing the alleged inconsistencies "to be distinguishable from this case." In <span class="Italic">Semans v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 62 MSPR 502, 508 (1994), the appellant was suspended for 30 days for misuse of a government-owned vehicle (GOV). The charges were that the employee misused a GOV and also that he allowed another individual to misuse the vehicle. Only the second charge was sustained by the Board. But the Board declined to reassess the penalty: "[n]o lesser penalty than a one-month suspension is permitted for a violation of 31 USC 1349(b)."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If "there is doubt concerning the severity of the penalty prescribed by a statute, a milder penalty over a harsher one will be favored." <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. DeMeo</span>, 77 MSPR 158, 161-62 (1997) (considering the evolution of the penalty provisions of the Hatch Act; rejecting an expansive view of the penalty provisions of the statute); <span class="Italic">cf. Special Counsel v. Malone</span>, 84 MSPR 342, 346-60 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-27 (1999) (discussion concerning Hatch Act penalties). But the Board made clear that mandatory penalties are mandatory in <span class="Italic">Himmel v. DOJ</span>, 21 MSPR 149 (1984). The case may have made the point a little too zestfully for the taste of some appellants. The appellant, charged with misuse of vehicles, was suspended for 30 days. Before the case could be heard on appeal, the agency unilaterally reduced the penalty to 14 days, arguing that the Board lost jurisdiction, a proposition agreed to by the AJ. The appellant filed a PFR, arguing that the Board retained jurisdiction because it had jurisdiction to begin with and the agency could not unilaterally destroy that jurisdiction by anything less than complete rescission of the action. The Board agreed and remanded the case for adjudication on the merits. The AJ upheld the charge of vehicle misuse and reinstated the original 30-day mandatory penalty. On a second PFR, the Board determined that the AJ properly affirmed the original 30-day suspension imposed by the agency, increasing the length of the penalty imposed by the employing agency. The Board justified all this by saying that the statute does not provide for the exercise of discretion on the part of the agency with respect to the vehicle misuse statute. The Board rejected the appellant's argument that the Board's "review" of the penalty interfered with the exercise of discretion by the agency. This decision suggests that the appellant wound up in a bad position because the Board decided to do something more than review penalty determinations. <span class="Italic">But see Westbrook v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 77 MSPR 149, 155 (1997) (setting aside a second suspension suggested by an arbitrator who apparently concluded the seven-day suspension first issued by the agency for vehicle misuse had to be augmented by a separate 23-day suspension; two disciplinary actions could not be imposed for the same misconduct); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board hedged its bets by explaining that even if mandatory penalties can be mitigated by a showing of disparate discipline, the appellant did not demonstrate sufficient disparity to upset the result in his vehicle misuse case. <span class="Italic">Madrid v.

In its one nonprecedential pronouncement, the Federal Circuit concluded that MSPB had no authority to reduce a statutorily-mandated suspension.

<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 7371 requires individuals convicted of felonies to be removed from law enforcement positions. <span class="Italic">Cleaton v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7371(b), any LEO who is convicted of a felony shall be removed from employment as an LEO on the last day of the first applicable pay period following the conviction notice date. The term "conviction notice date" means the date on which an agency that employs an LEO has notice that the officer has been convicted of a felony that is entered by a federal or state court, regardless of whether that conviction is appealed or is subject to appeal. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7371(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee who is removed under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7371 is entitled to appeal his removal to the Board only with respect to whether: (1) he is an LEO; (2) he was convicted of a felony; or (3) the conviction was overturned on appeal. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7371(e)(2). The appellant did not dispute that his position was an LEO position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that on May 6, 2014, the Virginia Circuit Court of Brunswick County accepted the appellant's guilty plea and found him guilty of Possession of Marijuana with Intent to Distribute, thereby convicting him but deferring the imposition of a sentence. In its November 20, 2014 order, however, the Virginia Circuit Court of Brunswick County, in addressing charges of Possession of Marijuana with Intent to Distribute and Contempt, accepted a plea agreement and the appellant's plea of guilty, finding that there was sufficient evidence for a finding of guilt but withholding a finding of guilt for a period of 2 years. The circuit court placed the appellant on supervised probation during the 2-year period, holding that, if the appellant fully and successfully complied with certain terms and conditions, both charges would be dismissed. If the appellant failed to comply with any of the terms and conditions, "he will be found guilty as originally charged on both offenses and will be sentenced by the Court with no agreement." The circuit court did not, however, expressly address the prior conviction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that the appellant was convicted of a felony. There is also no indication that the circuit court has expressly vacated that conviction. Even assuming, however, that the prior conviction is no longer in effect, the reason that it is no longer in effect is because of a plea agreement that led to a new court order, not because it was overturned on appeal. Under the maxim of statutory interpretation expressio unius est exclusio alterius, when Congress has enumerated specific things to which a statute applies, it should not be assumed that other things that could have been listed were meant to be included; rather, the specific mention of certain things implies the exclusion of others. <span class="Italic">See Hart v. Department of Transportation</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 280, &#x00B6; 10 (2008). Here, therefore, the appellant may not contest on appeal the question of whether his conviction is no longer in effect based upon reasons other than that his conviction was overturned on appeal. <span class="Italic">See Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cleaton v. DOJ</span>, 839 F.3d 1126, 1128-31 (Fed. Cir. 2016), affirmed the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7371(b), "[a]ny law enforcement officer who is convicted of a felony shall be removed from employment as a law enforcement officer on the last day of the first applicable pay period following the conviction notice date." "Conviction notice date" is defined as the date on which the employing agency receives "notice that the officer has been convicted of a felony that is entered by a Federal or State court...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7371(a)(1). "[t]he removal is mandatory even if the conviction is not yet final because it has been appealed." <span class="Italic">Canava v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., 817 F.3d 1348, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2016). On appeal, Mr. Cleaton argues that the Board erred in sustaining his removal because he has not been "convicted" of a felony under Virginia law. Therefore, we must first determine whether state or federal law governs the meaning of "conviction" under &#x00A7; 7371(b), and second, whether Mr. Cleaton's plea constitutes a conviction for purposes of &#x00A7; 7371(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute itself does not specify whether state or federal law controls. Absent "plain indication to the contrary,...it is to be assumed when Congress enacts a statute that it does not intend to make its application dependent on state law." <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Nat. Gas Util. Dist</span>., 402 U.S. 600, 603 (1971). In <span class="Italic">Dickerson v. New Banner Institute, Inc</span>., the Supreme Court held that whether a person has been "convicted" for purposes of a federal statute that imposed firearms disabilities was "a question of federal, not state, law, despite the fact that the predicate offense and its punishment are defined by the law of the State." 460 U.S. 103, 112 (1983).[2] The Court reasoned that "[t]his makes for desirable national uniformity unaffected by varying state laws, procedures, and definitions of 'conviction.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The same logic applies here. Section 7371(b) requires immediate removal of a law enforcement officer convicted of a felony. Because federal agencies employ law enforcement officers in every state, it is desirable to have one uniform standard for "conviction" that is unaffected by varying state laws, procedures, and definitions. Therefore, whether one has been "convicted" within the language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7371(b) is necessarily a question of federal law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Dickerson</span>, the Supreme Court concluded that even if an individual's felony conviction is expunged, the individual may not maintain a federal license to manufacture or sell firearms under 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 922(g) because the individual had been convicted within the <span id="Page_2403"></span>meaning of the statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> 460 U.S. at 119-20. Congress overruled this outcome in the Firearms Owners' Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 99-308, &#x00A7; 101, 100 Stat. 449 (1986), by clarifying that a conviction expunged under state law would not prevent an individual from maintaining such a license. <span class="Italic">See Logan v. United States</span>, 552 U.S. 23, 27-28 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under federal law, "a guilty plea alone [can] constitute a conviction" in some circumstances. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 113 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Mulder v. McDonald</span>, 805 F.3d 1342, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2015) ("[A]ccording to its ordinary meaning, a 'conviction occurs when the accused is found--or <span class="Italic">pleads</span>--guilty.") (emphasis added). In <span class="Italic">Dickerson</span>, for example, the Court determined that a formal judgment was not necessary to establish that an individual had been convicted of a felony for purposes of the firearms disability statute because the purpose of the statute "was to keep firearms out of the hands of presumptively risky people" and there was "no reason whatsoever to suppose that Congress meant [conviction] to apply only to one against whom a formal judgment has been entered." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 112 n.6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, Congress's main concern in enacting &#x00A7; 7371(b) was prohibiting individuals that were guilty of felonies from serving the public as law enforcement officers. Before Congress enacted &#x00A7; 7371(b), an agency had discretion regarding the removal of a law enforcement officer that had been convicted of a felony. <span class="Italic">See</span> 146 <span class="small">Cong. Rec</span>. S2617 (daily ed. Apr. 12, 2000) (statement of Sen. Grassley). Section 7371(b)'s broad language reflects Congress's intent to remove that discretion in order to maintain the public's trust in the federal law enforcement system. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. ("Rank and file [law enforcement officers] ...feel--as I do--that law enforcement officers, who are convicted of felonies--should be removed from their posts immediately. They don't want their badges tarnished by having one of their own, who committed a felony, remain on the job."). Nothing in the legislative history or statutory text indicates that Congress was concerned with whether the officer in question actually receives or serves a prison sentence, or whether a state court formally enters a written adjudication of guilt.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we find that an individual can be "convicted" for purposes of &#x00A7; 7371(b) "once guilt has been established whether by plea or by verdict and nothing remains to be done except pass sentence." <span class="Italic">Dickerson</span>. 460 U.S. at 114. Further, when an individual is placed on probation, a court does not need to necessarily issue a formal adjudication of guilt because "one cannot be placed on probation if the court does not deem him to be guilty of a crime." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 113-14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Mr. Cleaton pled no contest to a single felony offense and on May 6, 2014, the court found him guilty of that felony. Because guilt was established on May 6, 2014, the Board correctly determined that Mr. Cleaton was convicted of a felony for purposes of &#x00A7; 7371(b) as of that date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Cleaton argues that even if he was convicted of a felony under the initial plea agreement, the initial plea agreement was withdrawn and therefore the conviction was nullified. However, the statute is clear that a removal may only be set aside "retroactively to the date on which the removal occurred, with back pay," if the conviction is overturned on appeal, which has not happened in this case. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7371(d); <span class="Italic">see id</span>. &#x00A7; 7371(e)(2) (stating that "[t]he employee may...contest or appeal a removal, but only with respect to whether--(A) the employee is a law enforcement officer; (B) the employee is convicted of a felony; or (C) the conviction was overturned on appeal."). And, although Virginia law permits a defendant to withdraw a plea agreement--which could potentially affect whether there was a conviction if the plea were withdrawn as a result--Mr. Cleaton failed to present any evidence establishing that he filed a motion to withdraw the plea or that the court actually set aside the initial plea agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> Va. Code Ann. &#x00A7; 19.2-296 (2016) ("A motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or <span class="Italic">nolo contendere</span> may be made only before sentence is imposed or imposition of a sentence is suspended."); <span class="Italic">Hall v. Commonwealth</span>, 515 S.E.2d 343, 346 (Va. App. 1999) ("Whether a defendant should be permitted to withdraw a guilty plea rests within the sound discretion of the trial court to be determined based on the facts and circumstances of each case."). Instead, Mr. Cleaton's initial plea agreement was simply revised to encompass an additional criminal offense. This conclusion is supported by the fact that Mr. Cleaton's plea from the initial plea agreement did not change in the revised plea agreement--he merely pled no contest to the additional charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is also not a situation where there is a plea agreement, and, hypothetically, a withdrawal of that agreement could affect whether there was a conviction. <span class="Italic">See Dickerson</span>, 460 U.S. at 113 n.7. Here, there was a judgment of guilt by the trial court based on the plea agreement. The theoretical possibility that Mr. Cleaton could have withdrawn his plea agreement cannot affect that the judgment was entered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress enacted this statute to require the immediate removal of a law enforcement officer convicted of a felony. <span class="Italic">See supra</span> at 6. It would be inconsistent with both the plain language of the statute and Congress's intent if we were to hold that, although Mr. Cleaton was convicted of a felony in May 2014 that has not been overturned on appeal, he must be reinstated and awarded back pay because the initial plea agreement was revised to include additional criminal activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Mr. Cleaton's conviction has not been overturned on appeal, for purposes of &#x00A7; 7371(b), he stands convicted of a felony as of May 6, 2014. Therefore, the Board did not err in sustaining his removal as of that date.</p>

In rejecting the employee's argument that the agency was required to consider mitigating factors prior to removing her, the court observed that "the only way [the Department of Health and Human Services] can 'ensure' that current employees meet the minimum standards of character is to remove employees who <span id="Page_2404"></span>fail to meet the standards."[12] <span class="Italic">Delong</span>, 264 F.3d at 1341; <span class="Italic">cf.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;The appellant argued, below, that such a mandatory penalty is not appropriate for a charge that is not based on misconduct. We do not find meaningful this characterization of the charged behavior.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Agency directives involving alcohol testing left no discretion but to remove a TSA employee, and the Board found no due process denial when the deciding official could not mitigate the penalty (although that official could have sought guidance on a lesser penalty), <span class="Italic">Lindsay v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was removed from his position as a Transportation Security Inspector--Explosives Detection Canine Handler with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) after he allegedly failed to provide an adequate breath sample for an alcohol test. He argues that his due process rights were violated because the deciding official lacked the authority, or believed that he lacked the authority, to mitigate the proposed removal regardless of any argument or evidence that the appellant presented in reply to the proposal notice....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's argument fails for two reasons. First, the provisions of Management Directive 1100.75-3 and the accompanying Handbook, rather than chapter 75 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code, govern disciplinary actions against TSA employees. <span class="Italic">Buelna v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 5 n.2 (2014); <span class="Italic">see</span> 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 114(n), 40122(g)(2).

However, the Handbook provides that the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors do not apply to certain offenses for which removal is required, including the "[r]efusal to submit to TSA-ordered drug or alcohol testing." Accordingly, we find that if the deciding official had declined to consider any mitigating factors in this case, he did so in accordance with the law.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The Handbook provides for an exception to the mandatory removal policy. The deciding official testified to his awareness of the exception.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, we find that the deciding official's testimony indicates he understood that if he had concluded that the appellant should not have been removed due to some exculpatory or mitigating reason, he would have sent such information to his supervisors to make a determination on what to do. We find that his testimony is consistent with the scope of his authority under the agency's rules for a mandatory removal offense, such as refusal to submit to alcohol testing, and that the appellant received a meaningful opportunity to invoke all of the discretion afforded by agency rules. Although due process requires that "a deciding official must possess authority to take or recommend action, due process does not require 'unfettered discretion to take any action he or she believes is appropriate' or require 'consider[ation of] alternatives that are prohibited, impracticable, or outside of management's purview.'" <span class="Italic">Calhoun v.

Had the deciding official believed that he had no discretion in the matter, there would have been little reason for him to have even considered such mitigating circumstances. Accordingly, we find that the appellant failed to prove that the deciding official lacked, or believed that he lacked, the authority to take or recommend any action other than removal in his case. <span class="Italic">See Davis v.
