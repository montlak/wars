<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-212"><span class="space">1.</span> Fully Recovered Within a Year</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 CFR 353.301 (2022), as to an employee's application for restoration when the employee fully recovered within one year from the onset of eligibility for workers compensation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Fully recovered within 1 year.</span> An employee who fully recovers from a compensable injury within 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation began (or from the time compensable disability recurs if the recurrence begins after the employee resumes regular full-time employment with the United States), is entitled to be restored immediately and unconditionally to his or her former position or an equivalent one. Although these restoration rights are agencywide, the employee's basic entitlement is to the former position or equivalent in the local commuting area the employee left. If a suitable vacancy does not exist, the employee is entitled to displace an employee occupying a continuing position under temporary appointment or tenure group III. If there is no such position in the local commuting area, the agency must offer the employee a position (as described above) in another location. This paragraph also applies when an injured employee accepts a lower-grade position in lieu of separation and subsequently fully recovers. A fully recovered employee is expected to return to work immediately upon the cessation of compensation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Myrick v. USPS</span>, 21 MSPR 79, 80-81 (1984), summarized the rights of employees who fully recover:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant filed a petition for appeal with the New York Regional Office claiming that he was fully recovered from his compensable injury and should have been restored to his former position as a City Carrier. In the initial decision, the presiding official found that the agency failed to accord appellant "priority consideration" for restoration to his former City Carrier position as required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.307 even though that <span id="Page_4463"></span>position was available and appellant was entitled to it. He therefore found that appellant had been improperly restored, reversed the agency action, and ordered the agency to offer appellant his former position as City Carrier.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The right to immediate and unconditional return to an employee's former or an equivalent position is limited to those employees who have fully recovered from their compensable injury within one year. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.302(b). When an employee's full recovery takes longer than one year, he is entitled to priority consideration to his former or an equivalent position. A fully recovered employee is defined as one "whose compensation payments have been terminated on the basis that the employee is able to perform all the duties of the position he left or an equivalent one." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102(e). <span class="Italic">Cousins v. Department of the Navy</span>, 7 MSPB 607 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the Board finds that appellant cannot be considered a fully recovered employee. The evidence of record shows that at the time he applied for restoration to his former position, appellant was still receiving compensation from the Office of Workers' Compensation Program (OWCP). Further, the agency physician, following an orthopedic examination, found appellant unfit for duty as a City Carrier and even appellant's treating physician, W. J. Walsh, M.D., found appellant to be medically restricted with regard to lifting and carrying weights, two pervasive and unavoidable aspects of the City Carrier position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although not fully recovered, appellant was a partially recovered employee. However, injured employees who partially recover from compensable injuries may only appeal to this Board from an agency decision to deny him restoration. 5 C.F.R, &#x00A7; I53.401(a)(3); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. United States Postal Service,</span> 6 MSPR 209 (1981). Appellant has not been denied restoration, and may therefore not appeal to the Board from his restoration to a position different than his former position.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The Board notes that under appropriate circumstances, it might find a partial restoration to be so unreasonable as to be an effective denial of restoration and thus, within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. United States Postal Systems,</span> 722 F.2d 745 (9th Cir. 1983 unpublished); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. United States Postal Service</span>, 8 MSPB 459 (1981). In this case, however, appellant's claim does not arguably present such a situation so the Board need not consider its jurisdiction in such an instance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The regulatory scheme for employees who fully recover following a compensable injury after a year from eligibility for compensation was further explained by <span class="Italic">Welter v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 73 MSPR 414, 419-20 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant bears the burden of proving that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal of the agency's alleged denial of his restoration rights. <span class="Italic">See Cox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 817 F.2d 100, 101 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">McCloud v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 508, 511 (1996). In this appeal, the appellant claims that the agency improperly restored him to the position he formerly held.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency's obligation to restore an individual following a compensable injury is set forth at 5 C.F.R. part 353. <span class="Italic">See Welber v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 98, 103 n.4 (1994). Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b) (1996), an employee who was separated because of a compensable injury and whose "full recovery" takes longer than 1 year from the date he was eligible for compensation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">is entitled to priority consideration, agencywide, for restoration to the position he or she left or an equivalent one provided he or she applies for reappointment within 30 days of the cessation of compensation. Priority consideration is accorded by entering the individual on the agency's reemployment priority list for the competitive service.... If the individual cannot be placed in the former commuting area, he or she is entitled to priority consideration for an equivalent position elsewhere in the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, both 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.301(b) and 353.304(b) (1996) note that 5 C.F.R. part 330 provides agencies with the necessary procedures to follow when they restore competitive service employees like the appellant. Part 330 requires an agency to place a competitive service employee who has fully recovered from a compensable injury after more than 1 year on a reemployment priority list, to give him priority consideration over certain other job applicants for his former position or an equivalent one for which he qualifies, provided he requests reemployment within 30 calendar days after his compensation ceases. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.201(a), 330.202(a)(2), 330.204(a), 330.205, 330.206(b)(1) (1996). If the employee believes that his reemployment priority rights have been violated because of the employment of another person who otherwise could not have been appointed properly, he may appeal to the Board on that basis. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.209 (1996); <span class="Italic">Stuck v. Department of the Navy</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 153, 156 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant reasserts that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal from the agency's alleged improper restoration. We disagree. The Office of Personnel Management's restoration-to-duty regulations do not afford an employee, such as the appellant, whose full recovery from a compensable injury takes longer than 1 year from the date he was eligible for compensation the right to appeal an alleged improper restoration to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.301(b), line353.304(b) (1996); <span class="Italic">see also Tisdale v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 390, 394-96 (1990). Consequently, even though the administrative judge erred by applying the 1995 restoration regulations, she properly concluded that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's appeal of an alleged improper restoration.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Welter, supra,</span> 419 n.3, noted as to excepted service personnel: "Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.301(b) and 353.304 (1996), individuals in the excepted service have restoration appeal rights to the Board as provided in 5 C.F.R. part 302."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Steinmetz v. USPS</span>, 106 MSPR 277, 280-82 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-12, 2007 MSPB 178 (2007), outlined the jurisdictional requirements for an appeal asserting that the appellant recovered within a year of a compensable injury and should have been restored to his or her position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have reopened this case, however, to clarify the standard for establishing Board jurisdiction over an appeal in which an appellant alleges that the agency denied him restoration under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(a) as an employee who fully recovered within 1 year of sustaining a compensable injury. The Board has jurisdiction over such an appeal if the appellant makes non-frivolous allegations that: (1) He is an employee of an executive branch agency; (2) he suffered a compensable injury; (3) he fully recovered from the compensable injury within 1 year from the date his eligibility for compensation began; (4) the agency failed to restore him or improperly restored him; and (5) if he was separated from his position prior to the alleged failure to restore or improper restoration, his separation was from a position without time limitation and substantially related to the compensable injury. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Frye v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 695, &#x00B6; 9 (2006); <span class="Italic">Burgess v. Department of the Interior,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 134, &#x00B6; 8 (2003); <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Department of Transportation,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. 18, 19 (1993).[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Some Board decisions have suggested that, in appeals involving 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(a), an employee must "show" these elements to establish Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Kravitz v. Department of the Navy,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6; 8 (2005); <span class="Italic">Denny,</span> 43 M.S.P.R. at 127. The Board has otherwise indicated, however, that appeals involving restoration rights--whether as employees fully recovered within 1 year, fully recovered after 1 year, or partially recovered--should be treated similarly and require only non-frivolous allegations to establish jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Welby v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 16 n.1 (2006); <span class="Italic">Norwood v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 494, &#x00B6; 7 (2005); <span class="Italic">Chen v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 12 (2004). Thus, to the extent that Board decisions such as <span class="Italic">Kravitz</span> and <span class="Italic">Denny</span> have required appellants to prove these elements to establish jurisdiction, they are overruled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant satisfied the first element of this standard because he was an employee of an executive branch agency who is entitled to appeal an alleged denial of restoration to the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Norwood v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 494, &#x00B6; 4 (2005). He satisfied the second element because, as noted above, OWCP determined that he was entitled to benefits because he suffered a compensable injury. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Frye,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 695, &#x00B6; 9 (a compensable injury is defined as one that is accepted by OWCP as job-related and for which medical monetary benefits are payable from the Employees' Compensation Fund). The fifth element is not implicated in this case because the appellant was not separated until 2003. Thus, the issue is whether the appellant satisfied the third and fourth elements by making non-frivolous allegations that he "fully recovered" from his compensable injury within 1 year and that the agency did not restore him to the same position or to an equivalent position. For an individual to be considered "fully recovered," OWCP payments must have been terminated on the basis that the individual is able to perform all of the duties he left or the duties of an equivalent position. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102; <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Nixon v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 6 (2006). The requirement that OWCP first find an individual to be fully recovered is a prerequisite to a Board finding that an individual is fully recovered. <span class="Italic">Kravitz v. Department of the Navy,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6; 9 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant also satisfied the third and fourth elements of the jurisdictional standard. The appellant noted that he became eligible for OWCP benefits effective August 24, 1998, based on a compensable injury; that the agency offered him an OWCP-approved rehabilitation position on May 18, 1999; and that he accepted the position on July 22, 1999. He further noted, however, that before he reported to his new assignment, the agency placed him on administrative leave effective July 24, 1999, and, on August 25, 1999, withdrew the rehabilitation job offer. The record supports his allegations. Moreover, the appellant alleged that he fully recovered within 1 year because his compensation payments ceased during the administrative leave period on the basis that he was <span id="Page_4464"></span>able to perform the duties of the rehabilitation position, which was equivalent to the one he held prior to his work-related injury. Thus, we find that the appellant made non-frivolous allegations that he fully recovered from his compensable injury within 1 year and that the agency did not restore him to the same position or to an equivalent position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find on the merits, however, that the agency did not violate the appellant's restoration rights because the appellant failed to show that OWCP considered him to be fully recovered when he was offered the rehabilitation job in 1999. OWCP's May 24, 1999 letter concerning the rehabilitation position indicated that it did not consider the appellant to be fully recovered. OWCP stated that the rehabilitation position was "suitable to [the appellant's] work capabilities," that the "duties and physical limitations of the offered position" were described in the attached letter, and that the appellant would be "paid compensation based on the difference (if any) between the pay of the offered position and the pay of [his] position on the date of injury." Significantly, OWCP quoted 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8106(c)(2), the statute governing partial disability. Further, in his June 15, 1999 letter to OWCP, the appellant stated that he agreed with Psychologist John Andre that he could not return to the agency under any circumstances. In his June 21, 1999 letter to OWCP, Andre reiterated that the appellant should not work for the agency, stating that he had "a high potential for violent acting-out." Again, in a June 22, 1999, letter, the appellant informed the agency that he agreed with Andre that he should not return to work at the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant admitted and the record shows that OWCP restarted his wage-loss compensation payments after his administrative leave ended on August 27, 1999. The AJ acknowledged the appellant's assertion that the cessation of his compensation payments for approximately 1 month showed that he was fully recovered. She credited testimony from agency Senior Injury Compensation Manager Karen Fernandez, however, that it is common for DOL to suspend benefits temporarily when an employee is in a temporary pay status; that, until DOL issues a notice that compensation will cease based on a full recovery, the employee is not considered recovered; and that a rehabilitation position is not offered to a fully recovered employee. The AJ found that the appellant presented no OWCP decision letter or document to show that the temporary termination of his compensation in July 1999 was based on his full recovery. Moreover, the record suggests the reason that the agency withdrew the rehabilitation job offer and OWCP continued the appellant's compensation benefits. In the August 5, 1999 report of the appellant's July 27 and 28, 1999 fitness-for-duty examination, the examiners stated their opinion that the appellant was "a potential risk to the safety and health of others, specifically his supervisor and other post office employees." OWCP's September 22, 1999 letter then outlined the appellant's entitlement to compensation benefits, indicating that it did not consider the appellant to be then fully recovered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given this evidence, we find that the appellant failed to show that he was entitled to immediate restoration as an employee who fully recovered from a compensable injury within 1 year. <span class="Italic">Cf. Nixon,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 9 (the Board will extrapolate from the language actually used by OWCP to terminate benefits to determine whether an appellant meets the "fully recovered" definition of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102); <span class="Italic">Fisher v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 94, &#x00B6; 10 n.4 (2005) (although OWCP terminated the appellant's benefits, it did not further conclude that she could perform the duties of her position or an equivalent position), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 184 Fed. Appx. 969 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Accordingly, we conclude that the agency did not violate the appellant's restoration rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Young v. USPS</span>, 115 MSPR 424, 430 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14, 2010 MSPB 222 (2010), examined when compensation is deemed to begin so as to determine when the year-long recovery period permitted for unconditional restoration begins and ends:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant wrongly assumes that because she was not eligible to receive OWCP wage loss benefits until November 22, 2008, that that was the date upon which she became eligible for compensation for purposes of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.304. However, under the relevant statutory authority, 5 U.S.C., chapter 81, subchapter I, "compensation" is defined in relevant part to include "the money allowance payable to an employee or his dependents and any other benefits paid for from the Employees' Compensation Fund." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8101(12); <span class="Italic">see Bartol v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 106, 108-09 (1995). Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8103, the medical expenses of an employee injured while in the performance of duty are to be paid out of the Employees' Compensation Fund. <span class="Italic">Bartol,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. at 109. Further, the Board has found that "the payment of medical expenses related to such an injury out of the Employees' Compensation Fund is sufficient to make the injury a compensable injury within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151," triggering an employee's restoration rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Importantly, the OWCP provides that "[p]ayment of medical benefits is available for all treatment necessary due to a work-related condition." 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.500. Thus, compensation includes the payment of medical benefits, which is available for all treatment necessary for a work-related condition accepted by OWCP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, OWCP accepted the appellant's claim for an April 5, 2006 work-related injury on May 10, 2006. OWCP's acceptance of the appellant's claim made her eligible to be compensated for all treatment made necessary by that injury. <span class="Italic">See</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.500. Therefore, she became eligible for compensation for purposes of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304 as of April 5, 2006, i.e. the date of her work-related injury. <span class="Italic">Cf. Mendenhall v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 M.S.P.R. 430, 437 (1997) (finding that the appellant became eligible for compensation on the date of injury while compensation benefits commenced two months later). The appellant fully recovered in October 2009, approximately two and a half years after she became eligible for compensation. Therefore, the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that she fully recovered from her compensable injury within 1 year from the date she became eligible for compensation and failed to establish jurisdiction over her restoration appeal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(a).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cox v. ITC</span>, 6 MSPR 336, 337-38 (1981), suggested that there was a rule of reason, but no regulatory or statutory limit, on the time for a recovered employee to request restoration to duty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant was determined to be disabled by the Department of Labor from January 19, 1979, until November 5, 1979. Appellant was not officially notified by the Department, however, until May, 1980, that she had a compensable injury, at which time she filed an application for restoration to duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is the agency's contention that appellant's application for restoration was not timely filed as a matter of either law or equity and, therefore, such application should be denied. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute applicable to these facts requires the employee seeking restoration to have overcome the disability in question within one year of the date compensation commences. In this case appellant's compensable injury existed from January 19, 1979, until November 5, 1979. Therefore, appellant has clearly met the applicable one year requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, respondent argues that there exists, in addition to the one year recovery provision, a one year requirement for the employee's request for reinstatement. Because appellant did not request reinstatement within one year of the commencement of compensation, respondent argues she has failed to request restoration in a timely fashion. We agree with the presiding official that no such requirement exists.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A clear reading of the statute and regulations in question reveals that no such time limit exists. In fact, as noted by the presiding official, the regulations impose a duty on agencies to safeguard the rights of employees absent because of compensable injury.[2] It is well established that where statutory language and objective are clear, the implication of situations not covered by the clear language of the statute, and contrary to the objective of the clear language, is not permissible.[3] The statute in question here provides an obligation on the agency for restoration when the recovery from the employee's disability occurs within a year.[4] In light of this clear statement of intent, a one year time limit for filing a request for restoration cannot be implied.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. 353.105; 5 C.F.R. 353.201. <span class="Italic">See also</span> F.P.M. Chapter 353, Sub. Chapter 3-1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">United States v. Rice,</span> 327 U.S. 740 (1947).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The Board does not suggest, however, that there is no time limit within which the fully recovered employee must make application for restoration. Clearly, the employee must act within a reasonable time. Some help in defining what is reasonable can be found by comparing 5 C.F.R. 353.307 (which contains a 30 day time limit for employees who fully recover after 1 year). The issue need not be decided here, though, because there is no question but that the appellant acted diligently once she learned her injury had been found compensable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has argued in the alternative, that even if a time limit cannot be found in law, it must be found in equity. On these facts, we are persuaded that, were such an analysis employed, the equities would be with appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Official notice from the Department of Labor that appellant's injury was compensable was received by her in May 1980, at the same time she was informed that she had recovered, for purposes of worker's compensation, from the injury. We agree with the finding of the presiding official that it would have been unreasonable for appellant to have been expected to request restoration to duty until receipt of that official notification. Once she was so notified, her request was timely made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board is not unaware that it may be burdensome for an agency to have to make a position available for the exercise of restoration rights when delay by the Department of Labor prevented the employee from applying for restoration within the year. Since the employee is in no way responsible for the delay, however, it cannot serve to defeat the right of restoration.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_4465"></span>As to what constitutes partial recovery as opposed to full recovery, the issue is one of economics, <span class="Italic">Carter v. USPS</span>, 27 MSPR 252, 254 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the presiding official correctly determined that the Board does not have jurisdiction to entertain claims of improper restoration by employees who have partially recovered from compensable injuries after more than one year, she was in error in determining that the present record evidence in the case establishes that appellant was partially recovered rather than fully recovered. The Board made it clear in <span class="Italic">Montgomery v. USPS,</span> 16 M.S.P.R. 578 (1983), that the term "fully recovered" for purposes of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.306 and 353.307 is a "term of art." An individual whose Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) temporary total or temporary partial disability payments have been terminated is deemed "fully recovered." Such benefits are terminated when an individual regains his or her earning capacity.</p>
