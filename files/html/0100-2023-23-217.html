<p class="Body-Text">Many settlements contain a confidentiality clause as well as a clause allowing disclosure of the settlement, or the events leading to it, to those who need to know its contents to implement the agreement; the clause may be broader, for example, allowing disclosure for any lawful purpose. Although the Board will enforce the confidentiality clause, it will also honor the exception against a claim that the confidentiality clause was breached.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An unemployment compensation case set the stage for another dispute over the confidentiality or nondisclosure provisions of a settlement agreement involving an indefinite suspension, <span class="Italic">Felch v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 112 MSPR 145, 146-52 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-16, 2009 MSPB 160 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The relevant portions of the settlement agreement provide:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[The agency will] cancel and purge from [the appellant's] Official Personnel Folder (OPF) the Notification of Personnel Action (SF-50) form that placed him on indefinite suspension.... In addition, the Notice of Proposed Removal dated 23 August 2007 will be rescinded.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Agency will designate Marlene Kumro, Human Resources Specialist...as the agency Human Resources point of contact to whom [the appellant] may direct prospective employers for information pertaining to his employment with [the agency].... The agency's point of contact may release to prospective employers the following information:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">i.&#x2003;Dates of employment with [the agency]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">ii.&#x2003;Job title and grade levels</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">iii.&#x2003;Salary</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">iv.&#x2003;His performance evaluations were all satisfactory</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">...[The appellant agrees to r]esign or retire....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The parties agree that they will not disclose or discuss the terms of this settlement with other agency employees except those who may have a need to know in the course of their official duties or as otherwise required by law or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Agreement will be made part of the Merit Systems Protection Board record for enforcement purposes by that agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...The parties further agree that they shall not cause this settlement, its terms, and underlying facts surrounding the instant appeal to be publicized in any newspaper, magazine, book, motion picture, television or radio program, or on the Internet.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant subsequently filed a petition for enforcement, alleging that the agency breached the settlement agreement by: (1) Failing to purge his OPF of references to the suspension, and (2) providing the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board (UIB) with information about his suspension. As evidence of the alleged breach, the appellant submitted a Notice of Determination from the UIB, addressed to the agency, which stated, "You provided information regarding the eligibility of the [appellant].... You suspended [the appellant]. After considering the available information, the Department finds the reason for suspension does not meet the definition of misconduct connected with the work."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency responded, arguing that, because the UIB is not a prospective employer, the settlement agreement does not restrict the information that the agency may provide to the UIB. The agency further argued that, even if the UIB were a prospective employer, the appellant was to blame for the release of the suspension information because he failed to direct the UIB to the point of contact designated in the settlement agreement. The agency stated that "the information was provided by [Defense Civilian Personnel Management Service] /AC in Arlington, Virginia and not the agreed upon point of contact." The agency subsequently tempered this statement, asserting that the appellant provided no evidence as to who provided the information to the UIB, and suggesting that the UIB might have obtained the information prior to the settlement agreement in response to the appellant's request for unemployment benefits during the time he was actually suspended. The agency also asserted that it had revised the appellant's OPF in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement. In support of its assertion, the agency submitted an SF-50 documenting the appellant's voluntary retirement for the purposes of obtaining retirement benefits.</p>

In construing the terms of a written settlement agreement, the words of the agreement itself are of paramount importance. <span class="Italic">Saunders v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 75 M.S.P.R. 225, 229 (1997). In construing a settlement agreement, the Board examines the four corners of the agreement to determine the parties' intent. <span class="Italic">Wells v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 228, &#x00B6; 7 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Construing the terms of the settlement agreement in accordance with precedent of the Board and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, we find that the administrative judge erred in finding that the settlement agreement did not restrict what information the agency could disclose to the UIB. The Board and the Federal Circuit have construed settlement agreements that provide for expungement of adverse action-related documents from an OPF as requiring agency communications with third parties to reflect what the OPF, as amended, shows. E.g., <span class="Italic">Conant v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 255 F.3d 1371, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Principe v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 66, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 9 (2005). In addition, even where a settlement agreement only provides for expungement of adverse action-related documents from an appellant's OPF, the Federal Circuit has construed such a provision to provide for expungement of those documents from all "personnel records that are officially kept." <span class="Italic">E.g., King v. Department of the Navy,</span> 130 F.3d 1031, 1033-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997). The key concern in such cases is that the Board "see to it that the parties receive that for which they bargained." <span class="Italic">Principe,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 66, &#x00B6; 8 (quoting <span class="Italic">Pagan,</span> 170 F.3d at 1372).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement at issue here provides that the agency will "cancel and purge" from the appellant's OPF the SF-50 documenting his indefinite suspension, and that the notice of proposed removal would be rescinded. We find that this provision is materially similar to those at issue in <span class="Italic">Conant</span> and <span class="Italic">Principe</span>, which effectively required the agencies in those cases to expunge adverse action-related documents from the appellants' entire professional records and not to disclose adverse action-related information to third parties, even though the agreements did not explicitly set forth those requirements. The settlement agreement in <span class="Italic">Conant</span> provided that the agency would rescind the SF-50 documenting the appellant's removal and issue a new SF-50 indicating that the appellant "resigned for personal reasons." <span class="Italic">Conant,</span> 255 F.3d at 1373. The court construed this provision as, "in effect," a promise by the agency to erase "'removal' and all reasons for such removal from [the appellant's] professional record with the agency," leaving the SF-50 stating that the <span id="Page_5127"></span>appellant resigned for personal reasons as the only legal document recording the end of her employment with the agency. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1376.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement in <span class="Italic">Principe</span> provided that the agency would rescind the appellant's removal and issue a PS-50 indicating that she had resigned. <span class="Italic">Principe,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 66, &#x00B6; 2. The Board construed this provision as a promise by the agency to destroy all removal-related documents, erase "removal" and all reasons for such removal from the appellant's professional record with the agency, and leave the PS-50 indicating her resignation as the only remaining document recording the end of her employment with the agency. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 9. The Board explained its construction of the settlement agreement based on its understanding of <span class="Italic">Conant</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The settlement terms here are materially similar to those in <span class="Italic">Conant</span>, in requiring the agency to "rescind" the removal and to "issue" a new PS-50 reflecting the appellant's resignation, without explicitly requiring the agency to clean, expunge, purge, or delete removal-related documents from her personnel file or explicitly precluding disclosure of such documents to third parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement at issue here is also similar to the agreements in <span class="Italic">Conant</span> and <span class="Italic">Principe</span> inasmuch as it contains additional terms providing further support for our conclusion that it prohibits the agency from disclosing adverse action-related information to third parties. In <span class="Italic">Conant</span>, the Federal Circuit considered language in the settlement agreement that the agency would use its "best efforts" to "effectuate" the appellant's disability retirement as further support for its conclusion that the agreement precluded the agency from disclosing removal-related information to the Office of Personnel Management. <span class="Italic">Conant,</span> 255 F.3d at 1376. In <span class="Italic">Principe,</span> the Board considered language in the settlement agreement that the parties were to keep the terms and conditions of the agreement "confidential" as lending further support for its finding that the agency was precluded from disclosing removal-related information to the Social Security Administration. <span class="Italic">Principe,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 66, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 10. Likewise, we find that the additional settlement terms here, i.e. that the parties would not publish the terms or surrounding circumstances of the agreement or discuss its terms with other agency employees, lend further support to our construction of this agreement as prohibiting the agency from disclosing adverse action-related information to the UIB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A major benefit that the appellant obtained in exchange for his voluntary retirement and withdrawal of his appeal was the elimination of adverse action-related documents from his professional record so that third parties may not come to know of them or their attendant circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development,</span> 124 F.3d 1439, 1442 (Fed. Cir. 1997). If his employment records continue to contain information relating to the suspension or notice of proposed removal, the appellant will not have received the benefit of his bargain. <span class="Italic">See King,</span> 130 F.3d at 1034 (it was "highly unlikely that the parties bargained for the purging of only local personnel files, while [files in other locations] retain[ed] the undesired information"). Therefore, in order to be in compliance with the settlement agreement, the agency must eliminate all references to the suspension and notice of proposed removal from the appellant's professional record with the agency. <span class="Italic">See Conant,</span> 255 F.3d at 1376; <span class="Italic">Principe,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 66, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement also prohibits the agency from disclosing any information about these matters to third parties, including the UIB. Although the settlement agreement does not explicitly address the agency's obligations with regard to its communication with third parties, the agency's obligations under the expungement provision cannot be fulfilled if it discloses to any third party prospective employer or otherwise any information about the appellant's rescinded suspension or notice of proposed removal. <span class="Italic">See Pagan,</span> 170 F.3d at 1371-72 (although the settlement agreement did not address the type of references the agency was required to provide, the agency was required to provide references as if the appellant had the clean record that it had agreed to provide); <span class="Italic">Principe,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 66, &#x00B6; 9 (the agreement implicitly prohibited the agency from disclosing removal-related documents to third parties); <span class="Italic">see also Torres,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 12 (the settlement agreement, which required the expungement of all removal-related documents from the appellant's OPF, implicitly required that the agency refrain from disclosing to third parties any information about the appellant's removal; if the agency were to expunge the documents from the appellant's record but still communicate with third parties about the removal, the appellant would not receive the benefit of his bargain).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The UIB has undoubtedly become aware of the appellant's suspension, as evidenced by the notice that it sent to the agency addressing the matter. If the agency informed the UIB of the appellant's suspension while the settlement agreement was in effect, then the agency materially breached the settlement agreement, unless it was required by law or regulation to disclose that information to the UIB. <span class="Italic">See Conant,</span> 255 F.3d at 1377 (the agency's disclosure to the Office of Personnel Management of removal-related information constituted a material breach); <span class="Italic">Torres,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 12 (the agency's disclosure to a background investigator of removal-related information would constitute a material breach); <span class="Italic">Principe</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 66, &#x00B6; 10 (the agency's disclosure to the Social Security Administration or other third parties of removal-related documents would constitute a material breach). However, because he did not find it necessary to reach the issue, the administrative judge made no findings with regard to when or from what source the UIB became aware of the appellant's suspension, and we are unable to make any such determination on the existing record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We must therefore remand the appeal for further adjudication. On remand, the administrative judge shall adjudicate the merits of the petition for enforcement, making findings as to whether: (1) The agency has purged all references to the suspension and notice of proposed removal from the appellant's professional record; and (2) whether the agency disclosed any information regarding these matters to the UIB or any other third party after the September 13, 2007 effective date of the settlement agreement. If the administrative judge determines that the agency disclosed information about these matters to the UIB or any other third party after the effective date of the settlement agreement, the administrative judge shall make findings as to whether the agency was required by law or regulation to disclose that information. The administrative judge shall direct the parties to submit evidence and argument on the issue, and he shall conduct a hearing if there is a genuine issue of fact material to the agency's alleged breach of the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Torres,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 13.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) and the Board have construed a settlement agreement that calls for rescission of a removal and issuance of an SF-50 showing resignation to also contain implied provisions for expungement of removal-related documents from the employee's OPF and non-disclosure to third parties--in other words, a "clean record" settlement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Conant v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 255 F.3d 1371, 1374, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Pagan v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 170 F.3d 1368, 1371-72 (Fed. Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">Torres,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11; <span class="Italic">Principe v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 66, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9 (2005). A clean record means that the agency must return one's personnel record "to its former state" prior to the effected adverse action. <span class="Italic">Torres,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 10 (citing <span class="Italic">Pagan,</span> 170 F.3d at 1370).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Paragraphs 4 and 10 of the settlement agreement in this appeal are materially similar to the clean record provisions of the settlement agreement in <span class="Italic">Torres,</span> which expressly mandated that the agency replace the SF-50 showing removal with an SF-50 showing resignation, and expunge all removal-related documents from the OPF.<span class="Italic"> Torres,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 3. The appellant has not presented any evidence on review or in his PFE to establish that the agency failed to expunge all removal-related documents from his OPF. He merely submitted copies of the removal-related documents provided by the agency to OWCP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To demonstrate its compliance with the clean record provisions, the agency submitted a sworn declaration from Ms. Anderson averring that she instructed the Health Resource Center (HRC), which maintains the agency's OPFs, to expunge all removal-related documents from the appellant's OPF, including the proposal and decision notices, and to replace the information with an SF-50 reflecting the appellant's resignation; to the best of her knowledge, these documents were removed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Galloway v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 311, &#x00B6; 10 (2008) (to show compliance, the agency must present an affidavit or other evidence to support its claim). This evidence in itself is sufficient to show compliance with the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Allen v. Department of Defense,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 275, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 5-6 (2008) (the Board found that the agency showed its compliance with the clean record settlement by submitting affidavits from agency officials that verified there were no longer any references to the employee's positive drug test or the rescinded removal action in any of the agency's files where the agency had agreed to remove such references from all its records). On review, the agency also submits a July 17, 2009 sworn declaration of Assistant Human Resources Officer Jennifer LuttJohann of HRC, which confirms that Ms. Anderson's directives were completed, and avers that "there is no other documentation in the Appellant's OPF that shows he was disciplined or removed." Thus, we find that the agency expunged all of the removal-related documents from the appellant's OPF in compliance with the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5128"></span><span class="Italic">The agency was not required to expunge documents from agency-maintained files other than the appellant's OPF.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the PFE, the agency admitted that it provided information regarding the appellant's removal to OWCP, but stated that the information "was not information contained within Appellant's OPF." On review, the appellant contends that the settlement agreement is ambiguous concerning the files from which the agency was required to expunge the removal-related documents, and that there was no meeting of the minds regarding the agency's maintenance of "secret" files containing the removal-related documents. However, the plain language of the settlement agreement only specifies that the agency was required to "remove any and all [removal-related information] from the appellant's [OPF]," and does not contemplate expungement from all agency-maintained files. We analogize this provision to the clean record provision in <span class="Italic">Musick v. Department of Energy,</span> 339 F.3d 1365, 1367, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2003), which provided that the agency would remove "all documentation relating to and culminating in Mr. Musick's removal...from his position from his [OPF]," including all documentation proposing to remove Mr. Musick from his position. The Federal Circuit found that "the only reasonable reading of the [provision] is that the agency only obligated itself to remove pertinent material from Mr. Musick's OPF." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1369. Applying <span class="Italic">Musick,</span> we discern no ambiguity in Paragraph 10 of the settlement agreement, which specifically identifies the appellant's OPF as the sole location from which the agency was required to expunge the removal-related documents.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the AJ should have applied <span class="Italic">King v. Department of the Navy,</span> 130 F.3d 1031, 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1997), in which the Federal Circuit found that the agency should have expunged removal-related documents from OPFs in the hands of other agencies, although the settlement agreement did not expressly provide for it. However, the Federal Circuit set forth the following explanation in <span class="Italic">Musick</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We stated [in <span class="Italic">King</span>] that, in entering into a settlement agreement like Ms. King's, 'the employee's goal, to which the agency has agreed, is to eliminate th[e] information [related to the adverse action] as it may affect future employment with the government or elsewhere'... We concluded that '[b]y correcting only those files in the hands of the Navy, and by retaining references in official government personnel files to the action that was subsequently revoked, Petitioner was denied the benefit of her agreement.'... The critical difference between <span class="Italic">King</span> and this case is that Mr. Musick has not alleged that records were maintained outside the agency in violation of the settlement agreement. For that reason, <span class="Italic">King</span> does not help Mr. Musick.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Musick,</span> 339 F.3d at 1369-70; <span class="Italic">see King,</span> 130 F.3d at 1033-34. Similarly, <span class="Italic">King</span> does not help the appellant in this case because the appellant does not contend that other OPFs were maintained by other agencies. Furthermore, the Federal Circuit did not hold that the agency should have expunged all removal-related documents in all files it only limited expungement to documents in the personnel files. <span class="Italic">See King,</span> 130 F.3d at 1033-34.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the AJ that the plain language of the settlement agreement only mandates that the agency expunge removal-related documents from the appellant's OPF. Because the clean record provisions do not require the agency to expunge documents from other agency-maintained files, the agency's maintenance of removal-related documents in files other than the appellant's OPF does not breach the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The agency did not breach the settlement agreement in disclosing removal-related information to OWCP.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">1.&#x2003;The general rule precludes disclosure of information regarding rescinded adverse actions to third parties when the agency has agreed to provide the employee with a clean record.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his PFE and on review, the appellant argues that the agency breached the settlement agreement by disclosing removal-related documents to OWCP in response to OWCP's March 6, 2009 inquiry. It is undisputed that Ms. Anderson, the Human Resources Officer, provided OWCP with copies of the proposal and decision notices, and submitted additional information regarding the appellant's removal. In Paragraphs 4, 10 and 12 of the settlement agreement, the agency essentially agreed to provide the appellant with a clean record. <span class="Italic">See Pagan,</span> 170 F.3d at 1371; <span class="Italic">Torres,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where the agency has contractually agreed to provide an employee with a clean record, the Federal Circuit and the Board have consistently held that the clean record agreement contains an implied provision that precludes the agency's disclosure of information regarding the rescinded adverse action to third parties. <span class="Italic">Conant,</span> 255 F.3d at 1376; <span class="Italic">Pagan,</span> 170 F.3d at 1371-72; <span class="Italic">Felch v. Department of the Navy,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 145, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12, 14 (2009); <span class="Italic">Torres,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12; <span class="Italic">Principe,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 66, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-10. According to the Federal Circuit, the agency is required to "destroy [removal-related documents], erasing 'removal' and all reasons for such a removal from [the employee's] professional record with the agency," and to issue a new SF-50 of resignation to replace the removal, so "that the only legal document recording the end of [his] employment with the agency would henceforth be the SF-50 stating [he] resigned for personal reasons." <span class="Italic">Conant,</span> 255 F.3d at 1376; <span class="Italic">see Principe,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 66, &#x00B6; 9. Under this rationale, it is seemingly impossible to disclose information about an adverse action that has been rescinded without reneging on the bargain. We therefore interpret <span class="Italic">Conant</span> as creating the general rule that if an agency discloses information regarding the rescinded adverse action to any third party, then the agency has materially breached the clean record settlement. <span class="Italic">See Conant,</span> 255 F.3d at 1376; <span class="Italic">Principe</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 66, &#x00B6; 9. Any reservations that we might entertain about <span class="Italic">Conant</span> are beside the point since we are bound by our reviewing court's decisions. <span class="Italic">Principe,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 66, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If we based our breach analysis solely on the clean record language set forth in Paragraphs 4 and 10, and the agency's admitted disclosure of removal-related information to OWCP, then under <span class="Italic">Conant,</span> the agency would have materially breached the clean record settlement agreement. However, as set forth below, the presence of other pertinent contract provisions changes the essence of the contract, and thereby distinguishes this case from <span class="Italic">Conant.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">2.&#x2003;The settlement agreement contains an explicit exception to the general rule precluding disclosure of removal-related information to third parties.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the general principles of settlement construction, the words of the agreement itself are of paramount importance. <span class="Italic">See Felch,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 145, &#x00B6; 8. In construing the terms of a settlement agreement, the Board examines the four corners of the agreement to determine the parties' intent. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The contract provisions must be read "as part of an organic whole, according reasonable meaning to all of the contract terms" to identify and give weight to the "spirit" or essence of the contract as intended by the parties. <span class="Italic">Lockheed Martin IR Imaging Systems, Inc. v. West,</span> 108 F.3d 319, 322 (Fed. Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">LAI Services, Inc. v. Gates,</span> 573 F.3d 1306, 1314 (Fed.

Department of Commerce,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 523, &#x00B6; 8 (2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under <span class="Italic">Conant,</span> we must read the general clean record provisions of the settlement agreement as broadly prohibiting the agency from disclosing removal-related information to <span class="Italic">any</span> third party. However, the parties included language that was not contained in the <span class="Italic">Conant</span> agreement, which expressly provides that the agency's Human Resources Officer "will truthfully respond regarding those matters required by law" if contacted for any employment inquiry or reference. This provision may reasonably be interpreted as permitting disclosure of removal-related information to a third party as required by law. We therefore find <span class="Italic">Conant</span> distinguishable, and find that the plain language of this settlement agreement provides an exception to the general rule regarding disclosures to third parties. Under <span class="Italic">Lockheed</span> and <span class="Italic">Coker,</span> the clean record provisions in this agreement should not be read in isolation but read as a part of the organic whole. We therefore examine the four corners of the agreement to determine the parties' intent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">3.&#x2003;The parties did not intend to preclude disclosure of removal-related information to OWCP.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">a.&#x2003;The parties permitted third party disclosures made as required by law.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By including express language that unequivocally permits the Human Resources Officer to truthfully respond regarding those matters required by law, it appears that the parties contemplated possible scenarios that would necessitate disclosure of the removal-related information to third parties. Thus, although the general clean record provisions implicitly mandate agency non-disclosure of removal-related information to all third parties, the parties have carved out an exception. The Board analyzed a similar issue in <span class="Italic">Felch,</span> where the parties included clean record provisions, and carved out an exception to a general confidentiality provision for "those who may have a need to know...or as otherwise required by law or regulation." <span class="Italic">Felch,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 145, &#x00B6; 2. When reading the contract as a whole, the Board held that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[i]f the agency informed the [Unemployment Insurance Board (UIB)] of the appellant's suspension while the settlement agreement was in effect, then the agency materially breached the settlement agreement, <span class="Italic">unless it was required by law or regulation to disclose that information to the UIB</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Felch,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 145, &#x00B6; 15 (emphasis added). The exception to the general non-disclosure provision in <span class="Italic">Felch</span> is materially similar to the one in this settlement agreement. In <span class="Italic">Felch,</span> the Board remanded the case to the regional office for the AJ to determine whether the agency had in fact informed the UIB of the rescinded adverse action, and whether the agency was required by law or regulation to disclose the information to the UIB; consequently, the Board did not make a breach determination on review. <span class="Italic">Felch,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 145, &#x00B6; 16. However, the <span class="Italic">Felch</span> decision strongly suggests that if the parties contemplated and expressly permitted agency <span id="Page_5129"></span>disclosure of the settled adverse action to a third party as required by law, then the agency's disclosure under these circumstances would not constitute a breach of the settlement agreement. Based on <span class="Italic">Felch</span> and the parties' inclusion of express language that permits the agency to respond as required by law, we find that the parties intended to permit disclosure of removal-related information as required by law.</p>

The regulation at 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.117, provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;An employer who has reason to disagree with any aspect of the claimant's report <span class="Italic">shall</span> submit a statement to OWCP that specifically describes the factual allegation or argument with which it disagrees and provide evidence or argument to support its position. The employer may include supporting documents as witness statements, medical reports or records, or any other relevant information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;...If the employer does not submit a written explanation to support the disagreement, OWCP may accept the claimant's report of injury as established.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(emphasis added). Therefore, an employer is required to disclose to OWCP information that challenges an employee's claim of entitlement to FECA benefits. Furthermore, 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.16 provides that it is a crime to file a false or fraudulent claim or statement in connection with a FECA claim and cites 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1001, 1920, and 1922. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 22.3. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1001, anyone in any matter within the jurisdiction of any branch of the federal government who "knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals, or covers up" a material fact, or makes any materially false statement or representation "shall be fined...[and/or] imprisoned." The statute at 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1920 specifically addresses false statements made to obtain FECA benefits and provides that "[w]hoever knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals, or covers up a material fact," or makes a false statement or representation shall be guilty of perjury and shall be fined and/or imprisoned. Additionally, 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1922 provides that whoever is charged with making the immediate superior's report for FECA compensation, as specified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8120, and who "willfully fails, neglects, or refuses to make any of the reports, or knowingly files a false report," shall be fined and/or imprisoned. We also note that the language below the signature block of the OWCP Notice of Occupational Disease and Claim for Compensation completed by the appellant broadly warns that concealment of facts that enables an employee to obtain compensation under FECA is subject to civil and criminal penalties. Thus, we find that an employer has a legal obligation to provide OWCP with truthful information that could plausibly support or refute the employee's claim for FECA benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To read the settlement agreement as prohibiting the agency from disclosing removal-related information to OWCP would contravene the rationale behind these statutory and regulatory provisions; in effect it would prevent OWCP from performing its duties and obligations by impeding OWCP's ability to obtain accurate information that it has deemed necessary to investigate and analyze the appellant's claim for FECA benefits. OWCP was not a party to the settlement agreement, and thus, it would be unreasonable to interpret the contract executed by the agency and the appellant in a manner that would dictate OWCP's obligations. <span class="Italic">Cf. Parker v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-6, 15-21 (2003) (the employing agency and Mr. Parker entered a settlement agreement in which the agency agreed to award Mr. Parker the requisite service credit in order to make him eligible to receive a retirement annuity; however, OPM denied Mr. Parker's application; the Board held that a settlement agreement may not impose duties or obligations on a third party without that party's agreement; thus, because OPM was not a party to the settlement agreement, it was under no obligation to find that Mr. Parker had the requisite service credit to be entitled to a retirement annuity), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 91 Fed. Appx. 660 (Fed. Cir. 2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency disagreed with the appellant's claimed entitlement to FECA benefits, as set forth in its January 27, 2009 letter to OWCP. Consequently, the Human Resources Officer was required under 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1920, 1922, 1001; 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 10.16, 22.3, and 10.117 to provide OWCP with accurate information regarding the appellant's performance and conduct issues in response to OWCP's March 6, 2009 request for such information. Because OWCP crafted a broad request for information concerning the appellant's performance and conduct issues, it is unclear what documentation would sufficiently respond to the request. As OWCP's benefit determinations are "final and conclusive for all purposes and with respect to all questions of law and fact," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8128(b)(1), and may not be second guessed by a reviewing court or by the Board, it logically follows that OWCP is the best judge to determine the relevancy and sufficiency of the information necessary to make its benefits determinations. Consequently, neither the Board, nor an employing agency, is in a position to narrow OWCP's broad request. Although it is possible that the Human Resources Officer could have provided OWCP with information regarding the appellant's repeated unauthorized absences, failure to follow leave-request procedures, and failure to follow instructions, without submitting copies of the proposal and removal notices, we believe that the disclosures did not exceed the bounds of the settlement agreement based upon OWCP's broad request and the mandates of OWCP-related statutes and regulations. Therefore, we believe that the agency truthfully responded, as required by law, to OWCP's request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">c.&#x2003;The parties did not bargain for non-disclosure to OWCP.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another way of looking at the issue is to examine whether the parties "receive[d] that for which they bargained." <span class="Italic">Torres,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">see Pagan,</span> 170 F.3d at 1371-72; <span class="Italic">Felch,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 145, &#x00B6; 13. By including terms that specifically require the agency to provide potential employers with agreed-upon materials that are exhibits to the settlement agreement, the parties clearly bargained for non-disclosure to potential employers, except as required by law. <span class="Italic">See Conant,</span> 255 F.3d at 1376; <span class="Italic">Pagan,</span> 170 F.3d at 1371; <span class="Italic">Torres,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12. However, the parties did not include any express language that places an affirmative obligation on the agency to facilitate and advance any potential claims with OWCP. <span class="Italic">Cf. Lutz v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 485 F.3d 1377, 1379, 1381-82 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (the agency had an express obligation to facilitate the appellant's disability retirement claim before OPM, and thus, it was one of the benefits bargained for by the appellant in voluntarily retiring; thus, the essence of the contract was to prevent prejudice to the appellant's disability proceedings); <span class="Italic">Conant,</span> 255 F.3d at 1374, 1376 (the agency violated its agreement to use its "best efforts" to effectuate the appellant's disability retirement application when it took affirmative steps to prejudice the process).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record that at the time of executing the agreement, the agency foresaw that the appellant might file a claim for FECA benefits with OWCP approximately a year and three months later. The parties executed the settlement agreement in August 2007. It was only after the appellant received OPM's December 23, 2008 letter approving his disability retirement claim, that he filed his December 30, 2008 claim with OWCP for FECA benefits. Thus, although the agency's disclosure to OWCP may compromise his claim for FECA benefits, there is no evidence that the parties bargained for non-disclosure to OWCP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we note that the agency must reimburse OWCP for its FECA expenditures on the appellant's behalf. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 105-836 at 56-57; FECA Q&#x0026;A; <a href="http://www.dol.gov/esa/owcp/dfec/about.htm">http://www.dol.gov/esa/owcp/dfec/about.htm</a>. OWCP may award FECA benefits that cover lost wages and lost wage-earning capacity or permanent physical disability, and such benefits are paid out of the Employees' Compensation Fund. H.R. Rep. No. 105-826 at 56 (1998); OWCP, Questions and Answers about the FECA (FECA Q&#x0026;A), <a href="http://www.dol.gov/esa/owcp/dfec/reglibrary.html">http://www.dol.gov/esa/owcp/dfec/reglibrary.html</a>. Depending on whether OWCP determines that the injured employee is totally or partially disabled and entitled to FECA benefits, the employee may be entitled to compensation as great as 75 percent of the employee's basic monthly pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 10.400-10.406. Because the agency ultimately would be responsible for reimbursing OWCP for its FECA expenditures, and because it does not appear that the agency had notice at the time the parties executed the settlement agreement that the appellant might file an OWCP claim, we find that for the Board to construe the agreement as prohibiting the agency from disclosing removal-related information to OWCP in order to disagree with the appellant's claimed entitlement to benefits would deprive the agency of the benefit of its bargain. To so interpret the agreement would create a potentially open-ended financial liability on the part of the agency and for the benefit of the appellant that, from the plain language of the agreement, was clearly not contemplated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing reasons, we find that the parties did not intend to require non-disclosure of removal-related information to OWCP. We therefore find that the agency did not breach the settlement agreement, and that the AJ properly denied the PFE.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_5130"></span>On appeal, the Board's result was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Allen v. VA</span>, 420 Fed. Appx. 980, 987-88 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Allen additionally argues that the Board erred in concluding that the agency's disclosure of removal-related information to the OWCP did not breach the settlement agreement. Of particular relevance to this issue is the following provision of the agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[The agency will] change [Mr. Allen's] removal to voluntary resignation, and make the following changes:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">a.&#x2003;SF 50-B Notification of Personnel Action. Removal, dated May 26, 2007, will be canceled and removed, and VA will substitute a form SF 50-B Notification of Personnel Action [indicating Mr. Allen's resignation].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">b.&#x2003;SF-50-B Notification of Personnel Action. Suspension, dated August 28, 2006, will be cancelled [sic] and removed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found, and the agency does not dispute, that, under <span class="Italic">Conant v. Office of Personnel Mgmt.</span>, 255 F.3d 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001), it was required to read the above provision as "broadly prohibiting the agency from disclosing removal-related information to <span class="Italic">any</span> third party." <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2009 MSPB 238 &#x00B6; 18 (emphasis in original); <span class="Italic">see</span> Resp. Inf. Br. at 13-14 ("Generally, a settlement agreement with a clean record provision implicitly requires agency communications with third parties to reflect the amended OPF."). The Board also noted that, were its breach analysis based solely on that provision and "the agency's admitted disclosure of removal-related information to OWCP, then under <span class="Italic">Conant</span>, the agency would have materially breached" the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 16. Based on its reading of a separate provision of the settlement agreement, however, the Board distinguished <span class="Italic">Conant</span> and concluded that the parties intended to permit the agency to disclose removal-related information whenever such disclosure is "required by law." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Paragraph 12, on which the Board relied, provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he Agency agrees that Human Resource Officer Jeanette Anderson, or her successor(s)..., if contacted for any employment inquiry or reference for the Appellant will provide the information contained in Exhibit "C," and will truthfully respond regarding those matters required by law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on this language, the Board concluded that the parties intended to carve out an exception to any implied promise of non-disclosure where disclosure of removal-related documents is required by law. <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2009 MSPB 238 &#x00B6; 19. ("Based on <span class="Italic">Felch</span> and the parties' inclusion of express language that permits the agency to respond as required by law, we find that the parties intended to permit disclosure of removal-related information as required by law."). We agree.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Even without such a provision in the agreement, it would appear to be contrary to public policy for a government agency to attempt to contract out of an obligation required by federal law. <span class="Italic">See Fomby-Denson v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 247 F.3d 1366, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (holding that a contract barring an agency from reporting criminal behavior would be against public policy).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only reasonable reading of the paragraph is that it creates an exception to any implied promise of non-disclosure as to any matter for which the law requires truthful responses. Consequently, the breach inquiry turns on whether the agency was required by law to disclose the removal-related information Ms. Anderson submitted to OWCP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board observed, several statutes and regulations impose disclosure obligations on agencies in connection with an OWCP inquiry. Notably, 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.16, which specifically addresses statements made in connection with FECA claims, cites a number of statutes that make it a crime to "file a false statement" or "conceal a material fact" in connection with a FECA claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.16 (citing 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 287, 1001, 1920, and 1922); 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1001 ("[w]hoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of [any] branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully...falsifies, conceals, or covers up...a material fact" or "makes any materially false...statement or representation...shall be fined [or] imprisoned."); 18 U.S.C. 1922 ("Whoever [is] charged with the responsibility for making the reports of the immediate superior [for FECA benefits, and] willfully fails, neglects, or refuses to make any of the reports, or knowingly files a false report...shall be fined...or imprisoned....") Thus, in connection with its response to OWCP's inquiry, the agency was required by law to disclose material facts and to respond truthfully. The question which remains is whether Ms. Anderson needed to disclose removal-related information to respond truthfully or to avoid concealing a material fact.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As part of its examination of Mr. Allen's workers' compensation claim, OWCP specifically asked the agency to describe any performance or conduct issues:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Was this employee generally able to perform required duties in accordance with expectations? Were there any performance or conduct problems? Please describe.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response, Ms. Anderson explained that, "[a]s a result of Mr. Allen's failure to comply with the provisions of [his] leave restriction, Mr. Allen was charged with over 100 hours of absences without leave (AWOL) for 15 separate incidents of AWOL, and 12 incidents of failure to follow Instructions, as well as failure to participate in an OIG investigation." She further noted that, based on these issues, Mr. Allen's supervisor proposed his removal, and the agency decided to terminate Mr. Allen as of May 21, 2007.<span class="Italic"></span> She also submitted copies of Mr. Allen's Proposed Removal and Removal Decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the nature of OWCP's request, we cannot say that the Board's finding that the agency was required by law to disclose removal-related information was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. Information regarding Mr. Allen's removal was material to OWCP's inquiry because, among other things, it spoke to the gravity of Mr. Allen's conduct problems--i.e., it showed that Mr. Allen's issues were sufficiently serious to warrant termination. Consequently, we find no error in the Board's conclusion that the agency did not breach the agreement when it disclosed removal-related information to OWCP.</p>
