<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-298"><span class="space">c.</span> Failure to Comply With Judge's Order</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An appeal was properly dismissed after the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant failed to follow procedures outlined in the Board's acknowledgment order directing settlement discussions and stipulations of uncontested facts. The appellant failed to participate in a prehearing conference, and the appellant did not respond to an order requiring him to state whether he wished to proceed with the appeal and warning him that the hearing would be canceled and the appeal dismissed if he did not respond. The appellant's argument that he was having difficulty locating counsel was insufficient to warrant reinstatement of the case. Nor was the Board persuaded by the argument that the appellant had a disabling condition; the appellant did not show that the disability prevented him from complying with the AJ's orders. <span class="Italic">Murdock v. GPO</span>, 38 MSPR 297, 299 (1988). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Cioce v. Dept. of Army</span>, 69 MSPR 564, 567 (1996) (dismissal for the failure to prosecute was unwarranted when incarceration prevented the appellant from obtaining his mail and participating in prehearing proceedings; remanded for development of evidence concerning the period of incarceration). Although an appeal may be dismissed for failure to follow an AJ's orders, the misconduct should be serious and likely should be repeated. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-09-304.html#sec2-301">Inadvertent or Isolated Failure to Obey Judge's Orders</a>," and decisions mentioned in this chapter about the Board's "single failure" approach to sanctions.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An AJ may dismiss an appeal for failure to prosecute if the appellant repeatedly fails to file a witness list and proposed exhibits. Dismissal of a case with prejudice is among the sanctions an AJ may impose against a party for failure to prosecute an appeal. The penalty will be upheld for continued failure to respond to an AJ's orders, especially if the failure relates to basic, preliminary matters. <span class="Italic">Harrison v. FAA</span>, 15 MSPR 400, 402 (1983) (dismissal for failure to attend the prehearing conference, to submit a witness list and proposed exhibits, and to respond to a show cause order); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">White v. SSA</span>, 76 MSPR 303, 307 (1997) (dismissing appeal of an ALJ appellant who failed to respond to the AJ's order directing the appellant to address jurisdictional issues: "[A]n appellant or petitioner who appears before the Board ignores the Board's orders at his own peril"; "Litigants before the Board are obligated to respect the Board, its procedures, and the orders of its judges.")<span class="Italic">. But see</span> <span class="Italic">Hart v. USDA</span>, 81 MSPR 329, 333 &#x00B6; 8 (1999) (exclusion of the appellant's exhibits was unjustified as a sanction when the appellant may not have received the AJ's prehearing order by the time the appellant was ordered to serve the exhibits); <span class="Italic">Brumley v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 46 MSPR 666, 680 (1991) ("because the administrative judge lacked authority to issue the order in question, we find that imposing sanctions against the appellant for refusing to obey the improper order to be unwarranted").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appeal was dismissed when the appellant repeatedly failed to comply with prehearing orders. Although extensions were granted because of an injury to appellant's counsel, the appellant had the ultimate responsibility for remaining informed of the status of his appeal and prosecuting it. The appellant could have sought a dismissal without prejudice to refiling. The AJ warned him that his appeal might be dismissed for continued failure to comply with the AJ's orders. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Benton v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 47 MSPR 200, 203 (1991); <span class="Italic">Clower v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 15 MSPR 473, 475 (1983) (dismissal for the failure to prosecute the appeal was warranted when the appellant failed to comply with three orders from the AJ, he failed to appear at the prehearing conference and at the hearing, and he failed to show cause why his appeal should not be dismissed for lack of prosecution). Another appeal was dismissed for failure to comply with multiple orders, some mailed and apparently at least available through e-filing access, despite the appellant's assertion that his financial condition was so bad that he did not have access to a computer, <span class="Italic">Turner v. USPS</span>, 123 MSPR 640, 644-65 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13, 15-16, 2016 MSPB 35 (2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">He states that he did not respond to the administrative judge's orders because of a lack of access to a telephone or computer due to financial difficulties.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">When an appellant's repeated failure to respond to multiple Board orders reflects a failure to exercise basic due diligence, the imposition of the sanction of dismissal for failure to prosecute has been found appropriate. <span class="Italic">Williams v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 9 (2011); <span class="Italic">Heckman</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 210, &#x00B6; 16; <span class="Italic">Murdock v. Government Printing Office</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 297, 299 (1988); <span class="Italic">see Ahlberg</span>, 804 F.2d at 1242-43. For example, in <span class="Italic">Murdock</span>, the sanction of dismissal of the appeal with prejudice was appropriate because the appellant completely failed to respond to or comply with any of the Board's orders. <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 9 (citing <span class="Italic">Murdock</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. at 298-99). We analogize the facts of the appellant's appeals here to those in cases like <span class="Italic">Murdock</span> where the appellant failed to exercise basic due diligence. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge did not abuse her discretion in imposing the sanction of dismissal with prejudice in this case. The record reflects that the appellant failed to appear for the scheduled status conferences on February 11, 2016, in each of these appeals and failed to respond to the administrative judge's orders to execute a release for his workers' compensation records. Indeed, with the exception of his registering as an e-filer in each appeal on April 26, 2016, there is no evidence that the appellant took any steps to pursue his appeals from the time that he failed to appear for the status conferences until he filed his petitions for review. The record also reflects that the appellant was warned repeatedly that his failure to participate in the appeal could result in the dismissal of the appeal for failure to prosecute. While we appreciate the appellant's apparent financial difficulties, those difficulties do not explain why he did not use other inexpensive means, such as mailing a paper response to the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">Cf. Johnson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 257, 259 (1994) (finding that financial difficulties do not constitute good cause for a waiver of a filing deadline), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 56 F.3d 81 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Based on the foregoing circumstances, <span id="Page_1285"></span>we agree with the administrative judge's finding that the appellant failed to exercise due diligence in prosecuting his appeal, and we affirm the dismissal with prejudice for failure to prosecute.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McDavis v. MSPB</span>, 464 Fed. Appx. 864, 865 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP), affirmed dismissal of an appeal for failure to prosecute when the appellant did not respond to prehearing requirements, despite some problems with receipt of e-filings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While an extreme sanction, <span class="Italic">Williamson v. Met Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 334 F.3d 1058, 1063 (Fed. Cir. 2003), Board regulations expressly authorize an AJ to dismiss an appeal with prejudice if the appellant fails to prosecute the appeal, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43(b). We have recognized that failure to respond to the Board's orders may justify dismissal. <span class="Italic">See Ahlberg v. Dep't of Health and Human Servs</span>., 804 F.2d 1238, 1242-43 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Moreover, sanctions are within the discretion of the Board and will not be reversed unless there is a clear and harmful abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">See Baker v. Dep't of Health and Human Servs</span>., 912 F.2d 1448, 1457 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (citing <span class="Italic">Curtin v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 846 F.2d 1373, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1988)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, McDavis's argues that the Board decision should be reversed because she did not timely receive orders from the Board. We disagree. The record indicates that McDavis provided the Board's e-Appeal online system with an incorrect email address as well as a post office box address. McDavis's submissions on appeal indicate that she was aware that the Board was providing notice of new documents on e-Appeal online to the wrong email address by December 28, 2010, weeks prior to the first telephonic prehearing conference. These submissions are consistent with the Board's finding that, over one month prior to the dismissal of her case, an SSA representative informed McDavis that case-related notices were likely being sent to the wrong email address, that McDavis should update her email address with the Board's e-Appeal online system, and that she could still access all case-related materials through e-Appeal online. McDavis was aware that she was responsible for accessing e-Appeal online to inform herself about her case. Before the Board, McDavis only provided evidence that she had difficulty accessing the site on one occasion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At bottom, McDavis failed to comply with multiple Board orders. The AJ provided her three opportunities to participate in the proceedings and twice warned her that her failure to participate would be grounds to dismiss her case for failure to prosecute. While we are mindful of the severity of the sanction, on this record, we cannot hold it that it was an abuse of discretion to dismiss McDavis's appeal for failure to prosecute.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Buendia v. SSA</span>, AT-0752-13-0483-I-1 (NP 6/12/2014) (affirming dismissal of e-filed appeal when the appellant failed to respond to the AJ's orders; the appellant asserted, but the Board did not address, the appellant's statement that she was unaware of a status conference because she could afford neither Internet nor cell phone service).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another appellant's appeal was dismissed when she failed to respond to agency motions and to orders from the AJ, <span class="Italic">Brown v. VA,</span> CH-0752-10-0371-I-1 (NP 10/15/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that an administrative judge may impose the sanction of dismissing an appeal with prejudice if a party fails to prosecute or defend an appeal and, absent a showing of abuse of discretion, the Board will not reverse an administrative judge's finding in this regard. <span class="Italic">Holland v. Department of Labor</span>,<span class="Italic"></span> 108 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 9 (2008). We have carefully considered the appellant's conduct in this appeal and find that the administrative judge did not abuse his discretion in dismissing the appeal for failure to prosecute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Heckman v. Department of the Interior</span>,<span class="Italic"></span> 106 M.S.P.R. 210, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-16 (2007), the Board held that the administrative judge did not abuse her discretion by dismissing the appellant's whistleblower claim and a claim brought under Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act for failure to prosecute. Although the Board in <span class="Italic">Heckman</span> cautioned that an administrative judge should not dismiss an appeal for failure to prosecute based on an appellant's failure to comply with a single order, it found that dismissal of the appellant's claims was appropriate in that case because the appellant had failed to comply with multiple Board orders. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at &#x00B6; 16.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The situation in <span class="Italic">Heckman</span> is similar to the facts of the instant case where the appellant did not participate in her appeal for at least 2 months and failed to respond to several agency motions and orders by the administrative judge. Specifically, the agency twice requested dismissal of this appeal for failure to prosecute, and the administrative judge repeatedly warned the appellant that her failure to respond to, and comply with, the Board's orders and directives to appear for her deposition and to explain her non-appearance could result in dismissal of her appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts of the instant case are distinguishable from cases such as <span class="Italic">Wiggins v. Department of the Air Force</span>,<span class="Italic"></span> 113 M.S.P.R. 443 (2010), where the Board held that the administrative judge's dismissal for failure to prosecute was an abuse of discretion because the appellant's actions did not exhibit bad faith or evidence an intent to abandon his appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>,<span class="Italic"></span> &#x00B6; 12. Specifically, in <span class="Italic">Wiggins</span> the Board noted that, although the appellant did not comply with the administrative judge's order regarding discovery and was unavailable for a telephonic prehearing conference, the appellant had participated in an earlier telephonic status conference, asserted affirmative defenses, and filed three timely responses to the administrative judge's order on affirmative defenses. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Board found that the appellant's responses to the administrative judge's order, "while duplicative and incomplete, represented a good faith effort by this <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant to comply with the order." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Finally, the Board stressed that, although the administrative judge's frustration with the appellant was understandable, the administrative judge never specifically warned the appellant that he intended to dismiss the appeal for lack of prosecution. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>,<span class="Italic"></span> &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see no basis for disturbing the administrative judge's findings that the appellant's actions here demonstrated an intent to abandon her appeal. This is not a case in which a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant submitted duplicative or incomplete responses to the administrative judge's orders or participated intermittently in the proceedings below. Rather, there is no indication that the appellant participated in any aspect of this appeal after the April 15, 2010 conference in which the administrative judge informed her of the importance of cooperating with the agency's request to take her discovery deposition. Nor is it a case in which the appellant was unaware that her appeal could be dismissed for lack of prosecution.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit sustained dismissal for failure to prosecute, <span class="Italic">Cain v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1990 NP No. 90-3356):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB can dismiss an appeal if the appellant fails to prosecute that appeal. 5 CFR 1201.43(b); <span class="Italic">Ahlberg v. DHHS</span>, 804 F.2d 1238, 1242 (Fed. Cir. 1986)....&#8197;Cain's failure to attend the prehearing conference, to contact the MSPB upon discovering that failure, and to respond to the Order to Show Cause supported the MSPB's dismissal for failure to prosecute.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another dismissal for failure to prosecute an appeal was sustained by the reviewing court, <span class="Italic">Richardson v. MSPB</span>, 281 Fed. Appx. 985, 986-87 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal statute limits this court's review of Board decisions. This court must affirm a Board decision unless it is "(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c). In turn, the Board's own regulations give deciding officials authority to dismiss an appeal for failure to prosecute. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43(b). This court has recognized that failure to respond to the Board's orders may justify dismissal. <span class="Italic">See Ahlberg v. Dep't of Health and Human Servs.</span>, 804 F.2d 1238, 1242-43 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After filing his appeal with the Board, Mr. Richardson did not attend the prehearing conference and likewise did not contact the Board in any manner before issuance of the administrative judge's initial decision. The administrative judge issued multiple orders and provided Mr. Richardson with notice that his appeal would be dismissed if he failed to respond. After the administrative judge issued his initial decision, Mr. Richardson sent a letter petitioning the Board for review. Mr. Richardson stated in his letter that he thought he was expected to participate over the telephone.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board denied Mr. Richardson's petition and made final the administrative judge's decision. In doing so, the Board gave Mr. Richardson's letter consideration. However, Mr. Richardson did not deny receipt of the administrative judge's orders. He only stated he thought he was supposed to appear by telephone rather than in person. Thus, nothing in the record suggests that the Board abused its discretion in denying Mr. Richardson's petition and in adopting the administrative judge's initial decision as final.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Dismissal for failure to prosecute was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Porter v. MSPB</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210831140">___Fed. Appx.___</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP), for failure to file prehearing submissions and to attend the hearing. The Federal Circuit sustained dismissal of an appeal for failure to prosecute when the appellant did not participate in any of the prehearing conferences and supplied none of the submissions required by the prehearing orders. <span class="Italic">Presidente v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1991 NP No. 91-3218); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 96-3036) ("Under the board's regulations, an AJ has authority to dismiss an appeal for failure to prosecute. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.43(b) (1995). Repeated failure to respond to board orders may support dismissal of an appeal for failure to prosecute."); <span class="Italic">Ahlberg v. DHHS</span>, 804 F.2d 1238, 1242 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ("The presiding official correctly treated the...petitioners' failure to make any submission, after being told to do so, as a failure to prosecute their appeal, as he had warned them he would do.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Rejecting the argument that a jurisdictional dismissal for lack of a response to an AJ's order was an unwarranted dismissal for failure to prosecute, <span class="Italic">Clark v. USPS</span>, 123 MSPR 466, 473-74 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-15, 2016 MSPB 26 (2016), determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the appellant's representative were busy preparing for another case, the Board has held that a heavy workload does not establish good cause for a late filing. <span class="Italic">Andre v. Department of the Army</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 342, &#x00B6; 8 (2002). The Board also has recognized that holidays and other competing time demands do not constitute good cause for an untimely filing. <span id="Page_1286"></span><span class="Italic">Melendez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 51, &#x00B6; 14 (2009); <span class="Italic">cf. Passes v. Department of the Interior</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 33, &#x00B6; 7 (2005) (finding that the unavailability of an appellant's representative did not establish good cause for untimely filing a petition for review). Accordingly, the explanations provided for the appellant's failure to respond to the administrative judge's jurisdictional order do not warrant a different result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For her argument that the administrative judge's dismissal on jurisdictional grounds amounted to a premature and improper dismissal for failure to prosecute, the appellant attempts to analogize the current situation to that of <span class="Italic">Bilandzich v. Department of the Army</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 301 (2009). The appellant in that case filed an appeal under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (codified at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4301-4333) (USERRA), which, in relevant part, protects members of the uniformed service from employment discrimination, alleging that his employing agency had improperly charged him military leave for uniformed service performed on non-workdays, causing him to use other leave to perform military duty. <span class="Italic">Bilandzich</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 301, &#x00B6; 2. The administrative judge issued an acknowledgment order, noting that a person's entitlement to USERRA benefits by reason of prior military service may terminate if any of a number of intervening events occur, directing the appellant to respond by addressing whether any of those events applied to his service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 3. Although the appellant responded to a separate motion to dismiss from the agency, he failed to address the matter raised in the acknowledgment order. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Without issuing any further orders, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 4. On review, the Board reversed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9. The Board found that the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction was, in essence, a dismissal for failure to prosecute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 7. In doing so, the Board noted that the appellant had met his jurisdictional burden, which, in the context of a USERRA appeal, unconditionally entitled him to a Board hearing, despite his failure to respond to the administrative judge's acknowledgment order. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the appellant's arguments, <span class="Italic">Bilandzich</span> is not dispositive in the instant appeal; it is distinguishable from the facts at hand. First, this case does not involve a USERRA claim. Second, unlike the appellant in <span class="Italic">Bilandzich</span>, the appellant in this matter did not meet her jurisdictional burden. Because the appellant failed to meet her jurisdictional burden, despite being ordered to do so, the administrative judge's dismissal on jurisdictional grounds was proper. We decline to adopt a standard requiring that administrative judges respond to an appellant's failure to meet her jurisdictional burden with a second opportunity to meet that burden.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Slaughter v. USPS</span>, 56 MSPR 307, 310 (1993), emphasized that appellants should explain, through affidavits or other admissible evidence, their failures to abide by prehearing orders when they challenge through a PFR dismissals of their appeals based on those failings. The Board remanded the appeal to the regional office to develop the record further concerning the appellant's contention that he could not respond to prehearing orders because of the nature of his inpatient drug rehabilitation program. On remand in <span class="Italic">Slaughter</span>, the AJ once again dismissed the appeal for failure to prosecute, a finding that was again reversed by the Board in <span class="Italic">Slaughter v. USPS</span>, 60 MSPR 10, 13 (1993), concluding that the appellant should not have been defaulted for failing to respond to orders while he was hospitalized or in an inpatient program. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Crespo v. USPS</span>, 53 MSPR 125, 131 (1992) ("Good faith efforts falling short of full compliance with an order should be considered in determining whether a sanction is appropriate.").
