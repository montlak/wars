<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-28"><span class="space">b.</span> Constructive Request</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jefferies v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 78 MSPR 255, 259-61 (1998), reaffirmed that an agency must prove its compliance with FMLA (and the appellant need not establish noncompliance as an affirmative defense) and emphasized that documentation provided by the appellant to justify leave under FMLA must comply with OPM requirements and cover the period of the absence at issue in the adverse action. An employee is not required to explicitly invoke the FMLA in requesting covered leave:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the FMLA, an "eligible" employee of a covered employer, such as the agency, is entitled to unpaid leave, or paid leave, if earned, for a period of 12 weeks in any 12-month period because, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the employee is needed to care for a family member, including a daughter, with "a serious health condition." 5 USC &#x00A7; 6382(a)(1); <span class="Italic">Gross v. Department of Justice,</span> 77 MSPR 83, 86 (1997) (citing <span class="Italic">Ramey v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 70 MSPR 463, 466 (1996), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds, Ellshoff v. Department of the Interior,</span> 76 MSPR 54, 73-74 (1997)). A "serious health condition" is defined as "an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves--(A) inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility; or (B) continuing treatment by a health care provider[.]" 5 USC &#x00A7; 6381(5); <span class="Italic">Gross,</span> 77 MSPR at 86. Regulations by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) implementing the FMLA provide that an agency may require that a request for leave under the FMLA to care for a covered family member with a "serious health condition" be supported by written medical certification issued by the health care provider that provides certain specific information. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 630.1207. An agency is required to "inform its employees of their entitlements and responsibilities [under the FMLA], including the requirements and obligations of employees." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 630.1203(g).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2477"></span>Further, an agency bears the burden of proving that, in taking a leave-related disciplinary action, it properly denied an "eligible" employee, such as the appellant, leave under the FMLA. <span class="Italic">Ellshoff,</span> 76 MSPR at 73-74, <span class="Italic">modifying Ramey</span>, 70 MSPR at 467. In <span class="Italic">Ellshoff,</span> 76 MSPR at 74, the Board found that an agency must prove its compliance with the FMLA in bringing a leave-related charge against an employee. Thus, the Board specifically found that a claim made under the FMLA should not be treated as an affirmative defense under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(C). <span class="Italic">Ellshoff,</span> 76 MSPR at 74. Here, because the administrative judge treated the appellant's FMLA claim as an affirmative defense, the administrative judge erred. We find, however, for the reasons discussed below, that the administrative judge's error did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights inasmuch as we find that the administrative judge correctly concluded that the appellant was not entitled to leave under the FMLA to cover his charged absence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this regard, we note that, from the record, it appears that the appellant first raised the issue of possible entitlement to leave under the FMLA during his April 8, 1997 oral reply to his proposed removal when he indicated that his absence was caused by his daughter's health condition and submitted unspecified information allegedly covered by the Privacy Act. An employee is not, however, required to explicitly invoke the FMLA in requesting covered leave. <span class="Italic">Ellshoff,</span> 76 MSPR at 76. Thus, the agency was placed on notice that the appellant was requesting leave under the FMLA. <span class="Italic">See id.; see also Gross,</span> 77 MSPR at 88-89. The agency then asked the appellant at his oral reply to submit a letter from a physician that "covered the length of [his] child's illness and the reason he was absence [sic] from work," and the appellant agreed to provide that documentation on April 11, 1997.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 8, 1997, the agency issued its removal decision notice. The appellant thereafter submitted to the agency a letter dated May 15, 1997, from Dr. Lynn Shimabukuro, stating that the appellant's daughter suffered from "recurrent bouts of bronchitis and streptococcal pharyngitis," that "she had seven clinical visits" in 1995 for these problems, and that she underwent "tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy." Dr. Shimabukuro further stated that the appellant's daughter was seen at the clinic three times in 1996 and that her last visit was on November 7, 1996, when she was treated for bronchitis. She also noted that the appellant's daughter was treated on December 18, 1996, for a laceration under her left eye. Dr. Shimabukuro explained that "[b]ronchitis is a recurring problem in some individuals that can be precipitated by a respiratory virus" and that "[i]t tends to make colds more severe and of longer duration." Dr. Shimabukuro opined that it was conceivable that the appellant's daughter's condition required the care of one of her parents even though she was not seen at the clinic, and that her school attendance records would be another source of information as to whether she required such care. The appellant also submitted an undated note from Dr. Shimabukuro, stating: "Mr. Richard Jeffries [sic] was out of work due to illness of his daughter. She has had multiple illnesses and this has caused a great deal of stress in the family."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither Dr. Shimabukuro's letter nor her note indicated the length of the appellant's daughter's illness or showed that the appellant was required to care for her from October 28, 1996, through February 18, 1997, the period of his absence from work. Thus, this documentation did not comply with the agency's request for medical certification.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the medical documentation that the appellant submitted to the agency and on appeal for the period of his charged absence does not establish that his daughter was suffering from a "serious health condition" as defined in 5 USC &#x00A7; 6381(5) because it does not show that her illness involved inpatient care or continuous treatment by a health care provider for the charged period. While the appellant contends that the administrative judge erred by holding him responsible for his obligations under the FMLA but did not hold the agency responsible for its obligations to inform him of the FMLA and his responsibilities under it, the appellant has not shown any such error. We note that the administrative judge stated in the initial decision that the agency stipulated that it did not inform the appellant of his rights and responsibilities under the FMLA, and that the agency has not challenged this statement. We also note that the medical information that the agency requested was considerably less stringent than the minimum information provided in OPM's FMLA implementing regulations, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 630.1207, but that the appellant failed to provide even that limited information either to the agency or on appeal. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant failed to show that he was harmed by the agency's failure to inform him of his rights and responsibilities under the FMLA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Young v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 25, 35-38 (1998), considered a constructive, or indirect, request for family leave and documentation requirements concerning care for a family member:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the same reasons that we find that the agency should have allowed the appellant to use any available sick leave to cover her absence up to July 30, 1996, we similarly find that her absence during that time resulted from a serious health condition entitling her to FMLA leave. Under 29 USC &#x00A7; 2611(11), a "serious health condition" includes an "illness injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves...continuing treatment by a health care provider." <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Ellshoff v. Department of the Interior</span>, 76 MSPR 54, 74-76 (1997). Further, 29 CFR &#x00A7; 825.114 defines "continuing treatment" to include a period of incapacity of more than three days that also involves treatment two or more times by a health care provider, or treatment by a health care provider on at least one occasion which results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of the health care provider. We find that the evidence shows that the appellant suffered from a serious health condition, i.e., depression and anxiety, involving a period of incapacity of more than three days and treatment on at least one occasion by a health care provider followed by a regimen of continuing treatment, i.e., prescription medications, under the supervision of Dr. McMeekin until July 30, 1996.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the appellant's absence to care for her father also implicates the FMLA. The undisputed evidence shows that the appellant went to New York City to care for her terminally-ill father on July 2, 1996, and that he died on September 27 1996. The appellant submitted evidence to show that her father was hospitalized during some of that time. Under the FMLA, a covered employee may use up to 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period, paid or unpaid, to care for a parent with a "serious health condition." 29 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 825.112(a)(3), 825.200(a)(3). A "serious health condition" for purposes of the FMLA also means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves inpatient care in a hospital, and a period of incapacity or subsequent treatment in connection with that inpatient care. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 825.114(a)(1). In determining whether an employee is needed to care for a parent with a serious health condition, considerations include whether the parent "is unable to care for his or her own basic medical, hygienic, or nutritional needs or safety, or is unable to transport himself or herself to the doctor," and "also includes providing psychological comfort and reassurance which would be beneficial to a...parent with a serious health condition who is receiving inpatient or home care." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 825.116(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither the administrative judge nor the agency determined whether the appellant's reason for her absence to care for her father was sufficient to entitle her to FMLA leave. We find that the appellant's father's terminal cancer, requiring inpatient care from July 7, 1996, and subsequent incapacity and treatment, until his death on September 27, 1996, constitutes a "serious health condition" sufficient to invoke the provisions of the FMLA. The record is insufficiently developed to determine whether any period between July 1 and July 7 would also be qualifying. Although the August 27, 1996 statement from the Montefiore Medical Center indicates that the appellant's father was registered in the out-patient clinic on November 7, 1995, there is no evidence to show that his condition from that time until his hospitalization on July 7, 1996, would qualify under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 825.114, i.e., the evidence does not indicate whether he was incapacitated, seen two or more times by a health care provider, participating in a regimen of continuing treatment, incapacitated on a permanent or long-term basis because of a condition for which treatment may not be effective, or receiving multiple treatments from a health care provider for conditions including cancer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to setting forth the eligibility criteria for FMLA leave, the regulations also impose certain notice requirements. When the need for leave is "not foreseeable," an employee is required to notify the employer of the need for FMLA leave "as soon as practicable, under the facts and circumstances of the particular case," with the expectation that notice will be given "within no more than one or two working days of learning of the need for leave, except in extraordinary circumstances where such notice is not feasible." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 825.303(a). Notice may be in person, by telephone, telegraph, facsimile, or other means and "may be given by the employee's spokesperson, (e.g., spouse, adult family member or other responsible party) if the employee is unable to do so personally." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 825.303(b). "The employee need not expressly assert rights under the FMLA or even mention the FMLA." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Furthermore, the employer is expected to "obtain any additional required information through informal means." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant's adult son, Derrick McDaniel, telephoned Thompson in July 1996 and informed him that the appellant was in New York where her father was terminally ill. According to McDaniel, he spoke to Thompson on July 12, 1996. McDaniel testified that he called and was told by the receptionist that Thompson was unavailable. McDaniel called again 5 minutes later. As evidence that McDaniel spoke to Thompson on July 12, 1996, the appellant submitted a copy of McDaniel's telephone bill showing that two short telephone calls were made five minutes apart to Thompson's telephone number on July 12. Thompson testified consistently with McDaniel as to the substance of their conversation but testified that they spoke on approximately July 26. The administrative judge did not determine when the telephone call took place, but determined that McDaniel had not requested leave for <span id="Page_2478"></span>his mother, in any case. We find that McDaniel's testimony regarding the date of the telephone call is more credible than Thompson's because of the corroborating evidence of the telephone bill<span class="Italic">. See Peloquin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 51 MSPR 435, 438 (1991). Thompson acknowledged that he spoke to McDaniel on one occasion in July but was unable to identify an exact date or testify to any specific circumstances that would place the date of the telephone call at approximately July 26. Thus, we find that McDaniel telephoned Thompson on July 12, 1996, and informed him that his mother was in New York to care for her terminally ill father.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the particular circumstances of this case, we find that the appellant's notice to the agency that she was absent for a reason that implicated the FMLA, i.e., the telephone call from her adult son, McDaniel, was sufficient to meet the notice requirement of 29 CFR &#x00A7; 825.303. Prior to the July 12 telephone call, the appellant had been in contact with agency personnel through her submission of PS forms 3971, CA-1 and CA-17 forms, and negotiations resulting in the June 11, 1996 grievance settlement agreement with Thompson, through at least June 24, 1996. The agency had not requested any further information from the appellant at that time. We find that it was reasonable for the appellant to assume on July 12 that her absence was excused for medical reasons and to see no need to provide further notice to the agency that she needed FMLA leave because of her father's "serious health condition." We find it particularly noteworthy that Thompson did not inform the appellant's son, McDaniel, during the July 12 telephone call that the agency considered his mother's absences unexcused. Moreover, the agency did not inform her at that time or in the August 8, 1996 letter of the requirements of the FMLA. Although the agency's April 8, 1996 letter to the appellant included FMLA forms and information, the appellant had no reason to know in July that any specific notice of a request for FMLA leave was required or that the notice she provided the agency through McDaniel would be insufficient.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In finding that the appellant was not entitled to leave under the FMLA, the administrative judge relied on the fact that McDaniel did not specifically request leave for his mother. We find that such a requirement elevates form over substance. Without question, McDaniel informed Thompson of the appellant's absence and the reason for it. An employee who informs the agency that she will be absent and states a reason that might justify granting leave need not actually verbalize that she was requesting FMLA leave<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 825.303(b); <span class="Italic">Manuel v. Westlock Polymers Corp.</span>, 66 F.3d 758, 761-63 (5th Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Ellshoff</span>, 76 MSPR at 76. We thus find that the appellant's absence from July 12 to September 27, 1996, when her father died, was covered by the FMLA and that the charge of AWOL for that time period can not be sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Burge v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 82 MSPR 75, 83-90 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-27 (1999) (aff'd after remand, <span class="Italic">Burge v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 01-3005), <span class="Italic">post</span>), added as to documentation requirements and constructive request elements involved in an FMLA defense:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the FMLA, an "eligible" employee of a covered employer is entitled to unpaid leave, or paid leave, if earned, for a period of 12 weeks in any 12-month period because of, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, a serious health condition that renders the employee unable to perform his job. 5 USC &#x00A7; 6382(a)(1); <span class="Italic">Gross v. Department of Justice</span>, 77 MSPR 83, 86 (1997) (citing <span class="Italic">Ramey v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 70 MSPR 463, 466 (1996), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Ellshoff v. Department of the Interior</span>, 76 MSPR 54, 73-74 (1997)). A "serious health condition" is defined as "an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves--(A) inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility; or (B) continuing treatment by a health care provider[.]" 5 USC &#x00A7; 6381(5); <span class="Italic">Gross</span>, 77 MSPR at 86. An agency may apply its own leave procedures to leave requests under the FMLA, but the agency may not apply a more restrictive leave policy than that provided under the FMLA and may not deny an employee leave under the FMLA for failure to follow the agency's leave procedures. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 630.1206(e); <span class="Italic">Gross</span>, 77 MSPR at 87. The agency may, however, require the submission of administratively acceptable medical documentation in a timely manner to support a request for leave under the FMLA. 5 USC &#x00A7; 6383(a); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 630.1206(f); <span class="Italic">Gross</span>, 77 MSPR at 87; <span class="Italic">Ellshoff</span>, 76 MSPR at 76-77.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an employee requests leave under the FMLA, the agency is required to provide the employee with "guidance concerning the employee's rights and obligations" under the FMLA. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 630.1203(g). Further, an agency bears the burden of proving that, in taking a leave-related disciplinary action, it properly denied an "eligible" employee leave under the FMLA. <span class="Italic">Ellshoff</span>, 76 MSPR at 73-74, <span class="Italic">modifying Ramey</span>, 70 MSPR at 467. Here, it is undisputed that the appellant is an "eligible" employee under the FMLA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 6381(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee is not required to explicitly invoke the FMLA in requesting covered leave. <span class="Italic">Ellshoff</span>, 76 MSPR at 76. Here, we find that the appellant placed the agency on notice of his possible entitlement to leave under the FMLA when: (1) By letter dated May 16, 1996, when he requested 6 months' leave without pay (LWOP) based on his medical conditions, and as indicated in the agency's May 24 and June 24, 1996 letters to the appellant advising him of the need for "more comprehensive medical" documentation to support his leave request, and (2) when he submitted to Colonel Kane, his supervisor, a letter dated July 2, 1996, and a completed leave request form signed by Swaby-Price on July 2, 1996, stating that, due to the appellant's "condition," he was "unable to report to work from May 16, 1996 to July 17, 1996." The appellant stated on the form, "I am under medical evaluation for GERD, sliding hyatial [sic] hernia, diverticulosis, etc."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency attached to its May 24, 1996 letter a list of the kind of medical information that it required from the appellant, which included, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>: "[A] history of the specific medical condition(s), including references to findings from previous examinations, treatment, and responses to treatment"; "[c]linical findings from the most recent medical evaluation including...findings of physical examination...results of laboratory tests," and "X-rays, EKGs and other special evaluations or diagnostic procedures[,] and, in the case of psychiatric disease, the findings of a mental status examination and the results of psychological tests"; "[a]ssessment of the current clinical status and plans for future treatment"; "[d]iagnosis"; "[a]n estimate of the expected date of full or partial recovery"; "[a]n explanation of the impact of the medical condition on life activities both on and off the job"; a [n]arrative explanation of the medical basis for any conclusion that the medical condition has or has not become static or well-stabilized"; a "[n]arrative explanation of the medical basis for any conclusion which indicates the likelihood that the individual may experience sudden or subtle incapacitation as a result of the medical condition"; a "[n]arrative explanation of the medical basis for any conclusion that duty restrictions or accommodations are or are not warranted and, if they are, an explanation of their therapeutic or risk avoiding value and the nature of any similar restrictions or accommodations recommended for non-work-related activities"; and a "[n]arrative explanation of the medical basis for any conclusion which indicates the likelihood that the individual, is or is not, expected to suffer injury or harm by carrying out, with or without accommodation, the tasks or duties of a position for which he/she is assigned or qualified."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The medical certification that the FMLA permits includes: "(1) The date the serious health condition commenced; (2) [t]he probable duration of the serious health condition; [and] (3) [t]he appropriate medical facts within the knowledge of the health care provider regarding the serious health condition, including a general statement as to the incapacitation, examination, or treatment that may be required by a health care provider[.]" 5 CFR &#x00A7; 630.1207(b); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 6383(b). The term "health care provider" insofar as is relevant here is defined as "[a] licensed Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathy" or "[a] person providing health services who is not a medical doctor, but who is certified by a national organization <span class="Italic">and</span> licensed by a State to provide the service in question[.]" 5 CFR &#x00A7; 630.1202.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, a comparison of the medical certification that the agency required in its May 24, 1996 letter and the medical certification that the FMLA requires shows that the agency's medical requirements are more specific and detailed than the FMLA's. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 630.1207(b). Nevertheless, we find that the agency's more specific leave requirements did not harm the appellant's rights under the FMLA because not only did the appellant fail to comply with the agency's request for medical documentation, but he also failed to comply with the medical certification requirements under FMLA regulations. <span class="Italic">See Gross v. Department of Justice</span>, 77 MSPR 83, 87 (1997) (agency leave policy cannot be more restrictive than FMLA, but the agency may require administratively acceptable documentation to support the employee's leave request). In this regard, we note that the July 2, 1996 completed leave request form signed by Swaby-Price, which was the only medical documentation that the appellant submitted to the agency in response to its May 24, 1996 request, while stating that the appellant's "condition" rendered him "unable to work from May 16, 1996 to July 17, 1996" did not state the date that the appellant's serious health condition commenced, its probable duration, and appropriate facts regarding the appellant's condition, incapacitation, examination, or treatment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 630.1207(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we note that the appellant's submission of the completed July 2, 1996 leave request form to the agency was not timely. In its May 24, 1996 letter, the agency afforded the appellant 10 days from the date of receipt of that letter to provide the requested medical documentation. The agency subsequently extended the date for the submission of the medical documentation to June 8, 1996, and directed the appellant to return to work on July 1, 1996, if he had "not provided adequate medical documentation." The agency implicitly extended the June 8, 1996 deadline date for submission of medical documentation to July 1, 1996, when it informed the appellant in its June 24, 1996 letter that it would retain him in an LWOP status "until 1 July 1996 or the receipt of adequate medical documentation, which ever [sic] occurs first." Thus, the completed July 2, 1996 leave request form was untimely submitted to the agency. We note that the FMLA implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 630, which apply to federal employees, do not list any circumstances <span id="Page_2479"></span>under which an untimely submission may be accepted by an agency. We note, however, that analogous FMLA implementing regulations at 29 CFR part 825, which apply to private sector and U.S. Postal Service employees, allow for an untimely submission of medical documentation where timely submission "is not practicable under the particular circumstances...despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 825.305(b). Likewise, by analogy, we hold that the same standard applies in determining whether a federal employee's untimely medical certification should be considered under the FMLA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant consistently asserted before the agency and on appeal that his medical conditions and his difficulty obtaining the necessary medical information from VA physicians prevented him from timely submitting this information to the agency. In a June 26, 1996 letter to Colonel Kane, the appellant stated: "I have to wait until Monday, 1 July 1996 for the return of Mrs. Pryce, the Physician Assistant in charge of my medical evaluation to make arrangements for the requested information you are requesting. I regret this time lapse, but it was beyond my control." The appellant stated that he had been referred for further medical evaluation and requested "ample time, beyond the 1 July 1996 suspense" date, to submit the requested medical information. In a July 2, 1996 agency memorandum of record, Personnel Management Advisor Joan Whigham of the agency's Civilian Personnel Office, stated that, in a telephone conversation with her, the appellant "repeatedly indicated that he had been asking his doctors for the required information but they had failed to provide anything" and that "he felt that "Col Kane wasn't giving him sufficient time." Further, on appeal, the appellant reiterated that his failure to timely submit the requested medical documentation was beyond his control. If the appellant can so establish, we find that the untimely medical evidence that he has submitted on review must be considered on remand in determining whether he was entitled to leave under the FMLA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[O]n remand, the administrative judge must afford the appellant an opportunity to present witnesses to support his case. We note that the appellant requested several medical witnesses, including Drs. Weiss and McManus and Physician's Assistant Swaby-Pryce, whom the administrative judge disallowed, ruling that their proffered testimonies were irrelevant and immaterial. In this regard, we note that Drs. Weiss and McManus submitted to the VA reports on the appellant's medical conditions upon which the VA relied in approving his claim for a VA pension, the same medical conditions for which the appellant is claiming entitlement to FMLA leave. Also, Swaby-Price, as a Physician's Assistant, would qualify under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 630.1202 as a "health care provider." These health care providers who treated the appellant, including Swaby-Price, who signed most of the appellant's leave request forms, would be witnesses most likely to have relevant and material information regarding the appellant's claim that he had difficulty in timely obtaining medical documentation and the ultimate determination of his entitlement to LWOP under the FMLA. Therefore, on remand, the administrative judge shall afford the appellant an opportunity to present these and other witnesses with proffered relevant and material testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the administrative judge shall also consider the April 21, 1998 SSA decision that the appellant has submitted on review and that finds him disabled and entitled to disability insurance benefits under the Social Security Act from May 16, 1996, to at least through the date of that decision, based on "ruptured colon/diverticulitis, crushed right foot with tendon damage and resulting in right knee and spinal problems and depression," which impairments the SSA found are "severe" and "prevent him from sustaining a regular, competitive workday." We find that this document constitutes new evidence, because it is dated after the close of the record below, and that it may be of sufficient weight to warrant an outcome different from that of the initial decision....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the Board has indicated that the standard for determining whether an agency's denial of LWOP is reasonable takes into account the agency's relevant workload, the need for the employee's services, prior warnings for excessive leave, absences, abuse of leave or potential for such abuse, the legitimacy of the reasons for requesting LWOP, the dictates of the FMLA, and whether there is a foreseeable end in sight to the employee's absence. <span class="Italic">Joos v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 74 MSPR 684, 696 (1997). On remand, the administrative judge shall determine whether the agency's denial of LWOP was reasonable taking these factors into consideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, inasmuch as the appellant did not specifically request LWOP under the FMLA when he made his leave requests to the agency, the administrative judge shall determine, in the alternative, whether the agency nevertheless abused its discretion in denying LWOP under non-FMLA law based on medical reasons. <span class="Italic">See Kendricks v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 79 MSPR 510, slip. op. at 6 (1998); <span class="Italic">see also Wells v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 29 MSPR 346, 348 (1985); <span class="Italic">Desiderio v. Department of the Navy</span>, 4 MSPR 84, 86 (1980). The Board has held that, in reviewing the propriety of an AWOL determination, it will examine medical evidence presented for the first time to the Board, as well as any medical documentation presented to the agency. <span class="Italic">Kmiecz v. Department of the Army</span>, 29 MSPR 673, 677 (1986) (citing <span class="Italic">Zeiss v. Veterans Administration</span>, 7 MSPB 516, 8 MSPR 15, 18 (1981)). Thus, on remand, the administrative judge must determine whether the agency abused its discretion in denying him LWOP under non-FMLA law, considering the medical documentation that the appellant submitted on appeal and on review. <span class="Italic">See Carr</span>, 61 MSPR at 176.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that, while the appellant contended below that the agency was required to post notice of the FMLA, neither the FMLA nor its implementing regulations impose such a responsibility on non-Postal Service agencies. <span class="Italic">Cf. Ramey</span>, 70 MSPR at 466 (citing 29 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 825.300, 825.301) (the FMLA requires the Postal Service to post, and keep posted, on its premises notice explaining FMLA provisions and to provide employees with information regarding their entitlements and obligations under the FMLA in Postal Service guidance on employees' benefits or leave rights). The applicable regulation here, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 630.1203(g) requires only that, when an employee requests leave under the FMLA, "the agency must provide guidance concerning [the] employee's rights and obligations under this subpart." The administrative judge did not address the appellant's contention that the agency failed to inform him of his rights and responsibilities under the FMLA and whether the appellant showed harm in this regard. Therefore, the administrative judge must address this contention on remand.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After remand and affirmation by the Board of Mr. Burge's dismissal, the Federal Circuit affirmed the Board, <span class="Italic">Burge v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 01-3005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Burge argues that the Air Force's denial of his leave requests violates the Family and Medical Leave Act. The Family and Medical Leave Act allows eligible employees to take unpaid leave, or paid leave if it has been earned, for up to twelve weeks in any twelve-month period for, among other things, "a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's position." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6382(a)(1)(D) (1994). However, the employing agency may require the employee to timely submit a certification from the employee's health care provider. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6383(a) (1994). The certification is sufficient if it includes the date that the health condition commenced, the probable duration of the health condition, appropriate medical facts about the health condition that are known by the health care provider, and a statement that the employee cannot perform the functions of the employee's position. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6383(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The documents that Mr. Burge submitted to the Air Force in July 1996 were not sufficient to meet the requirements of &#x00A7; 6383(b). The signed statement by Ms. Swaby-Price only stated, "due to the condition of the above named patient, he is unable to report to work from May 16, 1996 to July 17, 1996." The statements by Ms. Swaby-Price do not state the probable duration of Mr. Burge's condition or the date that the condition commenced; nor do they state relevant facts about Mr. Burge's condition. Accordingly, substantial evidence in the record supports the administrative judge's finding that Mr. Burge's submissions in July 1996 were insufficient to meet the requirements of the Family and Medical Leave Act. Also, the Air Force previously informed Mr. Burge that medical documentation was due by July 1. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the administrative judge's finding that neither of the two SF-71's submitted by Mr. Burge was timely, as required by &#x00A7; 6383(a).</p>
