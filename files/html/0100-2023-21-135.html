<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Under 5</span> CFR<span class="Italic"> 842.807</span> (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;The final decision of an agency head denying an individual's request for approval of a position as a rigorous, secondary, or air traffic controller position made under &#x00A7; 842.804(c) may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;The final decision of an agency head denying an individual coverage while serving in an approved secondary position because of failure to meet the conditions in &#x00A7; 842.803(b) may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The basis for an agency determination of LEO status, and the time allowed for challenging a determination, are described at 5 CFR<span class="Italic"> 842.804</span> (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;An agency head's determination under &#x00A7; 842.803(a) (finding that a position is a rigorous position) must be based solely on the official position description of the position in question and any other official description of duties and qualifications. The official documentation for the position should, as soon as is reasonably possible, establish that the primary duties of the position are so rigorous that the agency does not allow individuals to enter the position if they are over a certain age or if they fail to meet certain physical qualifications (that is, physical requirements and/or medical standards), as determined by the employing agency head based on the personnel management needs of the agency for the positions in question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;A determination under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 842.803 (b) or (c) must be based on the official position description and any other evidence deemed appropriate by the agency head for making the determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;If an employee is in a position not subject to the one-half percent higher withholding rate of 5 U.S.C. 8422(a)(2)(B), and the employee does not, within 6 months after entering the position or after any significant change in the position, formally and in writing seek a determination from the employing agency that his position is properly covered by the higher withholding rate, the agency head's determination that the service was not so covered at the time of the service is presumed to be correct. This presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee was unaware of his or her status or was prevented by cause beyond his or her control from requesting that the official status be changed at the time the service was performed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agency head determinations, once made in favor of an employee, may be subject to Board scrutiny if an effort is made to modify that determination much later in time, MacMullin v. DHS, PH-0842-21-0140-I-2, n.3 (NP 12/6/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T[here is a serious question as to whether the agency had the authority to revoke that determination retroactively 14 years later. An agency is authorized to retroactively designate a position as LEO covered, but it does not appear that an agency is authorized to retroactively revoke such coverage. See Office of Personnel Management, CSRS and FERS Handbook, <span class="Italic">Special Retirement Provisions for Law Enforcement Officers, Firefighters, Air Traffic Controllers, and Military Reserve Technicians</span>, ch. 46, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 46A3.2-6, 46B3.2-3 (April 1998), <a href="https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/publications-forms/csrsfers-handbook/c046.pdf">https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/publications-forms/csrsfers-handbook/c046.pdf</a>. We likewise decline to decide this issue because the appellant is prevailing on other grounds.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The process for obtaining agency consideration of a request to be designated for LEO credit was indirectly described in <span class="Italic">Parker v. OPM</span>, DC-0842-15-0928-I-1, n.4 (NP 9/8/2022):</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Henry v. DOJ</span>, 157 F.3d 863, 864-65 (Fed. Cir. 1998), explained the evolution of the means for consideration of employees' requests for law enforcement retirement status:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal employees in many fields may not retire with an annuity until reaching fifty-five years of age and completing thirty years of service or reaching age sixty and completing twenty years of service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(a), (b) (1994). However, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(c) entitles employees to retire and draw an annuity at age fifty if they have completed twenty years of service as a law enforcement officer. Status as a law enforcement officer for any period depends upon an employee's position or duties. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.902 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee may request a determination of whether service qualifies for law enforcement officer retirement credit. But, before January 19, 1988, no regulations prescribed how or when to seek such a determination. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 831.901-831.905 (1982). On December 17, 1987, the Office of Personnel Management issued "final regulations...to improve administration of the [law enforcement officer retirement] program by clarifying the methods and criteria for obtaining coverage under [section 8336(c)]." Retirement; Law Enforcement Officers and Firefighters, 52 Fed. Reg. 47,893 (1987). The regulations, which became effective on January 19, 1988, required an individual to request, no later than September 30, 1989, a determination whether past government service that preceded the request by more than one year qualified for law enforcement officer credit. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.908(e) (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In August of 1982, Henry sent a letter to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), his employing agency. The letter, among other things, listed his past federal positions and ended, "[i]t is respectfully requested that you recommend to the Office of Personnel Management that I be certified for [section 8336(c)] coverage." In an October 25, 1982 memorandum, an INS personnel employee suggested three options "to present the strongest possible case to the Office of Personnel Management." The memorandum ended: "Without supporting documentation...the Office of Personnel Management will be unable to act favorably upon your request. Your draft is returned herewith." Henry did not pursue the options before he retired in 1994, after more than thirty-one years with the INS. In March of 1995, Henry sent a letter to the INS seeking law enforcement officer <span id="Page_4285"></span>retirement benefits. The Management Division of the Department of Justice denied his request as untimely, and Henry appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board. The board held that Henry untimely requested a determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In part, the board found that Henry's August 1982 letter "can not be considered a request that met the" September 30, 1989, deadline because "[h]e made no effort to tell the agency that [his] claim was still active [and] there would have been no way that the agency would have been aware of the...letter in 1989 since the letter was returned to the appellant in 1982 without agency or OPM action and the appellant never resubmitted it." The board's finding necessarily relies on the implicit regulatory interpretation that an employee's behavior can render untimely an otherwise timely prior request. We disagree. Simply put, "[r]equests received...not later than September 30, 1989," were timely. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.908(e) (1989). And--more than seven years before that date--the INS received Henry's letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government does not argue that the letter did not purport to be a request. After all, the regulations specified neither the form nor the content of a request, <span class="Italic">see id</span>., and Henry's letter unmistakably set out its purpose: it literally "requested" credit for his past service. Instead, the government focuses on Henry's dormancy after writing the letter. We acknowledge that his inadequate follow-up risked the ultimate denial of law enforcement officer retirement credit, for he bore the burden of demonstrating that his service counts toward section 8336(c)'s twenty year requirement and providing "all pertinent information regarding duties performed." <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 831.908(a). But Henry's inactivity did not change the date of his 1982 letter. The date mattered paramountly. Consequently, Henry's 1982 letter satisfied the timeliness requirement of section 831.908(e). The government's argument that by his subsequent inactivity he waived his right to obtain a determination of whether he qualifies for law enforcement officer credit was raised for the first time at oral argument and comes too late. <span class="Italic">See Sanders v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> 801 F.2d 1328, 1331-32 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The concept of an agency head determination of LEO status was elaborated upon in <span class="Italic">Streeter v. DOD</span>, 80 MSPR 481, 484 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The controlling regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.803 and &#x00A7; 842.804 state that it is the "agency head" that is to make the determination as to LEO coverage. The term "agency head" is defined in detail at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802 and includes designated representatives of the agency head so long as those representatives are at certain levels of the agency's organization and meet other requirements of the regulations. The appellants challenge whether the agency official who denied their requests for LEO coverage (John C. Moseley, Chief, Field Advisory Services Division) meets the definition of "agency head" at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802. Apparently, their theory is that, if the official who denied their LEO coverage claim does not meet the regulatory definition of "agency head," then their appeals would not be untimely because the agency has not yet made final decisions which would be appealable to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulation regarding Board jurisdiction over agencies' determinations concerning LEO retirement coverage under FERS provides that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">that [t]he final decision of an agency denying an individual's request for approval of a position as a rigorous, secondary, or air traffic controller position made under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.804(c) may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.807(a). This regulation specifically states that it is the decision of the "agency," not necessarily the decision of the "agency head," that is appealable to the Board. Although somewhat confusing on its face when read in context with &#x00A7; 842.803, OPM's supplemental information published when these regulations were modified makes it clear that "any affirmative determination [as to LEO coverage] must be made by the agency head in accordance with &#x00A7; 842.803. However, a denial of an individual request for position approval may be made by the agency head's designated representative...." 57 Fed. Reg. 32685, 32688 (July 23, 1992). Since it is the "final decision of the agency" <span class="Italic">denying</span> coverage that is the action on appeal here, and since the denial of a request for LEO coverage does not have to be made by the "agency head," then the 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802 definition 2 of "agency head" is immaterial to the appeal at hand.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Department of the Navy</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 152, 156 (1996) is hereby overruled to the extent that it is inconsistent with this holding.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fairchild v. VA</span>, 83 MSPR 1 (1999) (VA medical center was the designated official to make an LEO determination; the Board had jurisdiction over the ensuing appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dept. of State v. OPM</span>, 22 MSPR 404, 404-08 (1984), determined that agencies may appeal to the Board from OPM decisions concerning law enforcement retirement status:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an effort to obtain "law enforcement" status for certain of its security officer positions, the Department of State, appellant here, sought a blanket ruling from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that the positions met the definitional requirements set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8331(20)[1] This request was denied in a reconsideration decision by OPM on October 19, 1982.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Section 8331(20) provides, in part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">"law enforcement officer" means an employee, the duties of whose position are primarily the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States, including an employee engaged in this activity who is transferred to a supervisory or administrative position.,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant sought to obtain Board review of the OPM decision pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d), which states in part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[A]n administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual or of the United States under this subchapter may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant also relied on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.120(a), which permits an "individual or agency" whose rights or interests under the Civil Service Retirement System are affected by an OPM decision to appeal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's presiding official declined jurisdiction, however, on the theory that appellant did not have a "right or interest" in the determination of the status of its employees, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 8347(d)(1), and that the regulation was not an independent grant of jurisdiction but a mere reiteration of &#x00A7; 8347(d)(1). Implicit in the initial decision is a finding that the requisite right or interest lies only in the individual employee who has been turned down for some benefit based on a ruling by OPM as to that individual.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the Board has not earlier addressed the issue of whether the employing agency has a "right or interest" sufficient to bring an appeal pursuant to &#x00A7; 8347 under these circumstances, the parties were asked for additional briefs. For the reasons set out herein, the Board concludes that the initial decision was incorrect. The petition for review is therefore GRANTED.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of direct Board precedent on this issue, and because neither the statute nor regulations clearly define the Board's jurisdiction in the instant case, we have looked to Congressional intent to shed light on the subject. It appears that all legislation on this matter has been designed to enhance the youth and vigor of federal law enforcement personnel. However, Congress sought to achieve this purpose under earlier legislation by providing law enforcement officers with an early retirement option.<span class="Italic"> See Stewart v. Smith,</span> 673 F.2d 485, 487, 493 (D.C. Cir. 1982). As this early version of the law shows, the definition of law enforcement officer was contained in the same provision which set forth the individual law enforcement employee's special entitlement to retirement benefits. In our view, this suggests that Congress intended to link the definition directly to the retirement provision and thereby limit its applicability to cases involving individual retirement applications under that provision. In <span class="Italic">Obremski v. Office of Personnel Management and Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 699 F.2d 1263, 1271, n.31 (D.C. Cir. 1983), the court noted that the former Civil Service Commission (CSC) made its determinations of coverage under that provision on case-by-case application. While the agency's interest might have been directly affected by CSC's determinations in these individual applications for optional retirement, it is arguable that this was not the kind of interest contemplated by section 8347(d)(1). This argument, however, loses much of its appeal when considered in light of the changes made by Public Law 93-350, 88 Stat. 355 (July 12, 1974).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A brief discussion of the conditions which led to the enactment of Public Law 93-350 is helpful in understanding the impact of the legislative changes on CSC's role in making determinations of coverage under former section 8336(c). As the court noted in <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Smith, supra,</span> at 493, Congressional efforts to secure a young and vigorous law enforcement work force through a scheme of voluntary early retirement with high annuities had not produced the desired result:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Highly capable workers were retiring after 20 years of service, while many less capable employees were staying on until their 70th birthday, in order to acquire 20 years of covered employment. Furthermore, early retirement was a one way street. Employees could choose to retire early, but the agency had no authority to require them to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> (Footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While Congress did not abandon the early retirement scheme in enacting the current law, it recognized that its goal could not be achieved without the active participation of the employing agencies. Thus, the 1974 legislation gave agencies the authority to set maximum ages upon initial entry into law enforcement positions and the authority to separate law enforcement personnel upon reaching age 55 with the requisite service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The authority given agencies by the above provisions effected a dramatic <span id="Page_4286"></span>shift in CSC's role in making law enforcement coverage determinations. As the court noted in <span class="Italic">Stewart, supra,</span> at 494, the position itself became the determinant of which set of retirement and annuity provisions applied, i.e., the special law enforcement provisions or the ones setting forth the general retirement provisions. No longer were CSC's law enforcement determinations geared by statute only to retirement applications. Rather, the 1974 amendments also created the situation where CSC's determinations directly impacted upon agencies' personnel policies, including the hiring and separation of law enforcement personnel. The new role given agencies in the implementation of the statutory scheme is also reflected in the amendment removing the definition of law enforcement officer from the early retirement provision contained in section 8336(c) and placing it in new section 8331(20).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are persuaded by our review of the changes made by Public Law 93-350 that Congress intended to accord agencies a direct interest in CSC's determinations under section 8331(20).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our view of the Congressional intent gains support from the court's opinion in <span class="Italic">Obremski, supra.</span> There, the court had under consideration the question of OPM's interpretation of the law enforcement officer definition contained in section 8331(20). Considering the language of that section, the court reasoned that the "ordering of decisionmaking roles" effected by Congress under the provision required that OPM give deference to the employing agency's determination. The court noted, moreover, that "[t]he employing agency...has the greatest interest in and should have the greatest control over structuring the jobs within its own workforce."<span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1271 (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The situation in <span class="Italic">Obremski</span> demonstrates in a pragmatic way why Congress could not have intended to deny agencies a right of administrative appeal of OPM's decisions under section 8331(20). Although the administrative appeal was that of the employee, the court noted that OPM ignored the agency's interest in the matter. We cannot accept OPM's argument implying that Congress intended that an agency pursue its interests through the appeal of an employee or a survivor. OPM's approach would require piecemeal litigation which could result in conflicting outcomes involving cases of similar or identical factual circumstances. Such an approach does not foster the economy and efficiency of litigation. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. Department of the Army,</span> 715 F.2d 1485, 1488-90 (Fed. Cir. 1983). We therefore hold that Congress intended that an agency be permitted to pursue its own interest under section 8331(20) by filing an appeal under section 8347(d)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the initial decision dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction is hereby REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings and adjudication on the merits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On return from a remand to the AJ, and after a Federal Register notice soliciting comments concerning the timing of LEO appeals and requests by employees to agencies for LEO determinations, the Board summarized the LEO annuity, explained that employees will be bound to timely request agency determinations or reconsiderations of LEO eligibility status (when that status or those determinations are known to employees), and described the application of the LEO formulation to a group of Naval facility police officers and supervisory police officers, found not to qualify for LEO coverage because of what Board considered the less than rigorous nature of their work, <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. DOD</span>, 80 MSPR 1, 5-29 (1998) (Vice Chair Slavet concurring in part and dissenting in part):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants are or were employed at the Naval Air Warfare Center in Lakehurst, New Jersey as either a supervisory Police Officer, a Lead Police Officer, or a Police Officer.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The decision of the ASDPR was made in response to an October 13, 1992 memorandum from a Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy transmitting to the ASDPR a list of LEO positions, including the appellants,' for approval or disapproval of coverage in the rigorous or secondary category under the special retirement provisions of FERS. The memorandum to the ASDPR was prompted by the Navy's internal Office of Civilian Personnel Management guidance that no Navy police officer positions had been approved for LEO special retirement coverage under FERS, and any activities wishing to have positions reviewed by the ASDPR for such coverage were required to submit requests by a specified deadline date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his May 30, 1995 initial decision, the administrative judge (AJ) found that the appellants were LEOs as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17), and that they were entitled to retirement coverage as such. The agency filed a petition for review of that determination. Because it was unclear whether the Board had jurisdiction over the appeals, we vacated the initial decision and remanded the appeals for further adjudication. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Department of the Navy,</span> 70 M.S.P.R. 152 (1996). On remand, the AJ dismissed the appeals of the appellants Lloyd, Mickens, and Turner for lack of jurisdiction, but found jurisdiction over the appeals of the appellants Fitzgerald, Brown, and McGrail, and reinstated the May 30, 1995 initial decision's finding that those appellants were entitled to LEO retirement coverage. Both parties have filed timely petitions for review of this remand initial decision.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Analysis</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress created FERS when it enacted the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (FERSA), Pub. L. No. 99-335, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8401-8479, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. (100 Stat.) 514. FERSA, codified at chapter 84 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code, took effect on June 6, 1986. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 99-335 &#x00A7; 702. The statute, at section 8461(e)(1), allows that an administrative action or order affecting the rights or interest of an individual under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. chapter 84 administered by OPM may be appealed to the Board. The statute, at section 8461(g), gives OPM the authority to prescribe regulations to carry out the provisions of chapter 84.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">OPM has the authority to issue regulations which the Board will enforce.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has a history of giving effect to regulations issued by OPM in other situations in which the Board has jurisdiction by statute, but OPM is given the responsibility for prescribing regulations to implement that statute. For example, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5335(c) specifies that an agency's reconsideration decision to deny a within grade increase may be appealed to the Board. By regulation, OPM requires that the request for a reconsideration decision must be in writing, 5 C.F.R. 531.410(a)(1). The Board has long held that it will enforce OPM's regulation that calls for a request to be in writing even though the Board's jurisdiction to hear the appeal flows from a statute that says nothing about the written form of the request. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Plata v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 173, 174 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the Board has consistently enforced the regulatory requirements promulgated by OPM at 5 C.F.R. Part 831. Section 831.109(e) requires an applicant for retirement, prior to filing a retirement appeal with the Board, to file a written request for reconsideration with OPM within 30 calendar days from the date of the original decision, even though the statute that gives the Board jurisdiction over such matters says nothing about a requirement for a time limit or a written request. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Preece v. Dept. of Army</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 222, 226 (1991). Our superior court has upheld our enforcement of OPM's regulations as they relate to the matter of the regulatory requirement of a request for reconsideration. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Toquero v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 982 F.2d 520, 522 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Rulings such as these are particularly significant because they interpret the very statutory provisions at issue in the cases at bar, and they effectively allow OPM to restrict our oversight to only "final decisions" of OPM on retirement matters even though the statute speaks to our jurisdiction over the broader "administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d)(1) and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The reality of our oversight responsibility in the area of retirement is that OPM is given the responsibility under statute for the implementation by regulation of the various retirement programs, and the Board is given the responsibility for ensuring that OPM's regulations are reasonable, consistent with statute, and applied fairly. Contrary to the argument in the separate opinion, OPM's regulations are applicable to these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Section 842.804(c) is not invalid, unreasonable, or violative of due process.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.804(c), in its entirety, provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If an employee is in a position not subject to the one-half percent higher withholding rate of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8422(a)(2)(B), and the employee does not, within 6 months after entering the position or after any significant change in the position, formally and in writing seek a determination from the employing agency that his position is properly covered by the higher withholding rate, the agency head's determination that the service was not so covered at the time of the service is presumed to be correct. This presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee was unaware of his or her status or was prevented by cause beyond his or her control from requesting that the official status be changed at the time the service was performed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4287"></span>The Board has interpreted this provision as a restriction on its jurisdiction over FERS LEO matters. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., DeVitto v. Department of Transportation</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 354, 357-58 (1994). That is, if a request for LEO coverage is not made within the time limit set forth in the regulation, and neither of the circumstances specified in the regulation is present, the Board has held that an appeal of the agency's denial of LEO coverage is not subject to challenge, and must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants asserted below that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.804(c) was "illegal as contrary to the promulgating statute, codified at 5 U.S.C. [&#x00A7;] 8412(d)." Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8412(d), an employee who is separated from the service, except by removal for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency, after completing 25 years of service as an LEO, member of the Capitol Police, or firefighter, or any combination of such service totaling at least 25 years, or after becoming 50 years of age and completing 20 years of service as an LEO, member of the Capitol Police, or firefighter, or any combination of such service totaling at least 20 years, is entitled to an annuity. The appellants asserted that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8412(d) sets forth a legal entitlement to an annuity for individuals who perform the duties of an LEO, while the regulation mandates a denial of such an annuity based solely on the timing of the application, not the merits of the claim. The appellants claimed that OPM was taking their property (retirement benefits to which they are entitled by statute) without providing them with an opportunity to present evidence to support their claim of entitlement. The appellants also claimed that the statute included no time limit on filing requests for LEO coverage, and that OPM's interpretation of the statute, as set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.804(c), was entitled to no deference because OPM had offered no explanation for it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency opposed the appellants' argument, contending that section 842.804(c) was not contrary to or inconsistent with any statutes implementing FERS. It asserted that implicit in the timeliness requirement of the regulation was the need to ensure that persons seeking LEO coverage met the definition of LEO, including the requirement that they be young and physically vigorous individuals. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17)(A)(ii) (the term "law enforcement officer" means an employee, the duties of whose position, among other things, are sufficiently rigorous that employment opportunities should be limited to young and physically vigorous individuals, as determined by the Director of OPM considering the recommendations of the employing agency). The agency claimed that it would be difficult to make this determination, based on the evidence required at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.804, if employees were able to wait twenty years before alleging eligibility to retire under the special retirement provisions for LEOs. Citing <span class="Italic">Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</span> 467 U.S. 837 (1984), the agency claimed that section 842.804(c) filled gaps not specifically covered by statute, and was based on a permissible construction of the statute which, at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(g), permitted OPM to prescribe regulations to carry out the FERS provisions. The agency asserted that the regulation was entitled to deference because it was implemented as an interim regulation shortly after the 1987 effective date of FERS and has been consistently applied by OPM since that time. Finally, the agency asserted that the regulation was not a taking of property because the appellants had no property interest in an expectancy of an annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Section 842.804(c) is a reasonable interpretation of statute.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The starting point of every case involving statutory construction must be the language of the statute itself. <span class="Italic">Todd v. Department of Defense</span>, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 55 F.3d 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Where that language is clear, it must control absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Where a statute is ambiguous, however, the interpretation of an agency charged with administration of the statute is entitled to deference. <span class="Italic">DeJesus v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 62 F.3d 1431 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). As the Supreme Court held in <span class="Italic">Chevron,</span> 467 U.S. at 843, where a statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to a specific issue, the question for a reviewing court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute. <span class="Italic">See also Bain v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 978 F.2d 1227, 1231 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (an agency's interpretation of a statute need not be the only reasonable one in order for it to survive a challenge).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the assertion of the appellants on review and NTEU in its <span class="Italic">amicus</span> brief that the FERS statute does not include a deadline for requesting a determination as to LEO status. Nevertheless, we do not read into the absence of such a deadline a congressional intent to allow such requests to be filed at any time. Nor do we find anything in the legislative history cited by legal counsel for the parties or amici that suggests Congress intended that there be no regulatory time limit for making requests for LEO retirement coverage or that there be a regulatory time limit different from that set forth in section 842.804(c). Although the appellants assert that under 5.U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(c), OPM shall adjudicate "all claims" under the provisions of chapter 84 administered by OPM, not just claims found to be timely by OPM, this provision does not necessarily prevent OPM from establishing regulatory time limits for filing such claims. "Adjudication" of a claim may include, for example, a finding by OPM or the Board that the claim was untimely filed under a regulatory time limit. In short, we find that the statute is silent with respect to the establishment of a regulatory time limit for requesting a determination on LEO retirement coverage.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit, a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency. <span class="Italic">Chevron,</span> 467 U.S. at 844. Here, Congress authorized OPM to prescribe regulations to carry out the provisions of 5 U.S.C. chapter 84 administered by OPM. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(g). Pursuant to this statutory authority, OPM promulgated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.804(c). <span class="Italic">See</span> 57 Fed. Reg. 32,685, 32,689 (1992); 52 Fed. Reg. 2068, 2069 (1987). We may not, therefore, substitute our own construction of the statute for a reasonable interpretation by OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As OPM points out, the statute defines "law enforcement officer" as an employee, the duties of whose position, among other things, "are sufficiently rigorous that employment opportunities should be limited to young and physically vigorous individuals...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17). Having a determination, by the head of an agency, on LEO coverage made early in an employee's career or soon after a change in duties helps effectuate this congressional requirement by ensuring that LEO positions are encumbered by individuals who meet this statutory requirement. If, for example, an agency identifies a position as non-LEO, a request for LEO coverage is made by the employee within six months after entering the position, and the head of the agency determines that the position <span class="Italic">is</span> an LEO position, the agency could ensure that the position is thereafter occupied by a individual who is young and physically vigorous. In addition, we agree with OPM that there are fiscal reasons consistent with Congress' purpose of creating FERS that make a regulatory time limit for requesting LEO coverage a reasonable interpretation of the statute. Because of their earlier retirement eligibility and more generous annuity computation formula, the "normal-cost percentage" that agencies are required to pay into the Retirement Fund for FERS LEO employees is currently 25.6 percent of basic pay, more than twice the "normal-cost percentage" that agencies are required to contribute for employees generally. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. part 841, subpart D, appendix A. OPM posits that if an employee is permitted to wait until near the end of his or her career to make a claim of entitlement to FERS LEO service credit for up to twenty-five years of service, an agency could be forced to pay into the Retirement Fund, out of tightly-budgeted salaries and expense appropriations, a lump-sum amount greater than what it paid into the Retirement Fund over the course of the employee's career. OPM also contends that the Retirement Fund would have lost all of the interest income that the belatedly-made retirement contributions would have earned, a loss that could never be recovered, creating an unfunded liability for FERS annuities in the Retirement Fund, and violating the principle underlying the FERS funding statutes that FERS annuities be fully funded. In further support of early FERS LEO coverage determinations, OPM correctly asserts that, with the passage of time, the question of whether duties presently being performed by an individual were the same at a particular date in the past would become increasingly difficult to discern. Given these policy concerns, we find that section 842.804(c), which does include circumstances under which the six-month time limit may be waived, is a reasonable implementation of the FERS statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, Federal courts have upheld regulatory time limits where the statutes in question did not set forth time limits but did authorize the agencies to issue regulations to carry out their responsibilities under the statutes. For example, in <span class="Italic">Roman-Martinez v. Runyon,</span> 100 F.3d 213, 216-18 (1st Cir. 1996), the court upheld a similar exercise of regulatory authority by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) that requires Federal employees to contact EEO counselors within a specific time limit. The court noted that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Section 717 of Title VII does not set out the procedures, nor does it prescribe a limitations period, for the filing of grievances by a federal employee affected by an alleged unlawful practice. But it grants to the EEOC authority to "issue such rules, regulations, orders and instructions as it deems necessary and appropriate to carry out its responsibilities under this section." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(b) (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 216. Based on the plaintiffs' failure to meet the time limit, the court affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiffs' case. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 217-18. In <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 75 F.3d 639, 642-43 (Fed. Cir. 1996), the court held that the Board's time limit for mixed-case appeals (5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.154, 1201.22(c)) was issued pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(j) (1988), which provides that the Board "may prescribe regulations to carry out the purpose of this section." Citing <span class="Italic">Phillips v. United States Postal Service,</span> 695 F.2d 1389, 1390-91 (Fed. Cir. 1982), the court noted that the Board has discretion to "requir[e] that appeals be processed in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Board."<span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 643. In <span class="Italic">Azarkhish v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 915 F.2d 675, 677 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 1990), the court <span id="Page_4288"></span>applied 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.809(e)(2), which provides for an extension of the regulatory 30-day time limit for filing a request for reconsideration with OPM when the individual shows that he or she was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that he or she was prevented by, circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit. The court noted that it could not "say the latter regulation violates the statute it implements." OPM's authority for issuing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.809(e)(2) was derived from 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347, which provides in part that OPM shall, except as otherwise provided, prescribe such regulations as are necessary and proper to carry out subchapter III of chapter 83 (Civil Service Retirement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our finding that section 842.804(c) is valid is consistent with the decision in <span class="Italic">Bingaman v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 127 F.3d 1431, 1441 (Fed. Cir. 1997), where the court not only applied section 842.804(c), but explained the rational interplay between sections 842.804(c) and 842.807(a):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The effect of these two regulatory provisions is that if the employee does not request LEO credit within the six-month period specified in section 842.804(c), or show good cause for the failure to do so, the agency's determination will be deemed conclusive and the MSPB will not review the merits of that determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The absence of formal, written requests by the appellants for LEO retirement coverage does not deprive the Board of jurisdiction over these appeals.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction is not plenary; it is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.807(a), "[t]he final decision of an agency denying an individual's request for approval of a position as a rigorous...position made under &#x00A7; 842.804(c) may be appealed to the...Board under procedures prescribed by the Board." OPM's notice promulgating section 842.807(a) similarly specifies that any final agency decision "denying an individual's request for position approval" may be appealed to the Board, and that OPM was amending section 842.807 (1992) ("The final decision of an agency head under &#x00A7; 842.803 may be appealed to the...Board under procedures prescribed by the Board.") to "clarify that only agency denial decisions made in response to individual requests under &#x00A7; 842.804(c) are subject to appeal...." 57 Fed. Reg. 32,685, 32,689 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has applied the request requirement in prior cases involving 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.807(a) or its CSRS counterpart. <span class="Italic">See Scott v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 42, 45-46 (1996) (finding that a document, filed by the appellant with his employing agency and erroneously treated by the administrative judge as a mere grievance, was a "qualifying request for a decision" seeking treatment as an LEO within the meaning of CSRS and FERS). Indeed, such a request for coverage was found to be a jurisdictional requirement in our prior decision in these appeals. There we found that "the Board's jurisdiction is limited to agency decisions made in response to employees' formal, written requests for LEO retirement coverage," that the record showed the existence of a final agency decision determining that the appellants were not entitled to LEO retirement coverage but did not indicate when, or if, the appellants submitted formal, written requests for such coverage, and that remand therefore was necessary "for resolution of this issue." <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald,</span> 70 M.S.P.R. at 155<span class="Italic">.</span> On remand, the appellants admitted that they did not make formal, written requests. They asserted that the agency on its own initiative issued a decision that denied them LEO coverage and provided them with notice of Board appeal rights which they promptly followed in filing their appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald,</span> the Board cited <span class="Italic">DeVitto v. Department of Transportation</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 354 (1994), for the principle that the Board's jurisdiction under sections 842.807(a) and 842.804(c) "is limited to agency decisions made in response to employees' formal, written requests for LEO retirement coverage, and agency decisions cannot be challenged unless the requests were made within the six-month filing period, or unless preponderant evidence establishes good cause for the failure to make them in a timely manner." Without further explanation, the AJ and the parties interpreted this statement and the applicable regulations to mean that, even in the absence of a formal, written request for coverage, the agency decision could still be "challenged" if there was good cause for a failure to make a request at all.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review of the remand initial decision, the agency asserts that the Board lacks jurisdiction over these appeals because the appellants never made formal, written requests for an LEO retirement coverage determination. In its <span class="Italic">amicus</span> brief, OPM asserts that the appellants' failure to submit formal, written requests to the agency, in contravention of OPM regulations, means that proper applications for LEO coverage were never filed with the agency, that the agency did not have the authority to prescribe different procedures for FERS LEO claims than those established at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.804(c), and that the agency, therefore, had no authority to issue a decision on a FERS LEO claim that is appealable to the Board. Thus, OPM argues that it has delegated its authority to employing agencies to make LEO determinations and that such determinations must be made in accordance with the regulations delegating that authority. Based on this reasoning, OPM asserts that an agency's FERS LEO coverage determination, unless it is made in response to a formal, written request, is not an "action or order" giving rise to a Board appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1). By contrast, NTEU, AFGE, NAGE, and FLEOA all argue that the lack of a request does not deprive the Board of jurisdiction in these appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have determined that the regulations in question may be read in such a way as to eliminate any requirement that a formal request be made before appealing to the Board. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.807(a), final agency decisions denying requests for LEO coverage "made under &#x00A7; 842.804(c)" may be appealed to the Board. Section 842.804(c), however, by its very terms provides for rebuttal of the presumption of correctness of the agency head's determination where an employee is "unaware of his or her status or was prevented by cause beyond his or her control from requesting that the official status be changed at the time the service was performed." We conclude, therefore, that sections 842.804(c) and 842.807(a), when read together, contemplate that the Board will review the merits of an agency's LEO coverage determination, even though no request has been made by the employee, where the employee was unaware of his status or unable to make such a request because of circumstances beyond his control.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This reading finds support in <span class="Italic">Bingaman,</span> 127 F.3d at 1442, where the court held that "the six-month rule of section 842.804(c) does not apply if an employee proves that he was unaware of his status or that some cause beyond his control prevented him from making a request." Although the court agreed with the Board that the Adair petitioners did not make formal, written requests for LEO coverage, the court went on to note that the petitioners did not contend that the six-month rule was inapplicable "for either of those reasons," thereby suggesting that Board review would not be denied, despite the absence of formal, written requests, if the petitioners could prove that they were unaware of their status or that cause beyond their control prevented them from making a request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to OPM's argument, section 842.804(c) does not provide that employing agencies may only issue final, Board-appealable LEO determinations when employees have made formal, written requests for such determinations. Indeed, we find nothing in 5 C.F.R. part 842, subpart H that restricts agencies from issuing LEO retirement determinations in the absence of formal, written requests from employees. The regulation merely provides that, if an employee is in a position not subject to the one-half percent higher withholding rate of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8422(a)(2)(B), and the employee does not, within six months after entering the position or after any significant change in the position, formally and in writing seek a determination from the employing agency that his position is properly covered by the higher withholding rate, the agency head's determination that the service was not so covered at the time of the service is presumed to be correct. Section 842.804(c) provides an agency with the benefit of a rebuttable presumption if these conditions are met regardless of whether its decision is made in response to a formal, written request or not. Therefore, it would be incorrect to say that the agency exceeded its authority under the delegation by OPM and that its decision is therefore not subject to review by the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM asserts that a formal, written request requirement is reasonable because it would help create a written record for the Board of the nature of the evidence and arguments that the individual presented to die agency, "avoid any miscommunication that might otherwise occur between the employee and the agency concerning exactly what arguments the employee has raised in support of his claim of eligibility for FERS LEO coverage," and better enable OPM to fulfill its oversight function under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.808 by allowing it to ascertain the issues that were considered in any FERS LEO coverage claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we agree that a formal, written request requirement <span class="Italic">could</span> be part of a process designed to help create a written record of the issues involved in a given FERS LEO coverage determination, OPM's regulations do not provide that employees may submit, along with their written requests, argument and/or evidence regarding why they believe their positions are covered. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.804(c). Agencies are not required to inform their employees of their right to make such a request, <span class="Italic">see Bingaman,</span> 127 F.3d at 1442, let alone required to inform their employees that they may submit argument and evidence that will be part of a written record. Thus, any request requirement does not automatically assist in the creation of a written record for OPM and Board review. Moreover, statute and precedent require <span class="Italic">de novo</span> proceedings before the Board on the substance of the employee's claim. <span class="Italic">See Elias v. Department of Defense,</span> 114 F.3d 1164, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (interpreting the CSRS LEO regulations as providing for <span class="Italic">de novo</span> Board review of agency LEO coverage determinations).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that mandating that an employee request an agency determination as to his or her LEO retirement status after a final agency decision has already been made contradicts any notion of judicial and <span id="Page_4289"></span>administrative efficiency. The head of the agency has already considered and decided the issue and served notice on the affected employees, and we perceive no reason for the agency in have to repeat its procedures. Requiring that an employee make a formal, written request after the agency has issued a final determination on LEO coverage would obligate the employee and the agency to needlessly expend resources for no practical purpose. These appellants have no reason to believe that the agency would issue a different decision based on a formal, written request. The record shows that the ASDPR specifically instructed the Department of the Navy in August 1993, to "[p]lease ensure that the employees in the positions not recommended for coverage are notified of their rights to appeal this determination to the...Board...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM contends that, because the agency stands in OPM's place under the delegation of authority, "it is as if OPM had not received a request for reconsideration in a FERS retirement matter, and had not issued a reconsideration decision. In such circumstances, there is no right of appeal to the Board." OPM cites <span class="Italic">Slater v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. 405, 407 (1984), in support of this argument. We agree with OPM that the agency stands in OPM's place under the delegation of authority. Nevertheless, because the agency has issued a final LEO coverage determination, and there is no indication that it will issue another final decision, it is as if OPM had issued such a final determination or had issued an initial determination and refused to issue a reconsideration decision. <span class="Italic">See McNeese v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. 70, 73-74 (where OPM has not issued a reconsideration decision and does not intend to do so, its initial decision serves as a final decision over which the Board can exercise jurisdiction), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 40 F.3d 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). Although OPM may have decided that it will only rule on retirement issues in response to written requests, we have found nothing in 5 C.F.R. part 842, subpart H that prevents agencies from issuing final LEO coverage determinations in the absence of formal, written requests.[8] <span class="Italic">Slater,</span> which stands for the proposition that the Board has jurisdiction to review OPM's denial of an individual's application for a survivor annuity only if the decision is sustained by OPM on reconsideration, is inapposite here. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.109(c) (a decision initially rendered at the highest level of review available within OPM will not be subject to reconsideration, but will give an appeal right directly to the Board).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Although, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(c), OPM (or its designee) shall adjudicate all "claims" under the provisions of chapter 84 administered by OPM, we do not read this provision as prohibiting OPM or its designee from making a decision on retirement coverage in the absence of a claim. Rather, we view this provision as merely requiring that OPM or its designee adjudicate all claims that are made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The agency's petition for review is denied.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts on review that the AJ erred in finding that the Board had jurisdiction over the appeals of the appellants Fitzgerald, Brown, and McGrail. We discern no error, however, in the AJ's determination that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.804(c) does not apply to these appellants. The regulation applies to employees "in a position not subject to the one-half percent higher withholding rate of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8422(a)(2)(B)." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.804(c). As the AJ found, because these appellants were originally placed in the LEO retirement plan upon appointment to their positions, and remained in that plan for much longer than six months, the regulatory provision that they make a formal, written request within six months after entering their positions does not apply. It would make no sense for these appellants to have been required to make such a request within six months of their appointments when they were already deemed by the agency to be LEOs. Further, the AJ correctly found that the agency did not show that there were any significant changes in their positions; the Standard Form (SF) 50s issued to inform these appellants that they had received within-grade increases or performance awards was not a significant change in their positions. Thus, the appellants could not have filed a request for coverage within six months "after any significant change in the position," as set forth in the regulation. As previously found, the lack of a formal, written request for coverage from these appellants does not deprive the Board of jurisdiction over their appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The petition for review of the appellants Lloyd, Mickens, and Turner is granted.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under section 842.804(c), the presumption of correctness of an agency head's determination that service is not covered by the higher, LEO withholding rate "may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee was unaware of his or her status or was prevented by cause beyond his or her control from requesting that the official status be changed at the time the service was performed." The appellants Lloyd, Mickens, and Turner do not contend that they were prevented by cause beyond their control from requesting determinations as to their LEO status. Rather, they maintain that they were unaware of their non-LEO status until they received the agency's notice informing them that they were not covered and that they could appeal this determination to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that the appellants were "aware, or should have been aware" of their status based on their statements that they received SF 50s at the time of their appointments indicating in block 30 that they were in the "FERS and FICA" retirement plan. The AJ found that the bottom of these documents instructed the appellants to "turn over for important information," and that the back of the documents explained that "FERS" meant Federal Employees' Retirement System, and that "FERS-Spec" meant Federal Employees' Retirement System for law enforcement and firefighter personnel. The AJ found that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The fact that they denied looking at the back of the form does not relieve them from their responsibility to review the information that the agency supplied to them at the time they were hired. I conclude, therefore, that the agency notified these appellants in writing at the time of their appointments that they were not in the LEO retirement plan, that the appellants did not submit a formal, written request seeking a determination that their positions were properly covered by the higher withholding rate, and that they have failed to show by preponderant evidence that they were unaware of their status at the time of their appointments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The test in these cases, however, is not whether the appellants should have been aware that there were two types of retirements benefits (for non-LEOs and for LEOs) and that they were not considered to be LEOs. Nor is the test whether the agency notified, or attempted to notify, the appellants of their status. Instead, section 842.804(c) provides for the successful rebuttal of the presumption of correctness of the agency head's determination when the appellants prove by preponderant evidence that they were "unaware" of their status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellants testified without contradiction that they were unaware of their non-LEO status until they received the agency's decision on their coverage in December 1993, and that they did not understand what the abbreviations on their SF-50s stood for, nor did they read the back of their SF-50s. This testimony is consistent with the affidavits the appellants submitted on this issue. Based on the fact that they occupied Police Officer positions, the appellants testified that they had no reason to believe that they were not also LEOs entitled to LEO-based special retirement benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...While the appellants' receipt of the SF-50s is evidence relevant to the issue of awareness of status, the SF-50s alone do not rebut the appellants' sworn statements and testimony on this issue. The agency presented no witnesses at the jurisdictional hearing, let alone other evidence demonstrating that the appellants were aware of their non-LEO status before December 1993. Moreover, we do not find it inherently improbable that the appellants would fail to read the back of documents such as SF-50s. Indeed, the AJ did not specifically find this testimony incredible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the appellants have shown by preponderant evidence that they were unaware of their non-LEO status until December 1993. <span class="Italic">See Caponio,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. at 678-79 (the appellant's specific testimony that he was unaware of his LEO status was not rebutted by the general testimony of an agency witness that all new employees received information on their status, and constituted preponderant evidence of his unawareness)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellants are not entitled to LEO retirement coverage.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to qualify for LEO retirement coverage pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8412(d)(2), the appellants must show that they meet the definition of a law enforcement officer as set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17). For purposes of this appeal, the term "law enforcement officer" means an employee, the duties of whose position: (1) Are primarily the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States; and (2) are sufficiently rigorous that employment opportunities should be limited to young and physically vigorous individuals. In determining whether the appellants meet the requirements of establishing their entitlement to LEO retirement coverage, the Board must examine all relevant evidence, including the position description. <span class="Italic">Ferrier v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. 342, 345 (1994). The appellants, as applicants for LEO retirement coverage, bear the burden of proving their entitlement to it by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties stipulated that the appellants investigate, arrest, and apprehend individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States, including the traffic laws of the State of New Jersey, which have been expressly adopted and made applicable to the Naval Air Engineering Station, Lakehurst, New Jersey. At issue, then, is whether those duties are the appellants' "primary" duties, and whether the duties of the position are sufficiently rigorous that employment opportunities should be limited to young and physically vigorous individuals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Primary duties are those that: (a) Are paramount in influence or weight; that is, constitute the basic reasons for the existence of the position; <span id="Page_4290"></span>(b) occupy a substantial portion of the individual's working time over a typical work cycle; and (c) are assigned on a regular and recurring basis. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802. In general, if an employee spends an average of at least fifty percent of his or her time performing a duty or group of duties, they are his or her primary duties. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the investigation, arrest, and apprehension duties stipulated to by the parties do not constitute the basic reason for the existence of the Police Officer positions, i.e., they are not paramount in influence or weight, and thus are not "primary" duties. The position description for the GS-083-05 Police Officer position, which essentially describes the duties of all of the appellants, provides that the purpose of the position is to serve as a Police Officer for an assigned shift or tour of duty and to perform a variety of police tasks. (Testimony of Patrick Lloyd that this was his official position description); (testimony of Patrick Breaux, Security Director, that the supervisory and lead police officers perform the same duties as the police officers, but also have administrative and supervisory duties). "Police Officers maintain law enforcement of the entire [Naval Air Engineering] Center, involving the protection of life and property, maintaining law and order, traffic safety and control, enforcing all applicable Federal and state statutes, Navy regulations and command orders and regulations." Duties performed include:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;Performs duties of prevention and detection of crimes, by conducting routine patrols of assigned area or post in a radio equipped police vehicle or on foot and submit reports for appropriate action as required. Enforces NAEC base regulations, performs traffic control duties and in accordance with N.J. Title 39 motor vehicle code and personnel or visitor behavior, pet ownership, hunting, fishing and housing regulations, etc. Recognizes the characteristics of alcohol intoxication and drug abuse, identifies and field test suspected drug material, and blood and alcohol testing with the breathalyzer. Provides armed escort for money deposits or services, VIP's, ammunition and explosives or other valuable cargo.

Must preserve and process physical evidence, interview witnesses, victims and suspects and write a comprehensive report. 25%</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">3.&#x2003;Apprehend/detain without a warrant, any person committing any such offense or [sic] reasonable grounds to believe that person/s have committed a felony in the presence of a member of the police force. 10%</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">4.&#x2003;Apprehend/detain under a warrant an[y] person accused of having committed an offense against the laws of the United States or against any rule or regulation prescribed under pertinent laws. 5%</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5.&#x2003;Performs other related miscellaneous duties as assigned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A Request for Personnel Action form signed by Breaux shows that the position description for all of the Police Officer positions was amended to indicate that, as of April 23, 1992:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[P]olice officers are to directly engage in investigations, apprehensions, and detentions of persons suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States. Police Officers will take part in all facets of the on going investigation. Investigations will involve searching crime scenes for clues and evidence, interviewing witnesses, following leads, analyzing and evaluating evidence, locating suspects and making apprehensions. Inquiries into criminal cases will require the police officer to conduct extensive research, interviewing, planning, observing, conducting stakeouts, and executing investigative techniques. Police officers will be required to perform duties in a semi-covert capacity in order to detect and prevent criminal activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This amendment appears to be the result of an April 23, 1992 "process improvement" recommendation assigning the investigation of petty theft and misdemeanor cases to the patrol division to allow the detectives on the base to pursue more critical tasks. Thus, we find that these investigative duties do not appear to be the basic reason for the existence of the appellants' positions, but instead appear to be supplemental duties designed to reduce the workload of the detectives on the base.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the appellants spend most of their time patrolling. (Testimony of Patrick Lloyd that he spends at least seven hours of his eight and one-half hour day patrolling); (Testimony of Breaux that police officers are expected to patrol between 70 and 80 percent of the time). As set forth in the Navy Law Enforcement Manual, patrol operations provide a multitude of both crime and non-crime related services, such as crime prevention and deterrence, apprehension of criminals, provision of non-crime related services, provision of a sense of base security and satisfaction, and traffic enforcement and control. Breaux similarly testified that the mission of the police officers was to provide for the safety and security of the installation by detecting and preventing crime. James McGrail testified that his job was to detect <span class="Italic">and</span> deter crime. ("We deter crime just by being in the area, people see the police presence. My job is to protect life and property through law enforcement."). OPM's Position-Classification Standards for GS-083 police positions provides that most police officers are engaged in patrol duties and/or traffic control, and in performing patrol duties "serve as a deterrent to crime and other violations of laws, rules, and regulations. Crime prevention is enhanced by the presence of uniformed officers in an area and by their being continually alert in observing, inspecting, and investigating circumstances or individuals which appear unusual and suspicious. In sum, the Police Officer positions exist for a multitude of reasons, including deterring crime, providing escorts, assisting in non-criminal emergency situations, and providing traffic control at the front gate, and not "primarily" for conducting investigations. We therefore find that the appellants' investigation and apprehension duties are not "paramount in influence or weight," and do not constitute the basic reason for the existence of the Police Officer positions. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802 (definition of "primary duties").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the appellants have not shown that their duties investigating, arresting, and apprehending criminal suspects occupy a "substantial portion of their working time over a typical work cycle." While patrolling, the appellants may stop individuals for traffic-related reasons or stop individuals in restricted areas of the base, question the individuals, and take appropriate action. These types of stops constitute investigations of individuals suspected of wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">See Ferrier,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. at 347, <span class="Italic">supra</span> (stopping individuals possibly involved in wrongdoing, questioning them to determine if they had violated any law or regulation, and taking appropriate action depending upon the observations, the individual's responses, and other information, constituted investigations; even a traffic stop constituted such an investigation because the driver is questioned about his or her license, vehicle registration, and similar facts). The appellants also, for example, check buildings to ascertain whether they are secure, and investigate unsecured buildings for evidence of trespassers or burglary. One appellant was once involved in a "stake out" with an agency detective of a building that was to be burglarized. The appellants have not shown, however, that these types of activities, which involve investigating suspected criminal conduct, constitute their primary duties, as required by statute. Rather, their general patrolling duties would more appropriately constitute "protecting life and property, guarding against or inspecting for violations of law, or investigating persons other than those suspected of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States," all of which are duties that do not qualify under OPM's regulation as LEO duties. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802. Although the Navy Law Enforcement Manual indicates that there are "suspect oriented patrols," which focus on specific individuals or classes of suspects and may include the provision of photographs and background information concerning known suspects, there is no indication in the record that this is the type of patrolling the appellants usually do.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have found in the CSRS context, <span class="Italic">see Hobbs v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 628, 633 (1993), the term "investigation" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17) of FERS should be construed as "criminal investigation." Criminal investigations involve unusual physical hazards for the investigator, deriving from frequent contacts with criminals and suspected criminals and their desire to avoid criminal prosecution. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Our determination that these appellants are not entitled to LEO coverage finds support in <span class="Italic">Bingaman,</span> where the court approved of certain factors found by the Board to denote an LEO within the contemplation of the statue. An LEO commonly: (1) Has frequent direct contact with criminal suspects; (2) is authorized to carry a firearm; (3) interrogates witnesses and suspects, giving <span class="Italic">Miranda</span> warnings when appropriate; (4) works for long periods without a break; (5) is on call 24 hours a day; and (6) is required to maintain a level of physical fitness. <span class="Italic">Bingaman,</span> 127 F.3d at 1434.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties stipulated that the appellants are required to carry weapons and to be certified on those weapons, and the appellants give <span class="Italic">Miranda</span> warnings, and interrogate witnesses and suspects. Nevertheless, we find that the appellants have not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that they have frequent contact with criminal suspects. The appellants spend most of their time patrolling, and their duties not only involve investigations that may bring them into contact with criminal suspects, but also involve providing armed escort for money deposits, VIP's, ammunition, explosives, or other valuable cargo, responding to emergencies, and such activities as taking information from complainants, writing reports, responding to accidents on the base, and helping individuals who have been locked out of their cars. One appellant testified that he did not know how often he came in contact with criminals. Breaux testified that between 15 and 30 individuals were arrested during 1994. The appellants investigate a substantial number <span id="Page_4291"></span>of potential crimes, such as larceny and destruction of government property, that do not typically result in contact with criminal suspects. (Security Department Incident/Complaint Reports for 1993) (most of one of the appellant's incident/complaint reports involved larcenies of personal property and damage to government property). Although the appellants took courses in such topics as search and seizure, crimes in progress, crowd control, terrorism, and rape, one appellant admitted that those were "not an everyday situation here, but you are liable to come across any one of these topics as a crime somewhere during the course of your career. While the appellants' duties at times and as needed do include investigation, apprehension, and detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States, we find that the appellants have not shown by preponderant evidence that these are the primary duties of their positions, as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17)(A)(i)(1). <span class="Italic">See Bingaman,</span> 127 F.3d at 1434.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find for the reasons discussed below that the appellants have not shown that the duties of their positions are "sufficiently rigorous that employment opportunities should be limited to young and physically vigorous individuals." The appellants do not typically work for long periods without a break. Although the appellants "occasionally" work overtime, they can refuse to work overtime. There is also no indication that the appellants are on call 24 hours a day. Rather, they work eight and one-half hour shifts. Finally, although the appellants must undergo an annual physical examination, they are not required to maintain a particular level of physical fitness by, for example, passing a physical fitness stress test; <span class="Italic">cf. Ferrier v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 241, 245 (1995) (the appellant had to pass a five-event Physical Fitness Battery). In sum, although the appellants carry weapons and interrogate suspects and witnesses, they do not have frequent contact with criminal suspects, do not work long periods without a break, are not on call 24 hours a day, and are not required to maintain a particular level of physical fitness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Police Officer positions involve occasional physical challenges, such as breaking up domestic violence fights, (one appellant was involved in ten domestic violence incidents in one year), and foot chases (foot chases are "not every day" but "do[&#8197;] occur"), our conclusions regarding the above factors suggest that the appellants have not shown that the duties of their positions are sufficiently rigorous that employment opportunities should be limited to young and physically vigorous individuals. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17)(A)(ii). We disagree with the AJ that there is an irrebuttable presumption that the duties of the appellants' positions are rigorous because they must wear bullet-proof vest while on duty. That the agency, in an abundance of caution, seeks to protect its employees from the possibility of severe physical injury or death does not mean that the actual duties of the Police Officer positions are sufficiently rigorous to meet the requirements of the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are a number of factors that distinguish this appeal from <span class="Italic">Ferrier</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 349, where we ordered the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to award LEO credit under the CSRS for an employee's service as a Police Officer. The agency in <span class="Italic">Ferrier</span> had four Police Officers patrolling the entire refuge, <span class="Italic">see Ferrier</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 345, whereas approximately 37 individuals in the police division patrol the agency's grounds. In addition, there is no indication that there were other employees in <span class="Italic">Ferrier</span> doing investigative work, while in this appeal there are detectives and officers of the Naval Investigative Service who are the primary criminal investigators for the agency. The number of officers patrolling an area and performing investigations affects the nature of the duties performed and the frequency of an officer's interaction with criminals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the refuge in <span class="Italic">Ferrier</span> was located immediately adjacent to a large urban area, and the duties of the Police Officers were fully commensurate with city police officers. <span class="Italic">Ferrier</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 345. By contrast, there is no indication in the record that the naval base is located adjacent to a large urban area, and the duties of the Police Officers here are not "fully commensurate" with city police officers. (Arrest authority comes from the commanding officer) (the appellants did not have the authority to arrest personnel out in the community). The Police Officers in <span class="Italic">Ferrier</span> had full law enforcement authority in the communities in which the refuge was located, <span class="Italic">see Ferrier</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 347 n.4, while the appellants herein have no authority to arrest civilians who are located off base, other than under citizen arrest principles. In fact, the appellants must contact the local police department to effect arrests of civilians living in government-owned housing adjacent to the base.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note a difference in the apparent nature of the areas patrolled. In <span class="Italic">Ferrier,</span> the Police Officers patrolled a wildlife refuge. Here, the appellants patrol a naval base where access is restricted. (Persons entering the base were generally required to stop and get a pass), 168 (the agency conducted periodic unannounced searches and drug-dog searches at the gate) (vehicles entering the base were required to have a decal or day pass). Most of the individuals on the base were civilian employees and military personnel, not members of the general public. Finally, Ferrier had to pass an annual five-event Physical Fitness Battery in addition to an annual physical examination, while these appellants must only pass an annual physical examination. Balancing all of the pertinent factors under statute, regulation, and case law, we conclude that the appellants have not met their burden of showing that they have met the requirements which would entitle them to LEO coverage.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The presumption of validity of an agency LEO determination, if review is belatedly sought, was reiterated in <span class="Italic">Slater v. DHS</span>, SF-3443-15-0322-I-1 (NP 1/21/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.804(c), an employee must file a formal, written request for LEO coverage within 6 months after entering the position in question, or within 6 months of any significant change in the position. The regulation further provides that failure to make a timely request will result in a presumption that the agency head's determination of noncoverage was correct, unless the employee can show by a preponderance of the evidence that he was unaware of his status or that he was prevented from making a timely request by cause beyond his control. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, compliance with the 6-month time limit of section 842.804(c) is not a jurisdictional requirement. <span class="Italic">See Slater</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 378, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Trivett v. Department of the Navy</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 61, &#x00B6; 5 (1999). In any event, the regulatory 6-month time limit is deemed to be waived unless the agency denies coverage on that basis. <span class="Italic">Slater</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 378, &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">Trivett</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 61, &#x00B6; 5. While the agency in this case has not issued a formal decision on the merits, as occurred in <span class="Italic">Trivett</span> and the appellant's previous appeals, it nonetheless has declined to invoke the 6-month time limit, and we give it no further consideration.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mosely v. VA</span>, 86 MSPR 302 (2000) (appellant testified without contradiction that they were unaware of their non-LEO status until 1995 when they filed their request for coverage); <span class="Italic">Menendez v. OPM</span>, 83 MSPR 582, 585 &#x00B6; 8 (1999) (delay not excused because the appellant was not aware of the regulation permitting a request for LEO coverage); <span class="Italic">Davis v. DOD</span>, 82 MSPR 347 (1999) (examining circumstances involving both CSRS and FERS LEO coverage and concluding the appellant unreasonably delayed request for LEO determinations from the agency); <span class="Italic">Mahoney v. VA</span>, 81 MSPR 65, 69 &#x00B6; 11 (1999) ("these appellants were actually aware of their status when they began their service with the agency, and the Board may only decide the merits of their claims if they can establish that good cause exists for their delay in timely requesting a change in status. They argue that good cause exists because the agency never informed them that they could make such a request, or the procedures for doing so, and that they, in fact, made their requests promptly after learning that such requests were possible. The Board has held, however, that an agency is not obligated to inform employees about the right to request a change in status or the procedures for making such a request, and the lack of notice does not excuse the failure to make a timely request. <span class="Italic">See Fitzgerald</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. at 13-14, 18-19."); <span class="Italic">Margrey v. DOD</span>, 81 MSPR 42, 46-47 &#x00B6; 9 (1999) ("where an employee was placed in the LEO retirement plan upon appointment to the position in question and remained in that plan for more than 6 months, the provision of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.804(c) requiring a formal, written request for LEO coverage within 6 months after entry into the position is inapplicable. <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. at 20.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Applying its 1998 <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald</span> decision, the Board looked for actual unawareness of LEO status to determine whether to excuse delay in seeking a ruling. Finding no evidence of unawareness, the Board returned an appeal to the AJ for further development, <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. DOD</span>, 80 MSPR 636, 638-39 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to receive LEO service credit under FERS, an employee who is in a position whose basic pay of which is not subject to the higher retirement withholding rate applicable to LEOs must seek formally and in writing a determination from his employing agency that his position is properly covered by the higher withholding rate. If the employee does not seek such a determination within 6 months after entering the position or after any significant change in duties, the agency's determination that the employee's service was not so covered is presumed to be correct. The employee may rebut that presumption by preponderant evidence that he was unaware of his status or was prevented by circumstances beyond his control from requesting that his official status be changed at the time of his service in the position. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.804(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, on remand, in addressing the merits of the appellants' requests for LEO service credit, the administrative judge must determine whether they can rebut the presumption that the agency's decision is correct. We disagree with the administrative judge's conclusion that appellants Hamilton and Stevenson did not allege that they were unaware of their status. In their response to the administrative judge's show cause order, their representative stated that the appellants "made a request for [LEO] status in a timely manner once they became aware of their status. Hamilton in his affidavit stated that "he first became aware he was not covered by the retirement system for law enforcement officers...on July 16, 1996." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Stevenson stated in his affidavit, "He became aware of his right to the special retirement coverage for [LEOs] ...in May 1996." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. While Stevenson's affidavit is not as clear as Hamilton's in stating that he was unaware of his LEO status, we find that, when read in the context of the response to the show cause order, it constitutes a nonfrivolous <span id="Page_4292"></span>allegation that he was unaware of his LEO status. Hill's affidavit is even less clear, but the administrative judge shall afford it the proper evidentiary weight on remand. Furthermore, the appellants will have an opportunity on remand to supplement the record, with testimony if they desire, regarding their lack of awareness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contended below that each appellant received an SF-50 documenting his appointment to the Police Officer position and identifying his retirement system as FERS at block 30 of the form. According to the agency, on the back of this SF-50 was explanatory language informing the appellants that the retirement system for employees with LEO status was designated FERS-Spec at block 30. The appellants' SF-50s contained only the FERS designation at block 30, thus indicating that their positions did not have LEO status. In <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Department of Defense</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 1, 21-22 (1998), the Board held that, when an appellant asserts that he was unaware of his LEO status, the test is not whether the appellant should have been aware of the existence of LEO coverage or whether the agency notified or attempted to notify him of his status, but whether he was actually unaware of that status. The Board rejected the same argument made here regarding the information on the back of the SF-50 designating the appellant as FERS, finding that the SF-50 alone was insufficient to rebut the appellants' sworn statements that they were actually unaware of their status. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Here, as in <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald</span>, the SF-50s constitute evidence relevant to but not dispositive of the issue of whether the appellants were unaware of their status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If, on remand, the administrative judge determines that the appellants were unaware of their lack of LEO status or were prevented by circumstances beyond their control from requesting that their official status be changed at the time of their service in their positions and thus that the presumption that agency's decision is correct has been rebutted, she shall determine whether the duties of their positions qualify them for LEO service credit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The time limits for an LEO determination can be waived by the agency, <span class="Italic">Tirvett v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 83 MSPR 61, 63-64 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The time limit of section 842.804(c) is not a substantive condition of eligibility for LEO coverage mandated by statute, but instead is a procedural, "regulatory time limit." <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Department of Defense</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 1, 10 (1998). As such, it is waived if not enforced at the employing agency level. In the context of an agency determination as to an employee's entitlement to LEO service credit under FERS, this means that the time limit for filing a formal, written request for coverage is waived unless the agency denies coverage on this basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the agency denied the appellant's request for LEO service credit on the merits, i.e., it determined that the appellant's position did not meet the statutory and regulatory definitions for LEO service credit identified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802. The agency's decision contained no discussion whatever of the timeliness of the appellant's request. By issuing a decision on the appellant's substantive eligibility for LEO coverage, the agency waived the time limit of section 842.804(c), and whether the appellant met either of the exceptions of that section is irrelevant. In the instant case, the agency denied the appellant's request for LEO service credit on the merits, i.e., it determined that the appellant's position did not meet the statutory and regulatory definitions for LEO service credit identified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802. The agency's decision contained no discussion whatever of the timeliness of the appellant's request. By issuing a decision on the appellant's substantive eligibility for LEO coverage, the agency waived the time limit of section 842.804(c), and whether the appellant met either of the exceptions of that section is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a decision that would be reversed by the Federal Circuit, the Board strictly construed OPM regulations requiring that a request for LEO CSRS coverage or credit be made within a year of the covered service. Explaining and applying OPM regulations, <span class="Italic">Elias v. DOD</span>, 73 MSPR 52, 56-58 (1997) (rev'd and remanded, <span class="Italic">Elias v. DOD</span>, 114 F.3d 1164, 1166-68 (Fed. Cir. 1997), <span class="Italic">post</span>), stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction to hear an appeal of an agency head's final decision issued to a former employee as the result of a request for LEO service credit filed under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.906. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.910(a). Contrary to the agency's argument below and on review, this regulatory grant of jurisdiction does not limit the Board's review to decisions on the merits of a request for LEO service credit. Because an agency head has issued a final decision to the appellant denying his request for LEO service credit made pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.906, the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.906(e), when an individual requests LEO service credit from his employing or former employing agency,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Coverage in a position or credit for past service will not be granted for a period greater than 1 year prior to the date that the request from an individual is received...by the employing agency [or] the agency where past service was performed....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge correctly found, the appellant's request must have been filed by June 5, 1961 to be timely. His request is therefore more than 30 years untimely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The 1-year regulatory deadline may be waived under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.906(f) under the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An agency head...may extend the time limit for filing when, in the judgment of such agency head..., the individual shows that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency implicitly found that the appellant was not prevented by circumstances beyond his control from making a request within the time limit, and the agency declined to waive the deadline. Section 831.906(f) clearly contemplates that the decision to waive or not waive the filing deadline is a matter within the agency head's discretion.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Because the appellant retired in 1981, the Board assumes that this is a Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) case. Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) cases involve a different regulatory deadline and a different standard of Board review. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.804(c) (6-month deadline for requesting LEO service credit under FERS; where the employee does not meet the deadline, the agency's service credit determination is presumed correct; the employee may rebut the presumption by preponderant evidence showing that he was unaware of his LEO status or that he was prevented by circumstances beyond his control from timely requesting LEO service credit). Because the CSRS and FERS standards are not substantially similar, cases decided under FERS do not apply in this appeal. <span class="Italic">See Fitzgerald v. Department of the Navy,</span> 70 M.S.P.R. 152 (1996); <span class="Italic">Caponio v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 633 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 701, <span class="Italic">et seq.,</span> courts must set aside agency actions, findings, and conclusions found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2)(A). Because the Board has jurisdiction to review the agency's decision denying the appellant's request for LEO service credit as untimely, we stand in a position analogous to that of a reviewing court, and we adopt the APA standard of review set forth above. The Board will set aside the agency's timeliness determination if it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant retired in 1981. He seeks LEO service credit for service that concluded in 1960. He is receiving LEO service credit for his pre-1955 service with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He had the right to request LEO service credit for his post-1955 service at the time of his 1981 retirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.901, <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> (1981). He also had the opportunity to request LEO service credit after his retirement when regulations of the Office of Personnel Management provided that individuals could request LEO service credit for any period of prior service so long as the request was made by September 30, 1989. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.908(e) (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant did not file his request for LEO service credit until January 1993, well beyond both the current 1-year regulatory deadline and the September 30, 1989 deadline in effect in 1988-1989. By the time he filed his request, the appellant's position was no longer active. The agency has reasonably asserted that it would face an "inordinate burden" if it were required to attempt to reconstruct the actual duties of a position that the appellant has not occupied since 1960. Under the unique circumstances of this case, we find that the agency's decision not to waive the 1-year filing deadline was not arbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stein v. DOD</span>, 74 MSPR 521, 524 (1997) (under 5 CFR 831.906, the Board has jurisdiction over an appeal from an agency head's final decision on a request for LEO retirement service credit under the CSRS even when the request was untimely made and the agency head has declined to waive the regulatory time limit; the Board determined that the appellant's request for LEO retirement service credit was untimely).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit, not enamored with the Board's approach, recognized that the appellant could not have acted within a year, but acted with reasonable dispatch once he learned of the availability of LEO credit for his prior position, and reversed and remanded the decision for consideration on the merits, <span class="Italic">Elias v. DOD</span>, 114 F.3d 1164, 1166-68 (Fed. Cir. 1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the Board had no jurisdiction to review the agency's decision at all, citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.906(e) and (f). 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.906 contains regulations for law enforcement officer service credit under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(c). Subsections (e) and (f) provide:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(e)&#x2003;Coverage in a position or credit for past service will not be granted for a period greater than 1 year prior to the date that the request from an individual is received under paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section by the employing agency, the agency where past service was performed, or OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(f)&#x2003;An agency head...may extend the time limit for filing, when <span id="Page_4293"></span>in the judgment of such agency head or OPM, the individual shows that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's position is that the permissive language in subsection (f), that the "agency head...<span class="Italic">may</span> extend the time limit for filing," means that a decision as to timeliness is "vested solely" with the agency head and is not subject to the review procedures of the Civil Service Reform Act and the Merit Systems Protection Board. This position is not correct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board correctly held that the agency's decision concerning law enforcement officer service credit is appealable under the CSRA and is within the Board's jurisdiction. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.910, titled "Review of Decision," provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The following decisions may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;The final decision of an agency head or OPM issued to an employee, former employee, or survivor as the result of a request for determination filed under &#x00A7; 831.906....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction is not limited to decisions on entitlement to service credit, but also includes decisions concerning timeliness of an employee's application, <span class="Italic">viz.</span> the one-year period, &#x00A7; 831.906(e), and its extension based on "circumstances beyond his or her control," &#x00A7; 831.906(f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Elias contends that he was prevented by circumstances beyond his control from requesting law enforcement officer service credit within the regulatory time limit, thus meeting the criterion for waiver found in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.906(f). The full Board held that although the agency's decisions of waiver are reviewable, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) standard of review applies to the Board's review of agency action. The Board reasoned that on appeal of an agency action the Board "stand[s] in a position analogous to that of a reviewing court." That is incorrect. The Board is not "a reviewing court." The system of federal employment appeals under the CSRA is premised on the statutory procedure whereby the employee is entitled to full trial before an administrative judge of the Board, whereby the Board generates a record and reaches a decision based on its factual findings and fresh application of correct law to these facts. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a) ("An appellant shall have the right--(1) to a hearing for which a transcript will be kept;..."); <span class="Italic">Baker v. Department of Health and Human Servs.,</span> 912 F.2d 1448, 1456 (Fed. Cir. 1990)] :</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Even though the employee is the initiating party, the agency is required to establish its case to the Board by a preponderance of the evidence. [5 U.S.C.] &#x00A7; 7701(c). Under this standard, the 'appeal' requires a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> determination of the facts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus statute and precedent require <span class="Italic">de novo</span> proceedings before the Board on the substance of the employee's claim. The agency decision on substantive matters, to be sustained, must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence before the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B); <span class="Italic">Berube v. General Services Admin.,</span> 820 F.2d 396, 400 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Carducci v. Regan,</span> 714 F.2d 171 (D.C. Cir. 1983) the court explained that personnel actions within the remedial scheme of the CSRA are not subject to review under the standard of the APA. Although there are indeed areas, in the complexities of federal employment practices, wherein an agency's views may receive weight appropriate to its role in administering a particular rule, <span class="Italic">see Azarkhish v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 915 F.2d 675, 678 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (petitioner challenging the Office of Personnel Management's failure to extend the time limit for filing a request for reconsideration must show that the Office abused its discretion), the general statutory scheme of the CSRA is premised on the objectivity and nation-wide consistency of the Board as a centralized overseer of federal employment law. For example, in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 298-99 (1981), the MSPB pointed out that its authority to review and mitigate a penalty that the agency had imposed is broader than a court's authority to review and mitigate a penalty that the MSPB has imposed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus the Board erred in subordinating its own findings to those of the agency. The Board had properly conducted a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> determination of the facts; it was the administrative judge's findings that were before the full Board for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge held that Mr. Elias could not be denied pension rights to which he was entitled, because he had shown that he "was prevented by circumstances beyond his control from meeting the June 5, 1961 one-year deadline." The full Board reversed on the ground that the agency deemed it to be an "inordinate burden" to reconstruct Mr. Elias' duties. We take note that the records of those duties were apparently fully available (some of the early records are in the appendix filed with this court), and that the Air Force had already verified the facts of Mr. Elias' service and recommended entitlement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Elias points out that at the time of his retirement, in 1981, AFOSI positions had not been classified as law enforcement service. When the AFOSI positions were so classified in 1986, the particular positions Mr. Elias held in AFOSI in 1961 were not listed because those positions no longer existed. This was the situation in which the Air Force, as his direct employer, reviewed the duties of these positions and determined that they met the criteria of law enforcement officer positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Elias requested law enforcement officer service credit promptly after he learned that he became entitled to such credit. He bore the burden of establishing entitlement, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.906(a) ("An employee who requests credit for service under 5 U.S.C. 8336(c) bears the burden of proof with respect to that service...."). He met that burden when the Air Force agreed that his request was meritorious and recommended to Department of Defense personnel staff that it be approved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Department of Defense did not reject the recommendation on substantive grounds, but simply on the ground that the Department of Defense "found no basis to waive the filing time limit." The agency points out that Mr. Elias had a window of opportunity in 1989 when, under newly enacted provisions and classification, Mr. Elias' request for law enforcement officer credit would not have been untimely. However, Mr. Elias was not so notified and, as we have observed, his past positions were not specifically designated because they no longer existed. We observe that the burden on the agency to review the 1961 records was not much less in September 1989 than in January 1993 when Mr. Elias first filed this request; these were perhaps "old" records, but they were not unavailable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pension rights are established by statute, and are a matter of entitlement, not agency discretion. They can not be disposed of on the ground that it is too burdensome to check the records of an employee's service. <span class="Italic">Cf. Muwwakkil v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 18 F.3d 921, 925 (Fed. Cir. 1994)] (agency is obligated to check personnel records to verify responses on application for refund or retirement deductions). The administrative judge, observing that the requisite information was available and that the Air Force had concluded that Mr. Elias was entitled to the requested service credit, correctly rejected the agency's position that the question of timeliness was not reviewable by the Board, and then reversed the agency's decision that the application was untimely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since it was not disputed that Mr. Elias had never been notified of this entitlement and that he filed within days of learning of it, Mr. Elias met the regulatory criteria of showing that the circumstances of his delay were beyond his control.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB's decision, sustaining the agency's refusal to waive the late filing, is reversed. Since the Board did not reach the merits of Mr. Elias' entitlement <span class="Italic">vel non,</span> we remand for determination of this issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Elias</span> notwithstanding, the Board dismissed one LEO appeal when the appellant delayed filing a Board appeal because he relied on opinions of agency officials regarding LEO coverage, <span class="Italic">McDowell v. DOD</span>, 76 MSPR 281, 283-84 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant requested LEO coverage in 1995 for service between 1981 and 1987. He could have requested LEO coverage for this entire period at any time up until September 30, 1989. After that date, requests were subject to the one-year prospectivity limitation discussed above, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> the appellant could not receive LEO credit for service performed more than one year prior to the date of the request. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.908(e) (1988). The appellant admitted in his request for coverage that he was advised in 1989 of the deadline far requesting coverage. He stated that he did not submit a request at that time because he believed agency officials who had previously told him that he was not eligible for LEO coverage based on his having been hired at the GM-13 level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency officials' alleged explanation may have been correct. The appellant's GM-13 position apparently was supervisory. LEO positions are classified as either "primary" or "secondary." If the GM-13 position did not directly involve the duties specified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(20), the appellant could not have received primary LEO coverage, and if he did not transfer to the GM-13 position from a primary LEO position, then he would not have qualified for secondary LEO coverage either. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.903, 831.904. We need not decide whether the agency officials' alleged explanation was correct, however. What matters for present purposes is that the appellant knew he could challenge the agency's determination that he did not hold an LEO position and he chose not to; he simply took the agency's word on the matter. The appellant's situation is similar to the situation in <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Department of the Army</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 485, 487 (1993), where the Board held that the fact that an agency official told the appellant that "pursuing his appeal would be fruitless" did not excuse the appellant's untimely filing of a petition for review, because the agency did not "prevent[&#8197;] " him from filing a timely petition for review. <span class="Italic">See also Devine v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 289 (1994) (an appellant who was advised of the deadline for filing a petition for review, but who deliberately delayed filing one for a year because "the language in the initial decision made him think further appeal would be fruitless," did not show good cause for his delay in filing; the appellant's discouragement was not a circumstance beyond his control preventing a timely filing). In sum, even if we give no deference to the agency head's decision not to waive the deadline for requesting LEO coverage and instead review his decision <span class="Italic">de novo</span>, the appellant nevertheless has not shown that he was <span id="Page_4294"></span>prevented by circumstances beyond his control from seeking coverage by the deadline.</p>
