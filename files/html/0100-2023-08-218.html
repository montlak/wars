<p class="Body-Text">Although errors concerning leave status are not ordinarily within Board appellate purview, jurisdiction over leave status may depend on how that status is acquired or imposed. <span class="Italic">See Haentges v. USPS</span>, 80 MSPR 507, 510 &#x00B6; 5 (1999) ("An employee's voluntary absence from work is not appealable."); <span class="Italic">McNeil v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 12, 15 (1991) ("[a]gency's action of placing the appellant in AWOL status for the time he was on properly documented military leave is not a matter within our jurisdiction."); <span class="Italic">Maki v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 449, 456 (1989) (AWOL is not appealable if the employee voluntarily remains absent from work); <span class="Italic">Archuleta v. DHHS</span>, 38 MSPR 648, 654 (1988) ("The agency's placement of the appellant in an AWOL status is not by itself an action appealable to the Board."); <span class="Italic">Bruning v. VA</span>, 32 MSPR 213, 216 (1987) (no jurisdiction over an agency charge of AWOL for the refusal to report for duty); <span class="Italic">Aho v. USDA</span>, 25 MSPR 569, 571 n.* (1985) (placement of the appellant on AWOL status, by itself, is not an appealable action); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Nolan v. USPS</span>, 80 MSPR 241, 243 &#x00B6; 5 (1998) ("An employee who alleges that he was constructively suspended must prove by preponderant evidence that his absence was involuntary.")<span class="Italic">; Baker v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 680, 691-92 (1996) ("Absence from work initiated by an employee, that is, a voluntary absence, is unappealable. If, however, an agency bars an employee from duty for more than 14 days, the employee's absence is considered a constructive suspension appealable to the Board.");<span class="Italic">cf. Lundberg v. MSPB</span>, 665 Fed. Appx. 870, 871 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP) (noting a Board decision that 31 USC 1342, generally prohibiting the federal government from accepting voluntary services, does not confer Board jurisdiction over an annual leave dispute); Miller v. DOD, 45 MSPR 263, 267 (1990) (Board obtained a GAO advisory opinion concerning the validity of a provision in settlement granting the appellant a one-year period of administrative leave).</p> 
<p class="Body-Text">The issue of when placement of an employee on leave status constitutes an appealable suspension is a matter of some complexity. [Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-018.html#sec8-19">Proof of AWOL; Telework Status; Leave Request</a>," concerning actions based on AWOL, and to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-083.html#sec6-83">Enforced Leave; Constructive Suspension</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-13-012.html#sec6-13">Constructive Adverse Action</a>"; refer to Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-130.html#sec16-128">Enforcement of MSPB Decision</a>, "Reinstatement to the Same Position; <span class="Italic">Status Quo Ante</span> Remedy," and "Placement on Administrative Leave Pending Subsequent Removal Attempt" concerning leave issues arising in compliance disputes; refer to 5 USC 6329b-d, "Investigative Leave and Notice Leave."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Barger v. DOJ</span>, 8 MSPR 654, 655 (1981) (companion decision, <span class="Italic">Barger v. DOJ</span>, 11 MSPR 170, 176 (1982)), stated the rules concerning treatment of appeals from placement on AWOL:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The reasons for an agency's decision to deny leave are reviewable by a presiding official in an appeal from a disciplinary action, within our jurisdiction, based on AWOL. <span class="Italic">In re: Van Sciver</span>, 1 MSPB 94, 1 MSPR 99 (1980). However, the placement of an employee in an AWOL status, by itself, is not an appealable action<span class="Italic">. Marks v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 3 MSPB 17, 2 MSPR 494 (1980).

<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;This does not mean that appellant has no remedy. His AWOL status may be a matter which is grievable to his agency.

<p class="Body-Text">Of the practice of placing an employee on paid administrative leave during the notice period for an adverse action, <span class="Italic">Oliver v. USPS</span>, 696 F.2d 1129 (5th Cir. 1983), discerned no impediment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Oliver's first assignment of error is that the Postal Service violated the governing regulation by failing to retain him in a "duty status." By placing him on leave with pay, Oliver argues, the Postal Service action violated a procedure required by law. Oliver contends that 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7513(b)(1), which entitles an employee to a thirty-day notice period before removal or a suspension of 14 or more days, gives the employee more than a right to know he is being terminated. Oliver contends that the implementing regulation adds rights both to pay and to duty during the notice period. He asserts that 5 C.F.R. Sec. 752.404 (1981) accomplishes this by providing only three exceptions to pay and duty during the required period of notice: (1) Non-duty with pay for no more than 10 days may accompany more rapid removal when a crime is involved, 5 C.F.R. Sec. 752.404(d)(1); (2) furlough without pay for no more than 10 days may be imposed in unforeseeable circumstances, such as breakdowns of equipment or sudden emergencies, 5 C.F.R. Sec. 752.404(d)(2); and (3) an employee may be placed on non-duty with pay for up to 10 days when a suspension is effected in a dangerous situation. 5 C.F.R. Sec. 752.404(d)(3). Oliver urges the listing of these exceptions proves his version of the rule, i.e., stating the exceptions mandates that the thirty-day notice period must be accompanied by thirty days of pay and duty whenever they do not apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner's argument proves too much. The Office of Personnel Management is granted the authority to draft regulations to implement this statute. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7514. The statute provides for thirty-day notice to employees against whom certain adverse action is initiated except those who are reasonably believed to have committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7513(b)(1). The OPM promulgated regulations which added to the thirty-day notice provision the two additional exceptions noted by Oliver. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. Sec. 752.404. But the exceptions, which Oliver argues proves that paid non-duty status is allowed only in two of those three situations, are merely exceptions to the required thirty-day notice prior to removal, suspension or other adverse action under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7512.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When interpreting statutes and regulations, the plain language of the statute or regulation controls our construction, absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary. <span class="Italic">Alabama v. Marshall,</span> 626 F.2d 366, 368-69 (5th Cir. 1980), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 452 U.S. 905, 101 S. Ct. 3029, 69 L. Ed.2d 405 (1981). These regulations contain no express requirement that an employee be allowed to remain on the job. Nor do they explicitly prohibit the agency from placing an employee on paid leave during the thirty-day notice period. That which the statute required was given to Oliver--thirty-day advance notice of the proposed agency action with the reasons for the action, a reasonable time to answer, the right to a representative, and a written decision. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7513(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The exceptions set out in the regulation's special situations are permissive. No purpose of the statute or regulation would be served by requiring that the employee remain on active duty and receive pay during the notice period. We refuse to imply a "right" where none is expressly provided or need be inferred to effect a protection granted. The statute and regulations promulgated here are designed to allow agencies to expeditiously remove unfit employees while at the same time protecting the employees from violations of their rights. S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 9-10, reprinted in 1978 U.S. Code Cong &#x0026; Ad. News 2723, 2731-32. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 was intended to protect the employee's right to fair treatment while accelerating the personnel action process. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Inferring a right to remain on duty during the notice period is not the kind of protection (or tenure) that the Act was intended to grant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Oliver argues that language from <span class="Italic">Roskos v. United States,</span> 549 F.2d 1386 (Ct. Cl. 1977), also supports his position. In <span class="Italic">dicta,</span> the <span class="Italic">Roskos</span> court stated that "the Civil Service Commission's regulations call upon the employing agency to retain the charged employee in his regular position during the notice period--if that is at all practicable and there is no emergency." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1389 n.9. This <span class="Italic">dicta</span> was meant to deal with situations where a significant change in the employment relationship may cause a severe hardship to the federal employee. <span class="Italic">Roskos</span> does not suggest that an agency may not retain that employee in a non-duty, paid status.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">If the agency "suspends" the employee when he is already in a nonduty, nonpay status (as, for example, when the employee is receiving OWCP benefits), he is not "placed" into that status and deprived of his duties and pay through the suspension.
