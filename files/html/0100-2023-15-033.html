<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-34"><span class="space">c.</span> No Foreseeable End to Absence; Absence When Compensation Ends</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency may terminate LWOP initially granted because of a job-related injury if, after the employee is determined by OWCP to have recovered from the injury, the employee does not return to work because of a personal physician's statement that the employee is still disabled and has no definite date for resuming work. <span class="Italic">Newsome v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 10 MSPR 504, 505 (1982) (distinguishing <span class="Italic">Agnes v. USPS</span>, 4 MSPR 176, 178-79 (1980) ("In <span class="Italic">Agnes</span>, the agency removed the appellant for not reporting for duty, and the Board reversed the agency because it did not properly exercise its discretion in refusing to grant the appellant's request to be placed on LWOP status"; "Plainly <span class="Italic">Agnes</span> is not a case involving an appellant whose absence is without a foreseeable end.")); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Bologna v. DOD</span>, 73 MSPR 110, 114-15 (1997) (after OWCP discontinued benefits, an employee unsuccessfully argued that he should be carried on LWOP pending the completion of an OWCP appeal; the employee was properly removed when no indication of a foreseeable end to his absence was given; the absence was a burden to the agency because it hindered accomplishment of its workload and placed an extra burden on the appellant's coworkers). If worker's compensation is approved only to a certain date and the employee fails to return to work or submit medical information justifying a continuing absence, despite notice from the agency, the removal is then taken because the appellant is unavailable for work or AWOL, not because he is physically unfit for duty (assuming there is no evidence regarding continued fitness); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. GSA</span>, 46 MSPR 630, 635 (1991) (also noting that the agency's temporary approval of LWOP of an appellant, pending OWCP determination, did not preclude the agency from correcting leave status based on later information, citing FPM Ch. 630, Subch. 1-6). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-15-010.html#sec8-11">Unscheduled but Approved Absence Following Failure to Follow Procedure to Request Leave</a>"; "Excessive Leave, LWOP, Absences Beyond Employee's Control; Failure to Maintain a Regular Work Schedule; OWCP Coverage."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency could properly take an employee absent by reason of an injury off of LWOP status following an absence of about two years, notify the employee of the denial of continued LWOP, require the employee to report for duty, and discharge the employee for AWOL when he did not report. The action was justified when the agency had a need for the employee or someone else to fill his place and there was no foreseeable end to the employee's absence. <span class="Italic">Kamer v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 6 MSPR 184, 187-88, 6 MSPB 163 (1981). Removal was sustained of an employee who was on LWOP because of injury for more than four years, who returned to work briefly and then took more leave, and who failed to explain when she would again be able to return following receipt of an agency notice to report back to duty. A month after she was told to return to work, her physician supplied information indicating that she would be able to return to work in six to eight weeks. The agency was justified in requesting an explanation for the appellant's absence. The employee was obliged to protect her rights by furnishing the information at an early stage. She did not do so until a month after she was told that steps were being taken to remove her. After four-and-a-half years of absence, the agency awaited her return to work long enough. The agency was justified in concluding that it was no longer required to hold open her position. <span class="Italic">Butler v. DHHS</span>, 7 MSPR 370, 371, 7 MSPB 249 (1981). If, after being removed for inability to work, the employee was later approved for compensation by the Department of Labor and restored to duty following recovery, the removal would remain in effect through the time of the restoration. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cox v. ITC</span>, 12 MSPR 297, 300 n.2 (1982). As to the charge that an employee failed to be regular in attendance, "[a]n agency is not precluded from disciplining an employee for excessive absences merely because those absences resulted from an OWCP-covered injury." <span class="Italic">Foreman v. USPS</span>, 89 MSPR 328, 333 &#x00B6; 14 (2001).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency is not precluded from removing an employee for AWOL (after denying LWOP) by reason of an employee's application for OWCP benefits. The agency takes the risk that if the employee is removed, it may have liability for backpay through a reopening petition if the employee is found eligible for OWCP benefits during the period that benefits are granted, <span class="Italic">Sambrano v. DOD</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/netsearch/viewdocs.aspx?docnumber=612139&version=613991">116 MSPR 449</a>, 452 &#x00B6; 7, 2011 MSPB 60 (2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, the Board held that an adverse action based on AWOL cannot be sustained if OWCP determines that the individual was entitled to compensation benefits as a result of a work-related injury for the entire time period charged as AWOL. <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 95, &#x00B6; 6. An agency that implements an adverse action predicated upon a charge of AWOL pending a final determination from OWCP, or while an appeal is pending before the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board (ECAB), does so at its own risk that the AWOL charge may later be invalidated. <span class="Italic">See Bruton v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 271, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2008); <span class="Italic">King v. Department of the Navy</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 341, &#x00B6; 8 (2001). However, an agency is entitled to take that risk and institute an attendance-related adverse action against an employee who has a claim pending with OWCP or the ECAB. <span class="Italic">See Brown</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 95, &#x00B6; 4. Accordingly, the appellant's removal is affirmed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The complexities of OWCP status, the jurisdiction of the Board and the Department of Labor concerning OWCP determinations, and the authority of an agency to require an employee to return to work (or be discharged for failure to return) following partial recovery from an injury were explored, at length, in <span class="Italic">New v. VA</span>, 142 F.3d 1259, 1261-65 (Fed. Cir. 1998). The essential holding of <span class="Italic">New</span>, involving the dismissal of an employee who did not return to work following partial recovery from a compensatory illness or injury, was that the employee may legitimately decline an agency's return-to-work order that has not been reviewed by the Labor Department if the employee has a substantial concern that return to duty could impair her health. The employee's subsequent entitlements may then be determined under OWCP procedures relating to placement rights of partially or fully recovered employees. The case analysis, however, was far broader. <span class="Italic">New</span> explained the relative responsibilities of the Labor Department, the Board, and employing agencies in making determinations involving the employment status of workers with OWCP claims:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The system of unemployment compensation for federal workers is governed by the Federal Employees Compensation Act ("FECA"), 5 USC &#x00A7; 8101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> An agency's obligation to restore an individual to her last position or an equivalent position following her recovery from a compensable injury is defined at 5 USC &#x00A7; 8151 and its attendant regulations at 5 CFR Part 353. Under FECA, an employee's right to be reemployed by the agency depends, to some extent, upon the length of her recovery period. An employee who fully recovers within one year is entitled to return to her former position, or an equivalent one without condition. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.301(b). In contrast, when an employee's recovery from a compensable injury takes more than one year, as did Ms. New's, an agency is required only to accord the employee priority consideration for restoration to her former position or an equivalent. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.303. Priority consideration is accorded by entering the individual on the agency's reemployment priority list for the competitive service. However, according to the regulations, this agency duty only arises when the employee is separated "because of a compensable injury." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.303. Reading the regulation rather broadly, the Board has opined that an employee is entitled to priority consideration for restoration when her removal is the "result of her compensable injury or for reasons substantially related to her compensable injury." <span class="Italic">Wright v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 62 MSPR 122, 128, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 42 F.3d 1410 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (table). Although we will accept this definition for the present case, we decline to hold definitively that it is a proper gloss on the regulation<span class="Italic">. See Minor v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.,</span> 819 F.2d 280, 282 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Not only must the employing agency make an effort to place a recovered employee, but also the employee has a responsibility to return to work as soon as she is able. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 8106. In fact, a partially disabled employee who refuses to work after suitable work is offered to her is not entitled to compensation under FECA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 8106(c)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to FECA, the OWCP is the arbiter of whether a position offered by an agency is suitable for a partially disabled employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 8145 (stating that the Secretary of Labor shall "decide all questions arising under...this subchapter"). The pertinent regulation states: "[w]here an employee has been offered suitable employment (or reemployment) by the employing agency (i.e., employment or reemployment which the [OWCP] has found to be within the employee's educational and vocational capabilities, within any limitations and restrictions which pre-existed the injury, and within the limitations and restrictions which resulted from the injury),...the employee is obligated to return to such employment." 20 CFR &#x00A7; 10.124(c). Under the FECA scheme, when an employing agency offers a partially disabled employee a position, the employing agency must forward a copy of the offer containing a description of the position's duties to the OWCP. The OWCP evaluates the offer in light of several factors, including the nature of the employee's injury, the degree of the employee's impairment, and the employee's age and qualifications for other work. <span class="Italic">See Federal Personnel Manual</span> ch. 820, subchapter 8 &#x00B6; 4 (June 21, 1988).[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_2486"></span>[3]&#x2003;Although the Office of Personnel Management abolished the Federal Personnel Manual in 1994, <span class="Italic">see</span> Federal Staffing Provisions Supporting Sunset of the Federal Personnel Manual, 60 Fed. Reg. 3055, 3055 (Jan. 13, 1995), the Federal Personnel Manual was in effect at the time that the VA modified Ms. New's duties and work environment and ordered her to return to work in 1987.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the Board, Ms. New asserted that the VA and the OWCP failed to follow these regulations and procedures under FECA<span class="Italic">. See id</span>.; 20 CFR &#x00A7; 10.124(c). Specifically, Ms. New cited the OWCP's failure to conduct an evaluation to determine whether the position offered by the VA was suitable for her in light of her medical condition. In the absence of this determination, Ms. New claimed that she feared that returning to work under the conditions set forth by the VA could endanger her health. Thus, Ms. New argued, the unexcused absences that precipitated her removal were related to her compensable injury, and therefore, under the restoration regulations, she was entitled to priority consideration for restoration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rejecting this argument, the Board determined that it lacked jurisdiction over Ms. New's appeal because she was removed for cause--her unexcused absence--rather than for a reason substantially related to her compensable injury. <span class="Italic">See Cox v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.,</span> 817 F.2d 100, 101 (Fed. Cir. 1987) ("By definition, separation as <span class="Italic">a result of</span> a compensable injury excludes a valid removal for cause unrelated to the employee's compensable injury."). The Board asserted that, because the VA was not required to await the OWCP's suitability determination before effectuating Ms. New's return to work and charging her with absence without leave ("AWOL") for disregarding its orders to return, her removal was unrelated to her compensable injury. In support of this contention, the Board cited three of its opinions: <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of Justice,</span> 61 MSPR 92, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 43 F.3d 1485 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (table), <span class="Italic">Stith v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 21 MSPR 328 (1984), and <span class="Italic">Wright v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> 62 MSPR 122, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 42 F.3d 1410 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's approach to the problem was fundamentally flawed. The issue presented is not whether the VA was within its authority in removing Ms. New for her failure to report for work when ordered. Rather, it is whether, having removed Ms. New for refusing to return to work in the absence of a suitability determination, the DVA must now afford her priority consideration for restoration because her removal was the result of, or substantially related to, her compensable injury. The authority cited by the Board does not address this issue, and is therefore inapt.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, in <span class="Italic">Davis,</span> the Board stated: "once an injured individual has sufficiently recovered to be able to perform job duties in some capacity, he and the employing agency are encouraged to cooperate in his return to suitable work as soon as practicable, without awaiting OWCP's potentially time-consuming determination of his compensation status. 61 MSPR at 97. This statement, which the Board quoted in its final decision, is wholly inapposite. First, the determination in question in <span class="Italic">Davis</span> was not a determination of whether accommodations offered by an agency were suitable, but whether the appellant was either partially or completely disabled. Second, the statement in <span class="Italic">Davis</span> was pure dictum; the Board was merely offering a possible rationale for the disparate treatment of fully recovered and partially recovered individuals under the restoration regulations, <span class="Italic">see id.,</span> and therefore, the Board's reliance upon <span class="Italic">Davis</span> is misplaced.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Stith</span> lends even less support to the Board's theory. In <span class="Italic">Stith,</span> the agency proposed the appellant's removal for AWOL. <span class="Italic">See</span> 21 MSPR at 331. Before the agency acted on its proposal, however, the OWCP granted the appellant's claim for benefits during the entire time that he was purportedly absent<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> The agency nevertheless removed him. In its final decision, the Board concluded that the agency's AWOL charge was inappropriate in light of the OWCP award. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 332. The Board expounded in a footnote, however, that, notwithstanding its holding, "an employee who is receiving workers compensation benefits need not be granted [leave without pay] indefinitely. An agency may remove an employee who is unable to perform the duties of his position." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 331 n.3. <span class="Italic">Stith</span> did not involve a determination of suitability, and neither the holding of <span class="Italic">Stith</span> nor the dicta cited by the Board support the Board's claim that the circumstances surrounding Ms. New's removal created no nexus between her compensable injury and her removal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.303.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The last of its own decisions upon which the Board relied is similarly inconsequent. In <span class="Italic">Wright,</span> in February 1991, the employing agency offered a position to the appellant, a partially recovered individual who was receiving workers' compensation benefits. The appellant rejected the offer on the advice of her physician. <span class="Italic">See</span> 62 MSPR at 124. In June 1991, the OWCP terminated the appellant's benefits, and she appealed to the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board ("ECAB"). <span class="Italic">See id.</span> In August 1991, while the appeal was pending, the agency removed the appellant for AWOL violations dating from the time of her refusal to accept the offered position. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 125. On appeal, the ECAB affirmed the OWCP decision terminating the benefits, but the ECAB also found that the position offered by the agency was unsuitable. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 124. Claiming that her removal was substantially related to her compensable injury, the appellant filed an appeal with the Board, requesting restoration. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 125. In its final decision the Board held that, although the agency erred in removing the appellant based on AWOL violations for the time covered by workers' compensation benefits, <span class="Italic">see Parkinson v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 5 MSPR 552, 554 (1992), removal predicated on AWOL violations for the period after the OWCP benefits expired was proper. <span class="Italic">See Wright</span>, 62 MSPR at 128. Thus, reasoned the Board, the agency removed the appellant for cause, her unauthorized absences, and not for a reason substantially related to her compensable injury, notwithstanding the ECAB finding that the position offered in February 1991 was unsuitable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Crucial in <span class="Italic">Wright</span> was the fact that the ECAB decision that the position was unsuitable spoke only to the suitability of the position at the time it was offered--February 1991. The ECAB, in the same ruling, found that the appellant's compensable disability ceased by June 1991. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 124. Inherent in these two findings is the conclusion that, although the position was unsuitable as of February 1991, it was not unsuitable four months later, when the ECAB deemed the appellant fully recovered, because the appellant had no compensable medical condition which limited her ability to work. Hence the appellant was not removed on account of her compensable injury, but for her AWOL violations occurring upon her recovery. <span class="Italic">Wright</span> thus lends no support to the Board's theory that the employing agency may deny priority consideration for restoration to an injured employee who was terminated because she refused to return to work in the absence of a suitability determination by the OWCP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board further opined, relying on two of this court's opinions, that the accommodations offered to Ms. New were reasonable, and the OWCP's amended benefits award did not affect this fact. <span class="Italic">See Minor v.</span> <span class="Italic">Merit Sys. Protection Bd.,</span> 819 F.2d 280, 283 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Cox v. Merit Sys. Protection</span> <span class="Italic">Bd.,</span> 817 F.2d 100, 101 (Fed. Cir. 1987). The Board misapprehends the nature of the relationship between the OWCP and employing agencies. Although we have indeed noted that the OWCP's decisions do not bind the Board, <span class="Italic">see Cox,</span> 817 F.2d at 101, this is the case only when the Board or the agency acts within its own statutory sphere of authority, <span class="Italic">see Minor</span>, 819 F.2d at 283.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Cox</span>, the petitioner, a former air traffic controller, sought restoration on the ground that he was separated because of a compensable injury. <span class="Italic">See</span> 817 F.2d at 101. The petitioner offered as proof his receipt of workers' compensation benefits beginning immediately prior to his removal. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> However, the petitioner was, in fact, removed for striking against the federal government<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> In order to prove that he was removed because of his compensable injury, the petitioner was required to demonstrate that no cause aside from his compensable injury precipitated his removal. The petitioner failed to make this showing, of course, because he was removed for striking. <span class="Italic">See id. Cox</span> stands for the proposition that the receipt of workers' compensation benefits is not conclusive proof that an employee's removal is substantially related to his compensable injury: a proposition of no consequence to this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Minor</span>, the petitioner allegedly suffered an injury as a result of an accident at work and filed a claim with the OWCP, which allowed benefits. <span class="Italic">See</span> 819 F.2d at 281. Upon determining that the accident never happened, the employing agency removed the petitioner for filing a false-injury claim. The agency asked the OWCP to review its compensation award, and after a hearing, the OWCP rejected the petitioner's compensation claim on the ground that the accident never occurred. However, the ECAB reversed the OWCP's decision and made a formal ruling that the accident had occurred as the petitioner described it. The petitioner then sought restoration from the agency, but was denied, and the Board affirmed after determining that the petitioner had been removed for cause--filing a false claim. Despite the ECAB's holding that the accident had, indeed occurred, we nevertheless affirmed the Board, noting that the OWCP's decision on compensation had no bearing on the employing agency's determination that the award was procured through fraud. As we stated in our opinion, this determination was within the sphere of the agency's authority<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. at 283. In contrast, here, in presuming to pass upon the reasonableness of the VA's accommodations, the Board is acting outside its sphere of authority. It is the OWCP, not employing agencies or the Board, that possesses the requisite expertise to evaluate whether a position is suitable for an employee in light of that employee's particular medical condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the Board determined that Ms. New was obliged to obey the VA's order to return to work. If upon returning to work, Ms. New felt that the accommodations were inadequate, she could grieve or challenge them through the appropriate channels, asserted the Board, relying on <span class="Italic">Gragg v. United States Air Force</span>, 11 MSPB 546, 13 MSPR 296, 299 (1982), <span class="Italic">modified by Fleckenstein v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Army,</span> 63 MSPR 470, 474 n.3 (1994). Again, the Board's analysis misses the mark. The rule we deduce from these cases is that an employee is required to comply with instructions from her agency acting within its authority, unless obedience would <span id="Page_2487"></span>place her in a clearly dangerous circumstance. <span class="Italic">See Fleckenstein,</span> 63 MSPR at 474 n.3; <span class="Italic">Gragg</span>, 11 MSPB 546, 13 MSPR at 299. Ms. New's case quite obviously comes within the stated exception to the rule; Ms. New refused to obey the order to return to work, because, in the estimation of her physician, working under the conditions provided by the VA could have endangered her health.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The DVA, for the most part, eschews reliance on the cases cited by the Board and offers scant support in its brief for its theory that employing agencies have no duty to grant priority consideration for restoration to an employee in Ms. New's position. What little support it does offer is unhelpful, or even erroneous. First, the DVA directly quotes a portion of the Board's opinion which relied on <span class="Italic">Davis</span> and <span class="Italic">Stith</span>, both of which, as we have established, are irrelevant to the case at hand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, in its brief, the DVA offers a misguided interpretation of a regulation to support its position that it was authorized to determine whether the accommodations it provided were suitable. The regulation, which sets forth the employee's responsibility to return to work when suitable employment is offered, states: "Where an employee has been offered suitable employment...by the employing agency (i.e., employment...which the [OWCP] has found to be within the employee's...capabilities...[and] limitations)," the employee is obligated to return to work. 20 CFR &#x00A7; 10.124(c). The DVA opines that the regulation's mention of the OWCP's finding of suitability is merely exemplary and is not a limitation on what constitutes suitable employment. The DVA misunderstands the meaning of the abbreviation "i.e." which is the short form of <span class="Italic">id est</span>, meaning "that is to say." <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span> 746 (6th ed. 1990). The DVA apparently confused i.e. with <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> the short form of <span class="Italic">exempli</span> <span class="Italic">gratia</span>, which means "for the sake of an example." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 515. We must assume that, unlike the DVA, the drafters of the regulation apprehended the difference between the two terms and intentionally restricted the term "suitable employment" to "employment...which the [OWCP] has found to be within the employee's...capabilities...[and] limitations." 20 CFR &#x00A7; 10.124(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with Ms. New that there was a sufficient nexus between her removal and her compensable injury not only to create jurisdiction in the Board over the appeal but also to entitle her to priority consideration for restoration, in the absence of a valid removal for cause unrelated to her compensable injury. We therefore hold, as a matter of law, that when an agency removes an employee who has a compensable injury solely for refusal to return to work in the absence of a suitability determination by the OWCP, a sufficient nexus exists between the compensable injury and the removal to entitle the employee to priority consideration for restoration. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.303. Decisions on the suitability of an offered position are within the exclusive domain of the OWCP. <span class="Italic">See</span> 20 CFR &#x00A7; 10.124(c). When the OWCP fails to evaluate the position offered by the employing agency, an injured employee may be understandably concerned that the work situation offered by the agency is potentially hazardous to her condition. An employee's refusal to work in this circumstance is directly related to her compensable injury. It follows, then, that the employee's subsequent removal that is predicated upon her absence is similarly related. Such nexus, of course, depends upon the employee's continuing compensable injury at the time of her removal, which creates the need for OWCP's suitability determination that the agency has appropriately accommodated the needs of the employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our holding that the DVA's removal of Ms. New based on her refusal to return to work after October 7, 1987 was related to her compensable injury does not completely dispose of the appeal, however. "By definition, separation <span class="Italic">as a result of</span> a compensable injury excludes a valid removal for cause unrelated to the employee's compensable injury." <span class="Italic">Cox,</span> 817 F.2d at 101. The Board did not address whether the VA's second reason for removing Ms. New, her poor overall attendance record, was related to her compensable injury. If removal on this ground was, in fact, a valid removal for cause unrelated to her compensable injury, Ms[.] New is not entitled to priority consideration for restoration<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> Additional Board proceedings on this issue are necessary, and therefore, the appealed decision is <span class="Italic">REVERSED and REMANDED.</span></p>
