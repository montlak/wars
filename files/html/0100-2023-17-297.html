<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-295"><span class="space">i.</span> Training</h5>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE, Nat'l INS Council</span>, 37 FLRA 639, 643-45 (1990), the award required the agency to provide training to employees detailed to perform guard duties. The collective bargaining contract required training if employees were required to perform duties involving special hazards. The award was valid:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 37 FLRA No. 20 (1990) (<span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service</span>), the Authority reexamined and defined the approach that is to be used when an agency contends that an arbitrator's award enforcing an agreement provision is contrary to section 7106(a) of the Statute. The Authority held as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[W]e will examine the provision enforced by the arbitrator to determine (1) if it constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of managements rights, and (2) if, as interpreted by the arbitrator, it abrogates the exercise of a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If it is evident that the provision constitutes an arrangement and, as interpreted by the arbitrator, does not abrogate management's rights, the provision is within the range of matters that can be bargained under the Statute. Consequently, we will not find that the award is contrary to law, and we will deny the exception....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying that approach in this case, we find that the Agency fails to establish that the award is contrary to law. Rather, the Arbitrator has interpreted and enforced a provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement which constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to assign work. The Agency agreed in...the parties' agreement to provide "reasonable" training to employees in situations involving special hazards....&#8197;The Arbitrator determined that...the agreement required the Agency to provide training....&#8197;The Arbitrator, therefore, merely interpreted and enforced an arrangement negotiated by the parties when he directed...the...training....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we find that, as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, the provision...does not abrogate the Agency's right to assign work under section 7106(a). In <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service</span>, the Authority held that an award "abrogates" a management right when the award "precludes an agency from exercising" that right....&#8197;Although the provision of training has been held to be included in the right to assign work, the Arbitrator's award does not preclude the Agency from exercising its right. Rather, the award only requires the Agency to comply with Article 17(H) in which it agreed to provide reasonable training for employees exposed to special hazards. The award merely provides interpretation and enforcement by the Arbitrator of the arrangement agreed to by the parties. Accordingly, we conclude that the provision, as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, does not abrogate the exercise of the Agency's right to assign work under section 7106(a)....</p>
<p class="noindent">A contract may call for reimbursement of job-related training. An arbitrator properly makes determinations as to whether particular courses or portions of them qualify for reimbursement under the contract criteria. The agency properly exercises its discretion through negotiations to determine those expenses that are reimbursable under the Training Act. Arbitrators' determinations under contract provisions relating to reimbursement will be upheld unless they are shown to be contrary to law, e.g., Comptroller General decisions. <span class="Italic">IRS, Midwest Region and NTEU Chap. 10</span>, 28 FLRA 983, 985-87 (1987) (bar review course); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Army Military District of Washington and IAFF Local F-253</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-154.html">72 FLRA 772</a> (2022) (denying exceptions to award granting official time, with back pay, for training of union official in accordance with contract provisions).</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator's award directing an agency to provide outside training to an employee must be consistent with the Training Act, 5 USC 4101, <span class="Italic">et seq.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Training is not authorized for the sole purpose of providing an opportunity for an employee to obtain an academic degree or to obtain a degree to qualify for appointment to a particular position requiring the degree. 5 USC 4107(c). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Mines, Pittsburgh Research Ctr. and AFGE Local 1916</span>, 50 FLRA 116, 119-20 (1995) (remanding to parties for resubmission to arbitrator on facts necessary for determination of whether award was consistent with Training Act). FLRA concluded on exceptions to the award following remand in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Mines, Pittsburgh Research Ctr. and AFGE Local 1916</span>, 53 FLRA 34, 38-40 (1997), that an arbitrator may determine that training is reimbursable because it benefits the agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Awards Are Consistent With the Training Act </span>[1]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our review of the Agency's exceptions to the awards' consistency with the Training Act is <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 24 and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service v. FLRA</span>, 43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;Amendments to the Training Act in 1994 included changes to sections 4101(4) and 4107(c). We apply the pre-amended version here, as we did in 50 FLRA 116, because: it was in existence at the time of the events giving rise to the grievance; there is no indication in the legislative history of the amendments that they were intended to be applied retroactively; and, as the amendments eliminated various restrictions on training, including the requirement that training courses are or will be directly related to an employee's official duties, the Agency's rights in reliance on that requirement would be impaired were we to apply the amendments. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Little Rock</span>, <span class="Italic">Arkansas</span>, 51 FLRA 216, 224-25 (1995) (discussing <span class="Italic">Landgraf </span>v. <span class="Italic">USI Film Products</span>, 511 U.S. 244, 273-80, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 1501-05 (1994)). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 243</span>, 52 FLRA 358, 368 n.6 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency essentially argues that the award is deficient because the Training Act: prohibits the approval of and payment for courses that are taken solely for the purpose of obtaining an academic degree; and requires that courses are or will be directly related to an employee's performance of official duties in order to increase, among other things, <span id="page_2270"></span>the employee's knowledge, skills, and abilities. We find that the record does not support the conclusion that the Arbitrator failed to apply the appropriate legal standard or that his awards were contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, while 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4107(c) prohibits payment for, or reimbursement of, courses that are intended <span class="Italic">solely</span> in order to obtain an academic degree, nothing in the awards or the record in this case indicates that the grievant sought reimbursement solely for that purpose. An examination of the training request shows that the grievant, who occupied the position of electronics technician, sought payment for electronics and engineering courses only. The grievant specifically stated that he would pay for elective courses. Had the grievant sought payment solely for the purpose of obtaining an academic degree, it is logical to assume that he would have sought payment for <span class="Italic">all</span> the courses he intended to take. Moreover, Federal Personnel Management Chapter 410, subchapter S-3(d)(1), which was in effect at the time of the events surrounding this grievance, provided that reimbursement for training expenses was not prohibited even though attainment of an academic degree might be "an incidental byproduct of the training." Thus, the fact that the grievant may have earned an academic degree as a result of courses taken does not necessitate a finding that the courses were intended solely to obtain a degree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, nothing in the awards is inconsistent with, or fails to account for, the requirements that the courses, at the time they were requested or at some future date, had to directly relate to the grievant's performance of official duties and increase his knowledge, skills, and abilities in the performance of those duties. The Arbitrator expressly found that the courses for which the grievant sought payment "are or will be directly related to the performance by the employee of official duties for the Government." The Agency's argument is focused on the relationship between the courses and the grievant's duties at the time the grievant sought to take the courses. However, the Training Act specifically provides that courses can be directly related to the performance of duties <span class="Italic">in the future</span>, a finding that the Arbitrator expressly made and the Agency does not dispute. Based on this finding, it necessarily follows that the courses would increase the grievant's "knowledge, proficiency, ability, skill, and qualifications" in the performance of his duties. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4101(4). To the extent the Agency's arguments are premised on its disagreement with the Arbitrator's factual findings, we defer to those findings. <span class="Italic">See Federal Aviation Administration, SEATAC Airport, Seattle</span>, <span class="Italic">Washington</span>, 52 FLRA 701, 709 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHS, Bureau of Immigration &#x0026; Customs Enforcement and AFGE Nat'l INS Council Local 2859</span>, 60 FLRA 131, 136-37 (2004), affirmed an award of remedial firearms training that the arbitrator concluded was improperly withheld from the employee, but FLRA set aside a backpay award that was conditioned on successful completion of the training; the requisite causal connection between the training issue and the promotion was lacking:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator determined that the Agency breached the parties agreement because it violated Article 47B.(1) of the collective bargaining agreement when it failed to abide by the terms of the firearms training policy. As such, the employee was aggrieved by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, with respect to the second part under the Back Pay Act, the Arbitrator did not find that the Agency's improper termination of the grievant's training caused the grievant to suffer a "withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay." <span class="Italic">HHS, </span>54 FLRA at 1218. Rather, the Arbitrator awarded back pay conditioned solely on the employee getting her firearms certification during this 8 hours of remedial firearms training.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Agency states, in<span class="Italic"> SSA Office of Hearings and Appeals, Paducah, Ky., </span>58 FLRA 124, 125-26 (2002) (<span class="Italic">SSA, Paducah</span>), the Authority found an arbitrator's award deficient under the Back Pay Act where "the Arbitrator made no finding that but for the Agency's failure to follow Section 7B [an article requiring the Agency to consider an internal applicant's application for at least 10 days before hiring outside of the Agency] the grievant would have been selected for the promotion." Accordingly<span class="Italic">, SSA, Paducah </span>is similar to the current award in that the Arbitrator here also made no explicit or implicit "but for" determination linking the contract violation to the loss of pay. Therefore, as the Arbitrator did not find that the employee had suffered a loss of pay because of the Agency's breach of contract, the award does not satisfy the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While we are mindful of the<span class="Italic"> FDIC, Washington D.C., 4</span>8 FLRA 313, 330 (1993) and<span class="Italic"> United States Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Serv., SSA, Balt., Md. and United States Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Serv., SSA, Hartford Dist. Office, Hartford, Conn., </span>37 FLRA 278 (1990) decisions cited by Member Pope in her dissent, we note an apparent distinction between a circumstance where the parties first have to negotiate employee entitlements<span class="Italic"> </span>before knowing whether employees may have suffered any lost entitlement (the cases cited by Member Pope), and a situation where the lost entitlement is known--but it is unknown whether an employee is actually entitled to a retroactive promotion because the Arbitrator has first required that the employee successfully complete a training course before the Arbitrator would grant the retroactive promotion (the present situation). We need not await any further action (such as the negotiations referenced in the two cases by Member Pope) to know what benefits the employee may have lost--we know in the present instance that a lost promotion is the benefit alleged to have been improperly withheld. What isn't established (and what the Arbitrator didn't find) in the present case is that there is a causal relationship between the Agency's failure to abide by its firearms training requirements as part of the grievant's training and the lost promotion. Failure by the grievant to successfully complete all of the training course completely negates the Agency's obligation to provide the retroactive promotion, an event that would not be possible nor logical if the Agency's actions did indeed cause the promotion to be lost.</p>
<p class="noindent">EEO considerations may impact arbitration decisions involving training. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE INS Council</span>, 57 FLRA 254, 255 (2001) (sustaining award requiring agency to make disability accommodation determinations as to personnel denied training by reason of physical condition).</p>
<p class="noindent">Through 1990 and <span class="Italic">Customs Serv.</span> [37 FLRA 309], establishing an "abrogation" standard (the "abrogation standard was reinstituted in 2010 in <span class="Italic">EPA and AFGE Council 238</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v65/65-28.html">65 FLRA 113</a> (2010), and then the abrogation standard was abandoned in favor of application of the earlier applied "excessive interference" standard for negotiability cases in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 817</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v70/70-83.html">70 FLRA 398</a> (2018)), FLRA invoked management rights protections to vacate awards that imposed training obligations on agencies. Even though a contract had a clause requiring nomination of employees to participate in training on a fair and equitable basis, an award finding a violation of the contract was vacated. 5 USC 7106 provides that nothing shall affect the authority of the agency to exercise its reserved rights. One of those rights is the assignment of work, and, as a part of that right, the assignment of training during duty time. <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE, INS Council, Local 2805</span>, 18 FLRA 99, 100-01 (1985). An arbitration award improperly directed the employer to provide training in the form of university education to an employee on official time, with travel and per diem. Determination of how employees spend their duty time is an exercise of the right to assign work. Encompassed within that right is the discretion to determine who will receive particular training during duty hours. Proposals that required management to provide specific formal training or to assign employees to specific training programs during working hours interfered with the right to assign work. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE</span>, 25 FLRA 479, 480-81 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd on reconsideration</span>, 27 FLRA 114 (1987). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">IRS, Midwest Region and NTEU Chap. 10</span>, 28 FLRA 983, 986 (1987) ("The Activity fails to establish that reimbursement of that portion of the grievant's bar review course that was directly related to the grievant's position of appeals officer and that would enable the grievant to increase his ability to perform his current job is contrary to the Training Act or decisions of the Comptroller General."). An award that directed training of supervisors (to remedy apparent unfamiliarity with rating procedures) was disallowed as an infringement upon management's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">Army Transp. Ctr., Ft. Eustis and NAGE Local R4-106</span>, 33 FLRA 391, 395 (1988). Another award was reversed because it improperly interfered with management's right to reassign employees to ensure their cross-training. <span class="Italic">Naval Air Rework Facility, Jacksonville and Nat'l Ass'n of Gov't Inspectors</span>, 27 FLRA 318, 320 (1987).</p>
