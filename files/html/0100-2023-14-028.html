Nat'l Gallery of Art</span>, 980 F.2d 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (security guard was held to standards "above those borne by ordinary employees"); <span class="Italic">Bidnick v. DOJ,</span> AT-0752-14-0060-I-1 (NP 4/15/2015) (criminal investigator: "Regarding the nature and seriousness of the offense and its relation to the appellant's duties, position, and responsibilities, the Board has long held that offenses touching on honesty and integrity are especially serious when it comes to law enforcement officers, who are held to a higher standard of conduct to begin with. <span class="Italic">E.g</span>.,<span class="Italic"> Phillips v.

DOJ</span>, 69 MSPR 211, 241 (1995) (rule applied to an OIG criminal investigator); <span class="Italic">Beck v.

<p class="Body-Text">Of criminal activity by a federal law enforcement official, the Federal Circuit remarked, <span class="Italic">Martinez v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-1269):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are especially reluctant to interfere with an agency's decision to take adverse action against law enforcement officers charged with committing a crime. <span class="Italic">See Masino v. United States</span>, 589 F.2d 1048 (Ct. Cl. 1978). The reluctance stems not only from the notion that off-duty criminal misconduct dampens the efficiency of the service in an economic sense, but from the realization that an agency responsible for law enforcement relies heavily on its reputation for honesty and integrity. The agency may reasonably determine that the efficiency of its service to the public would deteriorate should it cast a blind eye on the malefactions of its own employees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The designation of a position or individual as a law enforcement officer is not dependent on the appellant's eligibility for LEO retirement credit. <span class="Italic">Jones v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the administrative judge erred when she determined that the appellant failed to establish his affirmative defense of harmful procedural error, especially with respect to his argument that the deciding official improperly relied on <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> issues in sustaining his removal. However, we find that the appellant's argument with respect to the agency's consideration of <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> issues is properly analyzed first as a claim that the agency denied him minimum due process. <span class="Italic">See Silberman v. Department of Labor</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-8 (2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency intends to rely on aggravating factors as the basis for the imposition of a penalty, such factors should be included in the advance notice of adverse action so that the employee will have a fair opportunity to respond to those factors before the agency's deciding official. <span class="Italic">Lopes v. Department of the Navy</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 5 (2011). <span id="Page_2321"></span>Our reviewing court has explained that, if an employee has not been given "notice of any aggravating factors supporting an enhanced penalty," an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication with the deciding official regarding such factors may constitute a constitutional due process violation because it potentially deprives the employee of notice of all the evidence being used against him and the opportunity to respond to it. <span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274, 1280 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Furthermore, in determining whether a due process violation has occurred, there is no basis for distinguishing between <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information provided to the deciding official and information personally known by the deciding official, if the information was considered in reaching the decision and not previously disclosed to the appellant. <span class="Italic">Lopes</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, not every <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication rises to the level of a due process violation; only <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications that introduce new and material information to the deciding official constitute due process violations. <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The question is whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is "so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances." <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279 (citations omitted). The Board will consider the following factors, among others, to determine whether an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contact is constitutionally impermissible: (1) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication merely introduces "cumulative" information or new information; (2) whether the employee knew of the information and had a chance to respond to it; and (3) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. <span class="Italic">See Blank v. Department of the Army</span>, 247 F.3d 1225, 1229 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency did not provide the appellant notice regarding <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> issues in the notice of proposed removal. In his written evaluation of the penalty determination factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305-06 (1981), however, the deciding official listed the appellant's <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> issues as an aggravating factor in assessing the removal penalty, which contributed in part to his finding that the appellant had no potential for rehabilitation. In so finding, the deciding official observed that the appellant's attorney failed to set forth any arguments in the appellant's written reply to the proposal notice to explain how the agency would overcome the <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> issues facing the appellant, despite the agency's failure to provide him proper notice of this matter. The deciding official's hearing testimony corroborated his written evaluation of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> issues in imposing the appellant's removal without providing him notice and an opportunity to respond to those issues cannot fairly be deemed cumulative or immaterial to the deciding official's decision. <span class="Italic">See Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1376-77. Thus, the agency violated the appellant's due process rights by denying him notice of the specific information considered and an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">See Silberman</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">see also Gray v.

Consequently, because the agency violated the appellant's due process rights, the appellant's removal must be reversed and he must be afforded a "new constitutionally correct removal procedure." <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This situation is analogous to cases where a third-party agency revokes a credential or qualification necessary to perform the employee's position. In such cases, the Board takes the independent agency's action at face value, and reviews the employing agency's response to that action. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Shoffner v. Department of the Interior</span>, 9 M.S.P.R. 265, 267 (1981), the agency removed Mr. Shoffner for failing to remain qualified for his position as a Hydrologic Technician due to a one-year revocation of his driver's license. The Board did not consider whether or not the revocation was correct, but rather reasoned that removal was appropriate because Mr. Shoffner "could no longer operate a government motor vehicle because the possession of a valid state motor vehicle operator's license was a prerequisite to the operation of the government vehicle." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This made Mr. Shoffner unable to perform his duties as a Hydrologic <span id="Page_2322"></span>Technician, "which required driving a vehicle alone approximately 1,000 miles per month." <span class="Italic">Id.; see also Penland v. Dep't of Interior</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 474, 476 (2010) (affirming the agency's removal of a pilot who failed to maintain his pilot authorization).[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;This case differs from situations where the agency itself decides to revoke a necessary credential. In those cases, the Board typically reviews the underlying decision to, e.g., revoke medical certification or procurement authority. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., McGillivray v. Fed. Emerg. Mgmt. Agency</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 398 (1993) (agency revoked procurement authority); <span class="Italic">Siegert v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Nguyen argues that this case is not analogous to a licensing situation, because his position does not require a license. Additionally, unlike the public standards for obtaining a driver's license, Mr. Nguyen argues the USAO's <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> determination "is devoid of any objective standard and stands essentially without sufficient articulation or explanation." However, Mr. Nguyen's position as a Deportation Officer expressly requires testifying and swearing out complaints, and the USAO's <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> determination prevents him from performing these duties. As in third-party licensing situations, the Agency lacks authority to contest the USAO's decision. The Board did not err in holding the Agency did not violate Mr. Nguyen's due process rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> issues ordinarily arise in appeals by law enforcement agents, similar considerations were applied in the appeal of a chemist charged with off-duty misconduct that the agency contended impaired his ability to testify in court, as required in his position description. <span class="Italic">Bland v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board has not explained how an agency must prove <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> impairment. Agencies asserting impairment may try to rely on no more than an opinion of a proposing or deciding official that the impairment would occur if the appellant were retained and later testified in a proceeding presenting the possibility of a credibility challenge to the appellant's testimony. The opinion of the proposing or deciding official is speculative. Stronger evidence is a written statement or testimony from a U.S. Attorney's office that <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> impairment would likely arise from the actions of the appellant. If that statement is obtained from the federal prosecutor's office, the Board will not reevaluate the prosecutor's opinion, <span class="Italic">Taylor v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In her initial decision, the administrative judge sustained both of the agency's charges based upon the appellant's admission that she created and signed the Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) arrest documentation that she knew contained materially inaccurate and untrue statements about how the arrest transpired. The administrative judge also sustained the agency's charge of unacceptable conduct based, in part, upon the determination of the United States Attorney's Office (USAO) that the appellant's aforementioned misconduct prevented the USAO from calling her as a credible government witness in any future case.[3] The administrative judge found no support for the appellant's claim that she was denied due process because she was not allowed to appeal the USAO's determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The effect of the USAO's letter was that the appellant was "<span class="Italic">Giglio</span>-impaired." <span class="Italic">See Giglio v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant alleges, as she did below, that she was denied due process when she was not allowed to appeal the USAO's determination that she was "<span class="Italic">Giglio</span>-impaired," which served as a basis for the agency's unacceptable conduct charge against her. When an agency intends to rely on aggravating factors, such as the USAO's <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> determination, as the basis for the imposition of a penalty, such factors should be included in the advance notice of adverse action so that the employee will have a fair opportunity to respond to those factors before the agency's deciding official. <span class="Italic">See Lopes v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency was bound by the USAO's decision that the appellant was <span class="Italic">Giglio</span>-impaired, and it determined that such impairment prevented the appellant from fully performing her duties as a police officer. <span class="Italic">See Doe</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 198, &#x00B6; 16. The agency appropriately notified the appellant in the notice of proposed removal that the USAO had determined the appellant was <span class="Italic">Giglio</span>-impaired and that the agency viewed such impairment as support for the unacceptable conduct charge. After the appellant was given an opportunity to respond to the charges, the deciding official weighed the evidence and determined that the appellant's removal was appropriate and warranted. Accordingly, because the agency informed the appellant that the USAO's determination was an aggravating factor supporting her removal and provided the appellant with an opportunity to respond to the removal charges, the administrative judge properly concluded that the agency did not violate the appellant's due process rights.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In support of her allegation that the agency denied her due process by basing her removal on the USAO's unreviewable determination that she was <span class="Italic">Giglio</span>-impaired, the appellant cited to the Board's holdings in <span class="Italic">Laycock v.

Such reliance, however, is misplaced because those cases involve decisions made by the employing agency that was a party to the appeal.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge found, the misconduct adversely affected the appellant's job performance because it impaired his ability to testify as a credible witness in any possible court case.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[8] The administrative judge correctly determined that the agency proved the existence of a nexus between the appellant's misconduct and the efficiency of the federal service. Given the nature of the appellant's misconduct, his role as a law enforcement officer, the display of a weapon authorized by his position, and the need for the agency to trust the candor of its law enforcement officers, we discern no error in the administrative judge's finding of nexus. <span class="Italic">Doe v.

Nexus supported discipline of a supervisory correctional officer who entered a guilty plea to a disorderly conduct charge involving the display of a weapon that the officer was permitted to carry. There was an impact on the job: the display of a weapon during a dispute with a civilian adversely impacted the agency's confidence in the appellant's ability to deal with prison confrontations without resorting to deadly force. There was also an impact on the public: limited publicity, with a greater impact in a small community, led to a suspicion of authority and a decline in confidence in agency integrity among people who knew the appellant as a law enforcement officer, <span class="Italic">Stines v.

Although the Board sustained one specification of a technical violation of the Gun Control Act, there was considerable confusion or doubt concerning the meaning of the statutory provision and its application to the appellant.

<p class="Body-Text">An off-duty and unauthorized false arrest of private citizens by a deputy marshal warranted dismissal. <span class="Italic">Connolly v.

The court opinion recited the facts: the employee drew a gun to effect an off-duty arrest, had the citizens he arrested jailed briefly pending disposition of the charges against them (apparently tampering with an auto or use of an auto without a proper registration), and verbally abused local police who investigated the incident. Sustaining the discharge, the court said of the incident:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Connolly's conduct in this bizarre fiasco was not only improper and in excess of his authority, but his rash behavior impinged on the working relationship between the Marshals Service and the local authorities and adversely affected the reputation of the Department of Justice and its Marshals Service. He demonstrated questionable judgment in drawing his weapon and in later refusing to back down in pursuing his charges when it should have been apparent to a reasonably prudent man that there were no reasonable grounds to believe the accused were guilty. The local police were called at the request of the accused who readily identified themselves and their conduct was explained by the owner of the car.... Connolly apparently "got his back up," insisted that his suspects be booked and charged, and refused to admit his error until the affair had dragged on unreasonably long, even though the local police were unconcerned with the incident and sought to reassure Connolly by vouching for the suspects. On the evening of the incident, Connolly's supervisor was informed over the telephone by the Falmouth police, that he "was on the borderline of being in protective custody for being intoxicated." This information later entered into the agency's decision to bring the removal charges. Finally, there was no excuse for his use of threatening, abusive, obscene language toward Ptl. Cusolito, the third reason for his discharge.... <span class="Italic">See Hayes v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 727 F.2d 1535, 1539 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Masino v.

Dept. of Treasury</span>, 15 MSPR 482, 484 (1983) (criminal investigator was removed for what appeared to be an off-duty, improper search of an individual following the appellant's identification of himself as a special agent).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Sufficient basis for removing a border patrol agent existed on proof of off-duty obscene phone calls and a threat of violence against an individual. A favorable psychiatric report was insufficient to outweigh the agency's concerns about the credibility of the employee as a witness in law enforcement proceedings and about his future contacts with aliens. <span class="Italic">Barnhill v. DOJ</span>, 10 MSPR 378, 381 (1982); <span class="Italic">see Capozzella v. FBI</span>, 11 MSPR 552, 557 (1982) (off-duty misconduct, consisting of dressing up in women's clothing for unauthorized purposes was properly punishable by an adverse action against a counterintelligence agent, but many mitigating factors and a demonstration of disparity in the penalties called for mitigation of the penalty to demotion to the next lower non-special agent position). As to a correctional officer whose position required contact with women in a prison, off-duty misconduct affecting a woman was sufficient <span id="Page_2324"></span>to sustain removal of the appellant in <span class="Italic">Royster v. DOJ</span>, 58 MSPR 495, 499-500 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency next contends that the administrative judge erred in his determination that nexus had not been shown. We agree. An agency may show a nexus between off-duty misconduct and the efficiency of the service by demonstrating by preponderant evidence that: (1) The circumstances are so egregious as to raise a rebuttable presumption; (2) the misconduct adversely affects the appellant's or co-workers' job performance or the agency's trust and confidence in the appellant's job performance; or (3) the misconduct interfered with or adversely affected the agency's mission. <span class="Italic">Kruger v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 32 MSPR 71, 74 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the administrative judge viewed the misconduct as a "violent lovers' quarrel" and, therefore, not particularly serious, especially since the appellant and the woman had resumed a cordial relationship. Furthermore, after noting that <span class="Italic">Barnhill v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 9 MSPB 608, 10 MSPR 378 (1982), is "[t]he Board case most on point," the administrative judge nevertheless found it inapplicable as precedent because the appellant did not exhibit the aberrant behavior shown in <span class="Italic">Barnhill</span> and because the woman was willing to resume friendly relations with the appellant. The administrative judge thus found that the appellant's misconduct was not serious and, therefore, discounted the testimony by the prison warden that he had lost trust and confidence in the appellant's abilities. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The agency contends that <span class="Italic">Barnhill</span> is directly on point.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that <span class="Italic">Barnhill</span> is applicable to this case. <span class="Italic">Barnhill</span> dealt with an employee whose duties as a border patrol agent included the apprehension of female aliens. 10 MSPR at 380. The employee had been convicted on a misdemeanor charge of making obscene phone calls and had been charged with making a threat of violence to a female. Despite favorable reports from the employee's psychiatrist and parole officer regarding the employee's progress in his counseling and his potential for rehabilitation, the Board found the required nexus between the misconduct and the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 380-381. The Board found persuasive the testimony by an agency official stating that the misconduct had resulted in a loss of trust and confidence in the employee's ability to perform his duties. The official noted that the duties of the position required dealing with female aliens and that claims of abuse by agency employees sometimes arose. Given the nature of the misconduct and the nature of the appellant's position, both with respect to his particular duties dealing with female aliens and his general status as a law enforcement officer held to a higher standard of conduct, the Board found that the required nexus had been established. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the sustained misconduct involved several threatening and abusive phone calls. In those phone calls, the appellant at times threatened to kill the woman and her house guests. Although the administrative judge found that the appellant did not exhibit the aberrant behavior shown in <span class="Italic">Barnhill</span>, we do not discern a substantial difference between these actions. The administrative judge placed much emphasis on the relationship between the appellant and the woman. Although the relationship is a factor to be considered, the appellant's repeated threats to the woman must also be considered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The employee's duties required him to maintain the safety, custody and control of female inmates. The prison warden testified that problems had occurred in the past involving sexual relations between staff members and inmates. He further testified that he had irretrievably lost his belief in the appellant's integrity and could no longer trust the appellant to properly perform the duties of his position. We find that the agency has established by preponderant evidence that the appellant's misconduct adversely affected its trust and confidence in the appellant's ability to perform his duties. <span class="Italic">See Beasley v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 52 MSPR 272, 275 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, nexus may be proven by showing that the employee's off-duty misconduct is antithetical to the agency's mission. <span class="Italic">Kruger</span>, 32 MSPR at 75 n.2. The agency is not required to demonstrate a specific impact on the appellant's job performance or the efficiency of the service before taking action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 75. Based on the above, we find that <span class="Italic">Barnhill</span> is applicable and that the agency has established the required nexus between the appellant's misconduct and the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Conviction for distribution of obscene materials supported removal of an immigration inspector.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant, as a Special Agent, had the general responsibility to uphold the law, not break it.

See MacDonald v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 4 MSPB 459 (1980). In considering the penalty, the deciding official stated that it was appellant's "casual disregard for the proper use of official government equipment," his failure to "maintain a high degree of credibility" and "to think quickly and act properly in emergency situations," and his "indecision relative to reporting the accident in a timely manner," which caused the adverse action to be taken against him.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the requirement that the agency prove the charge it has brought against the appellants, the agency must also prove that there is a nexus, i.e., a clear and direct relationship between the articulated grounds for the adverse action and either the appellants' ability to accomplish their duties satisfactorily or some other legitimate government interest. <span class="Italic">Merritt v.

The administrative judge found an "obvious" nexus in these cases, reasoning that the appellants are supervisors and must be prepared to lead by example and exercise good judgment in order to have credibility and be trustworthy. Given the nature of the facts cited in support of the charges in these cases, we deem it appropriate to more fully address this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may establish nexus by showing that the employee's conduct (1) affected his or his coworkers' job performance; (2) affected management's trust and confidence in the employee's job performance; or (3) interfered with or adversely affected the agency's mission. <span class="Italic">Johnson v.

The deciding official testified in both cases that the incident at issue had caused him to lose confidence in the appellants. He also testified that the mission of the agency is national security, and that it is important for supervisors to make sound decisions that are based on policies, directives, and law. In addition, he noted that the appellants, as first-line supervisors, oversee a young and impressionable workforce, and that such junior employees look to their supervisors for guidance and direction. Finally, the deciding official testified that drinking alcohol in a government vehicle is dangerous, considering the nature of law enforcement work, not only from a liability standpoint, but also from an officer safety standpoint. The deciding official's testimony establishes that the appellants' conduct affected management's trust and confidence in their job performance and adversely affected the agency's mission. Therefore, under the particular circumstances of these cases, nexus is established.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Removal was sustained of a wildlife management biologist who entered a <span class="Italic">nolo</span> plea to a publicized violation of criminal laws relating to federal wildlife and endangered species laws that he was directly responsible for enforcing. <span class="Italic">Wenzel v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 33 MSPR 344, 356-57 (1987). Removal was mitigated to a 30-day suspension for a correctional officer who attempted to smuggle a small quantity of fireworks into the country and who became abusive during a confrontation with customs officials. <span class="Italic">White v. DOJ</span>, 35 MSPR 684, 689 (1988). Mitigation was declined as to a law enforcement officer involved in off-duty drug use. The officer had sensitive and important responsibilities involving protection of public officials; the misconduct was considered to be directly opposed to the agency's mission. <span class="Italic">Canevari v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 50 MSPR 311, 317-18 (1991); <span class="Italic">see Zazueta v. DOJ</span>, 94 MSPR 493, 498-500 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-10 (2003) (Border Patrol agent with drug enforcement responsibility was removed for a first time charge of drug use that was revealed through random drug testing; stress or personal problems did not justify the use of drugs rather than "recourse to other coping mechanisms"), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Zazueta v. DOJ</span>, 104 Fed. Appx. 166 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP). In <span class="Italic">Zazueta</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the court observed, 104 Fed. Appx. at 170:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the petitioner has not cited a single case in which the decision to remove a law enforcement officer for off-duty drug use has been found unreasonable. The case law is clearly to the contrary. <span class="Italic">Rice v. Dep't of Treasury,</span> 998 F.2d 997 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (sustaining removal of IRS agent for off-duty use of drugs); <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 51 M.S.P.R. 43 (1991) (sustaining removal of prison guard for off-duty possession of marijuana); <span class="Italic">Masino v. United States,</span> 218 Ct. Cl. 531, 589 F.2d 1048 (1978) (sustaining removal of United States Customs Service employee for personal use and transportation of marijuana).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Law enforcement officers may be subject to mandatory removal based on a <span id="Page_2325"></span>felony conviction. <span class="Italic">See Cleaton v. DOJ</span>, 122 MSPR 296, 299-301 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-11, 2015 MSPB 24 (2015) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Cleaton v. DOJ</span>, 839 F.3d 1126 (Fed. Cir. 2016)).
