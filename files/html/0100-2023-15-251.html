<p class="Block-Quote1">Although three charges against the appellant have been sustained, including two charges of falsification, we agree with the administrative judge that the penalty of demotion exceeds the maximum reasonable penalty in light of the unique circumstances in this case. While falsification is serious misconduct, the Board has repeatedly held that there is no <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule as to the penalty to be imposed in cases involving falsification. <span class="Italic">See Blake</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. at 394, &#x00B6; 46.

Department of Justice</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 137, &#x00B6; 36 (2011); <span class="Italic">Edwards v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 173, &#x00B6; 14 (2010). The agency in its petition for review has placed much emphasis on the fact that the administrative judge failed to appreciate the nature and seriousness of the offense and failed to consider that the appellant was a supervisory law enforcement officer.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Citing <span class="Italic">Reid</span>, <span class="Italic">Solis v. DOJ,</span> DA-0752-14-0082-I-1 (NP 5/21/2015), mitigated to suspension the removal of a DEA criminal investigator for charges of unbecoming conduct and false statements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Like the administrative judge, we acknowledge the seriousness of the charges against the appellant, and we do not minimize their gravity. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Reid v. Department of the Navy</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 396, &#x00B6; 25 (2012) (falsification is a serious offense). The Board, however, has found that there is no <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule as to the penalty to be imposed in such cases, and that the proper penalty must be determined on a case-by-case basis, considering the totality of the surrounding circumstances. <span class="Italic">Reid</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 396, &#x00B6; 25. The Board has traditionally found the following <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors to be of particular relevance in determining the reasonableness of a penalty in cases involving falsification: (1) the nature of the offense and its relation to the appellant's duties; (2) the appellant's disciplinary record; (3) the effect of the offense on the appellant's ability to perform at a satisfactory level; and (4) the mitigating factors surrounding the offense. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 26.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We concur with the administrative judge that the facts of this appeal do not support the agency's imposed penalty. The record demonstrates that the appellant had a lengthy career with the agency during which he received outstanding performance evaluations and had no prior disciplinary history. Following the events leading to the issuance of the notice of proposed removal, moreover, the agency selected the appellant for a volunteer mission in Afghanistan involving heightened responsibilities, and he continued to receive outstanding performance evaluations from his immediate supervisors during this time. The Board has previously found that an agency's decision to promote an employee following the occurrence of the misconduct at issue undermines the agency's assertion of a complete loss of trust and confidence in the employee. <span class="Italic">See Hovanec v. Department of the Interior</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 340, 346 (1995). We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's selection for a special overseas mission after the misconduct occurs belies the agency's asserted lack of trust and confidence in the appellant and supports the mitigation of the removal to a lesser penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's admission of wrongdoing and cooperation with the agency's investigation, combined with his work performance, length of service, and prior honorable military service, weighs in favor of a penalty less severe than removal. <span class="Italic">See Boo v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 100, &#x00B6; 22 (2014) (expressions of remorse are mitigating factors indicative of rehabilitation); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. 341, 344 (1984) (removal is the most serious penalty available and the most harmful to the employee). Finally, we agree with the administrative judge that the comparator cases relied upon by the deciding official involving other instances of removal are sufficiently distinct from the facts of this case and do not bolster the agency's argument for removing the appellant from service as opposed to imposing some lesser penalty. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Portner v. Department of Justice,</span> 119 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6; 21 (2013) (observing that the conduct of identified comparators was arguably more serious than the appellant's conduct).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we agree with the administrative judge that the deciding official did not adequately consider the aforementioned mitigating factors and that the penalty of removal exceeded the bounds of reasonableness under the totality of the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Reid</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 396, &#x00B6; 30 (overturning a removal for falsification because several mitigating factors were not sufficiently considered by the deciding official); <span class="Italic">Casias v. Department of the Army</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 130, 132 (1994) (a penalty disproportionate to the offense must be mitigated). We AFFIRM the administrative judge's initial decision mitigating the appellant's removal to a 60-day suspension without pay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may attempt to assess a falsification charge relative to prior long and good service, apparent misconceptions by the deciding official about the nature of the charge, and the relatively minor nature of the appellant's breach of supervisory responsibility. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Robertson v. DOJ</span>, 81 MSPR 658, 664-65 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-14 (1999) (mitigating demotion to a suspension of a supervisor whose statement concerning the authorization to spend agency funds was somewhat misleading but apparently not truly harmful to agency interests); <span class="Italic">Blake v. DOJ</span>, 81 MSPR 394, 418-19 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 47-48 (1999) (mitigating to a demotion and suspension the removal of a manager accused of manipulating the appearance of working conditions and reports of working conditions to create a favorable impression for a visiting congressional delegation; no evidence of malice or personal gain); <span class="Italic">Greer v. USPS</span>, 43 MSPR 180, 189-90 (1990) (reducing demotion to a suspension for investigative misrepresentation concerning use of alcohol on agency premises); <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 27 MSPR 227, 230-31 (1985) (mitigating to a reprimand the suspension of a ship officer who failed to make log entries; the ship's captain directed that no entries be made). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">McManus v. DOJ</span>, 81 MSPR 672, 676 &#x00B6; 9 (1999) (higher standard of conduct expected of a supervisory law enforcement officer justified a demotion for false answers during an agency investigation of misconduct).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of mitigation in a falsification case, <span class="Italic">Stein v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 434, 441 (1993), commented:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The cases that the administrative judge cited to support his choice of demotion as the appropriate penalty are not closely analogous to these facts, since they involve situations where the employee engaged in repeated, widespread misconduct that involved a direct, significant aspect of financial gain; they do not squarely address the appropriate penalty for an isolated incident involving no direct benefit to the appellant....&#8197;[D]epending on the individual circumstances of each case...a 60-day suspension may be the maximum supportable penalty even for falsification of documents involving some prospective financial gain for the offender.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Stein,</span> several factors mitigated removal for falsification of production reports to suspension rather than the demotion directed by the AJ: the rehabilitation potential of the appellant because he "could still work well with his colleagues and subordinates," the offense "represented an isolated incident," and it was set against a background of "sixteen years of service by the appellant to the agency, with a good disciplinary record." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gunn v. USPS</span>, 63 MSPR 513, 520 (1994) (short suspension rather than a demotion was appropriate for an appellant who, with no personal gain resulting from the incident, improperly signed ("falsified") a leave slip for another employee who was entitled to the leave); <span class="Italic">Seas v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 569, 574 (1998) (mitigating a falsification penalty when the appellant signed another's name as a second signature to an audit report; had the appellant printed the name, no falsification charge would have resulted).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit intervened to mitigate a removal for falsification of expense vouchers in <span class="Italic">Birch v. DOD</span> (Fed. Cir. 1993 NP No. 93-3076). The court considered the appellant's excellent past record and the delay between the offense and the adverse action as it mitigated the penalty to a one-year suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court will not disturb a penalty "unless it exceeds the range of permissible punishment or is so harsh and unconsciously disproportionate to the offense that it amounts to an abuse of discretion." <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 772 F.2d 887, 889 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (quoting <span class="Italic">Villela v. Depot of the Air Force,</span> 727 F.2d 1574, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1984)). In this case, imposition of the penalty of removal amounted to an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First of all, while it is true that Ms. Birch acted recklessly in submitting the averaged vouchers, the AJ did not find, as a factual matter, that her intent was to defraud the agency. In addition, beyond her 18-year record of exceptional service, the evidence is uncontroverted that (i) Ms. Birch asked several people at the agency for help in completing the voucher forms; (ii) she attempted to tender meal receipts to Mr. Bukowski for his review; and (iii) she readily admitted that the amounts on her forms were not actual daily expenses and repeatedly offered to repay any amounts which the agency found to be overpayments. In addition, the agency's contention that it lost confidence in Ms. Birch's trustworthiness as a result of this incident is undermined by the fact that it allowed her to remain on duty during the 19-month period prior to the initiation of the removal action while an investigation was being conducted and during a six-month period after learning the results of the investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2780"></span>For the forgoing reasons, the decision of the Board sustaining the penalty of removal is reversed. The penalty is reduced to a suspension of one year.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Displaying an agency auto decal on a car after the decal was supposed to have been destroyed when the appellant's on-base driving privileges were revoked did not warrant removal when the car and decal were improperly used on the base. The penalty was mitigated to a suspension. The appellant was proficient at his work as a pneudraulic systems mechanic. The offense had nothing to do with his work. There were other mitigating factors. <span class="Italic">Winner v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 10 MSPR 177, 179 (1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board summarized some of its doctrine concerning mitigation of falsification cases in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 61 MSPR 484, 490-93 (1994), involving a document that was apparently falsified without personal gain to the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no doubt that a charge concerning the falsification of documents involves serious misconduct which "affects [an employee's] reliability, veracity, trustworthiness and ethical conduct and thus directly impacts on the efficiency of the service." Indeed, the Board has consistently found that severe penalties in such cases are warranted and promote the efficiency of the service. However, although falsification has been found to be cause for removal, falsification <span class="Italic">per se</span> does not mean that removal will always be warranted in such cases. The magnitude of the discipline in a falsification case must necessarily depend upon the particular circumstances, and a balance of the factors both for and against mitigation. The Board has held that factors of particular relevance in determining the reasonableness of a penalty in a falsification case are: (1) The nature and seriousness of the offense and its relation to the appellant's duties, position and responsibilities; (2) the appellant's past disciplinary record; (3) the effect of the offense upon the appellant's ability to perform on a satisfactory level; and (4) the mitigating factors surrounding the offense.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge evaluated the attendant circumstances of the case and thoroughly balanced the relevant factors for and against mitigation of the penalty. This thorough evaluation of the penalty is evident in the reasons she set forth for mitigating the action, i.e.: (1) The appellant, although committing "serious misconduct" that "involved a breach of integrity which is especially serious given the agency's function," was, nevertheless, not aware that "she was participating in a scheme to defraud the government"; (2) the other employee involved, Ann L. Williams, received a lesser penalty for arguably more serious misconduct, which, while not an example of disparate treatment since Williams worked for another supervisor and in a different organizational level, nevertheless demonstrated that the agency did not believe that every breach of integrity warrants the penalty of removal; (3) the appellant had (a) 12 years of government service, (b) no disciplinary record, and (c) an above-average performance record that included at least one performance award; (4) the appellant was "above reproach in her trustworthiness," to the extent of reporting an occasion where the agency had incorrectly overpaid her for overtime; (5) her supervisor testified that "he had no problems with the appellant's performance or truthfulness"; (6) the agency permitted her to continue working in her position from July 1990, when it became aware of her wrongdoing, until initiating a removal action in September 1991, over a year later, thus failing to demonstrate a lack of confidence in her performance or honesty; (7) not all of the agency's specifications were sustained; and (8) the agency did not explain why a lesser penalty would have been "ineffective."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's decision to correct the agency's removal action by bringing "the penalty within the parameters of reasonableness," in light of the numerous mitigating factors listed above, is entirely consistent with other Board decisions in falsification cases that have mitigated removal or demotion penalties to periods of suspension. For example, in <span class="Italic">Rigilano v. US Postal Service</span>, 41 MSPR 513 (1989), an employee who had been on restricted sick leave submitted false medical documentation to his supervisor and the agency removed him. On appeal, the Board found that, while the appellant had a prior disciplinary record and the offense struck at the heart of the employer-employee relationship, the agency had not shown that the offense caused any specific harm to the agency's mission. The Board also found that there were mitigating factors, i.e., the appellant's past offenses were not serious, he had 14 years of service with the agency, and he was in fact ill on the day for which he submitted false medical documentation, which necessitated a reduction of the penalty from removal to a 60-day suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Schoeffler v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 47 MSPR 80, <span class="Italic">vacated in part on other grounds</span>, 50 MSPR 143 (1991), the Board mitigated a demotion action to a 60-day suspension upon weighing the mitigating factors with the seriousness of the charge that the appellant falsified time and attendance records and travel documents. Specifically, the Board found therein that the following factors warranted mitigation of the penalty: (1) The appellant had served the government for 18 years, with the last 8 served as a supervisor; (2) he had been fully successful in his performance evaluation for the last 2 years and had received a number of commendations and awards; (3) he was well-liked and respected by his fellow co-workers; (4) the agency did not propose disciplinary action until 11 months after it learned about the incident; and (5) there was no harm to the agency's mission and there was no notoriety in connection with the offense. Weighing against mitigation, on the other hand, were the following factors: (1) The seriousness of the charges; (2) the appellant's second-line supervisor had lost trust in him; and (3) supervisors are held to a higher standard of performance and conduct. Nevertheless, upon weighing all of the above factors, the Board concluded in <span class="Italic">Schoeffler</span> that mitigation was warranted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Stein v. US Postal Service</span>, 57 MSPR 434 (1993), a Superintendent of Postal Operations was charged with manipulating reports of mail volumes on five occasions in order to improve his own merit performance rating.[33] The administrative judge sustained only one of the specifications of falsification. The Board found that, "depending on the individual circumstances of each case,...a 60-day suspension may be the maximum supportable penalty even for falsification of documents involving some prospective financial gain for the offender." The Board so mitigated in <span class="Italic">Stein</span>, finding that the penalty of a 60-day suspension recognized the seriousness of the offense and would deter future misconduct by the appellant. Further, the Board found that mitigation was warranted because: (1) The offense was the appellant's first in an otherwise satisfactory record of 16 years of government service; (2) the administrative judge had made no finding that the offense affected the appellant's ability to perform his duties; and (3) only one of the five specifications had been sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[33]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Contrast</span> <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 52 MSPR 45, 47-48 (1991) (the Board sustained the penalty of removal where the appellant had falsified his employment application by omitting therefrom a prior conviction for the possession and sale of marijuana), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 980 F.2d 744 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table); <span class="Italic">Curry v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 35 MSPR 301, 306 (1987) (the Board sustained the employee's removal for falsification of official documents in that she failed to report information regarding her termination from prior employment and her prior arrests, convictions, incarceration and probation); <span class="Italic">McCreary</span> <span class="Italic">v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 27 MSPR 459, 462-63 (1985) (the Board sustained the Office of Personnel Management's directed removal of an Air Force employee for recent criminal conduct involving repeated acts of violence, and for falsification of his employment application with respect to that criminal conduct).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, there are several factors similar to those that the Board found mitigating in the above cases. Specifically, as we have noted, this appellant had 12 years of service with no prior disciplinary record; this was her first offense; only one of the two charges was sustained; her supervisor testified that he was confident in her performance and honesty; the appellant had an above-average commendable performance record and was known to be trustworthy because she had reported an overpayment to her employer; although the agency became aware of the appellant's misconduct in July 1990, it did not initiate a disciplinary action until over a year later; the appellant was a non-supervisory employee; a 45-day suspension is stringent, so as to ensure that the appellant refrains from such conduct in the future; and the administrative judge made no finding that the appellant's ability to perform her duties had been affected by her commission of the offense.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Freeland v. DHS</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/20-1344.OPINION.8-7-2020_1632844.pdf">825 Fed. Appx. 750</a> (Fed.

Contrary to Mr. Freeland's argument, the Board's decision acknowledges that this training occurred after Mr. Freeland completed the SF-85P form. But the Board nonetheless reasonably found that Mr. Freeland knew he had to be truthful and complete on the SF-85P form based on his testimony. Additionally, the form itself specifically required Mr. Freeland to certify that his responses were 'true, complete and correct.'").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Supervisory condonation of an employee's fraudulent practices may or may not lead to mitigation, depending upon the severity, frequency, and circumstances of the misconduct, <span class="Italic">Avant v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 71 MSPR 192, 201-02 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although it is not a defense to the charge, the appellants' condonation argument is relevant to penalty. <span class="Italic">See Cruppi</span>, 65 MSPR at 624-25; <span class="Italic">Barrett v. Department of the Interior,</span> 65 MSPR 186, 202-03 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub. nom. Wiggins v. Department of the Interior,</span> No. 95-3160, 1996 WL 280075 (Fed. Cir. May 22, 1996) (Table). It is apparent that supervisor Miller's attendance policies were lax. Moreover, Miller, the appellants, and all of their peers testified that the practice of taking unofficial undocumented compensatory time was widespread. While the evidence does not support a conclusion that the agency condoned such a policy, Miller certainly did.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Cruppi</span> and <span class="Italic">Barrett</span>, the appellants received letters of reprimand. <span id="Page_2781"></span>Here, however, the appellants acted for personal gain, and did not have the specific knowledge and approval of Miller for each instance of absence (although they did have his general approval to use unofficial undocumented compensatory time). In both <span class="Italic">Cruppi</span> and <span class="Italic">Barrett</span>, the employees committed misconduct at the instigation of their supervisors, who directed the employees to commit misconduct to cover up the supervisors' own misconduct; the employees were either unwilling or unable to stand up to the wrongful acts of their supervisors. In this case, it is the appellants who instigated the misconduct, not Miller. Moreover, in both <span class="Italic">Cruppi</span> and <span class="Italic">Barrett</span>, the periods of absence were very brief, whereas in this case, the appellants left work early on 16 and 18 days at about 2-3 hours per absence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under all the circumstances in the instant case, we conclude that the maximum reasonable penalty for each appellant is removal.</p>
