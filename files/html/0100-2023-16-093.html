<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-92"><span class="space">c.</span> Statistics; Sampling Method</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If performance standards for production jobs are set in terms of percentages of allowable errors, must all the work for the review period be reviewed, or is a sampling sufficient? Under <span class="Italic">Johnson v. VA</span>, 32 MSPR 443, 446 (1987), a sampling appears allowable. The appellant was a contact representative responsible for answering inquiries about veterans benefits. The standard for work quality allowed a 10% error rate, "as evidenced by quality control standards" established in the agency operations manual. The agency sought to prove unacceptable performance through sampling results. The Board reversed an AJ's finding that the agency was required to perform 100% review during the improvement period:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency's regulations provide that supervisory performance reviews of agency contact representatives are to be based upon quality control standards which utilize a representative sample of the employees' work. We find these quality control standards to be reasonable given the nature of the work performed by appellant.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In its petition for review, the agency states that if it were in fact required to perform a 100 percent review of its contact representatives during the warning period, none of those employees could be removed based upon unacceptable performance under Chapter 43. The agency explains that such a review would require that a supervisor sit in on every telephone and personal interview conducted by the employee in order to judge the quality of each interview. Considering the number of interviews conducted by agency personnel and the burden such a requirement would place upon supervisory officials, such a 100 percent review clearly would be an unreasonable and undesirable means of employee evaluation. In this regard, we note that the Federal Personnel Manual cites with approval performance appraisal systems which use a sampling method, stating that the objectivity of employee performance appraisals can be improved by evaluating representative samples of employees' work. FPM Chapter 430, App. A-6, g(2) (Dec. 31, 1980).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Burnett v. DOJ,</span> SF-0432-11-0400-I-1 (NP 2/29/2012), noted of a statistically allowable error rated allocated for a PIP:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts in his petition for review that the administrative judge erred in interpreting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b) and finding that the agency's 10% technical error rate[2] was a firm benchmark. While the agency referred to each of the performance measurements noted by the appellant in his petition for review at one point or another, the agency also clearly advised the appellant both at the start of the FY 2009 performance year and at the start of his PIP that he would not be successful unless he obtained a technical error rate of 10% or less.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note that the Board has recognized that an agency may establish a numerical error limit at the beginning of a PIP and that doing so does not deny the employee a reasonable period in which to demonstrate acceptable performance. <span class="Italic">See Thompson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 188, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-17 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant asserts that he was effectively appraised quarterly and semi-annually under a 10% technical error rate that should have been applied as an annual performance standard and that he should have been afforded an entire 12-month appraisal period to achieve a technical error rate of 10% or less. As a threshold matter we note that the Board has held that a 60-day performance improvement period is sufficient to afford an employee a reasonable opportunity to improve his performance. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Lee v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 32-33 (2010). Further, Board precedent reveals several cases in which an employee was removed for unacceptable performance based on a failure to obtain an error rate expressed as a percentage during a PIP shorter than 12 months. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Addison v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 261, 268-70 (1990) (affirming removal for unacceptable performance based on the appellant's failure to obtain an accuracy rate of 80% or higher during the course of a PIP lasting from June 16, 1986, to November 30, 1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 945 F.2d 1184 (Fed. Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Johnson v.

<p class="Body-Text">Sampling conditions should be rational. In <span class="Italic">Player v. VA</span>, 32 MSPR 448, 450-52 (1987), the appellant was a GS-4 Clerk who suffered a demotion when her agency determined that she failed to satisfy the critical element of accuracy by meeting a standard that required less than 20% of the documents she presented for review to be returned for correction. The agency contended that its burden was met by the introduction of some work product that had many errors; the agency failed to establish the total number of documents the appellant prepared. The standards had no references to sampling techniques. Setting aside the agency action, <span class="Italic">Player</span> concluded:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We find that the agency failed to establish by substantial evidence that appellant's performance fell below this requirement for the following reasons: (1) Without knowing the total number of documents prepared, it is impossible to determine objectively whether appellant exceeded the twenty percent limit;[1] ; (2) appellant's uncontradicted testimony establishes that the exhibits in question do not represent all of the documents she prepared; and (3) appellant's testimony also establishes that her orders to type documents exactly as drafted sometimes resulted in her copying mistakes that were made by her superiors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In reaching this conclusion, we note that, under some circumstances, an agency may establish that an appellant failed to satisfy a percent requirement for a critical element by examining a random sample of the appellant's work; rather than all of the work performed during the period in question. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 32 MSPR 443 (1987). In the present case, however, the agency did not establish that the documents it examined constituted a random sample of appellant's work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...While an agency is not required to provide an accounting of every assignment in order to successfully pursue a performance based action with respect to a critical element with a per cent requirement, the agency must, at a minimum, establish some methodology for selecting the examples of alleged unacceptable performance so that a reasonable person might conclude that the appellant's performance fell below the position's requirements....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has failed to satisfy this requirement in the present case. As discussed above, the agency conceded that it had no conception of the relationship between the cited examples of unacceptable performance and appellant's total work during the performance improvement period. Further, there is no indication that these examples were selected in any objective systematic fashion....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Player</span> did not invalidate statistical standards. Under <span class="Italic">Atamantyk v. DOD</span>, 49 MSPR 432, 440 n.3 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e note that our decision in <span class="Italic">Player</span> does not hold that all performance standards containing percentage requirements are invalid as an abuse of agency discretion. It instead holds that, where such percentage requirements are used, the agency must prove that the examples of unacceptable performance accurately reflect the employee's work. This can be accomplished either through the methodology showing mentioned above or through evidence of the total number of the <span id="Page_2963"></span>assignments given to the employee during the evaluation period and the total number of errors. <span class="Italic">Player v. Veterans Administration</span>, 32 MSPR 448, 451-52 at n.1.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Player</span> and <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> were followed in <span class="Italic">Addison v. DHHS</span>, 46 MSPR 261, 268-69 (1990)--sampling methods were demonstrated to be sufficiently valid when a supervisor testified the sampling statistics represented 100% review of all of the appellant's pending work when he was on the PIP:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where, as here, the agency has charged the appellant with failing to maintain a required accuracy rate, it should not always have to prove the details of its computation at the hearing. Certainly, it ought not be required to recite the appellant's errors case-by-case just in case he might want to quarrel with some. If the appellant was made aware of his errors during the PIP, credible proof of how the computation was made should generally suffice. The appellant can always demand more detailed information in discovery if he wants to challenge the accuracy of the agency's calculation. When coupled with these discovery procedures, information given during the PIP should go a long way toward refuting the contention that an appellant cannot defend himself at a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that when an agency charges an employee with failing to meet a performance standard that sets a percentage requirement, it is not required to provide an accounting of every assignment. At a minimum, however, it must establish some methodology for selecting the examples of alleged unacceptable performance so that a reasonable person could conclude that the appellant's performance fell below the position's requirements<span class="Italic">. See Player v. Veterans Administration</span>, 32 MSPR 448, 451-52 (1987); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 32 MSPR 443, 445-46 (1987). In this case, the agency's evidence was that Ms. Johnson performed a 100% review of all of the appellant's pending work at the time he was on the PIP. Thus, we find that it met the evidentiary standard set by the Board for proving that its percentage requirements were not met.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">As to</span> the attempted removal of an administrative law judge for poor production, it was required that statistical evidence of case disposition be meaningful to the extent that it either encompassed the time required to render dispositions or in some other fashion related the appellant's work to national averages of others doing the same work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA v. Goodman</span>, 19 MSPR 321, 331-32 (1984), 33 MSPR 325, 333-34 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Goodman</span> was overruled or distinguished in <span class="Italic">Shapiro v.

[Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-164.html#sec6-163">Administrative Law Judges</a>," concerning complaints against ALJs.] In a related situation in a Chapter 75 performance appeal, if an agency seeks to show the appellant is inefficient because someone else could handle the same work (a letter carrier's route) in less time, the work performed by the other individual with whom appellant is compared must be the same or substantially the same as the appellant's. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Montalvo v. USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 642, 647 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If statistical evidence is presented, or if the performance standards are expressed as statistics, must the agency prove to the Board each component of work leading to the statistical compilation? That was unnecessary, <span class="Italic">Addison v. DHHS</span>, 46 MSPR 261, 268 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where, as here, the agency has charged the appellant with failing to maintain a required accuracy rate, it should not always have to prove the details of its computation at the hearing.

<p class="Body-Text">Apparently the agency may evaluate an employee during a PIP based on simulated rather than actual workplace problems, <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. DOD</span>, 54 MSPR 641, 644 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the agency did not give him a reasonable opportunity to improve because it gave him a "test," the mythical exercise, rather than a duty under his job description. The administrative judge found that the agency gave the appellant ninety days to improve, that the notice putting him on a performance improvement plan told him his deficiencies and what he must do to improve, and that documentation showed that the agency offered the appellant appropriate guidance and assistance. Moreover, the administrative judge specifically found that the fictional exercise simulated the actual performance that would be expected of the appellant to achieve an acceptable level of performance. The appellant has not explained how the administrative judge erred in making this finding.</p>
