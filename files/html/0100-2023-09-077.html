<p class="Body-Text">The effect on the obligation to timely file an appeal when an agency is required, but fails, to provide notice of appeal rights is provided by <span class="Italic">Cranston v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/CRANSTON_RICHARD_E_PH_0353_06_0422_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_277301.pdf">106 MSPR 290</a>, 295 &#x00B6; 9, 2007 MSPB 181 (2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an appellant has established good cause to waive the timeliness requirements for filing an appeal, the Board's analysis generally depends on whether the agency was required to <span id="Page_963"></span>provide notice of the appellant's right to appeal the action at issue and whether the agency provided such notice. In the absence of a duty on the agency's part to provide notice of appeal rights, an appellant must establish that he exercised due diligence in discovering and pursuing a right of appeal before the Board will excuse an untimely filed appeal for good cause shown. <span class="Italic">Jones v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 306, 313-14 (1994). However, an appellant who was not provided a required notice of appeal rights is not required to show that he exercised due diligence in attempting to discover his appeal rights; the question is whether he was diligent in filing an appeal after he learned he could do so. <span class="Italic">Gingrich v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 583, 588 (1995).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tomczak v. USPS</span>, CH-0353-13-0138-I-1 (NP 9/30/2014) (Member Robbins concurring) ("When the agency fails to provide the required notice of appeal rights, the appellant is not required to show that he exercised due diligence in attempting to discover his appeal rights, but must show diligence in filing an appeal after learning he could do so. <span class="Italic">Gingrich v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 583, 588 (1995). These principles are applicable to restoration appeals under 5 C.F.R. Part 353. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cranston v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 290, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-14 (2007).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board never explained how an individual who is unaware of an appeal right because the agency failed to provide a required notice is then supposed to be diligent in the discovery of the otherwise unknown right. Decisions that follow emphasize the lack of agency notice rather than the lack of the appellant's efforts diligently to discover a right of an appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit directed the Board to waive untimeliness of an appeal when the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant was not given the notice required under 5 CFR 1201.21 concerning the consequences of filing an untimely appeal, set out at 5 CFR 1201.22(c), <span class="Italic">Ladrido v. MSPB</span>, 248 Fed. Appx. 184, 186-87 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, several factors contributed to Ladrido's filing his appeal late and, when viewed together, warranted discretionary waiver of the appeal deadline. Foremost among these was the agency's failure to comply with all the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21 in providing Ladrido with notice of his appeal rights. Although Section 1201.21(a) specifically required the agency to include "[n]otice of...the requirements of &#x00A7; 1201.22(c)" in any decision that is appealable to the Board, the Removal Letter omitted the following language from Section 1201.22(c):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If a party does not submit an appeal within the time set by statute, regulation, or order of a judge, it will be dismissed as untimely filed unless a good reason for the delay is shown. The judge will provide the party an opportunity to show why the appeal should not be dismissed as untimely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Below, Ladrido's counsel argued that this omitted information failed to apprise Ladrido of the seriousness of his missing the deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency's failure to provide notice of appeal rights required by applicable regulations if serious enough can, by itself, constitute good cause for untimely filing of an appeal. <span class="Italic">Toyama</span>, 481 F.3d at 1366-67 (notice provided incorrect forum for appeal); <span class="Italic">Walls v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 29 F.3d 1578, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (notice did not specify whether the time limit was calendar or working days); <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 839 F.2d 669, 674 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (no notice of appeal rights). In this case, the AJ rejected Ladrido's assertion that the agency's omission was "material" because Ladrido's declaration did not state that he would have filed a timely appeal had he received proper notice and because neither Ladrido nor his son, whose help Ladrido had enlisted, had carefully read the notice--his son told Ladrido the appeal deadline was one year instead of thirty days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ, however, failed to assess the agency's omission in light of all of the other particular circumstances of Ladrido's case. As the AJ noted, Ladrido promptly sought the help of family members and attempted to obtain counsel. While standing alone his actions were insufficient to show good cause for the late filing, they suggest that complete notice may have encouraged him to file a timely appeal or seek an extension. True, Ladrido's son misapprehended the appeal deadline, but had the document contained the omitted language, Ladrido, his son, or others who reviewed the Removal Letter might have appreciated the potentially fatal consequence of late filing and taken action to avoid it. Aware of the consequence, Ladrido may well have timely filed an appeal, even before obtaining counsel, or at least requested an extension while he continued to seek counsel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other factors in this case also counsel in favor of waiving the appeal deadline when combined with the incomplete notice and Ladrido's actions following removal, namely, Ladrido's age, his declaration of emotional strain, his <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status at the time he received the Removal Letter, and his first language being other than English. <span class="Italic">Sadian v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 100, 103 (M.S.P.B. 1990) (taking age and English language capability into account in waiving appeal deadline). The AJ correctly found that none of these circumstances alone was sufficient to justify waiving the appeal deadline. Similarly, the AJ held that the deficiency in the notice was not material enough, by itself, to warrant waiver of the filing deadline. Given all these circumstances in toto plus the incomplete notice, plus Ladrido's relative diligence, however, the AJ abused his discretion by failing to waive the appeal deadline, particularly where no prejudice to the government from the delay was shown or even alleged.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, a case was remanded to the Board to reconsider whether the deadline for an appeal should have been waived when the agency's removal notice did not inform the appellant of his right under regulation to demonstrate late receipt of the decision notice, <span class="Italic">Tatum v. MSPB</span>, 482 Fed. Appx. 554, 556-58 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The filing deadline for Tatum's Board appeal was thirty days after the December 18, 2009, effective date, or thirty days after Tatum's receipt of the agency's removal decision, whichever was later. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(1). As the Board stated, the declaration from Natalie Stevenson that the agency sent Tatum's removal decision to his address of record via first-class mail in December 2009, and that it was not returned to the agency as undelivered, raises a presumption that the notice was delivered. Under the common law mailbox rule, if a properly directed letter is proved to have been delivered to the post office, this creates an "inference of fact" that the letter was received by the addressee. <span class="Italic">Rios v. Nicholson</span>, 490 F.3d 928, 930-31 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (quoting <span class="Italic">Rosenthal v. Walker</span>, 111 U.S. 185, 193 (1884)). If there is opposing evidence that the letter was not received, the trier of fact must weigh the evidence "with all the other circumstances of the case" to determine whether the letter was actually received. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 931 (quoting <span class="Italic">Rosenthal</span>, 111 U.S. at 194). In this case, the Board concluded that Tatum failed to rebut the presumption because he did not explicitly claim that he did not receive the letter or that the address was incorrect, and we cannot conclude that this factual finding is unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, however, that the Board erred in its alternative holding that even if Tatum could rebut the presumption of receipt, his appeal was untimely because he did not "demonstrate that he acted diligently after he learned of his [appeal] right" from his union representative. If Tatum did not actually receive a copy of his removal decision and the notice of his appeal rights, then his appeal was not untimely, even if he learned of his appeal right from a third party. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(1). As we held in <span class="Italic">Saddler v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 F.3d 1357, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 1995), an appellant who does not receive an agency's decision because of his own negligence in failing to update his address with the agency cannot be considered to have constructively received the decision for purposes of section 1201.22--the appellant has thirty days from actual receipt of the decision to file a timely Board appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Board's finding that Tatum's appeal was untimely was not erroneous, we must remand for the Board to analyze whether good cause existed for Tatum's delay in filing his appeal. The burden is on the appellant to establish good cause by showing that the delay was excusable and that he exercised due diligence. <span class="Italic">Zamot v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 332 F.3d 1374, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2003). "[P]olicy considerations counsel against dismissals for untimely filing and militate for providing employees with a hearing on the merits of their appeals,...and that broad equitable principles of justice and good conscience should be applied in good cause determinations." <span class="Italic">Walls v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 29 F.3d 1578, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have found good cause for untimely filing where the agency has failed to provide proper notice of appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Toyama v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 481 F.3d 1361, 1366-67 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (notice failed to inform petitioner that she could appeal either to the MSPB or file an action in district court); <span class="Italic">Walls</span>, 29 F.3d at 1583 (notice failed to specify whether the time limit was in calendar or working days); <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 839 F.2d 669, 674 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (no notice of appeal rights). It appears that the December 2009 notice of decision fails to adequately inform Tatum of his appeal rights as required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21. The letter states that Tatum may file an appeal "within 30 calendar days from the effective date of this decision." As discussed previously, this is incorrect: Tatum could also timely file within 30 days of the receipt of his removal decision and appeal rights, even if this was more than 30 days from the decision's effective date. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(1). Furthermore, section 1201.21(a) requires notice of "the requirements of &#x00A7; 1201.22(c)." That latter section states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If a party does not submit an appeal within the time set by statute, regulation, or order of a judge, it will be dismissed as untimely filed unless a good reason for the delay is shown. The judge will provide the party an opportunity to show why the appeal should not be dismissed as untimely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 1201.22(c). The December 2009 notice does not contain this language, and we have held that good cause for delay existed where, among other things, this language was omitted. <span class="Italic">See Ladrido v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 248 F. App'x 184, 186-87 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (nonprecedential).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that Tatum had not established good cause, the Board did not address the defective notice. A remand is therefore required. On remand, additional factors the Board should consider include, but are not limited <span id="Page_964"></span>to, Tatum's PTSD treatment, his <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status, the possibility that Tatum never actually read his removal notice, and whether the agency was prejudiced by the delay. <span class="Italic">See Erickson v.

<p class="Body-Text">When an agency decision letter stated the time for an appeal as running from the effective date of the removal, and did not explain that the appeal could be filed within 30 days after the receipt of the belatedly-received decision, the Federal Circuit reversed the Board's timeliness dismissal, <span class="Italic">Williams v. MSPB,</span> 176 Fed. Appx. 136, 139-40 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Williams states that he believed the statutory time for appeal had expired about two years before the time of his November 25, 2003 letter to the agency, because that is what the decision letter explicitly stated. He states that on November 25, 2003 he requested that the agency "reissue" its decision, writing that "Such good faith action...would afford me a fresh and timely opportunity to appeal the 'Removal' issue through normal appellate procedural channels, as outlined in the Agency Decision on Proposed Removal, which was received via facsimile from you." He states that it was an unsupported and arbitrary action for the Board to hold that his letter acknowledging the fax copy of the decision letter would be held to measure the time for appeal, although neither the decision letter, nor any other notice, told him of the "receipt" deadline or purported to reissue the decision or otherwise respond to his request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It was not unreasonable for Mr. Williams to believe that some action would be required to allow him to file an appeal from the 2001 decision, for that decision letter plainly (albeit incorrectly) stated that any appeal must be filed within thirty days after the effective date of the decision, a date that had expired nearly two years earlier. We have been directed to no basis on which he can be charged with reasonably understanding that the faxed copy of the agency decision started the clock for appeal. On the face of the decision letter, it reasonably required some response to his inquiry or some accommodation before an appeal could be filed despite the appeal term specified in the decision letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is established that in MSPB proceedings the "government must unambiguously and clearly give notice of that which it requires of a litigant." <span class="Italic">Waldau v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 19 F.3d 1395, 1403 (Fed. Cir. 1994). The agency is required, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, to give notice of the time limits for appeal to the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21 Notice of appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When an agency issues a decision notice to an employee on a matter that is appealable to the Board, the agency must provide the employee with the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(a)&#x2003;Notice of the time limits for appealing to the Board, the requirements of &#x00A7; 1201.22(c), and the address of the appropriate Board office for filing the appeal;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(b)&#x2003;A copy, or access to a copy, of the Board's regulations;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(c)&#x2003;A copy of the appeal form in Appendix I of this part....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It was undisputed that the agency did not provide Mr. Williams with correct notice of the time for appealing to the Board. Although the MSPB argues that Mr. Williams is a lawyer, this does not fill the serious gaps in the agency's compliance with the notice requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the Board, in ratifying the agency's failure to discharge its statutory and regulatory notice obligations, acted contrary to law. Applying the principle set forth in <span class="Italic">Shiftlett</span>, 839 F.2d at 674, the absence from the decision letter of an adequate statement of the time limits measuring the appeal from the date of receipt of the decision establishes "good reason" for the delay in filing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ladrido, supra,</span> did not excuse an untimely filing based only on an incomplete agency notice when a different appellant did not suffer infirmities attributed to Mr. Ladrido. <span class="Italic">Mauldin v. USPS</span>, 115 MSPR 513, 515-18 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-14, 2011 MSPB 11 (2011), considered but did not give conclusive weight to incomplete notice of appeal rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, an appeal must be filed no later than 30 days after the effective date, if any, of the action being appealed, or 30 days after the date of receipt of the agency's decision, whichever is later. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). The Board will dismiss an appeal not filed within the time limit unless the appellant establishes good cause for the delay in filing. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(c). An appellant bears the burden of proof on the issue of timeliness. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(ii) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(B)] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge properly found that the appellant's appeal was untimely. Indeed, the appellant does not dispute that he filed his appeal more than 7 months beyond the filing deadline. The critical question is whether the appellant demonstrated good cause for the delay in filing this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Absent other circumstances, the agency's incomplete notice does not constitute good cause to waive the filing deadline.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish good cause for the untimely filing of an appeal, a party must show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980). To determine whether an appellant has shown good cause, the Board will consider the length of the delay, the reasonableness of his excuse and his showing of due diligence, whether he is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and whether he has presented evidence of the existence of circumstances beyond his control that affected his ability to timely file his petition. <span class="Italic">Moorman v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 60, 62-63 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 79 F.3d 1167 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table); <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. at 184.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant contends, as he did below, that the agency failed to inform him as to whether the election of any applicable grievance procedure will result in a waiver of his right to file a Board appeal and the circumstances under which proceeding with one will preclude proceeding with the other. He also asserts that the agency omitted key language in the removal letter that could have made him aware of the consequences of late filing and he cites to <span class="Italic">Ladrido v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 248 Fed. Appx. 184 (Fed. Cir. 2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's first argument is without merit. In its decision letter, the agency informed the appellant that, as a preference eligible, he would have the right to appeal the decision in writing to the Board within 30 calendar days from the effective date of the decision and it provided him with the address of the appropriate regional office. The agency also informed the appellant that he had a right to file both an appeal with the Board and a grievance on the same matter, but that the filing of a grievance would not extend the time limit for filing an appeal. Furthermore, the agency listed the circumstances under which the appellant would be deemed to have waived access to arbitration. Thus, the agency provided the appellant with adequate notice of his appeal rights under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21(d)(1), (2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the appellant's second contention, the regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21(a) requires agencies to provide notice of the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(c) which informs an employee of the consequences of late filing of an appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If a party does not submit an appeal within the time set by statute, regulation, or order of a judge, it will be dismissed as untimely filed unless a good reason for the delay is shown. The judge will provide the party an opportunity to show why the appeal should not be dismissed as untimely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(c). We find that the agency did not inform the appellant in its decision letter that his appeal would be dismissed as untimely filed unless a good reason is shown for the delay. Consequently, it did not provide him with notice of the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(c), and did not provide him with proper notice of his Board appeal rights pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21(a). Because the administrative judge did not address this issue in the initial decision, we grant the appellant's petition for review to address the impact, if any, of this finding on our good cause determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ladrido</span>, our reviewing court analyzed an appeal in which an agency did not provide Mr. Ladrido with notice of the consequences of his failure to file a timely appeal, and Mr. Ladrido filed his appeal 60 days late. <span class="Italic">Ladrido</span>, 248 Fed. Appx. at 185-86. Although the court recognized that an agency's failure to provide notice of appeal rights required by the Board's regulations could, standing alone, constitute good cause for an untimely filing, the court found that the agency's incomplete notice, <span class="Italic">coupled with other factors</span>, including Mr. Ladrido's age, declaration of emotional strain, lack of English proficiency, and his <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status at the time of the removal, in addition to his "relative diligence," constituted good cause to waive the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 186-87.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although <span class="Italic">Ladrido</span> is an unpublished decision, the Board may rely on unpublished Federal Circuit decisions if it finds the court's reasoning persuasive. <span class="Italic">E.g., Herring v. Department of the Navy</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 165, &#x00B6; 13 n.* (2001), review dismissed, 35 Fed. Appx. 887 (Fed. Cir. 2002). We find it appropriate to rely on the court's analysis in <span class="Italic">Ladrido</span> in light of the factual similarities between that matter and this appeal. For instance, the agency in this appeal gave the appellant the same incomplete notice of his appeal rights as the agency did in <span class="Italic">Ladrido.</span> We do not believe that <span id="Page_965"></span>the agency's incomplete notice, by itself, however, is a dispositive factor in our good cause determination. Rather, consistent with the court's analysis in <span class="Italic">Ladrido</span>, we will consider the other circumstances to determine if, taken together, they justify waiving the filing deadline. Importantly, the appellant asserted in a declaration, made under penalty of perjury, that he was under emotional stress at the time he received the removal letter, that he was unsuccessful in obtaining legal counsel, that he acted reasonably and with due diligence after he "gain[ed] the information about the correct appeal time limit," and that the agency's incomplete notice contributed to his delay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, there are some important differences between this appeal and <span class="Italic">Ladrido.</span> For instance, Mr. Ladrido filed his appeal 60 days late, but the appellant in this case filed his appeal more than 7 months late. <span class="Italic">See Ladrido</span>, 248 Fed. Appx. at 186. A delay of more than 7 months is significant. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Greenberg v. Department of Justice</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 42, &#x00B6; 6 (2002) (a filing delay of over six months was significant). Moreover, this delay appears to have been largely caused by the appellant's decision to utilize the grievance procedures and to wait for the resolution of those procedures before filing with the Board. Indeed, the appellant declared below that he "was given wrong or no information of [his] appeal rights to the [Board] by [his union] and by management." However, the record reflects that the appellant received notice of the time limit for filing a Board appeal. In addition, the appellant had a union representative at the time of the removal action, the agency gave him proper notice of his right to file a grievance and a Board appeal, and it cautioned him that "the filing of a grievance will not extend the time limit for filing an appeal with the MSPB." He nonetheless chose to pursue the grievance procedures only. The Board has consistently held that the appellant is responsible for the errors of his chosen representative. <span class="Italic">Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 667, 670 (1981). Moreover, it is well-settled that awaiting the outcome in another forum will not provide good cause for an untimely appeal. <span class="Italic">See Masdea v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 556, &#x00B6; 8 (2002); <span class="Italic">Muse v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 342, &#x00B6; 11 (1999); <span class="Italic">Allison v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 335, &#x00B6; 13 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that this appeal does not present the totality of circumstances that, when taken together by the court in <span class="Italic">Ladrido</span>, constituted good cause to waive the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See Ladrido</span>, 248 Fed. Appx. at 186-87. In the absence of such circumstances, we do not find that the appellant has demonstrated good cause to waive the filing deadline and we affirm the initial decision as modified herein.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Maudlin</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Doe v. PBGC</span>, DC-0752-13-1225-I-1 (NP 7/31/2014). Lack of a complete notice of appeal rights did not alone excuse an untimely appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the appellant's assertion, however, an agency's failure to provide notice of rights in an adverse action as required under the Board's regulations does not necessarily constitute good cause for the late filing of an appeal. <span class="Italic">See Maudlin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 513, &#x00B6; 12 (2011) (finding that the agency's incomplete notice of appeal rights, by itself, was not a dispositive factor in the Board's good cause determination).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, none of the following decisions cited by the appellant on review support her claim that the agency's failure to notify her of her right to elect to file a grievance of her removal constitutes good cause for the untimely filing of her Board appeal: <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 669 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Williams v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 176 F. App'x 136 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (nonpublished); <span class="Italic">McCurn v. Department of Defense</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 226 (2013); <span class="Italic">Kirkland v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 74 (2013); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 654 (2007); and <span class="Italic">Drose v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 98 (2000). In <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span> and <span class="Italic">Drose</span>, the agency failed to advise the appellant of his/her right to appeal the agency's action to the Board. <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span>, 839 F.2d at 670; <span class="Italic">Drose</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 98, &#x00B6; 9. In <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, the Board remanded the appellant's removal appeal for further adjudication where it was unclear from the evidence in the record whether the agency had provided the appellant with a decision notice advising him of his Board appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 654, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-12. Here, the agency's decision letter specifically informed the appellant of her right to file a Board appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, the Federal Circuit found good cause for a filing delay where the appellant received the decision letter more than 2 years after the effective date of the decision and the letter did not include a statement explaining that the 30-day deadline for filing an appeal would begin to run from the date of receipt of the decision letter if the appellant received the letter after the effective date of the decision. <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 176 F. App'x at 138, 140. The agency's decision letter in this case similarly stated that a Board appeal must be filed within 30 days after the effective date of the removal, rather than within 30 days after the effective date of the removal or 30 days after receipt of the decision, whichever is later, as set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). Unlike the appellant in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, however, the appellant in the instant appeal received the decision letter prior to the effective date of the decision. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 54. Thus, the agency's failure to advise the appellant that the time limit for filing a petition for review might be measured from the date of receipt of the decision letter if she received the decision letter after the effective date of the decision is of no consequence in this case, as that condition did not occur here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">McCurn</span> and <span class="Italic">Kirkland</span>, the Board found that the appellant established good cause for the untimely filing of his/her request for review of an arbitrator's decision that denied the appellant's grievance of the agency's removal action where the agency's removal decision did not inform the appellant of his/her right to file a request for review of the arbitrator's decision, as required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21. <span class="Italic">McCurn</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 226, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13; <span class="Italic">Kirkland</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 74, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9. The instant case does not involve a request for review of an arbitrator's decision but, rather, an appeal of the appellant's removal. While the Board's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Kirkland</span> and <span class="Italic">McCurn</span> arguably supports the appellant's contention that the agency's failure to notify the appellant of her right to file a grievance constitutes good cause for her untimely grievance, the issue in this case is whether there is good cause for the untimely filing of her appeal. As noted above and in the initial decision, the agency provided the appellant with notice of her right to file a Board appeal. Consequently, <span class="Italic">Kirkland</span> and <span class="Italic">McCurn</span> provide no reason to disturb the administrative judge's finding that the agency's failure to notify the appellant of her right to file a grievance does not establish good cause for the untimely filing of her Board appeal.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency issues a decision to an employee on a matter appealable to the Board, the agency must provide the employee with (1) notice of the time limits, filing requirements and address of the appropriate Board office for filing a Board appeal, (2) a copy or access to a copy of the Board's regulations, (3) a copy of the Board's appeal form, and (4) notice of any right the employee has to file a grievance. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) and the Board have held that an agency's failure to notify an employee of his Board appeal rights when it is required to do so generally constitutes good cause for the late filing of an appeal. <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 839 F.2d 669, 674 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Gingrich v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. 583, 587 (1995). More specifically, the Federal Circuit and Board will find good cause for a filing delay, even if the appellant did not respond to an <span id="Page_966"></span>acknowledgment order regarding timeliness, where OPM attached the Board's regulations to its reconsideration decision, but otherwise failed to provide the appellant with clear information regarding the Board's appeal filing deadline. <span class="Italic">Walls v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 29 F.3d 1578, 1583-84 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Boulware v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 136, 139 (1996). When an agency provides inadequate notice of Board appeal rights, the appellant is not required to show that he exercised due diligence in attempting to discover his appeal rights, but rather must show diligence in filing an appeal after learning that he could. <span class="Italic">Gingrich,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. at 588.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, OPM's reconsideration decision does not contain any statement regarding the appellant's Board appeal rights. Nonetheless, the reconsideration decision indicates, and OPM asserts, that it sent the appellant a copy of the Board's regulations with its reconsideration decision. The Board's regulations are not attached to the copies of the reconsideration decision in the record, however. Furthermore, OPM did not submit an affidavit or sworn statement on this issue, and the allegations in its pleading are not evidence. <span class="Italic">See Santos v. U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Postal Service,</span> 77 M.S.P.R. 573, 577 (1998). Thus, the record is devoid of evidence that the regulations were actually attached to the reconsideration decision sent to the appellant, or that OPM otherwise notified the appellant of his Board appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the appellant did receive the Board's regulations, that alone is not adequate notice of Board appeal rights when the appellant is <span class="Italic">pro se</span>. <span class="Italic">See Walls,</span> 29 F.3d at 1583-84 (where OPM attached the Board's regulations to its decision letter but did not otherwise sufficiently explain the appeal filing deadline, the court held that a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant was not on notice of that filing deadline); <span class="Italic">Boulware</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. at 139. Moreover, the evidence suggests that in this matter, the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant has cognitive impairments which make understanding and following relatively simple instructions difficult for him. Under such circumstances, a copy of the Board's regulations alone would not have been sufficient notice to the appellant of his Board appeal rights. The Board therefore finds good cause for his filing delay. <span class="Italic">See Shiflett,</span> 839 F.2d at 674; <span class="Italic">Gingrich</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. at 587.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The complete failure of an agency to provide notice of appeal rights to an employee justified an eight-year appellate delay, <span class="Italic">Carroll v. USPS</span>, 87 MSPR 570, 573-75 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-11 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An important factor in determining whether good cause exists in this case is whether the appellant was entitled to a notice of appeal rights. <span class="Italic">O'Leary v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 86 MSPR 87 &#x00B6; 11 (2000). An agency is obligated to notify an employee of his right of appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board when it takes an appealable action. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.21; <span class="Italic">O'Leary</span>, 86 MSPR 87 &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">Drose v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 85 MSPR 98 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 10 (2000). An agency's failure to notify an employee of his Board appeal rights under circumstances requiring it to do so will justify waiver of the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">Gingrich v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 67 MSPR 583, 587 (1995). Absent an obligation on the agency's part to provide appeal rights, the appellant must establish that he exercised due diligence in attempting to discover whatever appeal rights he might have in order to show good cause. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If the agency failed to meet its obligation to provide a notice of appeal rights, however, the appellant is not required to show due diligence in discovering appeal rights; rather, the question is whether the appellant was diligent in filing an appeal after he learned that he could do so. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant has submitted a sworn statement from his representative stating that, on or about September 15, 1999, he informed the appellant for the first time of his appeal rights to the Board. The statement asserts further that the appellant filed his appeal within 30 days from the time that he was told that he had appeal rights. The record shows that the appellant promptly filed his appeal on October 7, 1999. Because the appeal was filed within 30 days from the date that he discovered his appeal rights, the appellant has shown that he was diligent in filing an appeal after he learned that he could do so. <span class="Italic">O'Leary</span>, 86 MSPR 87 &#x00B6; 11. Accordingly, if the AJ finds that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal, since the appellant has shown good cause for the 8 year delay in filing his appeal, he is entitled to adjudication of the merits of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A delayed appeal was excused when an agency mistakenly concluded that the appellant lacked veterans preference status and appeal rights, <span class="Italic">Redus v. USPS</span>, 88 MSPR 193, 199 &#x00B6; 16 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that the agency's removal notice did not inform the appellant of her right to file a Board appeal. The agency's only explanation for not providing appeal rights was that it believed the appellant was not a preference eligible employee. However, because we have found, based on reasons discussed above, that the appellant established that she qualified as a preference eligible employee at the time of her removal, we further find that the agency was obligated to provide her with notice of Board appeal rights. Thus, because the agency failed to provide the required notice, and the evidence does not indicate that the appellant delayed in filing the appeal after she became aware of a basis for her claim, we find that she has shown that there was good cause for the delayed filing of her appeal. <span class="Italic">Gingrich</span>, 67 MSPR at 587; <span class="Italic">see also Strope v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 71 MSPR 429, 439 (1996). We therefore waive the filing deadline in this case. <span class="Italic">Shiflett v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service,</span> 839 F.2d 669, 670-74 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (finding that the Board may grant or deny the waiver of a time limit for filing an appeal, in the interest of justice, after considering all the facts and circumstances of a particular case).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Two years of delay in appealing were excused when the agency should have known that the RIF was appealable and failed to provide notice to its employee. The burden was not on the employee to discover an appeal right, but on the agency to advise him of it. Once the appellant learned from any source of the appeal right, however, he was charged with the responsibility of prompt filing, <span class="Italic">Herring v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 438, 443 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Where, as here, the agency had an obligation to notify the appellant of his Board appeal rights, he had no obligation to exercise due diligence to discover those rights on his own, and the agency's failure to satisfy its notice obligation is generally the "critical and controlling fact" warranting waiver of the time limit<span class="Italic">.

Therefore, the fact that the appellant did not exercise due diligence to <span class="Italic">discover</span> his appeal rights does not dispose of the timeliness issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well-settled that, even where the agency has failed to satisfy its notice obligation, the employee has an obligation to exercise due diligence to <span class="Italic">pursue</span> his appeal rights once he has actual knowledge of those rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gordy v. MSPB</span>, 736 F.2d 1505, 1508 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (once the appellant's attorney was aware that appeal rights lay with the Board, his failure to exercise due diligence to promptly file the appeal warranted dismissal of the appeal as untimely filed, notwithstanding the agency's failure to provide notice of appeal rights)....&#8197;If, in fact, the appellant did not have actual knowledge of his Board appeal rights until early September, his filing of this appeal soon thereafter, on September 22, may warrant waiver of the time limit. <span class="Italic">See Guenther v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">This <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant's statement on petition for review that he first became aware of his Board appeal rights in September 1995 constitutes admissible, hearsay evidence, although its unsworn nature may detract from its probative value. <span class="Italic">See Cioce v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 69 MSPR 564, 566 (1996)....&#8197;Under the circumstances, the unsworn statement, specifically proffered for the first time on petition for review, is insufficient by itself to resolve this timeliness issue, and requires a remand for further development of the evidence....</p>

Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 4 MSPB 262, 4 MSPR 180, 184 (1980). Some of the factors the Board considers in determining good cause are the length of the delay, notice of the time limits, the existence of circumstances beyond the party's control, the presence or degree of negligence in the party's actions, and any evidence that the negligence was excusable. <span class="Italic">Luna v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In both his initial appeal and his response to the acknowledgment order, the appellant requested a waiver of the time limit for filing an appeal because the agency did not attach copies of "appeal forms" with the July 19, 1995 decision letter and he did not receive the Board's "forms and guides" until August 8, 1995. In a subsequent submission, the appellant alleged that he was informed by union officials on August 10 and 15, 1995, that the agency was considering rescinding the removal action and approving disability retirement for the appellant. He stated that he gave that alleged proposal time to develop before filing an appeal with the Board. The administrative judge found that the appellant's attempt to resolve the removal action apart from an appeal to the Board did not constitute good cause for the late filing and on that basis dismissed the appeal as untimely filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge erred in failing to address the appellant's allegation that he did not timely receive a copy of the Board's "forms and guides." <span class="Italic">Spithaler v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The length of the delay is a factor to consider in every good cause determination and a minimal delay weighs in favor of finding good cause. <span class="Italic">Walls v. MSPB</span>, 29 F.3d 1578, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

While the lack of a Board appeal form and regulations did not make it impossible for the appellant to timely file and the decision letter informed him of the deadline for filing, the Board does not require that an appellant show that timely filing was impossible. <span class="Italic">Murroughs v. OPM</span>, 67 MSPR 115, 118 (1995). The appellant's action in filing his appeal only 1 day beyond the time limit indicates that he exercised diligence in pursuing his appeal, given the delayed receipt of the Board's appeal form and regulations. This, along with the appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status, constitutes good cause to waive the filing deadline. Further, we find that the agency has not shown that it was prejudiced by the short delay. <span class="Italic">See Murroughs</span>, 67 MSPR at 119. However, in determining to waive our filing deadline, we give no consideration to the appellant's allegation that he was attempting to resolve the removal outside of an appeal to the Board.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the appellant maintains that she is entitled to a waiver of the time limit for filing an appeal because the agency did not attach a copy of the appeal form with its June 26, 2002 decision letter. The Board considered a similar claim in <span class="Italic">Singleton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 339 (1996). There, the Board found that the agency's failure to provide the appellant with the Board's appeal form and regulations with its decision letter established good cause for the untimely filed appeal of his removal<span class="Italic">.

Id.</span> at 343. Also weighing in the appellant's favor was the fact that the record evidence, including the agency's motion to dismiss, supported his claim that he had not received the Board's regulations and appeal form and that he had made a diligent effort to obtain those forms by contacting the agency's deciding official<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 342-43.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, unlike the appellant in <span class="Italic">Singleton</span>, the appellant was represented, the length of delay in filing her appeal exceeds the 1-day delay in <span class="Italic">Singleton</span> by one week, and she has failed to show that she diligently pursued her appeal. In her response to the agency's motion to dismiss, which she has resubmitted on petition for review, she asserted that she "had contacted her National Association of Postal Supervisors (NAPS) local president about appealing" her reduction in grade, and was told to "go back to the [a]gency and request a blank [OF-] 283." Although claiming that she received the appeal form from "Ms. Karen Trimm, Human Resource Specialist, on August 13, 2002," she does not provide any information as to when she purportedly contacted the agency for the appeal form or any other evidence that she did, indeed, attempt to obtain the form prior to the 30-day time limit for filing her appeal. Moreover, significantly undermining her claim that she never received the OF-283 until August 13, 2002, is her signature on her petition for appeal form, dated August 2, 2002.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming that the appellant failed to receive the OF-283 with the agency's decision letter, we find that she was not hampered in the pursuit of her appeal by the lack of such form. The appellant was represented, received ample notice of the time requirements for filing an appeal in the decision letter, and did not dispute that she received a copy of the Board's regulations with the decision letter.

VA</span>, 111 MSPR 116, 120-21 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11, 2009 MSPB 56 (2009), excused what might have been a one-day filing delay:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's excuse for any untimeliness, i.e. his miscalculation of the filing deadline, is reasonable because he did not receive adequate notice of how to calculate the deadline. The agency's decision letter did not comply with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21(a)(1) to the extent that it failed to provide the appellant with proper notice of the time limits for appealing to the Board or proper notice of the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(c). The decision letter failed to inform the appellant of the time limit for filing a Board appeal in the event that he did not receive the decision letter until after the effective date of his removal, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(1), and it makes no reference to the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(c). Although the decision letter states that it was accompanied by a copy of the Board's regulations, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 18, under these circumstances, providing a copy of the Board's regulations would not satisfy the agency's obligations under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21(a)(1), <span class="Italic">see Walls v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 29 F.3d 1578, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (the agency's decision letter, which was ambiguous as to whether the filing time limit was calculated using calendar days or working days, did not satisfy the agency's notice obligation under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21(a) (1993), and the agency could not cure the deficiency by merely appending a copy of Board's regulations to its decision letter). There is nothing in the record to indicate that the agency provided the appellant with any notice on how to compute the time limit based on the date of his receipt of the decision letter, or that it informed the appellant that the filing period might be deemed to start prior to the date of his actual receipt. <span class="Italic">See Shiflett</span>, 839 F.2d at 674 (the agency failed to meet its obligations under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21 (1985), where, among other things, the decision letter did not give notice of the time limits for appealing to the Board or how to compute the time within which an appeal must be filed).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the appellant acted diligently and with ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of his case. <span class="Italic">See Alonzo</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. at 184 (to establish good cause for the untimely filing of an appeal, a party must show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case). It is undisputed that the appellant did not actually receive the agency's decision letter until July 23, 2008. He filed his appeal 29 days later. Thus, in the absence of adequate notice of the relevant time limits, the appellant acted diligently in filing the appeal within the time limits as he understood them. <span class="Italic">See Walls</span>, 29 F.3d at 1582 (the appellant demonstrated due diligence and ordinary prudence in filing the appeal within the regulatory time period as construed by him); <span class="Italic">Fitzpatrick v. Department of State</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 318, 320-21 (1996) (<span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant's misconstruction of the filing period was a reasonable excuse for his 1-day delay in filing his appeal); <span class="Italic">see also Coleman</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 266, &#x00B6; 8 (<span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant established good cause for the minimal 1-day delay in filing her appeal where medical evidence supported her claim of stress-related depression and she was confused as to the filing deadline because she was unable to locate a copy of the agency's decision letter). Given the inadequate notice, the appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status, his diligence in pursuing his appeal rights, and the minimal length of what was at most a 1-day delay, we find that the appellant has shown good cause for any filing delay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_968"></span>As to the timeliness of appeals involving jurisdictional issues, <span class="Italic">Trotter v. USPS</span>, 91 MSPR 282, 287 &#x00B6; 15 (2002), involving a claimed reduction in grade, construed against an agency a defense that the action constituted a nonappealable classification correction that required no notice of appeal rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the timeliness issue, when an agency takes an action that is appealable to the Board, it must provide the employee with notice of his Board appeal rights. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21. An agency's failure to provide such notice will generally excuse the employee's failure to file a timely Board appeal. <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 839 F.2d 669, 674 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Parkinson v. Department of Justice,</span> 70 M.S.P.R. 316, 319, <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 91 F.3d 170 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table). In a case such as this, the issues of jurisdiction and good cause for an untimely filing are inextricably intertwined, i.e., a finding of Board jurisdiction would most likely result in a finding of good cause for the filing delay. <span class="Italic">See Lomax v. Department of Defense,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 553, 561 (1998); <span class="Italic">Parker v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. 603, 610-11 (1993). Thus, the administrative judge shall make findings on the timeliness matter, if necessary, when he considers the jurisdictional issue.</p>
