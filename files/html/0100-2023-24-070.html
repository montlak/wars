<p class="Body-Text">Federal Circuit jurisdiction over Board mixed cases dismissed for procedural reasons (and those include timeliness dispositions) was addressed by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-184_5ifl.pdf?utm_source=News+and+Case+Alert%21+5-2+%28Year+in+Review%2C+Winter+Sale+Extended%29&utm_campaign=NaCA+Email+05-02&utm_medium=email">133 S. Ct. 596</a>, 600-07 (2012), directing that review to district court instead (but not addressing what occurs when an appellant waives the EEO claim in favor of review in the Federal Circuit):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A federal employee subjected to an adverse personnel action such as a discharge or demotion may appeal her agency's decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board).<span class="Italic"> See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512, 7701. In that challenge, the employee may claim, among other things, that the agency discriminated against her in violation of a federal statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1). The question presented in this case arises when the MSPB dismisses an appeal alleging discrimination not on the merits, but on procedural grounds. Should an employee seeking judicial review then file a petition in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or instead bring a suit in district court under the applicable antidiscrimination law? We hold she should go to district court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, establishes a framework for evaluating personnel actions taken against federal employees. That statutory framework provides graduated procedural protections depending on an action's severity. If (but only if) the action is particularly serious--involving, for example, a removal from employment or a reduction in grade or pay--the affected employee has a right to appeal the agency's decision to the MSPB, an independent adjudicator of federal employment disputes.[1] <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1204, 7512, 7701. Such an appeal may merely allege that the agency had insufficient cause for taking the action under the CSRA; but the appeal may also or instead charge the agency with discrimination prohibited by another federal statute, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 621 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1). When an employee complains of a personnel action serious enough to appeal to the MSPB and alleges that the action was based on discrimination, she is said (by pertinent regulation) to have brought a "mixed case." <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.302 (2012). The CSRA and regulations of the MSPB and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) set out special procedures to govern such a case--different from those used when the employee either challenges a serious personnel action under the CSRA alone or attacks a less serious action as discriminatory. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7702, 7703(b)(2) (2006 ed. and Supp. V); 5 CFR pt. 1201, subpt. E (2012); 29 CFR pt. 1614, subpt. C.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The actions entitling an employee to appeal a case to the MSPB include "(1) a removal; (2) a suspension for more than 14 days; (3) a reduction in grade; (4) a reduction in pay; and (5) a furlough." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A federal employee bringing a mixed case may proceed in a variety of ways. She may first file a discrimination complaint with the agency itself, much as an employee challenging a personnel practice not appealable to the MSPB could do. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(a); 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.302(b). If the agency decides against her, the employee may then either take the matter to the MSPB or bypass further administrative review by suing the agency in district court. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(b); 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.302(d)(1)(i). Alternatively, the employee may initiate the process by bringing her case directly to the MSPB, forgoing the agency's own system for evaluating discrimination charges. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(a); 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.302(b). If the MSPB upholds the personnel action (whether in the first instance or after the agency has done so), the employee again has a choice: She may request additional administrative process, this time with the EEOC, or else she may seek judicial review. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7702(a)(3), (b); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.161; 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.303. The question in this case concerns where that judicial review should take place.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7703 of the CSRA governs judicial review of the MSPB's decisions. Section 7703(b)(1) gives the basic rule: "Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a petition to review a... final decision of the Board shall be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit." Section 7703(b)(2) then spells out the exception:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"Cases of discrimination subject to the provisions of section 7702 of this title shall be filed under [the enforcement sections of the Civil Rights Act, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and Fair Labor Standards Act], as applicable. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any such case filed under any such section must be filed within 30 days after the date the individual filing the case received notice of the judicially reviewable action under such section 7702."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The enforcement provisions of the antidiscrimination statutes listed in this exception all authorize suit in federal district court. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e-16(c), 2000e-5(f); 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(c); &#x00A7; 216(b); <span class="Italic">see also Elgin v. Department of Treasury</span>, [132 S. Ct. 2126] (2012) (slip op., at 9-10).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7702 describes and provides for the "cases of discrimination" referenced in &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2)'s exception. In relevant part, &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"[I]n the case of any employee... who--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">"(A) has been affected by an action which the employee... may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">"(B) alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited by [specified antidiscrimination statutes] ,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"the Board shall, within 120 days of the filing of the appeal, decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action in accordance with the Board's appellate procedures."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "cases of discrimination" in &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2)'s exception, in other words, are mixed cases, in which an employee challenges as discriminatory a personnel action appealable to the MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties here dispute whether, in light of these interwoven statutory provisions, an employee should go to the Federal Circuit (pursuant to the general rule of &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1)), or instead to a district court (pursuant to the exception in &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2)), when the MSPB has dismissed her mixed case on procedural grounds.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner Carolyn Kloeckner used to work at the Department of Labor (DOL or agency). In June 2005, while still an employee, she filed a complaint with the agency's civil rights office, alleging that DOL had engaged in unlawful sex and age discrimination by subjecting her to a hostile work environment. At that point, Kloeckner's case was not appealable to the MSPB because she had not suffered a sufficiently serious personnel action (e.g., a removal or demotion). Her claim thus went forward not under the special procedures for mixed cases, but under the EEOC's regulations for all other charges of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR pt. 1614, subpts. A, D. In line with those rules, the agency completed an internal investigation and report in June 2006, and Kloeckner requested a hearing before an EEOC administrative judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The next month, DOL fired Kloeckner. A removal from employment is appealable to the MSPB, and Kloeckner believed the agency's action was discriminatory; she therefore now had a mixed case. As permitted by regulation, she initially elected to file that case with the MSPB. Her claim of discriminatory removal, however, raised issues similar to those in her hostile work environment case, now pending before an EEOC judge; as a result, she became concerned that she would incur duplicative discovery expenses. To address that problem, she sought leave to amend her EEOC complaint to include her claim of discriminatory removal, and she asked the MSPB to dismiss her case without prejudice for four months to allow the EEOC process to go forward. Both of those motions were granted. The EEOC judge accepted the amendment,[2] and on September 18, 2006, the MSPB dismissed her appeal "without prejudice to [her] right to refile... either (A) within 30 days after a decision is rendered in her EEOC case; or (B) by January 18, 2007--<span class="Italic">whichever occurs first</span>."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Neither the CSRA nor any regulation explicitly authorizes an EEOC judge to consider the legality of a removal or other serious personnel action before the Board has done so. Nonetheless, the EEOC has approved that approach when the issues the personnel action raises are "firmly enmeshed" in an ongoing EEOC proceeding in order to avoid "delay[ing] justice and creat[ing] unnecessary procedural complications." <span class="Italic">Burton v. Espy</span>, Appeal No. 01932449, 1994 WL 748214 (EEOC, Oct. 28, 1994); <span class="Italic">see also Myvett v. Poteat</span>, Appeal No. 0120103671, 2011 WL 6122516 (EEOC, Nov. 21, 2011). We express no view on the propriety of this practice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Discovery continued in the EEOC proceeding well past the MSPB's January 18 deadline. In April, the EEOC judge found that Kloeckner had engaged in bad-faith conduct in connection with discovery. As a sanction, the judge terminated the EEOC proceeding and returned Kloeckner's case to DOL for a final decision. Six months later, in October 2007, DOL issued a ruling rejecting all of Kloeckner's claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Kloeckner appealed DOL's decision to the Board in November 2007. That appeal was filed within 30 days, the usual window for seeking MSPB review of an agency's determination of a mixed case. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(a); 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.302(d)(1)(ii). But the MSPB declined to treat Kloeckner's filing as an ordinary appeal of such an agency decision. Instead, the Board viewed it as an effort to reopen her old MSPB case--many months after the January 18 deadline for doing so had expired. The Board therefore dismissed Kloeckner's appeal as untimely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5264"></span>Kloeckner then brought this action against DOL in Federal District Court, alleging unlawful discrimination. The District Court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, Civ. Action No. 4:09CV804 (ED Mo., Feb. 18, 2010). Relying on the Eighth Circuit's ruling in <span class="Italic">Brumley v. Levinson</span>, 991 F.2d 801 (1993) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>), the court held that because the MSPB had dismissed Kloeckner's claims on procedural grounds, she should have sought review in the Federal Circuit under &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1); in the court's view, the only discrimination cases that could go to district court pursuant to &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2) were those the MSPB had decided on the merits. The Eighth Circuit affirmed on the same reasoning. <span class="Italic">See</span> 639 F.3d 834 (2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span>, 565 U.S. __ (2012), to resolve a Circuit split on whether an employee seeking judicial review should proceed in the Federal Circuit or in a district court when the MSPB has dismissed her mixed case on procedural grounds.[3] We now reverse the Eighth Circuit's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Compare</span> 639 F.3d 834 (CA8 2011) (case below) (Federal Circuit); <span class="Italic">Ballentine v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As the above account reveals, the intersection of federal civil rights statutes and civil service law has produced a complicated, at times confusing, process for resolving claims of discrimination in the federal workplace. But even within the most intricate and complex systems, some things are plain. So it is in this case, where two sections of the CSRA, read naturally, direct employees like Kloeckner to district court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Begin with &#x00A7; 7703, which governs judicial review of the MSPB's rulings. As already noted, &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1) provides that petitions to review the Board's final decisions should be filed in the Federal Circuit--"[e]xcept as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection." Paragraph (2), i.e., &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2), then sets out a different rule for one category of cases--"[c]ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of section 7702 of this title." Such a case, paragraph (2) instructs, "shall be filed under" the enforcement provision of an enumerated antidiscrimination statute. And each of those enforcement provisions authorizes an action in federal district court. So "[c]ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of section 7702" shall be filed in district court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turn next to &#x00A7; 7702, which identifies the cases "subject to [its] provisions." As also stated earlier, &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) describes cases in which a federal employee "(A) has been affected by an action which [she] may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, and (B) alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited by" a listed federal statute. The subsection thus describes what we (adopting the lingo of the applicable regulations) have called "mixed cases."<span class="Italic"> See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.302. Those are the "cases of discrimination subject to" the rest of &#x00A7; 7702's provisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Now just put &#x00A7; 7703 and &#x00A7; 7702 together--say, in the form of a syllogism, to make the point obvious. Under &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2), "cases of discrimination subject to [&#x00A7; 7702] " shall be filed in district court. Under &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1), the "cases of discrimination subject to [&#x00A7; 7702] " are mixed cases--those appealable to the MSPB and alleging discrimination. Ergo, mixed cases shall be filed in district court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">And so that is where Kloeckner's case should have been filed (as indeed it was). No one here contests that Kloeckner brought a mixed case--that she was affected by an action (i.e., removal) appealable to the MSPB and that she alleged discrimination prohibited by an enumerated federal law. And under the CSRA's terms, that is all that matters. Regardless whether the MSPB dismissed her claim on the merits or instead threw it out as untimely, Kloeckner brought the kind of case that the CSRA routes, in crystalline fashion, to district court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Government offers an alternative view (as did the Eighth Circuit)--that the CSRA directs the MSPB's merits decisions to district court, while channeling its procedural rulings to the Federal Circuit. According to the Government, that bifurcated scheme, though not prescribed in the CSRA in so many words, lies hidden in the statute's timing requirements. But we return from the Government's maze-like tour of the CSRA persuaded only that the merits-procedure distinction is a contrivance, found nowhere in the statute's provisions on judicial review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Government's argument has two necessary steps. First, the Government claims that &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2)'s exception to Federal Circuit jurisdiction applies only when the MSPB's decision in a mixed case is a "judicially reviewable action" under &#x00A7; 7702. Second, the Government asserts that the Board's dismissal of a mixed case on procedural grounds does not qualify as such a "judicially reviewable action." We describe in turn the way the Government arrives at each of these conclusions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first step of the Government's argument derives from &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2)'s second sentence. Right after stating that "cases of discrimination subject to [&#x00A7; 7702] " shall be filed under specified antidiscrimination statutes (i.e., shall be filed in district court), &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2) provides: "Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any such case filed under any such [statute] must be filed within 30 days after the date the individual filing the case received notice of the judicially reviewable action under section 7702." The Government reads that sentence to establish an additional prerequisite for taking a case to district court, instead of to the Federal Circuit. To fall within the &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2) exception, the Government says, it is not enough that a case qualify as a "case of discrimination subject to [&#x00A7; 7702] "; in addition, the MSPB's decision must count as a "judicially reviewable action." If the MSPB's decision is not a "judicially reviewable action"--a phrase the Government characterizes as a "term of art in this context,"--the ruling still may be subject to judicial review (i.e., "judicially reviewable" in the ordinary sense), but only in the Federal Circuit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Government's second step--that the Board's procedural rulings are not "judicially reviewable actions"--begins with the language of &#x00A7; 7702(a)(3). That provision, the Government states, "defines for the most part which MSPB decisions qualify as 'judicially reviewable actions[s] '" by "providing that [a]ny decision of the Board <span class="Italic">under paragraph (1)</span> of this subsection shall be a judicially reviewable action as of the date of the decision." Brief for Respondent 21 (quoting &#x00A7; 7702(a)(3); emphasis and brackets added by Government). From there, the Government moves on to the cross-referenced paragraph--&#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)--which states, among other things, that the Board "shall, within 120 days of [the employee's filing], decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action in accordance with the Board's appellate procedures." According to the Government, the Board only "decide[s] ... the issue of discrimination" when it rules on the merits, rather than on procedural grounds. On that view, a procedural decision is not in fact a "decision of the Board under paragraph (1)," which means that it also is not a "judicially reviewable action" under &#x00A7; 7702(a)(3). And so (returning now to the first step of the Government's argument), judicial review of a procedural decision can occur only in the Federal Circuit, and not in district court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If you need to take a deep breath after all that, you're not alone. It would be hard to dream up a more roundabout way of bifurcating judicial review of the MSPB's rulings in mixed cases. If Congress had wanted to send merits decisions to district court and procedural dismissals to the Federal Circuit, it could just have said so. The Government has offered no reason for Congress to have constructed such an obscure path to such a simple result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">And taking the Government's analysis one step at a time makes it no more plausible than as a gestalt. The Government's initial move is to read &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2)'s second sentence as adding a requirement for a case to fall within the exception to Federal Circuit jurisdiction. But that sentence does no such thing; it is nothing more than a filing deadline. Consider each sentence of &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2) in turn. The first sentence defines which cases should be brought in district court, rather than in the Federal Circuit; here, the full description is "[c]ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of section 7702"--to wit, mixed cases. The second sentence then states when those cases should be brought: "any such case... must be filed within 30 days" of the date the employee "received notice of the judicially reviewable action." The reference to a "judicially reviewable action" in that sentence does important work: It sets the clock running for when a case that belongs in district court must be filed there. What it does not do is to further define which timely-brought cases belong in district court instead of in the Federal Circuit. Describing those cases is the first sentence's role.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Proof positive that the Government misreads &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2) comes from considering what the phrase "judicially reviewable action" would mean under its theory. In normal legal parlance, to say that an agency action is not "judicially reviewable" is to say simply that it is not subject to judicial review--that, for one or another reason, it cannot be taken to a court. But that ordinary understanding will not work for the Government here, because it wants to use the phrase to help determine which of two courts should review a decision, rather than whether judicial review is available at all. In the Government's alternate universe, then, to say that an agency action is not "judicially reviewable" is to say that it is subject to judicial review in the Federal Circuit (even though not in district court). Small wonder that the Government must call the phrase "judicially reviewable action" a "term of art: On a natural reading, the phrase defines cases amenable to judicial review, rather than routes those cases as between two courts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">And even were we to indulge the Government that far, we could not accept the second step of its analysis. At that stage, remember, the Government contends that under &#x00A7; 7702 only decisions on the merits qualify as "judicially reviewable actions." The language on which the Government principally relies, stated again, is as follows: "[T]he Board shall, within 120 days of [the employee's filing], decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action." But that provision, too, is only a timing requirement; it is designed to ensure that the Board act promptly on employees' complaints. We see no reason to think that embedded within that directive is a limitation on the class of "judicially reviewable actions." Nor (even were we to indulge the Government on that point as well) can we find the particular restriction the Government <span id="Page_5265"></span>urges. According to the Government, the MSPB does not "decide... the issue of discrimination" when it dismisses a mixed case on procedural grounds. But that phrase cannot bear the weight the Government places on it. All the phrase signifies is that the Board should dispose of the issue in some way, whether by actually adjudicating it or by holding that it was not properly raised. Indeed, were the Government right, &#x00A7; 7702(a)'s statement that the Board "shall" decide the issue of discrimination would appear to bar procedural dismissals, requiring the Board to resolve on the merits even untimely complaints. No one (least of all the Government, which here is defending a procedural ruling) thinks that a plausible congressional command.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another section of the statute--&#x00A7; 7702(e)(1)(B)--puts the final nail in the coffin bearing the Government's argument. That section states: "[I]f at any time after the 120th day following [an employee's filing] with the Board..., there is no judicially reviewable action[,] ... an employee shall be entitled to file a civil action" in district court under a listed antidiscrimination statute. That provision, as the Government notes, is designed "to save employees from being held in perpetual uncertainty by Board inaction." But if, as the Government insists, a procedural ruling is not a "judicially reviewable action," then the provision would have another, surprising effect--essentially blowing up the Government's argument from the inside. In that event, an employee whose suit the Board had dismissed on procedural grounds could bring suit in district court under 7702(e)(1)(B) (so long as 120 days had elapsed from her Board filing), because she would have received "no judicially reviewable action." And what's more, she could do so even many years later, because the statute's usual 30-day filing deadline begins to run only upon "notice of [a] judicially reviewable action." &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2). So an argument intended to keep employees like Kloeckner out of district court would paradoxically, and nonsensically, result in giving them all the time in the world to file suit there.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Responding to this unwelcome outcome, the Government offers us an exit route: We should avoid "absurd results," the Government urges, by applying &#x00A7; 7702(e)(1)(B) only to "cases over which the Board continues to exert jurisdiction." But as the Government admits, that "gloss on the statute is not found in the text"; the Government's remedy requires our reading new words into the statute. We think a better option lies at hand. If we reject the Government's odd view of "judicially reviewable actions," then no absurdity arises in the first place: &#x00A7; 7702(e)(1)(B) would have no bearing on any case the MSPB dismissed within 120 days, whatever the grounds. It is the Government's own misreading that creates the need to "fix" &#x00A7; 7702(e)(1)(B); take that away and the provision serves, as it was intended, only as a remedy for Board inaction.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The Government supplements its tortuous reading of the CSRA's text with an appeal to one of the statute's purposes--in its words, "ensuring that the Federal Circuit would develop a uniform body of case law governing federal personnel issues." Brief for Respondent 32. We have previously recognized that Congress, through the CSRA, sought to avoid "unnecessary layer[s] of judicial review in lower federal courts, and encourag[e] more consistent judicial decisions." <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 449 (1988) (internal quotation marks and some bracketing omitted). But in this case, the Government's argument about the necessity of Federal Circuit review runs into an inconvenient fact: When Congress passed the CSRA, the Federal Circuit did not exist, and &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1) thus provided, as the general rule, that a federal employee should appeal a Board decision to 1 of the 12 Courts of Appeals or the Court of Claims. <span class="Italic">See</span> Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 1143. Moreover, the Government's own approach would leave many cases involving federal employment issues in district court. If the MSPB rejects on the merits a complaint alleging that an agency violated the CSRA as well as an antidiscrimination law, the suit will come to district court for a decision on both questions. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. Department of Army</span>, 715 F.2d 1485, 1491 (CA Fed. 1983) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). In any event, even the most formidable argument concerning the statute's purposes could not overcome the clarity we find in the statute's text.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A federal employee who claims that an agency action appealable to the MSPB violates an antidiscrimination statute listed in &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) should seek judicial review in district court, not in the Federal Circuit. That is so whether the MSPB decided her case on procedural grounds or instead on the merits. Kloeckner therefore brought her suit in the right place. We reverse the contrary judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit quickly recognized the significance of the Supreme Court's <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> decision, but the circuit did not immediately elaborate on how broad the preclusive effect of the decision would be in cases of jurisdictional dismissals by the Board of appeals that are concurrently also being litigated through the administrative EEO process, <span class="Italic">Shipp v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We generally have jurisdiction over appeals from the MSPB under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9), pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1). By including allegations of discrimination, Toyama presented a "mixed case complaint" under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(a). While without jurisdiction to review the merits of mixed cases, <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 715 F.2d 1485 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), we do have jurisdiction over appeals raising only timeliness issues of such cases, <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 75 F.3d 639, 642 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c), we must set aside agency actions we find, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit was not precluded from deciding an issue germane to Board jurisdiction, e.g., the timeliness of an appeal, because an issue of discrimination is raised before the Board. <span class="Italic">Harris v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 86-506); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Lang v. MSPB</span>, 219 F.3d 1345, 1357 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2000) ("If an individual wishes to appeal to this court from an unfavorable decision in a mixed case, he must abandon his discrimination claim and proceed before us solely with respect to the adverse personnel action. However, we do have authority to entertain an appeal in a case such as this, where the sole issue is whether the Board erred in dismissing a mixed case as untimely."); <span class="Italic">Wallace v. MSPB</span>, 728 F.2d 1456 (Fed. Cir. 1984)<span class="Italic">, supra. Earlier decisions</span> reviewed allegations that the Board improperly failed to consider an allegation of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Bartlett v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-2171) (citing <span class="Italic">Ballentine v. MSPB</span>, 738 F.2d 1244 (Fed. Cir. 1984)). That occurred in <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 898 F.2d 133 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (concluding that the Board improperly rejected a PFR of an arbitration award because a claim of disability discrimination had not been raised before the arbitrator).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Ballentine v. MSPB</span>, 738 F.2d 1244, 1247 (Fed. Cir. 1984), the appellant sought to appeal his demotion to the Board. The appeal was rejected because it was filed following the initiation of an EEO complaint but before the issuance of a final agency decision or the lapse of 120 days from the filing of the complaint. Mr. Ballentine sought review of the Board's dismissal of his appeal in the Federal Circuit. Without deciding on the merits, the Board sought transfer of the case to a district court. The issue was whether the Board properly rejected the appeal. <span class="Italic">Williams</span> was distinguished because there, the appellant had sought review of a Board decision that had decided the merits of discrimination and nondiscrimination issues. Focusing upon its review authority over final Board orders under the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982, 28 USC 1295(a)(9) ("exclusive jurisdiction... of an appeal from a final order or final decision of the [MSPB] pursuant to sections 7703(b)(1) and 7703(b)(2) of title 5 [vesting jurisdiction over discrimination cases under 5 USC 7702 in district courts] "), the <span id="Page_5266"></span>court noted that &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) requires the Board to decide both the appealable action and an issue of discrimination. Until the Board has decided both, there is no right to a trial <span class="Italic">de novo</span> in a district court lawsuit. To resolve the problem of what to do with jurisdictional decisions by the Board that do not fall within the class of decisions identified by &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1), the court determined that because it was unlikely that Congress intended to preclude review of jurisdictional issues, the Federal Circuit was the logical choice for review of "procedural or threshold matters not related to the merits of a discrimination claim before the MSPB." <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span> concluded:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, our exercise of jurisdiction over MSPB decisions until issues touching the merits of a discrimination claim are appealed comports with the intent of 7703(b)(1) and (2) and also allows the application of a unified body of case law concerning issues like that actually on appeal here, i.e., the jurisdiction of the MSPB itself, or perhaps questions as to whether good cause has been shown for the waiver of a filing deadline.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit summarized <span class="Italic">Williams</span> and its kin in <span class="Italic">King v. Lynch</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/1994110521f3d10841918">21 F.3d 1084</a>, 1089 (Fed. Cir. 1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our precedent also affirms the exclusivity of the district courts' jurisdiction over government employment discrimination cases and holds that this court lacks such jurisdiction. In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Army</span>, 715 F.2d 1485 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">in banc</span>), this court rejected an employee's attempt to obtain bifurcated review of the MSPB's decision by bringing his discrimination claims in the district court and seeking review of his civil service claims in this court. This court held that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">where jurisdiction lies in the district court under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2), the entire action falls within the jurisdiction of that court and this court has no jurisdiction, under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1), over such cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">715 F.2d at 1491. Because 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703 provides for exclusive jurisdiction in the district courts in discrimination cases and because this court found that unitary review of MSPB decisions was intended, the court refused to entertain Williams's civil service claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Director correctly notes that <span class="Italic">Williams</span> expressly excluded from its holding cases in which the employee has abandoned the discrimination claims at the agency level or on appeal. 715 F.2d at 1491; <span class="Italic">see Daniels v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States Postal Service</span>, 726 F.2d 723, 724 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Hopkins v. MSPB</span>, 725 F.2d 1368, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 1984), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Hagmeyer v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 852 F.2d 531 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">in banc</span>). And several other cases have more clearly defined the contours of the <span class="Italic">Williams</span> holding. For example, in <span class="Italic">Hill v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 796 F.2d 1469, 1470-71 (Fed. Cir. 1986), and <span class="Italic">Meehan v. United States Postal Service</span>, 718 F.2d 1069, 1073-74 (Fed. Cir. 1983), we held that this court has jurisdiction over an appeal otherwise properly in this court notwithstanding a frivolous or passing allegation of discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Ballentine v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 738 F.2d 1244, 1246-47 (Fed. Cir. 1984), we held that this court has jurisdiction to review MSPB rulings on procedural and threshold matters such as jurisdiction that are prior to and not related to the merits of a discrimination claim. None of these cases, however, questioned the holding of <span class="Italic">Williams</span> that district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over government employment discrimination claims. And none of the cases supports finding jurisdiction in this case where OPM's petition for review vigorously challenges the interpretation of a discrimination law and the merits of Lynch's claim of unlawful discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit's jurisdiction over a timeliness issue in a mixed case was reiterated in <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. MSPB</span>, 75 F.3d 639, 642 (Fed. Cir. 1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court has jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1). While this court has no jurisdiction to review the merits of a mixed case, <span class="Italic">Williams v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Army</span>, 715 F.2d 1485 (Fed. Cir. 1983) <span class="Italic">(in banc)</span>, the court will entertain an appeal from the MSPB in any case where the complaint was dismissed on the grounds of untimely filing of the employee's complaint to the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 728 F.2d 1456, 1458 (Fed. Cir. 1984). In such appeals, the MSPB, as the acting agency, is named respondent rather than the petitioner's employing agency. <span class="Italic">See Amin v.</span> <span class="Italic">Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 951 F.2d 1247 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Thus, we have jurisdiction over the subject appeal which raises only timeliness issues.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> decision in the Supreme Court, the Second Circuit determined that the employee need not, according to <span class="Italic">Downey v. Runyon</span>, 160 F.3d 139, 142-46 (2d Cir. 1998), proceed first to the Federal Circuit on the timeliness issue under the theory expressed by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span>. Instead, timeliness is an issue that may or may not be dispositive of the EEO claim in district court, but this issue was a component of the EEO claim and was properly before the district court:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Civil Service Reform Act ("CSRA") provides two paths toward redress for postal service employees who allege that an adverse employment action was wholly or partly based on prohibited discrimination. CSRA provides that aggrieved employees may either bring a "mixed complaint" before the postal service's Equal Employment Office ("EEO"), or a "mixed appeal" before the MSPB<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) &#x0026; (2); 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.302(a)(1) (defining mixed case complaint); 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.302(a)(2) (defining mixed appeal). An appeal is "mixed" if the aggrieved postal worker alleges that an action by an employer [appealed] to the MSPB was effected, wholly or in part, because of employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicap. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1); 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.302(a)(2). Mixed complaints are filed and processed in similar fashion to standard Title VII/Rehabilitation Act complaints, with a few notable exceptions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.302(d). Significantly, an appeal from an EEO determination of a mixed complaint must be made before the MSPB, rather than the EEOC.[29] CFR &#x00A7; 1614.302(d)(3). Thus, an aggrieved employee may bring a "mixed appeal" before the MSPB in two ways: as a direct appeal of an adverse employment action, or as an appeal of an EEO determination of a mixed complaint. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(a)(3); 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.302(b); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.151.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 22, 1995, Downey filed an appeal with the MSPB challenging his 1992 termination from the Postal Service. In his appeal he alleged as affirmative defenses to the removal action, discrimination based on physical disability (Hemochromatosis) as well as prohibited personnel practices. Among his defenses, he wrote "Having me sign a Last Chance Agreement while I was under the influence. Also imposing punishment while I was on sick leave. I was denied due process and my rights as a preference eligible veteran and discriminated because of disability." He stated that he believed the action he was appealing violated the Americans With Disabilities Act and the Freedom of Information Act. Because appellant's petition was untimely filed, he was ordered, within 15 days to show good cause for a waiver of the regulatory time limit by acknowledgment order of May 24, 1995. He filed an amended appeal on June 10, 1995.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant alleged that he was not afforded a copy of the MSPB's regulations and that he was under the influence of drugs when he signed the Last Chance Agreement. The record shows that appellant was again informed of his notice of removal of January 24, 1992 which incorporated his Board appeal rights in the Removal Imposition Letter of October 30, 1992. Downey had been represented at the Arbitration by an attorney and he and his attorney made a choice of forum, namely, Arbitration, and his hearing was held on June 3, 1993. At the Arbitration, appellant never contested his capacity to enter into a Last Chance Agreement but only his ability to carry out its terms.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 20, 1995, Judge William J. Lee of the MSPB issued an Initial Decision on plaintiff's appeal. Administrative Judge Lee dismissed Downey's appeal as untimely; he had failed to file with the Board within the regulatory time period. The Administrative Judge noted that the Board's regulations allowed 25 days to file a request for a review from an Arbitrator's decision. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(d) (1993). He also noted that the 30th day for appellant to file was August 6, 1993. Downey's envelope to the Board is post-marked May 19, 1995, nearly two years later.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiff then filed an appeal with the Full Board, which issued a decision on September 12, 1995, denying his petition for review. The Board's Order advised plaintiff of the right to request review of the Board's final decision in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit within 30 calendar days of receipt of the Order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 23, 1995 instead of proceeding in the Federal Circuit, plaintiff submitted a request to the EEOC to review the final decision of the MSPB on his allegations of discrimination "i.e. denial of reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act," 42 USC &#x00A7; 12101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> On November 14, 1995, the EEOC issued a Denial of Consideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The decision of the EEOC stated, that since the MSPB's decision went to the timeliness of Downey's appeal with the MSPB and not to the affirmative defense of discrimination, the EEOC did not have jurisdiction over Downey's petition and accordingly the EEOC denied his petition for review. The decision of the EEOC stated that its determination was final and that there was no further right of administrative appeal. It stated, however, that Downey did have the right to file a civil action in an appropriate United States District Court based on the decision of the MSPB within 30 calendar days of the date of the EEOC decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The next action by the plaintiff was his filing of this law suit in the Western District of New York. This suit is asserted against Marvin T. Runyon, Jr., Postmaster General.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question presented to this Court in this appeal is whether a federal employee is entitled to a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> judicial review in federal district court of his discrimination claim after the MSPB, without reaching the merits of the discrimination claim, dismisses a "mixed appeal on grounds of untimeliness." Several unassailable principles expressed in decided cases exist at the threshold of the inquiry, e.g.:</p>
<p class="list-1"><span class="list">1.</span> An employee aggrieved by an action affecting his continued employment may have recourse by an appeal to the MSPB.</p>
<p class="list-1"><span id="Page_5267"></span><span class="list">2.</span> An employee who has been affected in his employment by prohibited discrimination may appeal the adverse action complained of to the MSPB.</p>
<p class="list-1"><span class="list">3.</span> Mixed appeals to the MSPB are those appeals alleging an appealable action affected in whole or in part by prohibited discrimination.</p>
<p class="list-1"><span class="list">4.</span> Final rulings of the MSPB are appealable to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals <span class="Italic">except</span> for decisions made in cases involving elements of illegal discrimination that are judicially reviewable pursuant to &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) &#x0026; (3) of the CSRA. Federal Courts Improvement Act, 28 USC &#x00A7; 1295; Civil Service Reform Act, 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7702 &#x0026; 7703(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, case law has produced several principles that are equally unassailable, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"The decision of the MSPB... becomes judicially reviewable in district court on the date of its issuance unless, within thirty days, the employee petitions the Equal Opportunity Commission to consider the MSPB decision." <span class="Italic">Ballentine v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 738 F.2d 1244, 1246 (Fed. Cir. 1984); 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7702(a)(3)(A) &#x0026; 7702(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Once a case becomes judicially reviewable, &#x00A7; 7702 and &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2) specify that an action be filed under the appropriate discrimination statute." <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span>, 738 F.2d at 1246.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I.&#x2003;District Court Jurisdiction Under the Civil Service Reform Act</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;Mixed Appeals</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982 provides the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit with exclusive jurisdiction "of an appeal from a final order or final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board," pursuant to section 7703(b)(1) of the CSRA. 28 USC &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9). Section 7703(b) provides that all appeals of final orders and decisions of the MSPB are to be filed in the Federal Circuit, except "[c]ases of discrimination," defined in section 7702, which "shall be filed" in the United States District Courts.[1] <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1) &#x0026; (2). Section 7702 includes within its purview cases known as "mixed appeals,"[2] of "any employee... who has been affected by an action which the employee... <span class="Italic">may appeal</span> to the [MSPB] and alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited" by various federal statutes, including Title VII and &#x00A7; 791 of the Rehabilitation Act. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) (emphasis added). The EEOC regulations thus provide that a mixed appeal is "an appeal filed with the MSPB that alleges that an appealable action was effected, in whole or in part, because of discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap or age." [29] CFR &#x00A7; 1614.302(b) (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The statute provides that suits shall be filed under &#x00A7; 717(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16(c), &#x00A7; 15(c) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 USC &#x00A7; 633a(c), and &#x00A7; 16(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, 29 USC 216(b), where applicable. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2). Disability cases brought pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act are filed under &#x00A7; 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 USC &#x00A7; 791, 794a(a)(1).

<p class="Block-Quote1">An appeal from an MSPB decision concerning a mixed appeal must be a "judicially reviewable action" in order for the United States District Courts to exercise <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of the discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 7702(a)(3). Although the only express limitations on whether an MSPB decision regarding a mixed claim is to be considered "judicially reviewable" are temporal, the Federal Circuit has supplied to the CSRA an unwritten substantive limitation. Namely, that in order for an MSPB decision concerning a mixed appeal to be considered "judicially reviewable" by the district courts, the MSPB decision must reach the merits of both the appealable action and the discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">See Ballentine</span>, 738 F.2d at 1246-47. The Federal Circuit has stated, "[w]hen an appeal has been taken to the MSPB, until the discrimination issue and the appealable action have been decided on the merits by the MSPB, an appellant is granted no rights to a trial <span class="Italic">de novo</span> in a civil action under &#x00A7; 7702 or &#x00A7; 7703." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1246-47 (holding that the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over MSPB dismissals of mixed appeals on jurisdictional grounds).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRA does not express a requirement that the MSPB shall determine the merits of the discrimination claim in order for the decision to be "judicially reviewable." Subsection (b)(1) of section 7703 provides that the Federal Circuit shall have exclusive jurisdiction of all final orders and decisions of the MSPB, except as provided in subsection (b)(2). Subsection (b)(2) provides that "[c]ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of section 7702 of this Title <span class="Italic">shall be filed</span> under" the enforcement provisions of Title VII. Section 7702 applies to "the case of any employee... who has been affected by [an appealable action] ... and alleges that a basis for the action is prohibited discrimination.... " There is nothing in any of these sections of the CSRA that suggests that judicially reviewable actions under subsection (a)(3) of section 7702 are limited to decisions on the merits, or that a matter becomes a "[c]ase[&#8197;] of discrimination" under subsection (b)(2) of section 7703 only after a merits decision. This interpretation leaves untouched the statute as enacted: the proper construction is that when the MSPB issues an adverse "final decision" or "final order" concerning a "case" under section 7702(a)(1), the "case of discrimination shall be filed" in district court, as required by Title VII. In the case at bar, Downey may seek <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of his discrimination claim in the United States District Courts.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Under the Federal Circuit view of what constitutes "judicially reviewable action," Downey could pursue his discrimination claim in the district court. The Federal Circuit's reading of &#x00A7; 7702(a)(3) espouses that an MSPB determination of untimeliness is not "judicially reviewable" by the district courts. <span class="Italic">See Ballentine</span>, 738 F.2d at 1246. Subsection (e)(1) of section 7702 states that "[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, if at any time after... the 120th day following the filing of an appeal with the [MSPB] ... there is <span class="Italic">no judicially reviewable action</span>... an employee <span class="Italic">shall be entitled</span> to file a civil action to the same extent and in the same manner as provided" in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(e)(1) (emphasis added). Downey would have acquired the right to sue in the district court 120 days after he filed his appeal with the MSPB. A suit under &#x00A7; 7702(e) is a direct discrimination suit under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act, rather than an appeal of an MSPB determination subject to <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review under &#x00A7; 7702(a) and &#x00A7; 7703.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Downey has the right to seek review in the district court, he is not necessarily entitled ultimately to a determination of the merits of his claim therein. Prior to bringing suit under the Rehabilitation Act and Title VII, Downey was obliged to exhaust the administrative remedies at his disposal. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. General Services Admin.</span>, 425 U.S. 820, 828-29, 96 S. Ct. 1961, 48 L. Ed.2d 402 (1976) (Title VII); <span class="Italic">Stewart v.

Supp. 1427, 1429-30 (S.D.N.Y. 1995). The exhaustion doctrine is equally applicable to suits filed under Title VII through the provisions of the CSRA<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., McAdams v. Reno</span>, 64 F.3d 1137, 1142 (8th Cir. 1995) (holding that where a plaintiff elects to proceed with a mixed case appeal before the MSPB, she may not abandon that appeal prior to receiving a final decision). Had plaintiff filed his suit directly under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act, he would have been required to follow EEOC regulations, which require that an employee contact a Postal Service Equal Employment Office Counselor within 45 days of the alleged discriminatory personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(2). "[F]iling a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court, but a requirement that, like a statute of limitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling." <span class="Italic">Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.</span>, 455 U.S. 385, 393, 102 S. Ct. 1127, 71 L. Ed.2d 234 (1982). Section 7702 of the CSRA was intended to preserve the rights of plaintiffs to sue under Title VII in the district courts. <span class="Italic">See</span> H. Conf. R. No. 95-1717, 95th Cong., 139 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 4 USCCAN at 2872. It remains to be determined in the district court whether the regulatory time limits for filing suit before the MSPB will be disregarded in Downey's case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have concluded that, as expressed, the plain meaning of the CSRA entitled Downey to seek <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of a discrimination claim in federal district court after the MSPB dismissed his "mixed appeal" on grounds of untimeliness without reaching the merits of his discrimination claim. The district court should of course consider the effect of Downey's alleged failure to follow regulatory procedures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, the Tenth Circuit determined that review of a mixed case, including an issue of timeliness, was properly initiated before a district court, <span class="Italic">Harms v. IRS</span>, 321 F.3d 1001, 1007-08 (10th Cir. 2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The district court dismissed Harms' claims relating to his termination, reasoning that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the MSPB's dismissal of Harms' mixed case appeal for untimeliness because the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction to review such decisions. The district court also concluded it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Harms failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. This court reviews the dismissal of Harms' termination claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Union Pac. R.R.,</span> 245 F.3d 1188, 1191 (10th Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Harms argues that the district court erred in concluding that the Federal Circuit has exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over MSPB dismissals of mixed cases on procedural grounds. A determination of whether the district court has subject matter jurisdiction to resolve Harms' termination claims requires an examination of the CSRA. Under the CSRA, the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction to review final decisions of the MSPB in all appeals except those involving "cases of discrimination" filed under &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7702(a)(1); 7703(b)(1), (2). To fall within the ambit of &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1), the employee must (1) "[have] been affected by an action <span id="Page_5268"></span>which... may [be] appeal[ed] to the [MSPB] ," and (2) allege that the basis for the action was unlawful discrimination. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court in <span class="Italic">Wall</span>, held that if the MSPB dismisses an appeal on jurisdictional grounds because the adverse employment action alleged is not appealable to the MSPB, the appeal does not involve a "case of discrimination" under &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) and the Federal Circuit has exclusive subject matter jurisdiction to review the dismissal under &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1). <span class="Italic">Wall v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States,</span> 871 F.2d 1540, 1542-43 (10th Cir. 1989). This court declines to extend the ruling in <span class="Italic">Wall</span> to dismissals by the MSPB on procedural, as opposed to jurisdictional, grounds.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The IRS argues that this court's decision in <span class="Italic">Wall</span> controls this issue. In <span class="Italic">Wall,</span> this court held that the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction to review the dismissal of a mixed case appeal by the MSPB on jurisdictional grounds. 871 F.2d at 1542-43. The court in <span class="Italic">Wall</span> was not confronted with the issue presented in this appeal--whether a federal district court or the Federal Circuit has jurisdiction to review a dismissal of a mixed case appeal on procedural grounds. Accordingly, the decision in <span class="Italic">Wall</span> is not binding precedent on the issue before the court in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the MSPB exercises jurisdiction and makes a decision on the merits of both the appealed employment action and the discrimination claim, the appeal involves a "case of discrimination" and the federal district court has jurisdiction to review <span class="Italic">de novo</span> the MSPB's decision under &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2). <span class="Italic">See Ballentine v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 738 F.2d 1244, 1246 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The circuits, however, are split over whether the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over the MSPB's dismissal of appeals filed under &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) on procedural grounds. <span class="Italic">Compare Ballentine</span>, 738 F.2d at 1247 <span class="Italic">with Downey v. Runyon</span>, 160 F.3d 139, 144-45 (2d Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span>, the Federal Circuit held that it has exclusive jurisdiction over the dismissal of an appeal by the MSPB "until issues touching the merits of a discrimination claim are appealed." 738 F.2d at 1247. The Federal Circuit reasoned that its exclusive authority to review decisions by the MSPB is limited only in "cases of discrimination," <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, mixed case appeals under &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1246-48; 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2). The Federal Circuit noted in <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span> that under &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1), the MSPB must "'decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action'" before an appeal can be taken to federal district court. <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span>, 738 F.2d at 1246 (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)). From the language of &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1), the <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span> court reasoned, "it is clear that the judicially reviewable action by the MSPB which makes an appeal a 'case of discrimination' under &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2) that can be filed in district court is that the MSPB has decided 'both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action.... '" <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span>, 738 F.2d at 1246 (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Downey,</span> the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span> and held that the federal district court, not the Federal Circuit, has subject matter jurisdiction to review the MSPB's dismissal of a mixed case on procedural grounds. 160 F.3d at 144-45. The court in <span class="Italic">Downey</span> reasoned that &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2) deprives the Federal Circuit of jurisdiction over appeals properly filed under &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Further, the <span class="Italic">Downey</span> court reasoned, there is no language in CSRA "that suggests that judicially reviewable actions under subsection (a)(3) of section 7702 are limited to decisions on the merits, or that a matter becomes a '[c]ase[&#8197;] of discrimination' under subsection (b)(2) of section 7703 only after a merits decision." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 145.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is clear from the language of &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2) that the Federal Circuit lacks jurisdiction to review decisions made by the MSPB in "cases of discrimination" as designated in &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2). Under &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1), an appeal is a "case of discrimination" if the action is appealable to the MSPB and the employee alleges unlawful discrimination. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1); <span class="Italic">Wall</span>, 871 F.2d at 1542. Accordingly, when the MSPB decides that it lacks jurisdiction over an appeal because the employment action is not within the MSPB's designated appellate jurisdiction, the appeal is not a "case of discrimination" under &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wall</span>, 871 F.2d at 1542-43. A decision need not be reached by the MSPB on the merits of the discrimination issue, however, for the appeal to constitute a "case of discrimination." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1). This is clear from the statutory language in &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(B) which specifies only that the employee must allege that a basis for the action was unlawful discrimination for the appeal to fall under &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court adopts the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Downey</span> and holds that when the MSPB has jurisdiction over an appeal under &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) but dismisses the appeal on procedural grounds, the federal district court has jurisdiction to review <span class="Italic">de novo</span> the decision of the MSPB. Accordingly, we conclude the district court erred when it dismissed Harms' termination claims for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The approach in <span class="Italic">Downey</span> and <span class="Italic">Harms</span> was rejected by the Eighth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, 639 F.3d 834 (8th Cir. 2011), determining that a district court lacks jurisdiction to review an MSPB decision unless the MSPB has reached the merits of a discrimination claim; otherwise, the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction. The split in the circuits led to the 2012 Supreme Court decision in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the challenge in the circuit court goes to the validity of a settlement agreement, that the agreement may encompass a discrimination claim did not divest the court of jurisdiction; the settlement agreement and not the EEO claim is under review. <span class="Italic">Preny v. IRS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 87-3227); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Franklin v. USPS</span>, 61 Fed. Appx. 686, 686-89 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP) (EEO issues did not divest the Federal Circuit of jurisdiction to consider a challenge to settlement of Board appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the employee litigates a case before the Board and the Federal Circuit, the existence of an appellant's lawsuit in district court concerning discriminatory practices other than the personnel action before the Federal Circuit does not oust the appellate court of its review jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. SEC</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20200825162">972 F.3d 1307</a> (Fed. Cir. 2020), <span class="Italic">post</span>. The Federal Circuit's Form 10, "Statement Concerning Discrimination," applies only to EEO claims raised in the appeal before the Board or the grievance before the arbitration that is being reviewed in that circuit. <a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/wp-content/uploads/RulesProceduresAndForms/Forms/form10.pdf">https://cafc.uscourts.gov/wp-content/uploads/RulesProceduresAndForms/Forms/form10.pdf</a>. It does not require waiver of other cases involving the same appellant but involving different personnel actions and claims at EEOC, MSPB, or in the courts.</p>
