<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-113"><span class="space">3.</span> Criminal Activity</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Security clearance cases aside, in its common application, the indefinite suspension is generally based on reasonable cause to believe that the appellant committed a crime subject to the penalty of imprisonment, coupled with an ongoing investigation into the criminal conduct. The reasonable cause may be established by an indictment alone or by circumstances attendant to an arrest or investigation conducted by the employing agency or criminal law enforcement authorities. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dunnington v. DOJ</span>, 36 MSPR 122, 124 (1988) (reversing suspension), <span class="Italic">on OPM petition for reconsideration</span>, 45 MSPR 305 (1990) (sustaining suspension), <span class="Italic">affirming suspension</span>, <span class="Italic">Dunnington v. DOJ</span>, 956 F.2d 1151 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (best evidence of reasonable cause will be that determined by the agency after an appropriate investigation of the facts and circumstances of the alleged misconduct; in absence of its own investigation, the mere fact of an arrest by the police is not, in and of itself, sufficient to provide reasonable cause under 7513(b)(1)); formal judicial determination made following a preliminary hearing, or an indictment following an investigation and grand jury proceedings, would ordinarily provide enough evidence of possible misconduct provide reasonable cause to suspend; issuance of an arrest warrant based on a finding of probable cause found by a magistrate is not the equivalent to more formal proceedings). The existence of the investigation itself or an agency's belief that an individual may have committed a crime is insufficient to establish reasonable cause. Instead, the agency must point to evidence, derived from the investigation, sufficient to meet the reasonable cause standard. <span class="Italic">Mattern v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 86 MSPR 624, 629 (2000) (conflicting testimony concerning criminal activity) (the decision was withdrawn from official reporter).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The indefinite suspension is not to be used for misconduct itself, e.g., threats; the indefinite suspension is to be used only with an ongoing investigation into misconduct. If an agency is concerned about the welfare of others at the workplace as a result of the appellant's behavior, and the appellant is being referred for medical evaluation, the proper course is to use enforced leave, if that is appropriate; an indefinite suspension is inappropriate. <span class="Italic">Tigner-Keir v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 20 MSPR 552, 554 (1984); <span class="Italic">cf. Giacobbi v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 39 (1986) (investigation was already complete and there was no pending charge; an indefinite suspension was set aside for lack of a condition ending the suspension, but the removal was sustained for underlying misconduct). Administrative leave, not an appealable action, is available to avoid the employee's presence at the work site during notice periods. [Refer to Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-218.html#sec1-216">Leave Dispute; Administrative Leave; Notice, Investigation Leave.</a>"]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">We digress on a point of procedure--the distinction between an indefinite suspension and a shortened notice period in a suspension proposal when there is reasonable cause to believe that the appellant committed a crime subject to imprisonment. The bases for the shortened notice period and the indefinite suspension may be alike, but the shortened notice period need not be used with or as a predicate for an indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">Hodge v. DHS</span>, 114 MSPR 636, 637, 639-40 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 7-9, 2010 MSPB 190 (2010), suggested that under <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/GONZALEZ_MANUEL_J_NY_0752_09_0052_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_514402.pdf">114 MSPR 318</a>, 320-35 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-28 &#x0026; n.2, 2010 MSPB 132 (2010), the indefinite suspension is only invoked, as to suspected criminal activity "when the agency has invoked the crime provision." That is not what <span class="Italic">Gonzalez</span> said. The agency did not invoke the shortened notice period in <span class="Italic">Gonzalez</span>. The "crime provision" is part of 5 USC 7513, defining the notice period requirement for adverse actions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;An employee against whom an action is proposed is entitled to--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;at least 30 days' advance written notice, unless there is reasonable cause to believe the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed, stating the specific reasons for the proposed action;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;a reasonable time, but not less than 7 days, to answer orally and in writing and to furnish affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of the answer[.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The "crime provision" permits an agency to avoid the 30-day notice, and instead provide at least seven-day notice if the statutory condition is met. The "crime provision" and shortened notice period need not be invoked for an indefinite suspension, but it could be. In <span class="Italic">Martin v. Customs Serv.</span>, 12 MSPR 12, 17-19, 10 MSPB 568 (1982), defining the indefinite suspension the Board noted the similarity of the crime provision and the basis for an indefinite suspension but <span class="Italic">Martin</span> did not require that the shortened notice provision be invoked as a condition to the indefinite suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">All of the indefinite suspension actions herein were purportedly imposed pending resolution of possible criminal misconduct by the appellants. As the Board noted in <span class="Italic">Cuellar v. United States Postal Service</span>, 8 MSPB 282, 284 (1982), "[i]n passing the Reform Act, Congress maintained the 'crime exception' now contained in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1) as the only instance in which an agency's need to protect its employees, property, and/or reputation could outweigh the employee's right to 30 days' notice [of an adverse action]." Courts have examined, and given approval to, suspension actions taken on shortened notice and based on examinations into charged criminal conduct. <span class="Italic">See Coleman v. United States Postal Service</span>, No. 79-4751 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 1980), (approving, "[a]s a practical matter," an indefinite suspension based upon an arrest on a serious charge and an arraignment on the basis of a felony complaint); <span class="Italic">Jankowitz v. United States</span>, 533 F.2d 538 at 543 (Ct. Cl. 1976), (holding "eminently fair" an indefinite suspension based upon an indictment because "[r]ecognizing that he might well have been acquitted, the agency even-handedly rejected the 'knee-jerk' approach, giving plaintiff a chance to save his job if exonerated.")</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon this analysis, the Board agrees with INS that an indictment is sufficient, while an investigation, in and of itself, is insufficient, to give rise to "reasonable cause" to believe the employee has committed a crime for which imprisonment could be imposed.[3]...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;This is consistent with guidance provided in the former FPM Supp. 752-1, S5-3b: "An agency cannot invoke the 'crime' provision solely on evidence that the employee was arrested. However, if the agency has evidence that the employee was arrested <span class="Italic">and</span> held for further legal action by a magistrate or was indicted by a grand jury, then the agency would have reasonable cause for believing the employee guilty of the crime."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Perez v. DOJ</span>, <a href="https://openjurist.org/480/f3d/1309/perez-v-department-of-justice">480 F.3d 1309</a>, 1311, 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (Judge Dyk dissenting), affirmed the distinction between the bases for a shortened notice period and an indefinite suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7513(a) establishes the substantive standard justifying adverse action--promoting the efficiency of the service--and &#x00A7; 7513(b) prescribes the procedure to be followed in taking such action by defining the rights of affected employees. The first right of employees is to receive "at least 30-days written notice." The "unless" clause, which immediately follows the notice requirement, is a qualification of and limitation on the notice requirement. It is not, as Perez contends, a substantive requirement (in addition to that in subsection (a)) for the particular sub-category of indefinite suspension pending an investigation of an employee's possible criminal conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In other words, what &#x00A7; 7513(b) requires is that an employee against whom adverse action of the kinds listed in &#x00A7; 7512 is proposed must be given 30-days written notice, except that such notice need not be given if the reasonable cause requirement of the "unless" clause is satisfied. Nothing in that clause even suggests, let alone requires, that a reasonable cause determination must be made before an employee may be indefinitely suspended on 30-days notice of such proposed action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Judge Dyk, dissenting, noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1) refers only to the agency's decision to waive the thirty-day notice period when proposing an adverse action, the same standard--that there is reasonable cause to believe the employee committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed--has been applied as well to the agency's decision to impose an indefinite suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Perez v. DOJ</span>, 508 F.3d 1019 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (denying <span class="Italic">en banc</span> consideration) (the denial was accompanied by concurring and dissenting opinions that expressed confusion or division as to the relation of the shortened notice period and the burden of proof necessary to sustain an indefinite suspension).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Martin v. Customs Serv.</span>, 12 MSPR 12, 19, 10 MSPB 568 (1982), indefinite suspensions are based on reasonable cause, and an indictment is sufficient, although an investigation in and of itself is insufficient, to give rise to reasonable cause to believe the employee has committed a crime supporting a sentence of imprisonment. <span class="Italic">Martin</span> added that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2128"></span>...An arrest or investigation may, however, be accompanied by such circumstances as would give rise to a "reasonable cause." INS has cited as examples: an employee arrested and held for further legal action by a magistrate; an investigation resulting in evidence supporting a reasonable cause to believe; a "criminal information," (which differs from an indictment only in that it is brought by a prosecutor instead of by a grand jury); and, certain egregious acts detrimental to the accomplishment of the agency's mission, such as murder or national security offenses, brought to the agency's attention via the news media. Of course, the underlying facts and circumstances on which the agency bases its "reasonable cause to believe" must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence in order for the action to be sustained. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(l)(B).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Returning to the substance of the indefinite suspension, in <span class="Italic">Morrison v. NSF</span>, 423 F.3d 1366, 1368-70 (Fed. Cir. 2005), the court offered its view, as it entertained an appeal concerning the denial of counsel fees, of cause and nexus requirements for the indefinite suspension used during criminal proceedings when the suspension is coupled with a shortened notice period:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...There are two requirements for imposing an indefinite suspension with a shortened notice period: the agency must have reasonable cause to believe that the employee committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment could be imposed, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1), and the suspension must promote the efficiency of the service, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a). <span class="Italic">Dunnington v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 956 F.2d 1151, 1155 (Fed. Cir. 1992). To show that the suspension promotes the efficiency of the service, the agency must establish a nexus between the employee's alleged acts of misconduct and the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Dunnington,</span> we emphasized that an indefinite suspension with less than thirty days notice is an extraordinary action to be taken by the agency only in compelling circumstances. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1156. The purpose of such a summary suspension is to protect the public and agency personnel, not to discipline the employee. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> As we stated in that case, the procedure "is available only when there has been an allegation of a serious crime, and only when the misconduct alleged bears a sufficient relationship to the employee's duties in the agency to warrant the action as promoting the efficiency of the service." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> While a suspension under those circumstances may be indefinite, it is not unlimited. <span class="Italic">Richardson,</span> 47 F.3d at 419. The agency may suspend the employee pending the outcome of criminal proceedings, but then the agency must terminate the suspension within a reasonable amount of time after resolution of the criminal charges. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Dunnington,</span> 956 F.2d at 1156.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The arbitrator in this case correctly recognized that an indefinite suspension is to be imposed only as an emergency measure. In overruling Morrison's indefinite suspension, the arbitrator focused on the timing of the agency's action. He explained that an indefinite suspension is not an action to be withheld until an employee has been convicted of a crime, but rather it is a tool to be applied while awaiting the certainty produced by a court decision. Put another way, a court decision typically serves as the trigger for some appropriate agency disposition pursuant to proper procedures and for terminating an indefinite suspension, not initiating one.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency allowed Morrison to continue working for more than four months while the criminal case against him was adjudicated. The agency took appropriate steps to safeguard its personnel in the workplace, such as instructing Morrison to avoid contact with Veney. Morrison apparently had no problems with Veney or any other coworkers during the period of time he remained at work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the arbitrator did not express his decision in terms of promoting the efficiency of the service, we understand the lack of a nexus to be the implicit basis for the arbitrator's reversal of the agency's action. As the arbitrator noted, Morrison's status as a productive employee who complied with his supervisors' instructions did not suddenly change in March 2003, and there was no reason to believe that his conduct in the ensuing weeks or months would be any different than it had been during the previous four months. Under the circumstances presented by this case, there is no evidence that an indefinite suspension imposed more than four months after the alleged misconduct would promote the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that whether there was reasonable cause at the time of Morrison's arrest to believe a crime had been committed and whether the agency properly could have suspended Morrison at that time are questions not before us. The agency in this case waited until after a judicial determination had been rendered, and the arbitrator correctly determined that an indefinite suspension at that juncture was inappropriate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Several Board decisions refer to indefinite suspensions as protective measures (for the benefit of the government) rather than disciplinary measures against employees. Yet <span class="Italic">Frederick v. DHS</span>, 122 MSPR 401, 2015 MSPB 11 (2015), set aside an indefinite suspension, stemming from agency concerns about alleged criminal activity, based on the concept that double punishments should not be imposed for the same offense, i.e., double jeopardy. <span class="Italic">Frederick</span> involved a suspension, once taken, then reimposed, for what the Board believed to be the same basis. The Board directed that the second indefinite suspension be set aside and that the appellant be made whole.
