<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-143"><span class="space">b.</span> Extensions of Agreements</h5>
<p class="noindent">If an agency and union agree to extend a collective bargaining agreement to a date certain, assuming that the extension is for less than three years and signed more than sixty days before the expiration of the contract, the termination date of the extension agreement, rather than the termination date of the original contract, controls calculation of the open period for filing an election petition. <span class="Italic">DHHS, Boston Reg'l Office and NTEU</span>, 12 FLRA 475, 478-79 (1983). But if the parties execute a series of extension agreements to provide an opportunity to renegotiate an agreement, and if the parties agree to continue the terms of the earlier agreement until negotiations are complete, those extension agreements do not bar a petition that is otherwise timely filed. A temporary stopgap agreement does not constitute a final agreement of fixed duration and lacks the stability sought to be achieved by the agreement bar principle. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot and Chism</span>, 16 FLRA 281, 282-83 (1984) (relying on <span class="Italic">DHHS, Boston Reg'l Office</span>, 12 FLRA 475 (1983), <span class="Italic">supra</span>); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DOD, Army Nat'l Guard Camp Keyes and AFGE Local 3012</span>, 34 FLRA 59, 64 (1989) (agreement to extend terms of collective bargaining agreement during renegotiations does not bar petition; that the union and agency treated their agreement as having been renewed was not an extraordinary circumstances warranting reconsideration).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE</span>, 44 FLRA 230, 232-33, 238-40, 242-45 (1992), considered the effect of an extension of an agreement through a memorandum of understanding. AFGE contended that the MOU did not constitute a collective bargaining agreement and could not serve to bar the representation proceeding. AFGE's arguments were unavailing. If a reading of a collective bargaining agreement in conjunction with the document containing the agency head's approval establishes a clear and unambiguous effective date, the agreement may bar a petition:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1980, NFFE was certified as the exclusive representative of a consolidated, nationwide unit of approximately 900 nonprofessional employees employed by SSA at various of its District and Branch Offices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since 1982, NFFE and SSA have entered into a series of negotiated agreements covering the bargaining unit. In 1987, the parties executed a National Agreement, effective March 1, 1987, for a 3-year period to expire on February 28, 1990. The agreement was to renew automatically thereafter for 1-year periods unless one of the parties gave timely written notice to modify the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On September 14, 1989, NFFE notified SSA of its intent to modify the agreement. The agreement expired by its terms on February 28, 1990. On May 11, 1990, SSA proposed that it and NFFE execute a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) agreeing to renew the expired National Agreement for a new 3-year term and agreeing to reopen the agreement for the limited purpose of renegotiating Article 14 (safety and health), Article 17 (performance standards and evaluation), and Article 23 (flextime and hours of work). On May 14, 1990, NFFE agreed to SSA's proposal. On May 15, NFFE signed the MOU and the agreement was approved the same day by SSA's designated official in accordance with section 7114(c) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The MOU executed by NFFE and SSA consists of five paragraphs.&#x2003;Paragraphs 1-3 are as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;The parties agree that the National Agreement, effective March 1, 1987, shall be renewed for a three year term, effective as of the date of approval by the head of the agency in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 7114(c) or on the 31st day following execution of this Memorandum, whichever is sooner.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;The agency shall distribute an official notice to all bargaining unit employees which shall state:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">The National Federation of Federal Employees and the Social Security Administration have agreed to renew the National Agreement effective March 1, 1987 for an additional three year period which has commenced on May 15, 1990. The parties have also agreed to meet in the near future to negotiate over modifications to the National Agreement. Employees are advised to retain this notice with their copy of the National Agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;The parties mutually agree to reopen the following Articles under the terms of Article 31, Section 3 of the existing National Agreement, as renewed: Articles 14, 17 and 23. Such reopening is conditioned upon the Agency's receipt of written notice within 90 days of the effective date of [this] agreement, with the exception of Article 17. Notice to reopen Article 17 is required within 120 days of the conclusion of the work of the Commissioner's Task Force on Performance Standards.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_131"></span>The fourth paragraph of the MOU concerns the Agency's agreement to distribute copies of the MOU, and the fifth paragraph provides that the agreement may be modified or supplemented by mutual agreement and is enforceable under the terms of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On May 22, 1990, AFGE filed its petition in this case, seeking to represent a unit of employees coextensive with the unit for which NFFE was certified. The parties agreed and the Regional Director found that the petitioned-for unit is appropriate under the Statute. The issue before the Regional Director was whether AFGE's petition was barred by the MOU and was, therefore, untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AFGE argued before the Regional Director that the MOU was not a bar to the petition because it: (1) was not properly executed prior to the filing of the petition; (2) was not ratified by NFFE's membership; and (3) left open for negotiations at a later time certain terms and conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We turn...to the question of whether the MOU, as timely approved by the Agency head, constituted an agreement that could bar the filing of AFGE's petition. Section 7111(f)(3) of the Statute provides that, in order to constitute a bar to the filing of a representation petition, an agreement must be a "lawful written collective bargaining agreement." For the following reasons, we conclude that the MOU constitutes a "lawful written collective bargaining agreement" within the meaning of section 7111(f)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the requirement that the agreement be a "written" agreement, we note that the MOU was in writing and was signed and dated by the parties....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the requirement that there be a "collective bargaining agreement," we note that the Authority has not had occasion to address the question of what constitutes a "collective bargaining agreement" within the meaning of section 7111(f)(3) of the Statute that can bar the filing of a petition. However, the issue of what constitutes a contract which would serve as a bar to a petition has been considered by the NLRB under the National Labor Relations Act and by the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor-Management Relations (the Assistant Secretary) under Executive Order 11491.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Regional Director, citing <span class="Italic">Appalachian Shale Products Co.</span>, 121 NLRB 1160, 1163 (1958), stated that "[i]n order for an agreement to serve as a bar to an election in the private sector, the [NLRB's] longstanding rule requires that a contract must contain substantial terms and conditions of employment deemed sufficient to stabilize the bargaining relationship."...&#8197;The Regional Director, citing <span class="Italic">Stur-Dee Health Products</span>, 248 NLRB 1100 (1980); <span class="Italic">Levi Strauss and Co.</span>, 218 NLRB 625 (1975); and <span class="Italic">Spartan Aircraft Company</span>, 98 NLRB 73 (1952), also noted that "the NLRB has held that contracts which fail to contain or delineate every possible provision" may nonetheless be "sufficiently complete to constitute a contract bar." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 9 n.8.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Executive Order 11491, the Assistant Secretary applied a rule similar to that of the NLRB. In <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy, Navy Exchange, Miramar, California</span>, 6 A/SLMR 44 (1976), the Assistant Secretary found that an agreement that was challenged as incomplete was a bar to a rival petition, noting that the agreed-upon articles "contained substantial and finalized terms and conditions of employment sufficient to stabilize the bargaining relationship." 6 A/SLMR at 46<span class="Italic">. See also</span> <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Navy, U.S. Naval Station, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii</span>, 5 A/SLMR 237, 238 (1975); and <span class="Italic">United States Air Force, 321st Combat Support Group, Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota</span>, 3 A/SLMR 573, 575 (1973).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that under the Statute, in this and future cases, in order for an agreement to constitute a "collective bargaining agreement" within the meaning of section 7111(f)(3) that can bar the filing of a petition for exclusive recognition, an agreement must contain substantial terms and conditions of employment sufficient to stabilize the bargaining relationship between the parties to the agreement. The fact that an agreement contains provisions permitting the parties to reopen certain matters or stating that the parties agree to alter portions of the agreement in the future does not automatically prevent an agreement from constituting a "collective bargaining agreement." We will make such determinations on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the MOU, which incorporated and renewed the National Agreement between NFFE and SSA, contained provisions dealing with grievance and arbitration, disciplinary and adverse actions, official time, union dues allotments, awards, promotion, overtime, reductions in force, training, an employee assistance program, leave, union rights and recognition, and the negotiation of local supplemental agreements. Applying the standard set forth above, we find that the MOU contained substantial terms and conditions of employment sufficient to stabilize the parties' bargaining relationship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By the MOU's terms, Articles 14, 17, and 23 became effective (subject to possible subsequent modification) along with the remainder of the MOU. The fact that the MOU provided that those three articles may be reopened within a specified period after becoming effective did not mean that the MOU could not serve as a bar to AFGE's petition. Therefore, we find that the MOU constituted a "collective bargaining agreement" within the meaning of section 7111(f)(3) of the Statute. Moreover, we conclude that even if Articles 14, 17, and 23 had not become effective, the MOU without those articles contained substantial terms and conditions of employment sufficient to stabilize the parties' bargaining relationship so as to constitute a "collective bargaining agreement" within the meaning of section 7111(f)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AFGE asserts that the MOU was a sham agreement because it "served not to provide substantive terms benefiting employees but, rather was merely a denial of the democratic will of the bargaining unit by attempting to manufacture a bar."...&#8197;To the extent that this assertion constitutes an argument that the MOU is not a "lawful" agreement under section 7111(f)(3), we reject this argument for two reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, we reject AFGE's claim that the MOU was a sham agreement because it did not contain "substantive terms benefiting employees...."...&#8197;As we noted above in determining that the MOU constituted a "collective bargaining agreement" within the meaning of section 7111(f)(3) of the Statute, the MOU contained provisions dealing with grievance and arbitration, disciplinary and adverse actions, official time, union dues allotments, awards, promotion, overtime, reductions in force, training, an employee assistance program, leave, union rights and recognition, and the negotiation of local supplemental agreements. Accordingly, AFGE's claim in this regard is without merit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, we reject the assertion that the MOU was a sham agreement because it "was merely a denial of the democratic will of the bargaining unit by attempting to manufacture a bar."...&#8197;AFGE's assertions as to the actions of SSA and NFFE and its related challenge to the legality of the MOU constitute an allegation that an unfair labor practice has occurred and should, therefore, have been alleged in an unfair labor practice charge. Such matters are not appropriate for resolution in a representation proceeding. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Center, Togus, Maine</span>, 3 A/SLMR 568 n.1 (1973). However, there is no evidence in the record indicating that AFGE filed such an unfair labor practice charge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"[F]or a collective bargaining agreement to bar a representation petition, its effective date must be clear and unambiguous and it must clearly set forth its duration so that any potential challenging party may determine when the statutory open period will occur." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Newark Office, Newark, New Jersey</span>, 37 FLRA 1122, 1126 (1990) (<span class="Italic">HUD, Newark</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the MOU's duration, the first paragraph of the MOU states that the agreement "shall be renewed for a three year term, effective as of the date of approval by the head of the agency in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 7114(c) or on the 31st day following execution of this Memorandum, whichever is sooner."...&#8197;We find that Paragraph 1 of the MOU clearly sets forth the 3-year duration of the agreement. When that 3-year period begins and ends, however, depends on the effective date of the MOU. The remaining question, therefore, is whether the effective date of the MOU was clear and unambiguous so that any potential challenging party could determine when the statutory open period of the MOU would occur.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AFGE claims that there is an ambiguity as to the effective date of the MOU and the MOU is merely an attempt by the parties to extend their 1987 agreement.&#x2003;Initially, we find that the MOU was not an extension of the 1987 agreement. The 1987 agreement had terminated. Although the MOU adopted most of the terms of the 1987 agreement, the MOU was a new agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AFGE's claim that there is an ambiguity as to the effective date of the MOU is based on its contention that the copy of the MOU that it received on May 23, 1990, a day after it filed its petition, did not have a specific date filled in on the MOU. In our view, the fact that the initial copy of the MOU given to AFGE did not have a specific date on it does not compel the conclusion that the effective date of the MOU is ambiguous. As clearly stated in the MOU, the date on which the MOU became effective was the date on which the Agency head approved the MOU. It is undisputed that the Agency head's approval of the MOU was contained in a separate document dated May 15, 1990, and that AFGE subsequently received a copy of that document along with a copy of the MOU showing May 15, 1990, as the effective date of the agreement....&#8197;Accordingly, there is no ambiguity as to the effective date of the MOU; rather, the effective date is the date on which the Agency head approved the MOU, May 15, 1990.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fact that determination of the effective date of the MOU requires reference to a document other than the MOU does not preclude the MOU from serving as a bar to a petition.&#x2003;The NLRB was faced with a similar situation in <span class="Italic">Cooper Tire and Rubber Co.</span>, 181 NLRB 509 (1970) (<span class="Italic">Cooper Tire</span>). In <span class="Italic">Cooper Tire</span>, the duration clause of the parties' agreement provided that "this agreement shall become effective...1968 and shall remain in full force and effect until...1971 and thereafter for yearly <span id="page_132"></span>periods." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The agreement also provided for three annual progressive wage increases effective as of September 1, 1968, 1969, and 1970. The NLRB stated that "in order for a contract to constitute a bar, it must be sufficient on its face, without having to resort to parol evidence and...the term of the agreement, as stated in the agreement, should be such that employees and outside unions may determine the appropriate time for filing representation petitions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (footnote omitted). The NLRB found that, reading the duration clause in conjunction with the wage section, the agreement "reasonably construed on its face" provided for a 3-year term beginning on September 1, 1968, and the agreement barred the election petition. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Ben Franklin National Bank</span>, 278 NLRB 986, 993 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Statute, local agreements are subject to review by the agency head under section 7114(c) of the Statute. Therefore, as in this case, the effective date of a collective bargaining agreement may depend on the date of agency head approval and the date of the agency head approval may have to be ascertained from a document other than the document signed locally by the parties. If a reading of a collective bargaining agreement in conjunction with the document containing the agency head's approval establishes a clear and unambiguous effective date, the agreement may serve as a bar to a petition. In this case there is no doubt from a reading of the MOU in conjunction with the document containing the Agency head's approval that the approval was dated May 15, 1990, and, by application of the first paragraph of the MOU, the MOU was effective May 15, 1990....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the MOU and the document containing the Agency head's approval together clearly and unambiguously establish May 15, 1990, as the effective date of the MOU. As stated in the first paragraph of the MOU, the agreement was renewed for a 3-year period from its effective date. Consequently, we agree with the Regional Director that "[t]he evidence established that on May 15, 1990, the SSA approved the parties' MOU renewing the National agreement for three years, effective on the same date." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 6. We also conclude that the MOU contained language sufficient to allow AFGE or any other potential challenging party to determine the statutory open period in which a petition may be filed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject AFGE's argument that ratification of the MOU was required prior to Agency head review. We find that ratification was not required either by NFFE's constitution or by agreement of the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Regional Director found that ratification was not required by NFFE's constitution, and AFGE does not refute that finding. Because ratification of the MOU was not required by NFFE's constitution, the extent to which a NFFE official sought agreement of constituent locals is not relevant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the language of Article 31 of the National Agreement refers specifically to "this Agreement," and that the MOU does not state that it will be effective by the terms of Article 31, but rather contains its own specific terms for when the agreement will become effective. We find, therefore, that because the MOU did not contain a ratification requirement, ratification was not a condition precedent to the execution of the contract. Accordingly, the MOU may constitute a bar to AFGE's petition.</p>
