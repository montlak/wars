<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-15"><span class="space">8.</span> Reporting, Changing, and Wash-Up Time</h4>
<p class="noindent">In 1991 FLRA decided <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2022 and Dept. of Army, Hq., 101st Airborne Div., Ft. Campbell</span>, 40 FLRA 371, 381 (1991), approving as negotiable Proposal 3:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Section 17-1.</span> CLEAN-UP TIME</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employer and the Union agree normally ten minutes for personal clean-up time will be allowed employees to their lunch periods and at the end of their workday. Exception: Supervisors may grant designated employees specific approval for longer periods of clean-up time when the type of work being performed by the employees, either on a continuous basis or on any given occasion, justifies a large amount of clean-up time, the employee(s) may request the supervisor to furnish the reasons for the denial. Clean-up time will not be used to extend an employees' [sic] regular scheduled tour of duty nor will it be the basis for granting or compensating overtime pay unless the employee was prevented, for work reasons, from his/her normal, allowable clean-up time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Section 17-2.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">This Article is also applicable to employees required to perform overtime work under Article 18.</p>
<p class="noindent">The analysis of the <span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell</span> proposal was, 40 FLRA at 384-96:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 3 provides employees with cleanup time both during their regularly scheduled workdays (section 17-1) and during scheduled overtime assignments (section 17-2). As the Agency points out, in <span class="Italic">International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 2080 and Department of the Army, U.S. Army Engineer District, Nashville, Tennessee</span>, 32 FLRA 347, 363-65 (1988)...the Authority held that a provision requiring the agency to provide employees with "a reasonable amount of time...to clean up prior to lunch and at the end of the workday[ ]" was nonnegotiable because it conflicted with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101. The Authority stated, in this regard, that section 6101 requires a basic workweek to consist of 40 hours of work and that time set aside for personal cleanup cannot be considered 'work' or 'employment' for purposes of fulfilling the requirement for a 40-hour workweek....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 3 provides us with an opportunity to reexamine the statutory and regulatory restrictions, other than those in the Statute, applicable to proposals involving cleanup time. We will examine those statutory and regulatory restrictions first, followed by an analysis of the Agency's right to assign work under the Statute. We also note that the bargaining unit in this case includes non-supervisory general schedule and wage grade (prevailing rate) employees. Although non-supervisory wage grade employees are covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), non-supervisory general schedule employees may be excluded from coverage of the FLSA based on the nature of their positions.... Thus, we will address the negotiability of the two sections of Provision 3 as they apply to general schedule employees excluded from coverage of the FLSA and as they apply to wage grade and general schedule employees covered by the FLSA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_623"></span>On reexamination of the statutory and regulatory restrictions, other than those in the Statute, applicable to proposals involving cleanup time, we now conclude, for the following reasons, that such proposals do not conflict with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">1.&#x2003;Hours of Work</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a).&#x2003;<span class="Italic">General Schedule Employees Excluded from Coverage of the FLSA</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note first that nothing in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101...and nothing in 5 CFR part 610, entitled "Hours of Duty," both of which concern an agency's obligation to establish basic 40-hour work schedules for employees, define what will constitute work or prohibit an agency from assigning personal cleanup during regular duty hours. General schedule employees who work in excess of 8 hours a day or 40 hours a week are entitled to either overtime compensation or compensatory time off under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5542 and 5543. Nothing in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5542 or 5543 precludes an agency from assigning personal cleanup during periods of overtime.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It appears...that for purposes of pay administration under 5 C.F.R. part 550 and FPM Supplement 990-2, Book 550, work consists of the activities that an employee is employed to perform. It is also clear that the duties an employee is employed to perform include duties that are not necessarily related to the employee's classification or position.... OPM notes, in this regard, that because it is a long-standing rule that any time, however small, an employee is required to spend on assigned duties must be counted, "an employee must be compensated for every minute of work performed during his or her regularly scheduled workweek, including regular scheduled overtime." FPM Supplement 990-2, Book 550, Appendix I at a.(2)(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">OPM has also promulgated detailed guidance for the treatment of activities occurring prior to or after a work shift and has noted that there is no listing by category of preshift or postshift activities that are considered work and, thus, compensable, and activities that are considered preliminary or postliminary activities and, thus, not compensable. Rather, "[w]hether a preshift or postshift activity is considered work or is considered a preliminary or postliminary activity depends on the facts and circumstances of each individual employment situation." Supplement 990-2, Book 550, Appendix I, Exhibit 2. Further, it is noted in Exhibit 2 that an activity such as changing clothes before and after the daily tour of duty which is generally considered to be a preliminary or postliminary activity and, thus, not compensable, is compensable "when extraordinary circumstances are present to make the clothes changing indispensable to the performance of the [employee's] principal activities and where the changing of clothes is required by law, by rule of the employer, or by the nature of the work." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find nothing in applicable law or regulations that explicitly or implicitly prohibits an agency from requiring employees to clean up as a regular assigned duty during the basic 40-hour workweek or during periods of overtime. Moreover, even in circumstances where cleanup duties are not assigned to employees, if an agency determines that cleanup time: (1) is closely related to the employee's principal activities, (2) is indispensable to the performance of the principal activities, and (3) takes more than 10 minutes per workday, then the employees are to be compensated for that activity under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.112(b). There is no showing in this case that the Agency would be unable to make these determinations with respect to cleanup time for General Schedule employees excluded from coverage of the FLSA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b).&#x2003;<span class="Italic">General Schedule and Wage Grade Employees Covered by the FLSA</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency's obligation to establish basic 40-hour work schedules for employees under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101 and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610 also applies to general schedule and wage grade employees covered by the FLSA. As stated above, nothing in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101 and nothing in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; part 610 limits an agency's right to assign personal cleanup during the basic 40-hour workweek.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly there is no definition of "work" in the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 785.6 ("The [FLSA], however, contains no definition of 'work'"); <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 203(g) (defining "employ" as "to suffer or permit to work.") However, we note that the courts have interpreted the concept of "work" under the FLSA broadly....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Nothing in 5 U.S.C. section 5544 concerning the overtime entitlement for wage grade employees prohibits an agency from assigning personal cleanup during overtime.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similar to part 550, nothing in part 551 prohibits an agency from requiring employees to cleanup as a regular assigned duty. Moreover, even in circumstances where cleanup duties are not assigned to employees, an agency must compensate employees for the performance of those duties if an agency determines that cleanup duties will last more than 10 minutes per workday, are closely related to an employee's principal activities, and are indispensable to the performance of the employee's principal activities. Indeed, as provided in section 3 of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 203(o), time spent cleaning up which is otherwise a part of principal activity constitutes hours of work unless the parties' custom, practice, or collective bargaining agreement excludes such time....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 203(o) has been applied by the Comptroller General to Federal employees to find an entitlement to pay for time spent by food inspectors in changing their clothes. 60 Comp. Gen. 611 (1981). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Steiner v. Mitchell</span>, 350 U.S. 247, 255 (1956) (court held that the "clear implication" of 29 USC 203(o) "is that clothes changing and washing, which are otherwise a part of the principal activity, may be expressly excluded from coverage by agreement."). In other words, unless cleanup time, which is otherwise part of a principal activity, is expressly excluded from hours of work by custom, practice, or an agreement, that time is included within such hours and, as such, constitutes a compensable activity under the FLSA....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no indication in the record before us that the Union is seeking anything other than to require the Agency to assign employees the work of cleaning up.&#x2003;Further, we find nothing in 5 C.F.R. Part 551, or the FLSA, which would make illegal an agency determination that employees be required to cleanup during their regular tours of duty or on overtime or, in circumstances where cleanup duties are not assigned to employees, from reasonably determining whether cleanup duties are closely related to an employee's principal activities, and whether they are indispensable to the performance of the employee's principal activities....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, we have no basis on which to conclude that cleanup time cannot constitute compensable work. Accordingly, we will no longer adhere to previous Authority decisions so holding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">2.&#x2003;Right to Assign Work</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a).&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Wage Grade Employees</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The bargaining unit includes wage grade employees who are covered by section 9(b) of the Prevailing Rate Systems Act, Pub. L. No. 92-392, codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5343 (Amendments).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 704 (a) of the Civil Service Reform Act...codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5343 (Amendments) (1988), provides that agencies must continue to negotiate on those terms and conditions of employment and other employment benefits, with respect to prevailing rate employees to whom section 9(b) of Pub. L. No. 92-392 applies, which were the subject of negotiation in accordance with prevailing rates and practices prior to August 19, 1972, without regard to any provision of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case the Agency has not demonstrated or even argued that the requirements of section 704(a) of the CSRA are not met. Thus, we find that the Agency is obligated to bargain over cleanup time for wage grade employees....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b).&#x2003;<span class="Italic">General Schedule Employees</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have held consistently that proposals requiring an agency to provide employees with cleanup time during their hours of duty directly interfere with an agency's right to assign work.... Accordingly, we find that it directly interferes with the Agency's right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In determining whether a provision constitutes an appropriate arrangement, the Authority first determines whether the provision is intended to be an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by management's exercise of a management right. If a proposal is determined to be an "arrangement," the Authority determines whether the proposed arrangement is "appropriate" or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with management's rights....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Agency acknowledges...that "[i]t is a reasonable expectation on the part of any employer that employees maintain an acceptable level of personal cleanliness while on duty." We conclude that the assignment of work which involves the handling of, or exposure to, dirty, toxic, or hazardous materials, as well as, and in view of, the Agency's expectation of an acceptable level of hygiene, has foreseeable adverse effects on employees. Consequently, we conclude that Proposal 3 is intended as an arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude also that the proposal could significantly restrict management's right to assign work. As the Agency points out, the bargaining unit involved here consists of approximately 2,000 employees. Although it is not clear how many general schedule employees are in the unit, as opposed to prevailing rate employees who, consistent with our decision above are entitled to negotiate over cleanup time, it is reasonable to assume that a significant number of general schedule employees could, under this proposal, choose to take 20 minutes each day for clean-up purposes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On balance, however, we find that in the circumstances of this case, Proposal 3 does not excessively interfere with management's right to assign work.... [P]roviding employees with the ability to cleanse themselves of toxic substances eliminates risks to employees and <span id="page_624"></span>possible loss of productivity. Consequently, without addressing what amount of cleanup time would be so unreasonable so as to excessively interfere with the Agency's right to assign work, we conclude here that 20 minutes is not excessive.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">NAGE, SEIU and VAMC, Dept. of Memorial Affairs</span>, 40 FLRA 657, 663 (1991), approving negotiability as an appropriate arrangement of Provision 2: "Employees will be allowed to cease work in the field fifteen (15) minutes before the end of the daily tour of duty. The last fifteen (15) minutes of the workday shall be used exclusively for storage of equipment, personal cleanup, and change of clothing." But <span class="Italic">Army Aeromedical Ctr., Ft. Rucker and AFGE Local 1815</span>, 49 FLRA 361, 366 (1994), stated a provision was nonnegotiable for "preparation" time for operating room nurses who are recalled to work. The minimum time allowed for preparation, 25 minutes, precluded a shorter response time from being imposed in emergency conditions. The proposal was not an appropriate arrangement because it excessively interfered with management's right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiable as an arrangement under <span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell</span> was Provision 3 in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1513 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Air Station, Whidbey Island</span>, 41 FLRA 589, 601, 604-06 (1991), that: "Time will be allowed, consistent with the nature of the work performed, for employees to change and clean up prior to the eating period and at the end of the work day":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union states that Provision 3 is necessary for the health and safety of employees inasmuch as employees work with potentially hazardous materials, including methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and industrial chlorine. The Union further asserts that employees handle containers of radioactive materials and liquid components of avionics "black boxes," as well as non-hazardous and dirty materials, all of which come in contact with the employees' hands, arms, and clothing. The Union also states that employees are required to adhere to Agency directives pertaining to personnel and equipment cleanliness, and that failing to comply would subject employees to disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the Union's assertions concerning the nature of the work performed by unit employees, we find that Provision 3 was intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to assign work. In reaching this result, we find unpersuasive the Agency's claim that the Union has failed to establish that "inherently toxic materials are handled by the employees in the unit..." and that the Agency "requires employees to clean up prior to eating or leaving work."... Instead, as the Union states, employees use a variety of substances while performing work, some of which are potentially dangerous and others that are non-hazardous but involve dirty materials, and these substances come in contact with employees' clothing and skin surfaces. As the Union argues, authorizing time for the purpose of cleanup contributes to employees' health and safety.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, on balance, that the provision is appropriate because it does not excessively interfere with management's right to assign work. As the Union states, the amount of cleanup time to be used and the occasions on which employees could use cleanup time are designed to be consistent with the nature of the work performed. The provision does not grant time for cleanup to all employees in the bargaining unit, regardless of the nature of their work. When employees are not performing tasks that involve or bring them into contact with potentially dangerous chemicals or non-hazardous but dirty materials, nothing in the provision requires that employees be given cleanup time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, the provision could place a restriction on the exercise of management's right to assign work by precluding the Agency from assigning other tasks to employees during the time they are engaged in cleanup. However, the benefits to employee health and safety that will be gained by giving employees time to clean up after performing assigned tasks that expose them to potentially dangerous chemicals, as well as to non-hazardous and dirty materials, outweigh the burdens on management's right to assign other work during those periods. In addition, the provision would not otherwise significantly restrict management's right to assign work, because the provision requires that the time allowed for cleanup be "consistent with the nature of the work performed" and does not automatically provide cleanup time for all bargaining unit employees. Finally, the record indicates that the parties' current collective bargaining agreement provides for unit employees to use paid time for cleanup purposes. The Agency has not established that this practice has excessively interfered with its right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent">Through 1991, proposals for "clean-up" time were generally nonnegotiable if it was not demonstrated that the proposals were appropriate arrangements necessary to meet the requirements imposed by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1655 and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Dept. of Military Affairs, Illinois Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 35 FLRA 740, 746 (1990), summarized the complexities of the law governing time off to change clothing:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals which set aside time during the workday for employees to change clothes merely to accommodate an employee's preference directly interfere with an agency's right...to assign work. Such proposals preclude the assignment of other duties during the time set aside for employees to change clothes. Those proposals also are not appropriate arrangements...because they excessively interfere with the agency's right to assign work.... [T]he negative impact of the proposals outweighs the benefit to employees of not having to use their own time to exercise their option to change clothes at work....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority also has held that those activities which are controlled or required by the employer and pursued necessarily and primarily for the benefit of the employer constitute "employment" or "work" for purposes of fulfilling the requirement of a basic 40-hour workweek....</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal that employees have 15 minutes after starting time to reach their duty station and that they be given 15 minutes before the end of the shift for washing up and changing clothing was an impermissible infringement on the right of management to assign work during those periods of time. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2094 and VAMC, New York</span>, 19 FLRA 1027, 1028 (1985). A proposal requiring the agency to give employees time during their hours of duty to clean up and change uniforms prior to beginning work was not negotiable; it precluded the assignment of other work during the specified period. <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 153 and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 21 FLRA 1116, 1123 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">IBEW Local 2080 and Dept. of Army, Army Eng'r Dist., Nashville</span>, 32 FLRA 347, 363-65 (1988) (Provision 6, calling for reasonable amount of time, consistent with nature of work, to clean up prior to lunch and at end of workday, nonnegotiable; record did not show that inherently toxic materials were used and that agency required employees to clean up). A proposal (in response to an agency uniform requirement) that employees be allowed 10 minutes after the start and before the end of the workday to change clothes interfered with the right to assign work. It was not an appropriate arrangement for employees who preferred changing at work rather than using their own time at home or the activity to change their clothing. The proposal would result in the loss of 20 minutes a day to the agency and would have a significant negative impact on its right to assign work. In FLRA's opinion, without further reasoning, the agency's detriment outweighed the employee's benefit of changing clothing at work on work time. <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 2477 and Library of Congress</span>, 23 FLRA 204, 207-08 (1986).FLRA barred negotiation of provisions that set aside work time for employees to change out of motorcycle safety clothing. <span class="Italic">FEMTC and Dept. of Navy, Mare Island Naval Shipyard</span>, 41 FLRA 107, 117-18 (1991) (Proposal 4).</p>
<p class="noindent">Nothing in OSHA regulations required that employees engaged in work involving dirty, toxic, or hazardous substances be allowed time during their tour of duty for personal cleanup. <span class="Italic">NAGE, SEIU and Nat'l Guard Bureau, Adjutant Gen.</span>, 26 FLRA 515, 516 (1987). In <span class="Italic">NAGE Locals R12-1222, R12-222 and DOD, Washington NG, Tacoma</span>, 38 FLRA 295, 299 (1990) (Proposal 1), a proposal did not provide sufficient information for FLRA to characterize the proposed cleanup time as an appropriate arrangement. The proposal was not accompanied by information concerning the extent of employees' exposure to dirty substances or the number of affected employees. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1655 and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Dept. of Military Affairs, Illinois Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 35 FLRA 740, 749 (1990), reaffirmed, however, the basic rule that "personal cleanup" time is a nonwork activity; its compensation is inconsistent with 5 USC 6101, requiring that the basic workweek consist of 40 hours of "work." A different result was reached by FLRA, reviewing an arbitrator's award enforcing a contractual practice of cleanup breaks designed to avoid assignment of other duties in <span class="Italic">Washington Plate Printers Union Local 2 and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing</span>, 31 FLRA 1250, 1255 (1988). The contract clause was an appropriate arrangement despite the interference with management's right to assign work. The break period was designed to permit employees to remove toxic substances from their skin and clothing before eating. The benefit to the employees outweighed the loss to management of five or ten minutes production time.</p>
