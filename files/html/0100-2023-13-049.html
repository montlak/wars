<p class="noindent">Management's right to control its staffing is established by 5 USC 7106(b)(1), <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-184 and VAMC Lexington</span>, 55 FLRA 549, 552 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute, proposals relating to the "numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision" are negotiable at the election of the agency. This phrase applies to the establishment of agency staffing patterns, or the allocation of staff, for the purpose of an agency's organization and the accomplishment of its work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local</span> <span class="Italic">R5-184 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Lexington, Kentucky, </span>52 FLRA 1024, 1030 (1997) <span class="Italic">(VAMC). </span>The determination of whether, and which, positions assigned to an organizational subdivision will be filled concerns the allocation of staff. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 2148</span> <span class="Italic">and U.S. Department of the Interior, Office of Surface</span> <span class="Italic">Mining, Reclamation and Enforcement, Albuquerque,</span> <span class="Italic">New Mexico, </span>53 FLRA 427, 432 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1546 and DOD, DLA Defense Distribution Depot San Joaquin</span>, 58 FLRA 368, 369-70 (2003), determined a proposal to be nonnegotiable that required reassignment of employees from one division to another:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found that the phrase "numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty" in &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) applies to the establishment of agency staffing patterns, or the allocation of staff, for the purpose of an agency's organization and the accomplishment of its work. <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R5-184, </span>52 FLRA 1024, 1030 (1997); <span class="Italic">see also NFFE, Local 2148,</span> 53 FLRA 427, 432 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 723 and Dept. of Interior, Geological Survey</span>, 66 FLRA 639, 645-46 (2012), stated as to the "types of employees" in the context of arrangements <span id="page_561"></span>proposals responding to the imposition on employees of medical standards and required medical examinations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that Proposal 4 pertains to the "types" of employees. As relevant here, &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) provides that an agency may elect to negotiate on the "numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty." In determining whether a proposal is within the scope of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), the Authority assesses whether the proposal concerns: (1) the numbers, types, and grades; (2) of employees or positions; (3) assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty. <span class="Italic">E.g., NAGE, Local R5&#8209;184</span>, 51 FLRA 386, 394 (1995). In this connection, the phrase "numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty" in &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) applies to the establishment of agency staffing patterns, or the allocation of staff, for the purpose of an agency's organization and the accomplishment of its work. <span class="Italic">E.g., AFGE, Local 1546</span>, 58 FLRA 368, 369-70 (2003). The Authority interprets "types" as referring to distinguishable classes, kinds, groups, or categories of employees or positions that are relevant to the establishment of staffing patterns. <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R5-184</span>, 52 FLRA 1024, 1031 (1997) (Member Armendariz dissenting). Because the Union claims that Proposal 4 concerns the "types" of employees within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), the Union "bears the burden of establishing a relationship between the claimed type and staffing patterns." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 1031. <span class="Italic">Accord</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.25(c)(1)(i).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that Proposal 4 "seeks to define two types of employees[:]...crewmembers and scientific personnel," and argues that the Agency "could negotiate the proper mix of employees and the duties that each group performs." Although the Union asserts that the proposal concerns "types" of "employees," it does not assert that, or explain how, the proposal relates to any "organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty," <span class="Italic">see NAGE, Local R5-184</span>, 51 FLRA at 394, and does not establish a relationship between the claimed type and staffing patterns, even though the Union has the burden to do so, <span class="Italic">see NAGE, Local R5-184</span>, 52 FLRA at 1031. <span class="Italic">See also Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Evergreen Chapter</span>, 55 FLRA 591, 593-94 (1999) (<span class="Italic">ACT</span>). <span class="Italic">Accord </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.25I(1)(i). As such, the Union has not demonstrated that Proposal 4 concerns the types of employees assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent">Because management has the right to determine the numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to a tour of duty, proposals integrally related to that right are negotiable only at the election of the agency under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1). If FLRA is presented with a negotiability appeal involving a proposal encompassing a matter covered by &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), i.e., a matter that is negotiable at the election of the agency, FLRA dismisses the negotiability appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 2148 and Dept. of Interior, OSM</span>, 53 FLRA 427, 430-431 (1997) (dismissing an appeal as to proposals concerning number of employees and positions assigned to organizational subdivision), <span class="Italic">applying</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-184 and VAMC Lexington</span>, 51 FLRA 386 (1995) (explaining how FLRA treats proposals involving proposals bargainable at agency's election) <span class="Italic">and</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1336 and SSA</span>, 52 FLRA 794 (1996) (establishing framework for resolution of conflicting claims concerning whether proposal is outside duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(a) or is bargainable at agency's election).</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal that establishes a staffing plan is not a position classification matter that is excluded from the term "conditions of employment" under 5 USC 7103(a)(14)(B). The proposal does not affect the agency's ability to assure that work assigned to the positions will be consistent with their grade and classification. Although the proposal excessively interfered with management rights to organize and reorganize its operations, the proposal was permissively negotiable because it concerned "numbers, types, and grades of employees" assigned to an organizational subdivision under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1). <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R3-76 and DOD, DLA, Defense Automated Printing Serv.</span>, 55 FLRA 509, 511-12 (1999); <span class="Italic">see Fed.

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">ACT Schnectady Chap. And DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau</span>, 55 FLRA 925, 927-29 (1999), determined that provisions (Proposals 1, 2, and 3) to maintain the level of technician positions within an organization, during a period of transition to staffing by active duty personnel, were only permissively negotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, HUD Council of Locals 222, Local</span> <span class="Italic">2910 and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban</span> <span class="Italic">Development, </span>54 FLRA 171, 177-78, n.10 (1998), the Authority first addresses whether a proposal affects a management right or rights under section 7106(a) of the Statute, and then whether the proposal concerns a matter over which an agency has a duty to bargain under sections 7106(b)(2) or (b)(3). The Authority then addresses whether the proposal is negotiable at the election of the agency under section 7106(b)(1), if it is required. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency asserts, and the Union does not dispute, that Proposals 1 and 2 affect the Agency's right to determine its organization under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute and that Proposal 3 affects the Agency's rights to hire and assign, and to select employees under sections 7106(a)(2)(A) and (C). The Union also does not claim that any of these proposals constitutes a procedure or an appropriate arrangement, within the meaning of section 7106(b)(2) or (b)(3). Accordingly, we begin with the Union's assertion that these proposals are negotiable at the election of the Agency under section 7106(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute, proposals relating to the "numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision" are negotiable at the election of the agency. This phrase applies to the "establishment of staffing patterns, or allocation of staff, for the purpose of an agency's organization and the accomplishment of its work." <span class="Italic">National</span> <span class="Italic">Association of Government Employees, Local R5-184</span> <span class="Italic">and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Lexington, Kentucky, </span>52 FLRA 1024, 1030-31 (1997). The determination of whether, and which, positions assigned to an organizational subdivision will be filled concerns the allocation of staff. <span class="Italic">See National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 2148 and U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Interior, Office of Surface Mining,</span> <span class="Italic">Reclamation and Enforcement, Albuquerque, New Mexico, </span>53 FLRA 427, 432 (1997) (holding that a proposal requiring bilateral agreement concerning the number of employees or positions assigned to an organizational subdivision, work project or tour of duty comes within the scope of section 7106(b)(1), regardless of whether the proposal would increase, decrease or maintain the number that the agency proposes to assign or has assigned.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Proposals 1, 2 and 3 require the Agency to maintain a certain number and type of employee in the 109th Tactical Airlift Wing. In addition, the Agency does not dispute, and there is no basis in the record for rejecting, the Union's contention that the 109th Airlift Wing constitutes an "organizational subdivision" of section 7106(b)(1). As such, we conclude that the proposals concern the numbers and types of employees assigned to an organizational subdivision under section 7106(b)(1). <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In arriving at this result, we specifically reject the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">SSA, Mid-America </span>in arguing that Proposals 1 and 2 are not negotiable at its election because the dominant requirement of the proposals involves section 7106(a) rights. The dominant requirement test has been applied to resolve disputes involving proposals that impose two or more distinguishable but inseparable requirements. <span class="Italic">See id., </span>52 FLRA at 798-800. In our view, Proposals 1 and 2 impose only one requirement: that the Agency assign a certain number of positions in a specific organizational subdivision. Therefore, the dominant requirement test is not implicated by these proposals. <span class="Italic">See National Association of</span> <span class="Italic">Government Employees, Local R 14-23 and U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Commissary Agency, Fort</span> <span class="Italic">Lee, Virginia, </span>54 FLRA 1302, 1306 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As these proposals concern the numbers, types and grades of employees assigned to an organizational subdivision, we find that they are negotiable at the election of the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;Proposal 1 Does Not Violate 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency asserts that the Proposal 1 is outside the duty to bargain because it constitutes an attempt to bargain over the terms and conditions of military membership, in violation of 10 USC &#x00A7; 976.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under 10 USC &#x00A7; 976I, it is unlawful for a labor organization to attempt to bargain on behalf of members of the armed forces over the terms and conditions of their military service<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Montana ACT, </span>20 FLRA 737-42 (proposal requiring automatic renewal of military membership of dual status technician upon expiration of term of enlistment constitutes negotiation of military matter on behalf of members of the armed forces in violation of 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976I(2)). However, the fact that a proposal may affect non-unit employees' conditions of employment, does not, in and of itself, constitute a violation of 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976. <span class="Italic">See Association of Civilian Technicians, Granite State Chapter and</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, National Guard Bureau,</span> <span class="Italic">New Hampshire Air National Guard, Concord, New Hampshire</span>, 55 FLRA 476, 478 (1999) <span class="Italic">(New Hampshire</span> <span class="Italic">ACT). </span>The Authority has noted in this regard that "[n]early every bargaining proposal, if accepted, will have some effect on non-unit personnel." <span class="Italic">American</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of State, County &#x0026; Municipal Employees,</span> <span class="Italic">Local 2910 and Library of Congress, </span>53 FLRA 1334, 1338 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As more specifically described above, the supplemental agreement at issue here was advanced on behalf of civilian technicians in response to the expanded mission of the 109th and the consequent influx of AGR <span id="page_562"></span>personnel. Moreover, although it explicitly refers to AGR personnel, as construed, the proposal does not seek to require the Agency to decrease the number of AGR personnel assigned to the 109th. Instead, it seeks to ensure the continued employment of civilian technicians in a changed employment environment and attempts to accomplish this by establishing numerical limits concerning the size of the technician workforce. The proposal does not in any way dictate the number of military personnel assigned to the unit. Accordingly, the proposal does not regulate the number of positions of nonunit, military personnel, but prescribes the circumstances governing a reduction in civilian unit positions<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., New Hampshire ACT, 55 </span>FLRA at 478 (proposal seeking to limit the amount of involuntary overtime required of unit employees, as compared with involuntary overtime worked by non-unit personnel, did not prevent the agency from assigning AGR members or unit employees to any particular task and, therefore, was not inconsistent with 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976). <span class="Italic">See also Association of Civilian Technicians, Pennsylvania State Council and U.S. Department of Defense, Adjutant General</span> <span class="Italic">of Pennsylvania, Fort Indiantown Gap, Annville, Pennsylvania, </span>54 FLRA 552, 557-58 (1998), 54 FLRA 557 (proposal requiring agency to alter its method of filling positions did not require the agency to select AGR candidates for any particular position and, therefore did not require the agency to negotiate on behalf of the United States concerning the terms of service of military personnel in violation of 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976I).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As this proposal does not regulate the number of non-unit positions, it also does not constitute an attempt to bargain collectively over the terms and conditions of military service. In these circumstances, we reject the Agency's assertion that Proposal 1 violates 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976I. Accordingly, in light of the foregoing, we dismiss the petition for review as to Proposals 1, 2 and 3.</p>
<p class="noindent">Proposals concerning how staff should be distributed to perform work functions were nonnegotiable because they affected management's right to determine its organization. Because they did not affect the grades of employees or the methods and means of performing agency work, they were not classified as permissively negotiable, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3529 and DOD, DCAA</span>, 55 FLRA 830, 831-33 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Proposals 1 and 2 Affect Management's Right to Determine Its Organization under Section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Management's right to determine its organization under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute encompasses an agency's authority to determine its administrative and functional structure, including the relationship of personnel through lines of control and the distribution of responsibilities for delegated and assigned duties. <span class="Italic">South</span> <span class="Italic">Pacific Division, </span>52 FLRA at 819. The right includes the authority to determine how the agency will structure itself to accomplish its mission and functions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This determination includes such matters as where organizationally certain functions shall be established and where the duty stations of the positions providing those functions shall be maintained. <span class="Italic">See National Treasury</span> <span class="Italic">Employees Union, Atlanta, Georgia and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Jacksonville District, </span>32 FLRA 886, 889-90 (1988). The Authority has found that a proposal directed at continuing particular work functions at a particular site, thereby precluding the agency from consolidating the performance of that work function at another site, affects management's right to determine the organization of the agency. <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R1-109 and U.S. Department of Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Affairs, Medical Center, Newington, Connecticut,</span> 53 FLRA 526, 531-32 (1997) (Proposal 1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that the proposals do not affect management's right to determine its organization because they would transfer only functions performed and would not transfer any personnel. However, in determining whether a proposal affects management's right to determine the agency's organization, the Authority focuses on whether work functions are transferred, rather than on whether personnel are transferred. For example, the Authority has found that a proposal directed at continuing a particular human resources function at its existing location, when the agency intended to transfer performance of that function to another site, affected management's right to determine the agency's organization, even though the proposal did not address transfer of personnel. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>At 531-32.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1 would require management to transfer all of the staffing function performed for both bargaining unit and non-bargaining unit employees at DCAA Central Region to DFAS. Proposal 2 would require management to transfer all of the staffing function performed for bargaining unit employees at DCAA Central Region to DFAS. Because both proposals would dictate where, organizationally, the Agency's staffing function is established, we find that the proposals affect management's right to determine the organization of the Agency under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. In the circumstances of this case, we next address whether the proposals are bargainable at the Agency's election under section 7106(b)(1).[3] <span class="Italic">See HUD Council of Locals</span>, 54 FLRA at 178.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;The Union makes no claim that the proposals are within the duty to bargain as procedures under section 7106(b)(2) of the Statute. To the extent that the Union's assertion that the proposals do not interfere with the Agency's rights "in an excessive manner" can be construed as a claim that the proposals constitute appropriate arrangements under section 7106(b)(3), we reject the claim. In determining whether a proposal is an appropriate arrangement, the Authority, among other things, weighs the "competing practical needs of employees and managers" to determine whether the proposal excessively interferes with management's right<span class="Italic">. See National Association of Government Employees, Local</span> <span class="Italic">R3-76 and U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Logistics</span> <span class="Italic">Agency, Defense Automated Printing Service, Philadelphia,</span> <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania</span>, 55 FLRA 509, 512 (1999) (Member Cabaniss dissenting as to other matters). Here, the proposals would afford unit employees the asserted benefit of equalizing personnel services provided as a result of the transfer of various functions. However, the proposals would completely preclude the Agency from determining where certain personnel functions will be performed. The Union provides no support for finding that the potential burden the proposals would have on the Agency's right to determine its organization is outweighed by the potential benefit the proposals would provide to unit employees. Accordingly, we conclude that the Union has not demonstrated that the proposals constitute appropriate arrangements. <span class="Italic">See American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Local 1345 and U.S. Department of the Army,</span> <span class="Italic">Headquarters, Fort Carson and Headquarters, 4th Infantry</span> <span class="Italic">Division, Fort Carson, Colorado, </span>48 FLRA 168, 205 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The Proposals Do Not Concern the Grades of Employees Assigned to an Organizational Subdivision, under Section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute makes bargainable at the election of the agency proposals that concern the "numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty[.]" The Authority has defined this phrase to mean "the establishment of staffing patterns, or allocation of staff, for the purpose of an agency's organization and the accomplishment of its work." <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R5-184 and U.S. Department of Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Affairs, Medical Center, Lexington, Kentucky, </span>52 FLRA 1024, 1030-31 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that "[t]he instant issue is clearly a subject falling under the provisions of 7106(b)(1) in that the [A]gency wants to transfer personnel functions by grade of employee." We construe this assertion as an argument that the proposals concern the grades of employees assigned to an organizational subdivision within the meaning of section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1 would require the Agency to transfer the staffing function for all positions from DCAA Central Region to DFAS, and Proposal 2 would require the Agency to transfer that function for all bargaining unit positions. The proposals do not involve the grade of staff to be assigned to a particular subdivision. In fact, the Union concedes that no changes in assigned personnel are contemplated by the proposals. The proposals involve <span class="Italic">personnel work </span>itself, and who should be assigned to perform that work for employees of a particular grade. The grade of employees assigned <span class="Italic">to do </span>that work is not a subject of the proposals, and as such, we find that the proposals do not concern the grades of employees assigned to an organizational subdivision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The Proposals Do Not Concern the Methods and Means of Performing Work, under Section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Authority applies a two-pronged test to determine whether a proposal concerns the methods and means of performing work, within the meaning of section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. First, the proposal must concern a "method" or "means" as defined by the Authority. In this regard, the Authority construes "method" to refer to "the way in which an agency performs its work." <span class="Italic">South Pacific Division, </span>52 FLRA at 818. The term "means" refers to "any instrumentality, including an agent, tool, device, measure, plan, or policy used by an agency for the accomplishment or furtherance of the performance of its work<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. Second, it must be shown that (1) there is a direct and integral relationship between the particular methods or means the agency has chosen and the accomplishment of the agency's mission; and (2) the proposal would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which the method or means was adopted. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Association of</span> <span class="Italic">Civilian Technicians, Arizona Army Chapter 61 and</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, National Guard Bureau,</span> <span class="Italic">Arizona National Guard, </span>48 FLRA 412, 420 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both proposals would transfer the staffing function performed for certain employees from one location to another.&#x2003;Neither proposal prescribes the way in which the Agency must perform its work. Nor does either proposal concern the means that the Agency will use in performing its work, as that term is defined above. Accordingly, we find that the proposals do not concern the methods and means of performing work under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Cf. National Federation</span> <span class="Italic">Of Federal Employees, Local 7 and U.S. Department Of</span> <span class="Italic">Agriculture, Office of Rural Development, <span id="page_563"></span>Portland, Oregon, </span>53 FLRA 1435, 1438 (1998) (proposals preventing an agency from implementing its decision to change the geographic location of two offices do not concern the methods and means of performing work); <span class="Italic">South Pacific Division, </span>52 FLRA at 818 (a proposal requiring the establishment of organizational subdivisions does not concern the methods or means of performing work).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the proposals affect management's right to determine its organization under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, the Agency is not obligated to bargain over the proposals, and we dismiss the Union's petition.</p>
<p class="noindent">Proposals for adequate staffing of an institution or concerning the replacement of personnel who are absent from work violate management's right to determine staffing levels and to assign work. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Union of Hosp. and Health Care Employees, Dist. 1199 and VAMC, Dayton</span>, 28 FLRA 435, 438 (1987) (Proposal 1). Under <span class="Italic">Nat'l Union</span>, a provision, Proposal 13, was nonnegotiable that called on management to establish a float pool of nurses who would provide relief service through the Nursing Service. Management must retain the right to determine the employees needed to perform particular work on various shifts. A proposal that the employer maintain reasonable staffing levels to ensure employee health and safety was not within the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Council of VA Locals and VA</span>, 29 FLRA 515, 543 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Nat'l Union</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n and DODDS</span>, 29 FLRA 628, 639-40 (1987), a nonnegotiable proposal requested management to use every reasonable effort to find means to provide classroom assistance and to staff school lunchrooms during lunch hours so that teachers could have duty-free breaks:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e also reject the Union's contention that the "every reasonable effort" standard embedded in each of these proposals is a general, nonquantitative standard which is negotiable. Where a range of reasonable options or choices exists whereby an agency can exercise its management rights, the standard of "every reasonable effort" is, in reality, a substantive rather than a general nonquantitative standard. That is because an arbitrator under such a standard could substitute his or her judgment for management's and, for example, find that the Agency had not tried every option before it decided on the particular course of action implemented....</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was not an appropriate arrangement that required management to fill vacancies to maintain staffing levels. It was not tailored to situations involving reductions in staffing flowing from management initiatives. Staffing could drop as a result of voluntary resignations or retirements. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3354 and USDA, Farm Servs. Agency</span>, 54 FLRA 807, 813-14 (1998). <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2755 and NASA Goddard Space Flight Ctr.</span>, 62 FLRA 93, 94-96 (2007), declined to approve as an appropriate arrangement a proposal for increased staffing:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The Union's proposal affects management rights set out in &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that an agency's decision whether to fill positions is encompassed within management's rights to "hire" and "assign" employees set out in &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3354,</span> 54 FLRA at 812; <span class="Italic">Int'l Plate Printers,</span> 25 FLRA at 144-46. Consequently, a proposal requiring an agency to fill positions affects those rights. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3354,</span> 54 FLRA at 812; AFGE, Local 1923, 44 FLRA 1405, 1465-68 (1992). Here, the Union's proposal would require that the Agency hire an additional two employees for the Range Safety Branch.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that any effect on the Agency's management rights is negligible, compared to the overall size of the Agency and its flexibility in allocating staff. The Union provides no support for concluding that this is relevant to determining whether there is an effect on management rights. In this regard, the above authority indicates that any proposal that requires an Agency to fill positions affects its rights to hire and assign employees. The fact that the number of employees is small relative to the size of the Agency or that the Agency could reallocate employees from another office to the office at issue does not eliminate this effect. As the Authority explained in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3354,</span> a proposal that requires that an agency fill positions "when the Agency determines that it is operationally inefficient to maintain the number of employees" proposed by the union affects an agency's rights to hire and assign. 54 FLRA at 813. The proposal here would require the Agency to maintain more employees in the Range Safety Branch than it deems efficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As such, we conclude that the proposal affects the Agency's rights to hire and assign employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The Union's proposal does not constitute an appropriate arrangement for adversely affected employees pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The approach for determining whether a proposal is within the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute is set forth in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87,</span> 21 FLRA 24 (1986). Under that approach, the Authority initially determines whether the proposal is intended to be an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. An arrangement must seek to mitigate adverse effects "flowing from the exercise of a protected management right." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service v. FLRA,</span> 960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992). Proposals that are unrelated to management's exercise of its reserved rights do not constitute arrangements. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NFFE, Local 2015,</span> 53 FLRA 967, 977-78 (1997) (Proposal 2). The purported arrangement must be sufficiently "tailored" to compensate or benefit employees suffering adverse effects resulting from the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU, Chapter 243,</span> 49 FLRA 176, 184 (1994). That is, &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) brings within the duty to bargain provisions that provide "balm" to be administered "only to hurts arising from" the exercise of management rights. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Border Patrol Council,</span> 51 FLRA at 1319. If the Authority finds that a proposal constitutes an arrangement, it then determines whether it is "appropriate," or whether it is inappropriate <span id="page_564"></span>because it excessively interferes with the relevant management right. <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 2015,</span> 53 FLRA at 973.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In explaining why the proposal constitutes an arrangement for adversely affected employees, the Union makes two inconsistent arguments. In its petition, the Union asserts that the proposal is intended to relieve the workload of employees affected by the "transfer of non-supervisor FTE's to other components[.] However, in its response to the Agency's SOP, which claimed that there was no reduction in FTE's in the branch at issue, the Union claims that the "actual basis" of the proposal is to increase the staff of the branch because the Agency conceded that there would be some negative effects of the reorganization and because there has been an increased workload in the Ground Safety Group generally.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the Union's initial claim that employees were adversely affected by the transfer of FTEs to other components, the Union does not dispute in its response that the transfer of FTEs had no impact on employees, because those positions were vacant prior to the reorganization. Far from being "irrelevant," as the Union claims, this fact demonstrates that the adverse impact that the Union claimed in its petition did not exist.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the Union's later claim that there were other adverse effects from the reorganization, there is no indication that the increase in FTEs proposed by the Union ameliorates these effects, if they in fact occurred. For example, the Union relies on an Agency presentation indicating that the loss of an engineering position and double-duty for the manager are negative aspects of the reorganization, but it does not explain what adverse effects these particular changes have on unit employees or how the addition of two unspecified FTE's to the branch would ameliorate adverse effects. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Nat'l VA Council 53,</span> 58 FLRA 8, 10 (2002) (proposal not arrangement if union fails to demonstrate how proposal ameliorates adverse effects) <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA,</span> 352 F.3d 433 (D.C. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2280, Iron Mountain, Mich.,</span> 57 FLRA 742, 743 (2002) (same). In addition, the Union's evidence that the Range Safety Group has a demanding workload does not establish that there has been an increased workload, that the workload is an adverse effect of the exercise of any management right, or that it is an effect of the reorganization. As such, the Union's reliance on this evidence is misplaced. <span class="Italic">See NFFE, Local 2015,</span> 53 FLRA at 974 (proposal not an arrangement where adverse effects are speculative).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Union has failed to establish that the proposal addresses adverse effects flowing from the exercise of a management right, we find that the proposal is not an arrangement pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Proposals, designed to provide relief to overworked teachers, that management find a pool of substitute teachers and teachers' aides, were nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n and DODDS</span>, 29 FLRA 734, 749-50, 769-70 (1987) (Proposals 9 and 20). The proposals interfered with management's right to determine its staffing needs. <span class="Italic">NWSEO and Dept. of Commerce, NWS, Alaska Region</span>, 61 FLRA 241, 243 (2005) (remanded, <span class="Italic">NWSEO v. FLRA</span>, 197 Fed. Appx. 1 (D.C. Cir. 7/17/06 No. 05-1397 unpublished, <span class="Italic">post</span>), following remand, <span class="Italic">NWSEO and Dept. of Commerce, NWS, Alaska Region,</span> 64 FLRA 569 (2010), <span class="Italic">post</span>), initially determined to be nonnegotiable a proposal, argued as an arrangement, to set staffing levels at agency facilities:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a proposal or provision constitutes an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), the Authority applies the analytical framework set forth in <span class="Italic">KANG</span>. Under this framework, the Authority first determines whether the proposal is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 33; <span class="Italic">see also United States Dep't of the Treasury</span>,<span class="Italic"> Office of the Chief Counsel</span>,<span class="Italic"> IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish that a proposal is an arrangement, a union must identify the adverse effects or reasonably foreseeable adverse effects on employees that flow from the exercise of management's rights and how those effects are adverse. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31. The claimed arrangement must also be sufficiently tailored to compensate employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See AFGE</span>,<span class="Italic"> Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals</span>, 58 FLRA 616, 617-18 (2003). If the proposal is determined to be an arrangement, then the Authority determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the relevant management right. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-33. In doing so, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded to employees under the arrangement against the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that the proposal constitutes an arrangement, we find that it excessively interferes with management's right to determine staffing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Union, increasing the staff by five forecasters, four hydrological meteorological technicians and one information technology officer would address the adverse consequences of the greater workload created by IFPS. Clearly, this proposal would provide some benefit to the current employees at the Anchorage WFO by distributing the workload to a greater number of staff. However, the proposal would burden the Agency by requiring that it increase the staff by a specific number, effectively leaving the Agency with no discretion as to the numbers and types of staff to assign to the Anchorage WFO. The proposal restricts management's ability to increase the number of staff by fewer numbers or different positions, or to not increase the staff at all and address the effects of IFPS by other means. Because the restriction on the Agency's ability to determine the numbers and types of positions to be filled is absolute, the Agency's right to determine staffing would be substantially impaired.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On balance, we conclude that the burden on the Agency outweighs any benefit to the employees. Its effect is similar to that of other proposals that impose an absolute requirement on management to take action and have been found not to constitute appropriate arrangements. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NFFE, Local 2192</span>, 59 FLRA 868, 871 (2004) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting, in part, as to another matter) (proposal imposing absolute requirement on management to make certain work assignments not a negotiable appropriate arrangement); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 51 FLRA 1308, 1332-33 (1996) (provision permitting no exception to requirement that an employee be assigned to one of three positions identified by the employee not an appropriate arrangement). Accordingly, we conclude that the proposal excessively interferes with management's rights and, therefore, does not constitute an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). Therefore, the Agency is not required to bargain over the proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit returned <span class="Italic">Weather Service</span> for reconsideration, <span class="Italic">NWSEO v. FLRA,</span> 197 Fed. Appx. 1, 1-2 (D.C. Cir. 7/17/06 No. 05-1397 unpublished) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, <span class="Italic">NWSEO and Dept. of Commerce, NWS, Alaska Region,</span> 64 FLRA 569 (2010), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To help employees dealing with the increased workload caused by the National Weather Service's decision to switch to a new computerized weather forecasting system, the National Weather Service Employees Organization (the "Union") proposed that the National Weather Service ("NWS") increase staffing at its Anchorage Weather Forecast Office ("WFO"). After the NWS refused to negotiate over the proposal, the Union petitioned the Authority for review. The Authority dismissed the petition for review, holding that the proposal was not an "appropriate arrangement," and, consequently, not negotiable. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) (requiring that management bargain with union officials over "<span class="Italic">appropriate arrangements </span>for employees adversely affected by" management's exercise of its authority to determine the organization and number of employees) (emphasis added). The Authority reached this decision after concluding that the Union's proposal would interfere with management rights by "leaving the Agency with no discretion as to the numbers and types of staff to assign to the Anchorage WFO." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Weather Serv. Employees Org. v. U.S. Dep't of Commerce</span>, 61 F.L.R.A. No. 46, 243 (2005). Because the Authority concluded that this burden on management "outweighs any benefit [the proposal would have had for] employees," it held that the proposal was not an "appropriate arrangement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Authority did not, however, consider whether the proposal would have hampered the ability of the agency to get its job done in an effective and efficient manner. The Union now petitions this Court for review, arguing, among other things, that the Authority erred by failing to consider this factor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Union.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923 v. FLRA</span>, we explained that the determination whether a proposal is an appropriate arrangement "depends primarily on the extent to which the interference [with management rights] hampers the ability of an agency to perform its core functions--to get its work done in an efficient and effective way." 819 F.2d 306, 308-09 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Thus, assuming the proposal is an "arrangement"--which neither side disputes is the case here--"if implementation of [the] proposal will directly interfere with substantive managerial rights, <span class="Italic">but will not significantly hamper the ability of an agency to get its job done</span>, the proposal...is negotiable...as an appropriate arrangement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 309 (emphasis added). Put another way, the "question...whether [a] proposed arrangement is appropriate within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)" "<span class="Italic">demands </span>that we examine the extent to which implementation of the proposed arrangement would hamper the ability of the agency to perform its work in an efficient and effective manner." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 310 (emphasis added). The Authority did not make this examination here. We must therefore grant the petition for review and remand to the Authority so that it can consider to what extent "implementation of the [Union's proposal] would hamper the ability of the [NWS] to perform its work in an efficient and effective manner." <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">After remand, the proposal was resolved to be negotiable, <span class="Italic">NWSEO and Dept. of Commerce, NWS, Alaska Region,</span> 64 FLRA 569, 571 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We adopt the court's opinion in <span class="Italic">NWS v. FLRA</span> as law of the case. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NAGE, Local R14-143,</span> 57 FLRA 879, 879 (2002) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force Headquarters, Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio,</span> 23 FLRA 376, 379 (1986). Under the standard set forth by the court, "if implementation of [the] proposal will directly interfere with substantive managerial rights, <span class="Italic">but will not significantly hamper the ability of an agency to get its job done</span>, the proposal...is negotiable...as an appropriate arrangement." 197 Fed. Appx. at 2 (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying that standard here, the proposal would require the Agency to increase by ten the number of specific types of FTEs at its Anchorage facility. We find it significant that the Agency's own statement of need asserts that the Agency's Alaska region "cannot provide all of the basic services required by customers[,]" and suggests that "a total of 16 FTE"--including "9 FTE at [the] Anchorage" facility--is "needed to set [the Alaska region] on [a] path to success." The Agency does not explain how adding the ten FTEs specified in the proposal would hamper--let alone "significantly" hamper, as the court requires--the ability of the Agency to "get its job done[.]" 197 Fed. Appx. at 2 (emphasis removed).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Union asserts, and the undisputed evidence shows, that--apart from the unencumbered FTEs in the Alaska region--there are numerous, additional unencumbered FTEs within the Agency. In other words, the Agency has budgeted for, but not filled, numerous additional FTEs. Thus, there is no basis for finding that requiring the Agency to add ten FTEs to the Anchorage facility would significantly hamper the Agency's ability to get its job done elsewhere, let alone lead to the need to close two or more weather service offices, as the Agency alleges.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, with regard to the Agency's claim that the proposal would require the Agency to add "<span class="Italic">exactly</span>" the numbers set forth in the proposal, the proposal sets forth only minimum, not maximum, numbers of additional FTEs. Thus, to the extent that the Agency is contending that it would be prohibited from hiring additional FTEs if necessary, the Agency's claim is unfounded.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the Agency has not met its burden to demonstrate that the proposal would significantly hamper its ability to get its job done. Thus, under the standard set forth by the court in <span class="Italic">NWS v. FLRA</span> and adopted here as the law of the case, we find that the proposal is an appropriate arrangement and, thus, is within the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1164 and SSA Auburn Dist. Office</span>, 65 FLRA 836, 840-42 (2011), determined nonnegotiable a proposal seeking an adjustment in staffing levels to reduce workload stress or imbalances following a realignment of work to the gaining office. The proposal provided no flexibility to the agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 2</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Wording</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In order to improve and maintain consistent service quality for both the Auburn and Rumford Service Areas and to mitigate the adverse impact (stress, backlogs, performance, etc.) on Auburn bargaining unit employees as a result of the increased workloads, Management will increase staff in the Auburn office by two bargaining unit positions. This increase will be in addition to any vacancies in Auburn existing prior to or during the negotiation of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Meaning</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 2 refers to the Agency's decision to transfer work from one field office in Rumford, Maine (Rumford) to another field office in Auburn, Maine (Auburn). The parties agree that Proposal 2 would require the Agency to add two bargaining unit positions to Auburn by hiring or transferring two employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that Proposal 2 is an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). In arguing that Proposal 2 is an "arrangement[,]" the Union contends that the Agency's exercise of its right to "consolidate workloads and determine its organization" has resulted in "increased stress[,]" "increased difficulty in getting leave approved[,]" and "more difficulty in meeting performance expectations" for employees. The Union asserts that Proposal 2 would ameliorate these adverse effects "because there would be additional workers among whom to allocate the work, thereby easing the stress of performing more work, collectively; making the approval of leave requests more likely; and improving each employee's ability to achieve performance expectations."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_565"></span>D.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposal 2 affects management's right to determine its organization under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, where a union does not respond to an agency argument that a proposal affects a management right under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, the Authority finds that the union has conceded that the proposal affects the claimed management right. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Local 1367</span>, 64 FLRA at 870. As the Union did not respond to the Agency's assertion that Proposal 2 affects management's right to determine its organization, the Union concedes that the proposal affects that right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposal 2 is not an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth above, in determining whether a proposal is an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, the Authority applies the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-33. As relevant here, if the Authority finds the proposal to be an arrangement, then the Authority will determine whether it is appropriate or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with management's rights. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>At 31. In doing so, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded to employees under the arrangement against the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>At 31-33. Applying this standard, the Authority has found that a proposal that "absolutely require[s]" that a management right be exercised in a particular manner, without "any provision for exceptions or the weighing of individual circumstances[,]" and without "allow[ing] [the agency to] assess[&#8197;] the effect of the proposal's requirements on the [a]gency's ability to conduct its operations effectively and efficiently[,]" places a "significant burden on the [a]gency." <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 39 FLRA 153, 161 (1991) (<span class="Italic">OEA</span>). Even assuming that Proposal 2 constitutes an arrangement, for the following reasons, we find that it is not appropriate because it excessively interferes with management's right to determine its organization.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the benefits that Proposal 2 would afford employees, the Union argues that the addition of two employees would mitigate the adverse effects of the workload transfer on employees' stress levels, performance, performance appraisals, and leave requests by providing more employees to share the burden of the increased workload, thereby "making the approval of leave requests more likely...and improving each employee's ability to achieve performance expectations."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the degree of intrusion on the exercise of management's right to determine its organization under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, this right encompasses the right to determine the administrative and functional structure of the agency, including the distribution of responsibilities. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3807,</span> 54 FLRA 642, 647 (1998) (Local 3807). In other words, this right includes the authority to determine how an agency will structure itself to accomplish its mission and functions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, the first sentence of Proposal 2 "absolutely require[s]" that a management right be exercised in a particular manner without "any provision for exceptions or the weighing of individual circumstances[,]" <span class="Italic">OEA</span>, 39 FLRA at 161, thereby substantially restricting the Agency's ability to structure itself to accomplish its mission and functions, <span class="Italic">see Local 3807</span>, 54 FLRA at 647. In addition, the Agency asserts, and the Union does not dispute, that because of a fixed regional staffing allocation, Proposal 2 would require the Agency to reassign two employees from other offices in order to add two positions to Auburn. According to the Agency, this would result in the overstaffing of Auburn while "severely hamper[ing] the ability of the [A]gency to get its job done in the locations having to give up staff." Balancing the parties' respective interests, we find that the benefits to employees do not outweigh the significant burdens that Proposal 2 places on management. Accordingly, we find that Proposal 2 excessively interferes with the Agency's right to determine its organization under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) and, thus, is not an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asks that the Authority "sever sentence two from the first sentence of Proposal 2--and thus address only sentence one--if the Authority determine[s] that the inclusion of sentence two would render Proposal 2 nonnegotiable." In other words, in the event that the Authority finds Proposal 2 is outside the duty to bargain on the basis of the proposal's second sentence, the Union asks the Authority to consider the negotiability of the proposal's first sentence standing alone. However, as discussed above, the first sentence's requirement that the Agency "increase staff in the Auburn office by two bargaining unit positions[,]" Petition at 2, without "any provision for exceptions or the weighing of individual circumstances[,]" <span class="Italic">OEA</span>, 39 FLRA at 161, excessively interferes with the Agency's right to determine organization. Thus, we find that Proposal 2's first sentence, standing alone, is outside the duty to bargain without regard to the second sentence. Accordingly, even assuming, without deciding, that the Union has sufficiently supported its severance request, severing the second sentence would not provide a basis for finding the proposal within the duty to bargain. Therefore, it is unnecessary to determine whether severance would be appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-109 and VAMC, Newington</span>, 38 FLRA 211, 216-20 (1990), contributed definition to the statutory term "types" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), providing that management may, but is not required to, negotiate over the "numbers, types, and grades of employees" assigned to an organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty. The agency maintained that part-time employees were a "type" of employee and that the agency had no obligation to bargain over a proposal that sought management's agreement to attempt to assign full-time nursing employees (who were eligible for Sunday premium pay) rather than part-timers (who were not eligible for the premium) to tours of duty that included Sunday work. FLRA concluded there was no bar to the proposal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has not expressly defined "types" of employees. The Authority has in many cases, however, discussed, in general, management's right to determine numbers, types, and grades of employees, and in particular, the right to determine types of employees. Examination of those cases supports a conclusion that management's right to determine the "types" of employees assigned to organizational subdivisions, work projects, or tours of duty, encompasses the right to make determinations based on work or job-related differences between employees....</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The intended meaning of "types" of employees...is not discussed extensively in the legislative history of the Statute. We note, however, that in discussing the provision that was to become section 7106(b)(1), the Senate referred to "numbers, types, and grades of positions or employees" as "the agency's staffing patterns, including job content."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find...that Proposal 2 does not directly interfere with the Agency's right to determine the types of employees assigned to a tour of duty. In all the foregoing cases, the disputed proposals which were held to interfere with an agency's right to determine the types of employees assigned to a tour of duty related, in some way, to the assignment of employees with different job-related characteristics to perform certain work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]t is clear that the part-time and the full-time nursing assistants are equally qualified to perform and do perform the same duties....</p>

<p class="noindent">FLRA again interpreted the meaning of "types" of employees assigned to tasks in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local R5-185 and VAMC, Lexington, Ky.</span>, 52 FLRA 1024, 1029-33 (1997). Disputed were proposals to use a dental hygienist or temporary employees to work with or cover for dental assistants. The proposal was nonnegotiable because it concerned the types of employees or positions assigned to an organizational subdivision. FLRA interpreted the "numbers, types and grades" phrase in &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) as applying to the establishment of staffing patterns, or allocation of staff, for the purpose of an agency's organization and the accomplishment of its work:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has not clearly defined the term "type" in the context of section 7106(b)(1).[8] Because such lack of clarity promotes litigation rather than the settlement of disputes, we take this opportunity to clarify our approach to determining when proposals relate to types within the meaning of section 7106(b)(1) in this decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;The Authority has held that a proposal concerns "types" of employees if it relates to the assignment of employees with different job-related characteristics and if it implicates management's right to determine the necessary qualifications and experience for those assignments. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R1-109 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Newington, Connecticut</span>, 38 FLRA 211, 216-20 (1990) (<span class="Italic">VAMC, Newington</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Neither the Statute nor its legislative history define the term "types." However, that term is included in a phrase--the numbers, types and grades of employees or positions assigned to an organizational subdivision, work project or tour of duty--the meaning of which is addressed in the legislative history. We will first consider the phrase in which the term "types" appears in interpreting the term.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Report of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, United States Senate, equated a phrase substantively identical to the "numbers, types and grades" phrase contained in the statute with "the agency's staffing patterns." S. Rep. No. 95-969, 95th Cong. 2d Sess. 105 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, House of Representatives, 96th Cong. 1st Sess., <span class="Italic">Legislative History of</span> <span class="Italic">the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, Title</span> <span class="Italic">VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978</span> (Comm. Print 1979) at 765 (<span class="Italic">Legislative History</span>). In addition, interpreting the phrase "numbers, types and grades" in section 7106(b)(1) as meaning "staffing patterns" is consistent with the interpretation by the Federal Labor Relations Council (FLRC) of a substantially identical phrase that defined <span id="page_566"></span>one of the permissive areas of bargaining under Executive Order 11491, as amended. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service, Region VII</span>, 5 FLRC 250, 258-59 (1977). The FLRC interpretation, in turn, was consistent with the explanation of "numbers, types and grades" offered at the time E.O. 11491 was first issued. <span class="Italic">See</span> "Study Committee Report and Recommendations, August 1969, Which Led to the Issuance of Executive Order 11491" <span class="Italic">reprinted in Legislative History</span> at 1218, 1233-34 ("numbers, types and grades of positions, or employees assigned to an organizational unit, work project or tour of duty" applies to in agency's right to establish "staffing patterns for its organization and the accomplishment of its work").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Senate Report, viewed in the context of the Executive Order practice, persuades us that Congress intended the phrase "numbers, types and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project or tour of duty" to mean "staffing patterns." Although the Senate Report does not elaborate on the phrase "staffing patterns," the FLRC and Study Committee Report treated it as referring to the allocation of staff. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">International Association of Fire Fighters, Local F-111 and Griffiss Air Force Base, Rome, N.Y.</span>, 1 FLRC 323, 331 (1973) (staffing patterns referred to "organizational allocations of positions and people"); <span class="Italic">Legislative History</span> at 1233 (the Study Committee equated the establishment of staffing patterns for agency organization and accomplishment of work with the agency's assignment of its personnel). Such construction is consistent with the manner in which the term is defined in Roberts' Dictionary of Industrial Relations, which equates "staffing pattern" to "job pattern." Roberts' Dictionary of Industrial Relations 730 (4th ed. 1994) (Roberts'). "Job pattern" refers to a list of jobs with the number of workers in each job. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 367.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we will interpret the "numbers, types and grades" phrase in section 7106(b)(1) as applying to the establishment of staffing patterns, or allocation of staff, for the purpose of an agency's organization and the accomplishment of its work. In addition, in the absence of any clear definition of the term "types" in either the Statute or the legislative history, we will follow the Authority's practice of interpreting terms and phrases based on the ordinary meaning of the words used. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots, Marine Division, Panama Canal Pilots Branch and Panama Canal Commission</span>, 51 FLRA 333, 341 (1995).

<p class="noindent-2">qualities common to a number of individuals that serve to distinguish them as an identifiable class or kind...[;] an individual exhibiting distinguishable qualities of its kind[;] a typical and often superior specimen...[;] a group or category exhibiting such type[;] a particular kind, class, or group...[;] something felt to be distinguishable as a variety or kind[;] sort....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Webster's at 2476.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, in construing section 7106(b)(1), we will interpret "types" as referring to distinguishable classes, kinds, groups or categories of employees or positions that are relevant to the establishment of staffing patterns.[9] The party claiming that a particular proposal concerns "types" within the meaning of section 7106(b)(1) bears the burden of establishing a relationship between the claimed type and staffing patterns. <span class="Italic">Cf. American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3062 and U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Boulder City, Nevada</span>, 51 FLRA 229, 232 (1995) (parties bear the burden of creating a factual record on which the Authority can make a negotiability determination; agency must provide record support and demonstrate its assertion that a proposal is nonnegotiable).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;To the extent that this definition varies from the approach applied in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Newington</span>, that decision will no longer be followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this definition to Proposal 4, we find that it concerns types of employees or positions. Dental hygienists are in a separate classification series.[10] It follows that dental hygienists constitute a distinguishable class, kind, group or category of employee or position and fall within the ordinary meaning of type. As the differentiation of dental hygienists as a group or category is based on specialized line of work and qualifications requirements, we find that their identification as a type relates to the establishment of staffing patterns. Consequently, dental hygienists constitute a type of employee or position within the meaning of section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;A classification "series" consists of a grouping of positions that are "similar as to specialized line of work and qualification requirements." <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 49 and U.S. Department of the Army, Army Corps of Engineers, South Pacific Division, San Francisco, California</span>, 52 FLRA 665, 666 n.1 (1996) (quoting U.S. Office of Personnel Management, <span class="Italic">Introduction to the Position Classification Standards</span> 4 (1991)). The position classification series for the three positions involved in this decision are as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">Dental assistant series--GS-681</p>
<p class="noindent-3">Dental hygiene series--GS-682</p>
<p class="noindent-3">Dental laboratory aid and technician series--GS-683...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties do not dispute that the dental assistant's duties constitute a work project under Authority precedent. The Authority has construed the term "work project" in section 7106(b)(1) to mean "particular job" or "task." <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3302 and U.S. Department of Health and Human Service, Social Security Administration, Dunbar Branch Office, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 37 FLRA 350, 355 (1990). We find that the dental assistant's duties constitute a work project.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 4 requires that the Agency assign a type of employee or position (dental hygienist) to a work project (dental assistant's duties). As such, Proposal 4 concerns a matter within section 7106(b)(1).[11] Therefore, we find that Proposal 4 is negotiable at the election of the Agency and we do not reach the Agency's contentions as to section 7106(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;We also find that this proposal concerns numbers and grades within the meaning of section 7106(b)(1). The proposal is concerned with the number of employees to whom dental assistant duties are assigned--that is, the Union is seeking to negotiate over the number of employees or positions to be assigned these duties. Additionally, because the positions of dental assistant, dental hygienist and dental laboratory technician that are involved in this proposal have specific grades attached, this proposal concerns the grades of employees or positions to be assigned dental assistant duties.</p>
<p class="noindent">The interaction of management's right to determine the number of employees assigned to a tour of duty and proposals concerning changes in shifts was explored in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23</span>, 33 FLRA 532, 541-47 (1988). [Discussed in Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-14-006.html#sec6-7">Shifts, Tours, Hours of Duty</a>."] Along with proposals that essentially set staffing levels, proposals are nonnegotiable that set qualifications for positions or identify positions to be established, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923 and DHHS, HCFA, Baltimore</span>, 44 FLRA 1405, 1458 (1992) (Proposal 13):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have defined the term "types" of employees as used in section 7106(b)(1) to encompass the right to make determinations based on work or job-related differences between employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Medical Center, Newington</span>, 38 FLRA at 216. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 39 FLRA at 1188-90. Specifically, we have found that the right to determine the types of employees is related to management's right to determine the necessary qualifications and experience for work assignments. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Medical Center, Newington</span>, 38 FLRA at 217. We see no reason to define the term differently where the issue is the "type" of position within the meaning of section 7106(b)(1) rather than the "type" of employee.</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiability restrictions on staffing cannot be used to defeat specific statutory guarantees. As a result, a court concluded that FLRA erred when it decided that a union could not negotiate a proposal for full-time union representatives on official time. Although the proposal affected manpower limits, by denying its negotiability FLRA eroded if not negated the official time guarantees of &#x00A7; 7131(d). Given the conflict, FLRA could not accommodate the competing interests by reading the official time provision out of the Statute. The proposal was negotiable. <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 214 v. FLRA</span>, 798 F.2d 1525, 1531 (D.C. Cir. 1986). [Discussed in Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-11-025.html#sec3-26">Official Time</a>."]</p>
