<p class="Body-Text">Termination of a temporary promotion is not an appealable adverse action. <span class="Italic">Parker v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 7 MSPR 662, 663, 7 MSPB 489 (1981); <span class="Italic">Winn v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 7 MSPR 157, 159, 7 MSPB 76 (1981) ("As in the case of an employee serving a limited term appointment, the termination of a temporary promotion is not an adverse action covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 and subject to the appellate jurisdiction of the Board."); <span class="Italic">see Lightsey v. EEOC</span>, 19 MSPR 626, 627 (1984) (no appeal right from the return of the employee to a permanent position following a one-year renewal of a one-year temporary promotion). The termination of a temporary promotion and return of the employee to his former position or grade is not a reduction in grade under 5 USC 7512(3) appealable to MSPB. <span class="Italic">Shjeflo v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-1103); <span class="Italic">see Gosnell v. DOJ</span>, 69 F.3d 1138 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (appellant, a supervisory assistant U.S. attorney, was not reduced in grade or pay for purposes of MSPB appellate jurisdiction when a temporary assignment of increased responsibilities, with increased pay, was terminated in accordance with established agency policy and she returned to her prior duties and pay level); <span class="Italic">cf. Bielomaz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 86 MSPR 276, 279-80 &#x00B6; 10 (2000) (challenge to an action canceling a promotion was beyond the Board's jurisdiction because the appellant had not completed his probationary or trial period at the time of the action appealed); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Shik v. MSPB</span>, 662 Fed. Appx. 919 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP) (no legal basis supported a claim that the appellant should have continued to receive the higher pay of a temporary promotion that ended when the appellant asserted he continued to do the higher level work).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to a temporary promotion that exceeds two years, initially it was determined that if an appellant is removed at the conclusion of the term because of the return rights of the permanent appointee, the law requires only that the appellant be given adverse action procedures; the cause requirement is met by a demonstration that the temporary appointment expired of its own accord. <span class="Italic">Phipps v. DHHS</span>, 23 MSPR 486, 488-89 (1984); <span class="Italic">see Riley v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 16 MSPR 19, 21 (1983) (remanding for consideration of whether under 5 CFR 752.401(c)(7) (1983) [currently 5 CFR 752.401(b)(12) (2022)] appellant's temporary promotion exceeded two years, requiring appeal rights upon termination). On review, in <span class="Italic">Phipps v. DHHS</span>, 767 F.2d 895 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (citing but not resolving some problems addressed in <span class="Italic">Crowley v. United States</span>, 527 F.2d 1176 (Ct. Cl. 1975)), the court concluded, contrary to the Board, that termination of the temporary appointment was not an adverse action. In <span class="Italic">Phipps</span>, the court noted that the employee agreed in writing to revert to his permanent position on expiration of his extended term, but that he later relied on an OPM regulation, 5 CFR 752.401(c)(7) (1997) [currently 5 CFR 752.401(b)(12) (2022)], defining adverse actions to exclude actions terminating a temporary promotion within a maximum period of two years. Phipps argued that because his promotion exceeded two years, its termination was an adverse action. OPM regulations governing temporary promotions provided, at 5 CFR 335.102(f)(1) [currently 5 CFR 335.102(f) (2022)], that agencies may temporarily promote for periods of one year and extend the promotions for the same period. At the conclusion of the promotion period, or when the agency decides it no longer needs the employee in the higher-level position, the agency returns the employee to his original position or takes other action consistent with the employee's original grade. The regulation provided that the return of the employee is not subject to the protections of part 752 (adverse actions) of 5 CFR. As to the employee's position in this situation, the court stated that "[i]t looks as if Phipps claims title by adverse possession," and as to the meaning of the regulations defining how temporary promotions were to be extended through OPM approval (5 CFR 335.102), the court commented that "[t]his regulation reads like the product of sleepy conferees anxious to adjourn at midnight." From the regulatory confusion, the court concluded, 767 F.2d at 897:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We think that the regulation quoted above, &#x00A7; 335.102(f)(1), whatever its other obscurities, quite sufficiently refutes the ideas either that a useless ritual of an adverse action is to be staged whenever a temporarily promoted employee remains in the position to which temporarily promoted over 2 years with OPM consent, and is then returned to the previous position, or that, whatever the intentions of the agency, the OPM, and the employee himself, the mere lapse of time creates new substantive property rights in the position to which temporarily promoted. This being so, the negative inference from 752.401(c)(7) cannot stand as the true meaning and intent of the regulations read as a whole.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court's decision in <span class="Italic">Phipps</span> has since been treated as a general rule of law, followed in subsequent Board decisions. <span class="Italic">See Boswell v. Dept. of Army</span>, 40 MSPR 521, 523 (1989) (adverse action procedures were not required when a temporarily promoted employee was returned to the prior position, even though the employee occupied the position held through promotion for more than two years); <span class="Italic">Mosley v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 689, 690-91 (1986) ("The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, however, in affirming <span class="Italic">Phipps</span>, held that the regulatory provisions of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 335.102(f)(1) and 752.401(c)(7) do not require adverse action procedures where a temporarily promoted employee is returned to his or her previous position after having served in the temporary position for more than a two year period."). Following <span class="Italic">Phipps</span>, <span class="Italic">Weyman v. DOJ</span>, 58 MSPR 509, 512-13 (1993), declared:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_364"></span>To establish the Board's jurisdiction over this alleged reduction in grade and/or pay appeal, the appellant must show by a preponderance of the evidence that he was appointed by an authorized appointing officer who took the promotion action with an awareness that he was permanently appointing the appellant to the SAUSA position of Deputy Chief in 1989, and the appellant noted his acceptance of the promotion. <span class="Italic">See Brock v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 49 MSPR 564, 567-68 (1991). The appellant has been afforded the opportunity throughout this appeal to present evidence substantiating his claim that United States Attorney Dexter Lehtinen permanently promoted him to a SAUSA position in October 1989, or subsequently on December 31, 1989. He has offered no such evidence. Therefore, we find that he has not shown that he was permanently appointed to the SAUSA position of Deputy Chief in 1989 and is entitled to the benefits of the position.... Further, while the appellant implies that the agency created an expectancy that his assignment to the Deputy Chief position constituted a permanent promotion because the agency failed to state that this assignment was temporary in SF-50s issued subsequently over an approximate 1-year period, we find that the mere lapse of time did not create new substantive property rights in the temporary position for the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Phipps v. DHHS</span>, 767 F.2d 895, 897 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Mosley v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 689, 690-91 (1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Leiser v. DOJ</span>, 64 MSPR 543, 548-50 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Leiser v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 95-3064), the Board again addressed its jurisdiction over termination of temporary promotions in the claim of an Assistant United States Attorney who, as in <span class="Italic">Weyman</span>, claimed tenured entitlement to a Supervisory Assistant United States Attorney position. The Board again resolved that it lacked jurisdiction over the claim because of the appellant's failure to show facts demonstrating a permanent promotion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Government can be bound by an agent only if the agent had actual authority. <span class="Italic">H. Landau &#x0026; Co. v. United States</span>, 886 F.2d 322, 324 (Fed. Cir. 1989). Unauthorized acts taken by an agent do not bind the Government. <span class="Italic">Federal Crop Insurance Corp. v. Merrill</span>, 332 U.S. 380, 384-85, 68 S. Ct. 1, 3-4, 92 L.

Moreover, it is a long-established rule that "estoppel cannot be set up against the Government on the basis of an unauthorized representation or act of an officer or employee who is without authority in his individual capacity to bind the Government." <span class="Italic">Byrne Organization, Inc. v. United States</span>, 287 F.2d 582, 587, 152 Ct. Cl. 578, 587 (1961); <span class="Italic">see also Potter v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 21 MSPR 476, 477 n.1 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Mr. Hudson lacked the authority to promote the appellant permanently to a SAUSA position so as to preclude Ms. Fahey from selecting her own supervisory attorneys, the agency cannot be bound by anything Hudson may have said or done to represent that the appellant's promotion was permanent, nor can Hudson's acts or representations as to the nature of the promotion estop Ms. Fahey from terminating the promotion upon her appointment as the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. <span class="Italic">Cf., e.g., United States v. Benson</span>, 941 F.2d at 612 (United States Attorney, who lacked authority under the USAM to initiate prosecutions without the approval of the Tax Division, properly exercised his authority to initiate prosecution only after he sought and received the Tax Division's permission to commence such an action). Accordingly, an inquiry into Mr. Hudson's state of mind when he promoted the appellant is unnecessary, and, to the extent that <span class="Italic">Weyman</span> suggests such an inquiry, we decline to follow it under the circumstances presented in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record evidence further shows that the agency informed the appellant in January 1991 that his promotion was temporary and of limited duration, i.e., it would not exceed January 12, 1995. The appellant signed a January 11, 1991, statement notifying him of the temporary nature of his status as a SAUSA. In a sworn statement, the appellant recalls that he signed the January 11, 1991, statement, and that he "knew that theoretically [he] could be removed or downgraded essentially at will." Moreover, the appellant does not allege nonreceipt of the SF-50 showing that his assignment to the SAUSA position was temporary and of limited duration. <span class="Italic">See Deans v. Department of Labor</span>, 15 MSPR 326, 328 (1983) (the agency notified the appellant in advance of the scheduled expiration date of her temporary appointment, and she was not employed in the position beyond that date; the Board lacked jurisdiction over the termination of the appointment).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Office of Personnel Management regulation, 5 CFR 752.401(b)(12), excludes, for purposes of chapter 75 of title 5 of the United States Code, an</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[a]ction that terminates a temporary or term promotion and returns the employee to the position from which temporarily promoted, or to a different position of equivalent grade and pay, if the agency informed the employee that it was to be of limited duration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The documentary record shows that the appellant's promotion to supervisory status was temporary and of limited duration, and that the agency informed him of the nature of his promotion in January 1991. Moreover, to the extent that the appellant argues that the agency brought about an expectancy that his assignment to a SAUSA position constituted a permanent promotion because it failed to state the temporary nature of the promotion in June 1989, the mere lapse of time did not create new substantive property rights in the temporary assignment for the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Phipps v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 767 F.2d 895, 897 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Weyman</span>, 58 MSPR at 513.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons set forth above, we find that the termination of the appellant's temporary promotion by the newly appointed United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia and his reassignment to his previous AUSA position constitutes an action excluded from the Board's jurisdiction under 5 CFR 752.401(b)(12). <span class="Italic">Cf. Mosley v. Department of the Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 689, 690-91 (1986) (an employee who was returned to his previous position after having served in a position with a temporary promotion for more than a two-year period had not been affected by an adverse action appealable to the Board). Because the appellant has not raised nonfrivolous allegations of the Board's jurisdiction that cannot be resolved on the basis of the documentary record, he is not entitled to a hearing on the jurisdictional issue.[*] <span class="Italic">See Santillan v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 54 MSPR 21, 27 (1992); <span class="Italic">O'Neal v. USPS</span>, 39 MSPR 645, 649, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 887 F.2d 1095 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;In light of our finding that the termination of the appellant's temporary promotion is not an action appealable to the Board, we need not determine whether 28 USC 542 and 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(C) conflict so as to deprive the Board of jurisdiction over actions involving AUSAs generally<span class="Italic">. See Weyman</span>, 58 MSPR at 513 n.2. However, we note that the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has held that the Attorney General possesses unconditional power under 28 USC 542(b) to remove AUSAs, and that AUSAs have "no [protectable] property or liberty interest in continued employment." <span class="Italic">Windsor v. The Tennessean</span>, 719 F.2d 155, 159 (6th Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 469 U.S. 826, 105 S. Ct. 105, 83 L. Ed.2d 50 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The appellant argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that he voluntarily waived his appeal rights under 5 USC 7511 when he signed the January 11, 1991, statement. The appellant also contends that the agency's 1991 actions were an attempt to divest him of any appeal rights that he may have had as an "employee" under 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(C). Because we find that the action being appealed is not within the Board's jurisdiction, we need not address these arguments, which involve the issue of whether the appellant is an "employee" with appeal rights to the Board under 5 USC 7511. <span class="Italic">See Weyman</span>, 58 MSPR at 513 n.2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Briggs v. National Council on Disability</span>, 60 MSPR 331 (1994), requires a jurisdictional hearing to determine whether Mr. Hudson provided him with notice of the nature of his 1989 promotion. In <span class="Italic">Briggs</span>, the Board found that the agency head had the authority to determine that the Executive Director position was of a policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 335. The Board remanded the appeal for, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, findings as to whether the head of the agency had exercised that authority and made such a determination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 335-36. As explained above, Mr. Hudson had no authority to determine the nature of the appellant's promotion to a SAUSA position. Thus, <span class="Italic">Briggs</span> is inapplicable to this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some regulations cited in earlier decisions have changed. Now, under 5 CFR 752.401(b)(12) (2022), OPM excludes from adverse action coverage:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Action that terminates a temporary or term promotion and returns the employee to the position from which temporarily promoted, or to a different position of equivalent grade and pay, if the agency informed the employee that it was to be of limited duration.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;Make time-limited promotions to fill temporary positions, accomplish project work, fill positions temporarily pending reorganization or downsizing, or meet other temporary needs for a specified period of not more than 5 years, unless OPM authorizes the agency to make and/or extend time-limited promotions for a longer period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The agency must give the employee advance written notice of the conditions of the time-limited promotion, including the time limit of the promotion; the reason for a time limit; the requirement for competition for promotion beyond 120 days, where applicable; and that the employee may be returned at any time to the position from which temporarily promoted, or to a different position of equivalent grade and pay, and the return is not subject to the procedures in parts 351, 432, 752, or 771 of this chapter. When an agency effects a promotion under a nondiscretionary provision and is unable to give advance notice to the employee, it must provide the notice as soon as possible after the promotion is made.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">CEP positions are entry-level positions in the Federal Government advertised at the GS-5 and/or GS-7 levels with targets at the GS-11 or GS-12 grade levels. According to the agency's CEP Policy, the 52-week program gives employees an opportunity to develop and grow within the agency, when they otherwise would not have been eligible for promotion. CEP participants are temporarily assigned to the position with a formalized training plan, and they are expected to satisfactorily complete the requirements of the CEP within the first 52 weeks in the program or they will be returned to their position of record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The job announcement for the appellant's CEP position informed applicants that initial placement is temporary and, if the selected employee does not satisfactorily complete the program requirements within the first 52 weeks, the employee "will be returned to the position of record if available, or to a position equivalent in grade and salary to the position held before selection to the program." The job announcement further stated that, although employees in a position with further promotion potential may be noncompetitively promoted if they successfully complete the program requirements and if recommended by management, "promotion is neither implied nor guaranteed."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a June 15, 2015 letter, the agency informed the appellant that her temporary placement in the CEP position was being terminated based on management's determination that she did not successfully complete the program requirements. Effective June 28, 2015, the agency returned the appellant to her position of record as a GS-0525-07 Accounting Technician. IAF, Tab 8 at 13 (SF-50 citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.102 as the legal authority for the action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a Board appeal and requested a hearing, alleging that she was illegally demoted when the agency reassigned her to her "previously held grade, title and pay" in the GS-0525 series instead of promoting her to a GS-2210-09 position after she completed the 52-week CEP training program and received "a fully successful performance rating within the first year." The appellant alleged that the agency was required to promote her to the GS-9 position on June 29, 2015, following the 1-year anniversary of her CEP appointment and, after that date, the agency could not simply return her to her previously held position. The appellant further alleged that, on June 30, 2015, "after the 52 week deadline had passed," the human resources office received management's request to reassign her to her previous position, retroactive to June 28, 2015....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The undisputed documentary evidence shows that the appellant's CEP position and the Accounting Technician position shared the same grade but the pay was greater in the CEP position due to a special rate of pay under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5305. On review, the appellant appears to argue that the CEP position held greater promotion potential than the Accounting Technician position, which could be construed as an argument that she was reduced in grade. We find this argument unavailing because promotion potential is not a basis for distinguishing between positions of equal grade for purposes of determining whether an appealable reduction in grade has occurred. <span class="Italic">Burrell v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 427, &#x00B6; 12 (1999); <span class="Italic">Lange v. Department of Transportation</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 700, 701-03 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the appellant claims that she suffered a reduction in grade because the agency should have promoted her to a GS-9 position after 1 year of successful performance in the CEP position, we find that she has failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation of an action within the Board's jurisdiction. The denial of a promotion is not an adverse action that is generally appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Walters v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 115, 118 (1994). The appellant did not make any allegations that could implicate any of the exceptions to the general rule. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 5 C.F.R. parts 1208, 1209 (concerning claims pursuant to the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998, the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, and the and the Whistleblower Protection Act, as amended). Further, absent an allegation that a relevant position was reclassified, she has not alleged facts that, if proven, could establish jurisdiction on a "constructive demotion" theory. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Marcheggianni</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 212, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the appellant has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that she was subjected to an appealable reduction in grade.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">A reduction in grade or pay associated with the termination of an employee's temporary promotion and return to her former position is not an appealable adverse action under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant may have experienced a reduction in "pay" as that term is defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(4) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402. However, we find that there is an issue as to whether the special rate of pay under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5305 associated with the CEP position should be considered in determining whether the appellant has experienced a reduction in "pay" under applicable definitions. <span class="Italic">See Adde</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 689, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-14. We do not reach this issue because, even assuming the appellant experienced a reduction in grade and/or pay, we agree with the administrative judge that the Board lacks jurisdiction to review the type of action challenged here for the following other reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under regulations implementing chapter 75, the adverse action appeal process before the Board does not apply when an agency "terminates a temporary or term promotion and returns the employee to the position from which temporarily promoted, or to a different position of equivalent grade and pay, if the agency informed the employee that it was to be of limited duration." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(12). Further, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.102(f)(1) similarly provides that an employee serving a time-limited promotion "may be returned at any time to the position from which temporarily promoted, or to a different position of equivalent grade and pay, and the return is not subject to [certain procedures]," including, as particularly relevant here, the procedures governing adverse actions set forth in 5 C.F.R., part 752, subpart D. The Board and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have long followed the implementing regulations excluding such actions from the adverse action appeal process. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mosley v. Department of the Navy</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 689, 690-91 (1986); <span class="Italic">Phipps v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 767 F.2d 895, 897 (Fed. Cir. 1985). For the following reasons, we agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that the exclusion in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(12) applies here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that her promotion through the CEP was anything other than temporary. We find nothing in the terms of the agency's CEP, vacancy announcement, or appointing documentation that suggests that her temporary promotion might become permanent absent further explicit agency action. This is consistent with the general rule that the promotion of a Federal employee cannot occur unless an official with the appropriate authority took, authorized, or ratified an action that could reasonably be said to have resulted in an appointment or promotion. <span class="Italic">See Hoever v. Department of Navy</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6; 8 (2011). The appellant has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that any such act occurred here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered the appellant's theory that she should be deemed to have been promoted because she successfully completed 52 weeks in the CEP position; however, we find that she has not identified any legal authority or alleged any facts that, if proven, could establish that she was entitled a promotion under these circumstances absent further express action from the agency. The appellant relies in particular on the following excerpt from the agency's CEP Policy:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Positions are initially filled as temporary, with the option to make the selection permanent within the first 12 months (52 weeks) of program participation. The selection is made permanent and the employee non-competitively promoted to the next grade in the career ladder when:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;Time in grade and specialized experience requirements have been met;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">2.&#x2003;Training requirements for the current grade level have been successfully completed; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">3.&#x2003;Performance is at a fully successful level or higher at the current grade level as documented by quarterly performance between the employee and supervisor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the appellant's view, she satisfied all of these criteria, and the agency could no longer deny her a promotion after she occupied the CEP position for more than 52 weeks. We find that the appellant has failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency was obligated to promote her after she occupied the CEP position for 52 weeks. On its face, the agency's CEP Policy does not support the appellant's theory; instead, it reinforces the normal rule that the decision to promote requires action by agency management. <span class="Italic">See Hoever</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6; 8. For instance, the CEP Policy refers to management's "option" to make the selection permanent during the first 52 weeks of participation. It further provides for permanent noncompetitive promotion only after the employee "successfully" completes training requirements and her supervisor documents her performance at a "fully successful level or higher," thus anticipating assessment by management. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 9-10. Accordingly, we find that the appellant has not alleged any facts that, if proven, could establish that her promotion through the CEP was anything other than temporary. <span class="Italic">See Phipps</span>, 767 F.2d at 896-97 (rejecting an employee's argument, concerning a prior version of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.102(f), that "the mere lapse of time" created new rights to a position to which an employee had been temporarily promoted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the undisputed record shows that the agency informed the appellant that her promotion to the CEP position was to be of limited duration. The vacancy announcement created no express or implied right to continued employment in her temporary position. The job announcement specified that CEP participants receive temporary <span id="Page_366"></span>position assignments and that "promotion is neither implied nor guaranteed." We find that the appellant has failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(12) does not apply because of a lack of notice that the promotion to the CEP position was to be of limited duration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is also undisputed that the agency returned the appellant to a GS-7 Accounting Technician position, which was the position and grade she occupied prior to her temporary promotion through the CEP. The appellant does not claim that she has been returned to a position with a reduction in grade or pay as compared to what she held prior to taking the temporary promotion through the CEP.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Thus, we find the facts alleged clearly implicate the regulations rendering the adverse action appeal process inapplicable to an agency's action terminating an employee's temporary promotion and returning her to the position from which she was temporarily promoted. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(12). We find that the appellant has failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that this regulatory limitation does not apply to her claims. Accordingly, we affirm, as modified, the initial decision dismissing this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For protections available to "employees" under 5 USC 7511 in temporary or term appointments not made under 5 CFR 335.102(f), refer to <span class="Italic">Mitchell v.
