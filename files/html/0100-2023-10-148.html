<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-149"><span class="space">9.</span> Professional Employees' Unit Status</h4>
<p class="noindent">The definition of a professional employee is supplied by 5 USC 7103(a)(15):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(A)&#x2003;an employee engaged in the performance of work--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;requiring knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction and study in an institution of higher learning...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;requiring the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment in its performance;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(iii)&#x2003;which is predominantly intellectual and varied in character (as distinguished from routine mental, manual, mechanical, or physical work); and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(iv)&#x2003;which is of such character that the output produced or the result accomplished by such work cannot be standardized in relation to a given period of time; or</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(B)&#x2003;an employee who has completed the courses of specialized intellectual instruction and study described in subparagraph (A)(i) of this paragraph and is performing related work under appropriate direction or guidance to qualify the employee as a professional employee described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="noindent">5 USC 7112 provides, in part:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;A unit shall not be determined to be appropriate under this section solely on the basis of the extent to which employees in the proposed unit have organized, nor shall a unit be determined to be appropriate if it includes--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(5)&#x2003;both professional employees and other employees, unless a majority of the professional employees vote for inclusion in the unit;</p>
<p class="noindent">Adding context to the statutory definition of professional employee, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-092.html">61 FLRA 485</a>, 492-93 (2006), explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(15) of the Statute, an employee is a professional employee if that employee is engaged in performing work that: (1) requires "knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction and study in an institution of higher learning"; (2) requires "the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment in its performance"; (3) is "predominantly intellectual and varied in character," as opposed to "routine mental, manual, mechanical, or physical work"; and (4) is "of such character that the output produced or the result accomplished by such work cannot be standardized in relation to a given period of time[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(15). In applying this definition, the Authority has customarily assessed whether the position in question requires advanced knowledge of a type that is usually acquired in an institution of higher learning. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Attorneys Office for the Dist. of Columbia</span>, 37 FLRA 1077, 1082 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Attorneys Office</span>); <span class="Italic">Veterans Admin., Regional Office, Portland, Ore.</span>, 9 FLRA 804, 805-06 (1982) (<span class="Italic">Regional Office</span>). The Authority has noted, however, that a college degree is not necessarily required for an employee to be considered a professional. <span class="Italic">See Attorneys Office</span>, 37 FLRA at 1082. <span class="Italic">Cf. Massachusetts Army Nat'l Guard, TAGO, Nat'l Guard Bu., Dep't of Defense</span>, 8 FLRA 711 (1982) (<span class="Italic">Massachusetts Nat'l Guard</span>). The Authority has also considered the extent to which performance of the job involves the exercise of discretion and judgment, as well as whether the nature of the work is intellectual and varied, as opposed to routine mental, manual, or physical work. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., 934th Tactical Airlift Group (AFRES), Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, Minneapolis, Minn</span>, 13 FLRA 549 (1983); <span class="Italic">Regional Office</span>, 9 FLRA at 805-06.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA is prohibited by &#x00A7; 7112(b)(5) from including professional employees in a unit with employees who are not professionals, unless a majority of the professional employees vote for inclusion in the unit. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, N.

Ctr.</span>, FLRA will direct separate elections if a petition is filed for a unit combining professionals and nonprofessionals. The first voting group comprises all professionals. The second group consists of all the nonprofessionals. The nonprofessionals are asked whether they wish to be represented by the union (or another) or by no union. The professionals are asked: (1) whether or not they wish to be included with nonprofessionals for the purpose of exclusive recognition; and (2) whether they wish to be represented by one union, another, or neither. If a majority of the professionals vote for inclusion with nonprofessionals, the ballots of the two groups are combined. If the majority of the professionals do not vote for inclusion with nonprofessionals, but they seek representation, they are considered to have indicated their desire for a separate unit, and a certification will be issued accordingly.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the RD failed to apply established law--specifically, <span class="Italic">FTC</span>--when he declined to consider whether there were meaningful <span id="page_136"></span>changes to the liaison's job duties, functions, or circumstances before excluding the liaison from the unit as a professional employee. In other words, the Union argues that the RD should have "held [the parties] to their earlier agreement" rather than resolving the liaison's bargaining-unit status under the Statute. The Authority will grant an application for review if the application demonstrates that the RD failed to apply established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">FTC</span>, the parties had a pre-election agreement to <span class="Italic">exclude</span> certain positions, several of which were also statutorily excluded, from a bargaining unit.[30] After the election, when the Union sought to include some of those previously excluded positions in the unit, the Authority held that it would not clarify the bargaining-unit status of those positions absent "meaningful changes...in the job duties or functions and/or job circumstances" of the positions.[31] However, <span class="Italic">FTC</span> did <span class="Italic">not</span> involve a situation where the parties had agreed to <span class="Italic">include</span> a position in a unit and later asked the Authority to resolve whether the Statute prohibited the continued inclusion of that position. Those situations are governed by a different line of Authority precedent, including the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Credit Union</span>. In that decision, the Authority explained that, regardless of an agreement between parties to include a position in a unit, meaningful changes to the position need not be shown in order for the Authority to resolve whether the <span class="Italic">Statute</span> requires that the position be excluded from the unit.[32] This is because, as a general matter, where the Statute requires the exclusion of a position from a bargaining unit, a prior agreement between the parties to include that position is not enforceable.[33] In particular, &#x00A7; 7112 of the Statute provides that a bargaining unit is not "appropriate" if it includes certain types of employees.[34] For example, under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(2), a bargaining unit cannot properly include a "confidential employee."[35] So, in <span class="Italic">Credit Union</span>, where the parties had agreed to include in the unit a position that the regional director found to be a confidential employee under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13) of the Statute, the Authority found that &#x00A7; 7112(b)(2) required that the position be excluded from the unit.[36]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the RD concluded that <span class="Italic">FTC</span> did not apply--and that <span class="Italic">Credit Union</span> did apply--because the Union sought to enforce an agreement to <span class="Italic">include</span> a position in the unit even if doing so might conflict with the mandatory exclusions of &#x00A7; 7112. The Union argues that <span class="Italic">Credit Union</span> is inapplicable here because confidential employees like those excluded in Credit Union cannot belong to any bargaining unit under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(2), whereas professional employees can be in units. But &#x00A7; 7112(b)(5) provides that professional employees cannot be included in a non-professional unit like the one here "unless a majority of the professional employees vote for inclusion in the unit." And the Union fails to explain why the Authority's holding in <span class="Italic">Credit Union</span>--that &#x00A7; 7112(b) exclusions govern over pre-election agreements to include positions--does not encompass the RD's application of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(5) here. Moreover, the Authority has held that the parties' history of categorizing employees as professionals or non-professionals does not bind the Authority "insofar as unit determination[s] under the Statute [are] concerned."[40] Thus, where, as here, there has been no election to determine whether professional employees wish to be included in a non-professional unit, the parties' pre-election agreement provides no basis for including a professional employee in the unit. However, we note that nothing in this decision precludes an election to include professionals in this non-professional unit in the event that an election petition is properly filed.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the parties' pre-election agreement does not provide a basis for the Authority to keep the liaison in the unit without determining whether she is excluded under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(5). Therefore, the Union has not shown that the RD failed to apply established law when he clarified the liaison's bargaining-unit status under the Statute, rather than enforcing the parties' agreement.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We note that section 7103(a)(15) of the Statute provides that a professional employee is engaged in work requiring advanced knowledge of a type "customarily acquired" in an institution of higher learning. Consistent with this definition, we agree with the Activity that a college degree is not always required for an employee to be considered professional. However, in view of the statutory definition, the RD's examination of the educational requirements of the position was not misplaced and, in view of the RD's findings concerning the incumbent's duties and responsibilities, the Activity's argument provides no basis for concluding that the incumbent is professional.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, NAS New Orleans and NAIL</span>, 67 FLRA 422, 424-27 (2014), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, affirmed a regional director's determination that a school-liaison officer was a professional:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the RD committed clear and prejudicial errors concerning substantial factual matters when he found that the duties of the liaison require "advanced knowledge" and "the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment." The Union also argues that, as a result of these alleged errors, the RD failed to apply established law when he found that the liaison is a professional under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(15) of the Statute. Additionally, the Union argues that the RD should have relied upon the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Columbia</span> (<span class="Italic">Attorneys Office</span>) to find that the liaison is not a professional employee. As relevant here, the Authority will grant an application for review if the application demonstrates that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter, or (as stated previously) failed to apply established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(15), one of the characteristics of the work of a "professional employee" is that it requires "knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction and study in an institution of higher learning." In this regard, the RD found that the liaison position "requires knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning (e.g., education, child/youth development, or psychology)." The Union argues that the RD erred in making these findings because the liaison's position description "does not...use the term 'advanced.'" However, bargaining-unit-eligibility determinations are based on the evidence of employees' actual duties, not written position descriptions.[50] Therefore, the Union's argument does not establish that the RD erred.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[50]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command</span>, 67 FLRA 117, 123 (2013) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Projects Office, Yuma, Ariz.</span>, 37 FLRA 239, 245 (1990)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also argues that the RD erred because the liaison's position description "does not require a degree." However, the RD did not find that the liaison is required to hold a degree. Rather, the RD found that the liaison's position description requires <span class="Italic">either</span> "the successful completion of a four-year college or university degree...or a combination of education and experience" <span class="Italic">equivalent</span> to a "four-year course of study." More importantly, the RD correctly noted that "neither the Statute nor Authority case law" specifically requires a degree in order for a position to be professional. In this regard, the Authority has held that "a college degree is not necessarily required for an employee to be considered a professional."[54] Thus, that the liaison is not required to hold a college degree does not establish that the RD erred in his findings concerning the "advanced knowledge" required to perform the liaison's duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[54]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">CBP</span>, 61 FLRA at 493; <span class="Italic">see also Attorneys Office</span>, 37 FLRA at 1082 ("a college degree is not always required for an employee to be considered professional").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also argues that the RD erred when he found that the duties of the liaison require the "consistent exercise of discretion and judgment." As set forth above, &#x00A7; 7103(a)(15) pertinently provides that the work of a "professional employee" requires "the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment in its performance." In challenging the RD's findings concerning this statutory requirement, the Union makes three assertions. In support of these assertions, the Union cites a signed document that the liaison provided to the RD in which she describes her duties (liaison's statement).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Union asserts that the liaison's work is "routine in nature." But the variety and complexity of the liaison's duties--as described in both the RD's decision and the liaison's statement--contradict this assertion. For example, the RD found that the liaison: acts as a "primary advisor" and "subject[-]matter expert" on "youth education, transitions, deployment issues, and K-12 educational matters"; represents her superiors "to school boards, school faculty, parents, and the local community"; "builds relationships with community leaders and organizations"; and "works independently in dealing with multiple school districts and schools, as well as the educational requirements/restrictions of different localities." And the RD found that the liaison "develops solutions, in partnership with local schools, to overcome educational barriers for students and...collaborates with local schools, school boards, public and private organizations, and installation organizations to facilitate transitions in education for military students." The Union does not specifically <span id="page_137"></span>dispute any of these findings. And, similarly, the liaison's statement describes the "wide spectrum of services" she provides, including: "serv[ing] as subject[-]matter expert[&#8197;]...on K-12 issues"; "helping to connect command, school[,] and community resources"; "leverag[ing] [resources] to support...families"; and "navigating families [through] the administrative systems within the local education agencies." Therefore, undisputed evidence indicates that the liaison's duties are varied and complex, and, thus, the Union has not shown that the RD erred by failing to find that the liaison's duties are "routine in nature."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Union asserts that the liaison does not "mak[e] decisions for or pertaining to schools/military families" However, the RD did not find that the liaison <span class="Italic">makes decisions for</span> schools or military families. Rather, the RD found that the liaison "provides direct support and assistance to military families on educational issues." And the liaison's statement--cited by the Union in support of its argument--confirms the RD's findings. For example, the liaison states that she "assist[s] families with school transfers and help[s] 'level the playing field' for military children and youth"; "[a]ssist[s] with school choice"; "navigat[es] families [through] the administrative systems within the local education agencies"; and "leverage[s] installation and school resources to provide graduating military students with access to post-secondary information and opportunities." Thus, undisputed record evidence supports the RD's finding that the liaison "provides direct support and assistance to military families on educational issues."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, the Union asserts that "[a]ny issues/problems that are brought to...the [liaison] by schools or families are given to...her immediate supervisor." However, even if correct, this assertion does not establish that the RD erred in finding that the liaison consistently exercises discretion and judgment. In this regard, undisputed findings by the RD, in addition to the liaison's undisputed description of her duties in her statement, establish that the liaison performs duties beyond resolving the "issues/problems" of "schools or families." For example, as discussed above, the RD and the liaison both describe the liaison as a "subject[-]matter expert" who builds connections between schools, communities, military command, and military families. Further, the RD found--and the Union does not dispute--that the liaison: represents her superiors "to school boards, school faculty, parents, and the local community"; "collaborates with local schools, school boards, public and private organizations, and installation organizations to facilitate transitions in education for military students"; "develops action[&#8197;] plans for accomplishment of community/school support goals"; and "develops the timelines for projects...and then ensures that the planned events take place." Moreover, even if the liaison brings "issues/problems" to her immediate supervisor, that does not refute the RD's finding that the liaison "receives little supervision" and "sets her own schedule." Similarly, the RD's conclusion that the liaison consistently exercises discretion and judgment is supported by his undisputed findings that the liaison's supervisor "does not direct [the liaison's] daily work duties," but, rather, gives the liaison "a great deal of freedom to plan her work, relying on her experience as the subject[-]matter expert in educational issues."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the Union's three assertions do not establish that the RD erred in finding that the liaison's duties "require the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we address the Union's argument that the RD's decision was inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Attorneys Office</span>. Specifically, the Union argues that because the liaison--like the non-professional "[v]ictim/[w]itness [a]dvocate" in <span class="Italic">Attorneys Office</span>[76]--is not required to have a degree or provide "psychological or clinical counseling," the RD failed to apply established law when he found that the liaison is a professional employee. However, Attorneys Office is distinguishable because, in this case, the RD found that the liaison has many duties requiring "advanced knowledge" and the "consistent exercise of discretion and judgment"--as discussed extensively in the analysis above--that were not performed by the employee in <span class="Italic">Attorneys Office</span>. Accordingly, the Union's argument does not establish that the RD failed to apply established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[76]&#x2003;37 FLRA at 1082.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the Union has not shown that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter, or failed to apply established law, when he concluded that the liaison is a professional under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(15) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Information technology project managers were professionals, based on their education and experience when hired, augmented by training they received during required certification processes, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, BEP and NTEU</span>, 70 FLRA 359, 359-63 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a petition seeking to clarify the bargaining-unit status of IT project managers. The Union is the certified, exclusive representative of a unit of non-professional employees who work for the Agency. The Union's petition concerns whether the IT project managers are professionals, and therefore excluded from the bargaining unit, or non-professionals, and therefore part of the bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The IT project managers at issue range from General Schedule (GS)-11 employees to GS-13 employees. When a supervisor assigns a project to an IT project manager, that IT project manager generates templates to build the project. The IT project manager's task includes determining the stakeholders in the project, creating a list of requirements for the project, creating a schedule for the project, and negotiating for the resources necessary to complete the project. The IT project manager also monitors the project to make sure it is on schedule. After a project is completed, the IT project manager ensures that all tasks are completed and completes a final assessment of the project. In order to successfully perform this task, an IT project manager must have some technical knowledge in order to properly sequence tasks.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Agency does not require IT project managers to have a four-year bachelor's degree when hired, IT project managers must begin the process of getting the federal acquisition certification once the Agency hires them. The certification is through a federal certification program and is a federal government requirement. In order to receive the certification, the IT project managers must attend classes that cover topics such as the process of requirement gathering and how the supply chain interacts with the projects.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The certification has three levels, and more complex and expensive projects can only be assigned to IT project managers with higher-level certifications. For IT project managers, the second and third levels of certification include some IT specialization. Each level requires certain classes as well as a certain amount of experience. Employees can earn some college credits by taking the courses necessary for the certification.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Statute provides the definition of a "professional employee" as an employee who performs work that: (1) requires "knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction and study in an institution of higher learning" (the knowledge requirement, as noted previously); (2) requires "the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment in its performance"; (3) is "predominantly intellectual and varied in character," as opposed to "routine mental, manual, mechanical, or physical work"; and (4) is "of such a character that the output produced or the result accomplished by such work cannot be standardized in relation to a given period of time."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency alleges that the RD made a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter when he found that the vacancy announcements did not require higher education or the equivalent level of experience.&#x2003;Specifically, the Agency argues that the RD made two such errors by not finding that: (1) the standards set by OPM for the series assigned to the IT project managers require either an advanced degree or significant experience; and (2) the IT project managers must complete "significant advanced coursework" for the certification and this coursework qualifies the employees to receive college credit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency alleges that the RD erred when he failed to take into consideration the OPM-assigned series of the IT project managers when he found that the IT project managers did not require higher education. Under OPM standards, the series of the IT project managers--2210 and 0301--list requirements of education or equivalent experience. For a GS-11 or higher in the 2210 series, OPM standards state that the education requirement is either a doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) or equivalent doctoral degree, or "[three] full years of progressively higher level education leading to a Ph.D. or equivalent doctoral degree," or equivalent experience.[20] A GS-11 in the 0301 series has similar requirements.[21]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[20]&#x2003;Information Technology (IT) Management Series, 2210 (Alternate A), <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/</a>...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[21]&#x2003;Classification &#x0026; Qualification: General Schedule Qualification Standards, <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/</a>...&#8197;(requiring, as relevant here, a "Ph.D. or equivalent doctoral degree <span class="Italic">or</span> [three] full years of progressively higher level graduate education leading to such a degree" or equivalent experience).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the vacancy announcements provided to the RD did not list any education requirements, they did list the positions as in either the 2210 or 0301 series. Combined with the OPM standards for these series, the RD made a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter in finding that the IT project managers did not require an advanced degree. As noted above, such a degree or equivalent experience may satisfy the knowledge requirement. We further note that a college degree does not necessarily satisfy the knowledge requirement. Here, a Ph.D., or its equivalent, demonstrates that the project managers must have "knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction." Because the OPM requirements for the IT program manager series satisfy the knowledge requirement, the RD should have found that the IT program managers are professional employees. As such, this error <span id="page_138"></span>is sufficient for us to grant the Agency's application and reverse the RD's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the Agency argues that the RD erred when he found that the federal acquisition certification did not satisfy the knowledge requirement under the Statute. The Agency contends that the certification is equivalent to a college degree. As noted above, the certification has three levels. IT project managers must take 80 to 120 hours of courses for each level. Additionally, the levels require one, two, and four years of experience respectively. Under our interpretation of the Statute, this represents a "prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction and study." As such, the certification is "acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction and study" and satisfies the knowledge requirement. Consequently, the RD erred in finding otherwise, and we grant the Agency's application on this issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency alleges that the RD erred in finding that the knowledge requirement must be met at the time the Agency fills the IT project manager position at issue because the Authority has never found this to be the case.&#x2003;Although conceding that the certification might be considered "specialized intellectual instruction and study in an institution of higher learning," the RD stated that "it seems implicit that for the knowledge requirement to be met, the employee must generally be expected to come into the position" with the requisite knowledge. As the Authority has no case law concerning the timing of the knowledge requirement, the RD's decision raises an issue for which there is an absence of precedent. We grant the Agency's application for review to resolve this issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To iterate, in order for an employee to be a professional employee, the Statute requires, as relevant here, that the employee "engage[&#8197;] in the performance of work...requiring knowledge of an advanced type." Although the certification is not a requirement at the time of hiring, IT project managers are required to obtain the certification during their time in the position in order to continue employment. As found by the RD, without this certification, IT project managers do not have the requisite knowledge and cannot perform their work. Consequently, the IT project managers perform work requiring the certification, that is, knowledge of an advanced type.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By looking solely at the requirements to obtain a position, the RD failed to take into consideration the requirements of the position after the Agency hires an IT program manager. The proper inquiry does not stop at a vacancy announcement or a position description,[37] but the actual duties performed by an employee in that position.[38] In this regard, &#x00A7; 7103(a)(15) of the Statute requires us to consider whether the "<span class="Italic">work</span>" that an employee performs requires knowledge of an advanced type.[39] Furthermore, unit determinations must reflect the conditions of employment that existed at the time of hearing rather than what may exist in the future unless there are definite and imminent changes planned by the agency.[40] Likewise, where there is no employee in a position--and thus no duties performed by an employee in that position--the Authority will not consider the bargaining-unit status of that position.[41] Consequently, the proper inquiry for satisfying the knowledge requirement is not at the time of hiring in the past, but the requirements of the position in the present hearing; and the RD erred in finding otherwise.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the dissent's assertion, we do not find that these employees are rendered professional employees "merely by performing work 'of an advanced type.'"

<p class="noindent-2">i.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Positions of Business Development Specialist, Business Initiatives Specialist, Senior Business Development Specialist, Broker Relations Specialist, and Senior Congressional Analyst </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the RD found that these positions do not satisfy the judgment requirement. However, the record establishes that the individuals in these positions exercise significant discretion when performing their duties. For example, the business development specialists exercise "discretion" and judgment to identify potential customers, market and recommend the Agency's financial products, and assist customers with applying for those products. And the Agency tasks these employees with independently "determin[ing] what[&#8197;] [is] going to be the best program or the best product [to market to] the potential [customer]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employees in the business-initiatives-specialist position also have "a lot of latitude in what [they] are able to do" due to the varied nature of that position's duties. As noted above, each business initiatives specialist is assigned to a different geographic region of the world and, as such, there is no "set schedule" for the position. Instead, the business initiative specialists must use their judgment to "balanc[e] and prioritiz[e]" their work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the senior business development specialist uses judgment to, among other things, structure some of "the most complex transactions" at the Agency. And in doing so, the senior business development specialist has the discretion to "change [certain] variables" within a project or transaction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the broker relations specialist, the individual in that position has the "flexibility and independence to determine...[the] agenda for" creating and implementing the Agency's broker strategy. And, the broker relations specialist "define[s]" the goals and priorities for fulfilling that core duty.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the senior-congressional-analyst position, employees in that position operate "independently to initiate and respond to communications with" Congress. Specifically, when the Agency receives a congressional inquiry, the senior congressional analysts work "fairly independently [to] analyz[e] and formulat[e] a response."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the RD concluded that these positions do not satisfy the judgment requirement because their duties are "limited to offering advice and recommendations," nothing in the Statute or case law states that an advisor cannot be a professional employee. In fact, the Authority has found that an employee who "act[ed] as a 'primary advisor' and 'subject[-]matter expert'" was a professional employee under the Statute.[46] And here, as the RD found, the employees in these positions provide advice as subject-matter experts.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Based on the above, we find that the positions of business development specialist, business initiatives specialist, senior business development specialist, broker relations specialist, and senior congressional analyst satisfy the judgment requirement. We further find that the RD, in determining otherwise, failed to apply established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">ii.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Senior Credit Review Officer and IT Specialist </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD concluded that the senior-credit-review-officer and IT-specialist positions do not satisfy the judgment requirement because employees in these positions "remain in regular...communication with their supervisors."[48] However, as long as those supervisors are not directing the positions' daily work, such communication, by itself, does not disqualify these positions from being professional.[49] And here, the RD did not determine--and the record does not establish--that supervisors provide such direction with regard to these positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[48]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 22.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[49]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Navy</span>, 67 FLRA at 426 (finding that a position's work required the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment where the supervisor did "not direct [the position's] daily work duties").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In fact, the record establishes that the individuals in these positions exercise significant discretion in the performance of their duties. Specifically, the senior credit review officer--as a contracting officer representative--manages projects of substantial "size" and "scope." In relation to those projects, the Agency tasks the senior credit review officer with managing vendor contracts and reviewing vendors' work product. The individual in that position is also responsible for detecting and mitigating fraud in certain Agency transactions and has significant "autonom[y]" in that role.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The IT specialists exercise a similar level of discretion.&#x2003;They draft project contracts, supervise contractors' work, and evaluate contractors' work product. And the record shows that when performing those duties, the specialists must "adhere to their...judgment [because] that [is part of the] job."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although someone in a different position has final approval over the types of contracts that the senior credit review officer and IT specialists manage, the relevant inquiry focuses on the work performed by individuals <span class="Italic">in the disputed positions</span>.[57] And, with regard to these contracts, the senior credit review officer and IT specialists are consistently using judgment in the performance of their work. For instance, the senior credit review officer must be "satisfied with the [vendor's] work" before signing a vendor invoice. Without the senior credit review officer's endorsement, those invoices are not advanced for final approval. Similarly, IT specialists use their understanding of the technical requirements of a project, and their familiarity with a contractor, to draft purchase agreements, statements of work, and other contracts. Even though another individual reviews those contracts, that person "usually accepts the IT [s]pecialist's input."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[57]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(15)(A)(ii) (a professional employee is one "engaged in the performance of work...requiring the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment in <span class="Italic">its performance</span>" (emphasis added)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the above, we conclude that the senior-credit-review-officer and IT-specialist positions satisfy the judgment requirement.[62] As the parties do not contest that these positions satisfy the other three criteria in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(15)(A), we further conclude that those two positions are professional under the Statute. Thus, we direct the RD to exclude those two positions from the unit.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The positions of business development specialist, business initiatives specialist, senior business development specialist, broker relations specialist, and senior congressional analyst satisfy the knowledge requirement. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7103(a)(15)(A)(i) provides that the work of a "professional" position requires "knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction and study in an institution of higher learning...(as distinguished from knowledge acquired by...training in the performance of routine mental, manual, mechanical, or physical activities)."[64] The Authority has stated that the "proper inquiry" for determining whether a position satisfies the knowledge requirement "does not stop at a vacancy announcement or a position description";[65] it addresses whether the work that the employee performs--at the time of the hearing--requires knowledge of an advanced type.[66]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[66]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 363.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the RD found that these five positions do not satisfy the knowledge requirement because the related position descriptions and vacancy announcements did not provide any educational requirements. However, the RD did not consider how the educational qualifications of the employees occupying those positions relate to the positions' duties. Thus, the RD's analysis is inconsistent with Authority precedent.[68]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[68]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also Navy</span>, 67 FLRA at 425 (the determination of whether a position satisfies the knowledge requirement cannot be based solely on positions descriptions, but must also consider the employees' actual duties).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record establishes that employees occupying these five positions perform similar duties.&#x2003;Each of the positions requires knowledge of, and the ability to communicate about, the types of complex financial transactions that the Agency facilitates between U.S. exporters and foreign importers. Moreover, the representative testimony demonstrates that employees in these positions possess degrees related to their profession. For example, of the two business development specialists who testified, one possesses a degree in business management, and the other has a bachelor's degree in economics and finance with a master's degree in applied economics. Similarly, the testimony establishes that most of the business initiatives specialists have master's degrees in "either finance or...international relations." And the senior business development specialist and the broker relations specialist possess, respectively, a bachelor's degree in finance with an MBA in international business, and a bachelor's degree in international relations with an MBA specializing in international business.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record demonstrates that the above "group of employees is predominantly composed of individuals possessing a degree in the field to which the[ir] profession is devoted," and the employees use their advanced knowledge to perform their work.[75] Therefore, we conclude that the positions of business development specialist, business initiatives specialist, senior business development specialist, and broker relations specialist satisfy the knowledge requirement.[76]</p>

In particular, both definitions state that the work performed must require "knowledge of an advanced type." <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(15)(A)(i), <span class="Italic">with</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 152(12)(a)(iv).

<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the senior-congressional-analyst position, the record shows that the individuals occupying that position acquired their knowledge through "intellectual instruction," as opposed to "training in the performance of routine mental, manual, mechanical, or physical activities."[77] In this regard, the testifying senior congressional analyst stated that her bachelor's degree in political science provided her with the necessary knowledge to fulfill that position's duties--such as developing and implementing the Agency's legislative priorities and strategies and analyzing legislation that may impact the Agency. Therefore, we also find that the senior-congressional-analyst position satisfies the knowledge requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[77]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(15)(A)(i) ("knowledge of an advanced type" is "distinguished from knowledge acquired...[through] training in the performance of routine mental, manual, mechanical, or physical activities").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we have found that the positions of business development specialist, business initiatives specialist, senior business development specialist, broker relations specialist, and senior congressional analyst satisfy the judgment and knowledge requirements, and the parties do not dispute that these positions satisfy the other two professional-employee criteria, we conclude that these positions are "professional" under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(15)(A). Accordingly, we direct the RD to exclude them from the unit.[80]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[80]&#x2003;Member Abbott observes that his dissenting colleague again calls for unceasing obedience to precedent that was neither clear nor contrary to our decision today. This call sounds more shopworn by the day. <span class="Italic">See U.S. DHS, U.S. CBP</span>, 71 FLRA 119, 120 (2019) (Member <span id="page_140"></span>DuBester dissenting); <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 71 FLRA 205, 206 n.10 (2019) (Member Abbott concurring, Member DuBester dissenting); <span class="Italic">U.S. HUD</span>, 70 FLRA 605, 607 n.29 (2018) (Footnote by Member Abbott) (Member DuBester dissenting). What remains thoroughly unclear is the level of deference that is owed by this Authority to its own Regional Directors. Is it as high as the deference our dissenting colleague demands for the decisions of arbitrators and greater than what he is willing to give to our own Administrative Law Judges? <span class="Italic">See U.S. Small Bus. Admin</span>., 70 FLRA 885, 887 n.18 (2018) (Footnote by Member Abbott) (Member DuBester dissenting); <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Fed. BOP, Fed. Med. Ctr. Carswell, Fort Worth, Tex.,</span> 70 FLRA 890, 892 n.20 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting). We provide no guidance to the parties or to the Authority's own RD's when we leave them in the dark. In my view, therefore, it is high time that we resolve what level of deference is appropriate to extend to arbitrators, regional directors, and our administrative law judges but also what level of review--substantial, preponderant, or <span class="Italic">de novo</span>--should be applied under each scenarios.</p>
