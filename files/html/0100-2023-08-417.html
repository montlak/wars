<p class="Body-Text">The Board's procedure for review OPM rules and regulations (and agency implementation of those rules) is defined by 5 USC 1204 [formerly 5 USC 1205], providing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;The Merit Systems Protection Board shall--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)&#x2003;review, as provided in subsection (f), rules and regulations of the Office of Personnel Management.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)(1) At any time after the effective date of any rule or regulation issued by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management in carrying out functions under section 1103 [providing OPM authority to issue rules and regulations], the Board shall review any provision of such rule or regulation--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; on its own motion;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; on the granting by the Board, in its sole discretion, of any petition for such review filed with the Board by any interested person, after consideration of the petition by the Board; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003; on the filing of a written complaint by the Special Counsel requesting such review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;In reviewing any provision of any rule or regulation pursuant to this subsection, the Board shall declare such provision--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; invalid on its face, if the Board determines that such provision would, if implemented by any agency, on its face, require any employee to violate section 2302(b) [defining prohibited personnel practices] ; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; invalidly implemented by any agency, if the Board determines that such provision, as it has been implemented by the agency through any personnel action taken by the agency or through any policy adopted by the agency in conformity with such provision, has required any employee to violate section 2302(b) [prohibited personnel practice provisions] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;The Director of the Office of Personnel Management, and the head of any agency implementing any provision of any rule or regulation under review pursuant to this subsection, shall have the right to participate in such review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)&#x2003;The Board shall require any agency--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; to cease compliance with any provisions of any rule or regulation which the Board declares under this subsection to be invalid on its face; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; to correct any invalid implementation by the agency of any provision of any rule or regulation which the Board declares under this subsection to have been invalidly implemented by the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The procedures for regulation review and implementation review cases are at 5 CFR Part 1203 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1203.1 <span class="Italic">Scope; application of part 1201, subpart B</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">General.</span> This part applies to the Board's review, under 5 U.S.C. 1204(a)(4) and 1204(f), of any rules or regulations ("regulations") issued by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). It applies to the Board's review of the way in which an agency implements regulations, as well as to its review of the validity of the regulations on their face.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Application of 5 CFR part 1201, subparts B and C.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Where appropriate, and unless the Board's regulations provide otherwise, the Board may apply the provisions of 5 CFR part 1201, subpart B to proceedings conducted under this part. It may do so on its own motion or on the motion of a party to these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The following provisions of 5 CFR part 1201, subparts B and C do not apply to proceedings conducted under this part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;Sections 1201.21 through 1201.27 which concern petitions for appeal of agency actions, and the pleadings that are filed in connection with those petitions; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;Sections 1201.111 through 1201.119 which concern final decisions of presiding officials, and petitions for Board review of those decisions.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;The Board, in its sole discretion, may grant or deny an interested person's request for regulation review. It will grant a request for regulation review that the Special Counsel submits. It will not, however, review a regulation before its effective date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;After considering the request for regulation review, the Board will issue an order granting or denying the request in whole or in part. Orders in which the Board grants the request, in whole or in part, will identify the agency or agencies involved, if any. They also will include the following:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(a) <span class="Italic">Place to file and number of copies.</span> One original and three copies of each pleading must be filed with the Office of the Clerk, U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, 1615 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20419. In addition, parties to a proceeding under this part must serve their pleadings on each other in accordance with &#x00A7; 1203.14 of this part. The Office of the Clerk will make all pleadings available for review by the public.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Time limits.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;A request for regulation review may be filed any time after the effective date of the regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;A response to a request for regulation review, whether the response supports or opposes the request, must be filed within the time period provided in the Board order granting the request for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;A reply to a response may be filed within 10 days after the response is filed. The reply may address only those matters raised in the response that were not addressed in the request for regulation review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Motions may be filed at any time during the regulation review. The filing of a motion will not delay the acting of the Board unless the Board orders a postponement. The Board may rule immediately on a motion for an extension of time or a continuance if circumstances make consideration of others' views regarding the motion impracticable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;Submissions opposing motions must be filed within five days after the opposing party receives the motion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Additional pleadings.</span> The Board will consider pleadings in addition to those mentioned above only if the Board requests them, or if it grants a request that it consider them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Method and date of filing.</span> An initial filing in a request for review of a regulation may be filed with the Office of the Clerk by mail, by commercial or personal delivery, or by facsimile. Pleadings, other than an initial request for a regulation review under this part, may be filed with the Office of the Clerk by mail, by commercial or personal delivery, by facsimile, or by e-filing in accordance with &#x00A7; 1201.14 of this chapter. If the document was submitted by certified mail, it is considered to have been filed on the mailing date. If it was submitted by regular mail, it is presumed to have been filed five days before the Office of the Clerk receives it, in the absence of evidence contradicting that presumption. If it was delivered personally, it is considered to have been filed on the date the Office of the Clerk receives it. If it was submitted by facsimile, the date of the facsimile is considered to be the filing date. If it was submitted by commercial delivery, the date of filing is the date it was delivered to the commercial delivery service. If it was submitted by e-filing, it is considered to have been filed on the date of electronic submission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Extensions of time.</span> The Board will grant a request for extension of time only when good cause is shown.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1203.14 <span class="Italic">Serving documents</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Parties.</span> In every case, the person requesting regulation review must serve a copy of the request on the Director of OPM. In addition, when the implementation of a regulation is being challenged, the requester must also serve a copy of the request on the head of the implementing agency. A copy of all other pleadings must be served, by the person submitting the pleading, on each other party to the proceeding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Method of serving documents.</span> Pleadings may be served on parties by mail, by personal delivery, by facsimile, or by commercial delivery. Service by mail is accomplished by mailing the pleading to each party or representative, at the party's or representative's last known address. Service by facsimile is accomplished by transmitting the pleading by facsimile to each party or representative. Service by personal delivery or by commercial delivery is accomplished by delivering the pleading to the business office or home of each party or representative and leaving it with the party or representative, or with a responsible person at that address. Regardless of the method of service, the party serving the document must submit to the Board, along with the pleading, a certificate of service as proof that the document was served on the other parties or their representatives. The certificate of service must list the names and addresses of the persons on whom the pleading was served, must state the date on which the pleading was served, must state the method (<span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> mail, personal delivery, facsimile, or commercial delivery) by which service was accomplished, and must be signed by the person responsible for accomplishing service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Electronic filing.</span> Other than the initial request for a regulation review, pleadings in a regulation review proceeding may be filed with the Board and served upon other parties by electronic filing, provided the requirements of &#x00A7; 1201.14 of this chapter are satisfied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1203.15 <span class="Italic">Review of regulations on the Board's own motion.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may, from time to time, review a regulation on its own motion under 5 U.S.C. 1204(f)(1)(A). When it does so, it will publish notice of the review in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1203.16 <span class="Italic">Proceedings</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has substantial discretion in conducting a regulation review under this part. It may conduct a review on the basis of the pleadings alone, or on the basis of the pleadings along with any or all of the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003; Additional written comments;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003; Oral argument;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c)&#x2003; Evidence presented at a hearing; and/or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(d)&#x2003; Evidence gathered through any other appropriate procedures that are conducted in accordance with law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Order of the Board</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1203.21 <span class="Italic">Final order of the Board</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Invalid regulation.</span> If the Board determines that a regulation is invalid on its face, in whole or in part, it will require any agency affected by the order to stop complying with the regulation, in whole or in part. In addition, it may order other remedial action that it finds necessary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Invalidly implemented regulation.</span> If the Board determines that a regulation has been implemented invalidly, in whole or in part, it will require affected agencies to terminate the invalid implementation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Corrective action.</span> The Board may order corrective action necessary to ensure compliance with its order. The action it may order includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Cancellation of any personnel action related to the prohibited personnel practice;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Rescission of any action related to the cancelled personnel action;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Removal of any reference, record, or document within an employee's official personnel folder that is related to the prohibited personnel practice;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Award of back pay and benefits;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;Award of attorney fees;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;Other remedial measures to reverse the effects of a prohibited personnel practice; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(7)&#x2003;The agency's submission of a verified report of its compliance with the Board's order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_810"></span>&#x00A7; 1203.22 <span class="Italic">Enforcement of order</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Any party may ask the Board to enforce a final order it has issued under this part. The request may be made by filing a petition for enforcement with the Office of the Clerk of the Board and by serving a copy of the petition on each party to the regulation review. The request may be filed in electronic form, provided the requirements of &#x00A7; 1201.14 are satisfied. The petition must include specific reasons why the petitioning party believes that there has been a failure to comply with the Board's order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;The Board will take all action necessary to determine whether there has been compliance with its final order. If it determines that there has been a failure to comply with the order, it will take actions necessary to obtain compliance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Where appropriate, the Board may initiate the enforcement procedures described in 5 CFR 1201.183(c).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Explanation of the regulation review and regulation implementation review process was provided in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. OPM &#x0026; DHS</span>, 110 MSPR 237, 240-41 &#x00B6; 7, 2008 MSPB 242 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has original jurisdiction to review rules and regulations promulgated by OPM. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(f). In exercising its jurisdiction, the Board is authorized to declare an OPM rule or regulation invalid on its face if the Board determines that such provision would, if implemented by any agency, on its face, require any employee to violate a prohibited personnel practice as defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(f)(2)(A). Similarly, the Board has the authority to determine that an OPM regulation has been invalidly implemented by an agency, if the Board determines that such provision, as it has been implemented by the agency through any personnel action taken by the agency or through any policy adopted by the agency in conformity with such provision, has required any employee to violate a prohibited personnel practice. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(f)(2)(B). <span class="Italic">See Prewitt v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 133 F.3d 885, 887 (Fed. Cir. 1998). We find that the petitioner's allegations fall within the latter category of the Board's regulation review jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The basis for a regulation review case and the degree of specificity of pleading required were described in <span class="Italic">Blanton v. OPM</span>, 105 MSPR 496, 498 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-4, 2007 MSPB 117 (2007), challenging OPM leave accrual regulations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has original jurisdiction to review rules and regulations issued by OPM. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(f)(1); <span class="Italic">Clark v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 95 F.3d 1139, 1141-42 (Fed. Cir. 1996). In exercising that jurisdiction, the Board has the "sole discretion" to grant a petition for regulation review. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(f)(1)(B). Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(f)(2), the Board shall declare a regulation invalid only if it determines that such regulation, on its face, or as implemented, would require an employee to commit a prohibited personnel practice, as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b). <span class="Italic">See Prewitt v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 133 F.3d 885, 887 (Fed. Cir. 1998). In light of the statute's mandatory language, the Board's regulations, at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1203.11(b)(iii)-(iv), make clear that the individual requesting review must specifically describe how the regulation would require an employee to commit a prohibited personnel practice in enforcing the regulation, and must specifically identify the prohibited personnel practice in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b) that would be violated by the regulation or its implementation. <span class="Italic">See Burnett v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 225, &#x00B6; 5 (2003). Thus, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(f) and 5 C.F.R. Part 1203 do not vest the Board with a general authority to review OPM regulations based merely on a bare allegation. <span class="Italic">See generally Hernandez v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 196, 198 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner's request that the Board review 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.306, based merely on his challenge to his agency's implementation of the regulation, does not state a sufficient ground for the Board to grant his request for regulation review. He does not specify or explain in any way how the agency's implementation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.306 requires an employee to commit a prohibited personnel practice, nor does he identify the prohibited personnel practice the agency committed. Because the petitioner has failed to meet the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1203.11(b), it would be inappropriate for the Board to conduct a regulation review in this case. <span class="Italic">See Nadybal v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 485, 489 &#x00B6; 8 (2002). Accordingly, we DENY the petitioner's request for review of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.306.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Garcia v. OPM</span>, 109 MSPR 266, 268-69 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7, 2008 MSPB 145 (2008) (regulation review request was denied when the petitioner did not explain in detail why the regulations, or their implementation, required the commission of a prohibited personnel practice and when the petitioner did not specifically identify the prohibited personnel practice that the regulation required to be committed); <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. OPM</span>, 94 MSPR 315, 318 &#x00B6; 6 (2003) ("Even with this liberal construction of the petitioner's allegations, it is not possible to discern the reasons why OPM's failure to implement section 250.102 <span class="Italic">requires</span> an employee to commit a prohibited personnel practice."), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. OPM</span>, 89 Fed. Appx. 699, 702 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP) ("At best, OPM's alleged lack of oversight <span class="Italic">permitted</span> employees to discriminate against him on the basis of his age. The appropriate forum for such claims is the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ('EEOC'), <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 631, 633a, not the Board"); <span class="Italic">Burnett v. OPM</span>, 93 MSPR 225, 229 &#x00B6; 7 (2003) ("Nothing in the petitioner's submissions to the Board alleges how complying with the OPM Guide to Processing Personnel Actions requires an employee of his employing agency (the Drug Enforcement Administration), or an employee of any other federal agency, to commit a prohibited personnel practice in violation of 5 USC &#x00A7; 23202(b).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Constitutional challenges are not embraced by regulation review, <span class="Italic">Asatov v. OPM</span>, CB-1205-16-0021-U-1 (NP 9/27/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first regulation the petitioner has identified is 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.703, a regulation in 5 C.F.R. part 300, subpart G, "Statutory Bar to Appointment of Persons Who Fail To Register Under Selective Service Law." The petitioner claims that this regulation is invalid on its face because it conflicts with the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. As a threshold matter, the Board's regulation review authority does not include constitutional challenges; it is limited to whether a challenged regulation would require an employee to violate 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(f)(2). To the extent that the petitioner is claiming that the regulation causes a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(2), which protects the constitutional rights of an employee or applicant and is incorporated by reference in section 2302(b)(12), the claim is denied for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Regulation review exists for rules and regulations. The Board process is not available for the failure of OPM to issue a regulation, as in <span class="Italic">Roesel v. OPM</span>, 119 MSPR 15, 17-18 &#x00B6; 8, 2012 MSPB 119 (2012), involving a provision in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA) concerning the timeliness of security clearance reviews:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner's challenge is based on language in an OPM manual, "End-To-End Hiring Initiative," that provides guidance to assist agency officials in carrying out their hiring responsibilities. The hiring manual does not appear to be a rule or regulation within the meaning of section 1204(f) since its provisions do not directly implement and interpret statutory provisions. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Kligman</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 614, &#x00B6; 14 (Delegated Examining Operations Handbook found not to be a rule for purposes of section 1204(f)). In any event, the petitioner does not challenge the language on page 43 of the manual that he cites.[*] Instead, he challenges OPM's failure to promulgate a regulation giving specific content to the statutory language requiring clearance investigations taking more than 60 days to be completed "without delay." However, there is nothing in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(f) that gives the Board authority to require OPM to issue a rule or regulation to implement a statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003; A challenge to this language restating the standard set out in 50 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 435b(g)(2)(A) would not be within the Board's section 1204(f) jurisdiction, which does not extend to review of a regulation to the extent it merely incorporates statutory language. <span class="Italic">See Thoms,</span> 103 M.S.P.R<span class="Italic">.</span> 652, &#x00B6; 5.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For an analysis of the right to judicial review (now lodged in the Federal Circuit) of MSPB decisions reviewing challenges to OPM regulations, refer to <span class="Italic">NTEU v. MSPB</span>, 743 F.2d 895 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (also determining that unions have standing to obtain judicial review of those decisions). The Federal Circuit may review a Board decision on the merits of a litigant's challenge to an OPM rule or regulation. <span class="Italic">Clark v. OPM</span>, 95 F.3d 1139, 1143 (Fed. Cir. 1996)<span class="Italic">. Clark</span> was distinguished and explained by <span class="Italic">Delos Santos v. OPM</span>, 289 F.3d 1382, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2002), concluding that the determination of whether to grant regulation review is within the sole discretion of the Board. It is only when the Board decides the merits of a petition that the court has jurisdiction to consider the Board's decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Paderes v. OPM</span>, 237 Fed. Appx. 618 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP) (court lacks jurisdiction over a petition for review of a Board decision involving a request for review of a regulation if the Board denies review without addressing the merits of the request, as occurred in <span class="Italic">Paderes</span> on the basis of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>); <span class="Italic">Frederick v. OPM,</span> 186 Fed. Appx. 988, 989 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">The regulation review procedure is limited in practice. Under 5 USC 1204(a)(4) and 1204(f), the Board has jurisdiction to review the validity of OPM rules and regulations. That review is confined to a determination of whether a regulation is invalid because it requires the commission of a prohibited personnel practice, an assertion to be proved by the party seeking review. <span class="Italic">Thompson v. OPM</span>, 87 MSPR 184, 187 n.1 (2000). "The Board may, in its discretion, review a regulation promulgated by OPM and the manner in which it is implemented in order to determine whether the regulation requires the commission of a prohibited personnel practice as defined in 5 USC 2302(b)." <span class="Italic">Blount v. OPM</span>, 87 MSPR 87, 90 &#x00B6; 3 (2000). Under <span class="Italic">Blount</span>, if the argument is that the OPM regulation violates a law, rule, or regulation implementing a merit system principle, that is, a violation of 5 USC 2302(b)(12), the petitioner must specify the law, rule, or regulation violated by the OPM regulation, identify the merit system principle at issue, and explain how the law, rule, or regulation arguably violates, implements, or directly concerns the merit system principle. When the Board construes the meaning of "rule," it may include provisions of the OPM's [prior] FPM. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brooks v. OPM</span>, 59 MSPR 207, 210 n.4 (1993) (provisions <span id="Page_811"></span>of the FPM "in question" are rules for purposes of 5 USC 1204(f)); <span class="Italic">Pollard v.

<p class="Body-Text">If the OPM regulation does no more than restate the requirements of a statute, the Board will not entertain a challenge to the regulation.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board's disinclination to review provisions of the late Federal Personnel Manual that restated statutory provisions was explained in <span class="Italic">Pavlopoulos v. OPM and Dept. of Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 620, 623-26 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Board's regulations governing requests for review of OPM rules and regulations, the petitioner must: identify the relevant OPM rule or regulation; specify the prohibited personnel practice at issue; and submit a detailed statement describing the reasons why the agency's implementation of OPM's rule or regulation requires an employee to commit the alleged prohibited personnel practice. 5 CFR 1203.11(b)(1). Further, if the petitioner claims, as he does here, that 5 USC 2302(b)(11) [now 2302(b)(12)] was the prohibited personnel practice that was committed, he must: identify the merit system principle at issue; the law or regulation that has been violated; and explain the way the law or regulation implements or directly concerns the identified merit principle. 5 CFR 1203.11(b)(2). In this case, petitioner claims that the agency has invalidly implemented the Federal Personnel Manual, Chapter 511, Subchapter 1-1(a). That provision states, in pertinent part, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This [General Schedule classification] system is based on two fundamental principles:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;That there be substantially equal pay for substantially equal work, and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;That variations in pay should be in proportion to substantial differences in the difficulty, responsibility and qualifications required.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner contends that the agency has improperly implemented this provision by establishing quotas for non-competitive promotions and by improperly using classification standards to enforce the alleged quota system. He further contends that this alleged quota system requires employees to violate 5 USC 2302(b)(11) [now 2302(b)(12)] because it causes them to deny promotions to qualified individuals and that, in turn, violates the merit system principles set forth in 5 USC 2301(b)(1) and (3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although neither the Navy nor OPM has raised the issue of whether this FPM provision is a "rule," it is appropriate to address this threshold question because the Board's authority in 5 USC 1204(f)(2)(B) is limited to review of an agency's implementation of OPM rules or regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has previously found that FPM provisions which meet the definition of "rule" in 5 USC 551(4) are rules for the purpose of the Board's exercise of its review authority in section 1204(f). <span class="Italic">Pollard v. OPM</span>, 52 MSPR 566, 569 n.1 (1992). We find that the FPM provision cited above does not meet the definition of a rule under section 551(4) because it merely repeats, almost verbatim, the language contained in a statute, 5 USC 5101(1). Section 551(4) of title 5, which was enacted as part of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), states that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"rule" means the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Agency rulemaking is considered a quasi-legislative function "intended to add substance to the Acts of Congress, to complete absent but necessary details, and to resolve unexpected problems." J. Stein, G. Mitchell, B. Mezines, 3 <span class="Italic">Administrative Law</span>, 14.01, at 14-2 (1992) (citations omitted).... Here, the FPM provision at issue does not reflect OPM's interpretation of the statute: it merely repeats the statutory language almost verbatim. Because Congress did not authorize the Board in section 1204(f) to review statutory provisions, the Board's review authority must be limited to OPM issuances that meet the APA definition of a rule, i.e., which add substance to the statute or fill in gaps.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming that this FPM provision is a rule for the purpose of review under 5 USC 1204(f), the record does not support the petitioner's contention that the agency's failure to promote him invalidly implemented this provision by requiring the Navy to violate 5 USC 2302(b)(11) [now 2302(b)(12)] . That statute makes it a prohibited personnel practice to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">take or fail to take any other personnel action if the taking of or failure to take such action violates any law, rule, or regulation implementing, or directly concerning, the merit systems principles contained in section 2301 of this title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The merit system principles were not intended to be self-executing. <span class="Italic">Wells v. Harris</span>, 1 MSPB 199, 1 MSPR 208, 215 &#x0026; n.11 (1979). To establish his claim that the agency's failure to promote him violated section 2302(b)(11) [now 2302(b)(12)], the petitioner must show that (1) the Navy violated FPM Chapter 511, subchapter 1-1(a); and (2) the violated FPM provision is one which "implements" or which "directly concerns" the merit system principles. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>., 1 MSPR at 215. For the reasons stated below, we find that the petitioner does not meet the first part of this test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of his position that the Navy's failure to promote him to a Level IV position violated FPM Chapter 511, subchapter 1-1(a), the petitioner contends that the Navy (1) utilized a quota system to limit non-competitive promotions to level IV positions, (2) used improper classification standards to limit promotions at this level by including supervisory criteria in nonsupervisory Level IV positions; and (3) failed to include an entry on performance appraisal forms where supervisors could certify that the employee's position description was current and accurate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner has not shown that the Navy engaged in the first two practices. More importantly, he has not shown that any of these practices violates FPM Chapter 511, subchapter 1-1(a). Although the documents submitted by the petitioner show that the Navy set goals for reducing the number of higher-graded positions, there is nothing that indicates these goals set an absolute limit on the number of Level IV positions. Even if that were the case, there is nothing in FPM Chapter 511 that suggests that such a limitation would violate that provision. The petitioner has not shown how the agency's alleged quota on higher-graded positions violates the two principles set forth in the cited FPM provision, i.e., equal pay for substantially equal work, and pay-setting in proportion to substantial differences in difficulty, responsibility and qualifications.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner's reliance on <span class="Italic">McDiarmid v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 19 MSPR 347 (1984), and 23 MSPR 420 (1984) is misplaced. In those cases, the Board considered an agency's implementation of the OPM regulation at 5 CFR 430.204(d) (1983), which explicitly prohibited any preestablished distributions of performance ratings for GM employees. The FPM provision at issue here is not at all similar to that regulation because it does not explicitly or implicitly prohibit an agency from imposing limits on the number of higher-graded positions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Determined not to be a rule for purposes of MSPB review authority was an opinion provided to the Federal Labor Relations Authority by OPM in response to FLRA's request for OPM's interpretation of an OPM regulation, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. OPM</span>, CB-1205-11-0017-U-1 (NP 1/8/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner requests that we review, pursuant to our authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(f), an advisory opinion issued by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) which was requested by the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) in the course of its adjudication of U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Ralph H. Johnson Medical Center, 60 F.L.R.A. 46 (2004). For the reasons discussed below, we hold that the OPM advisory opinion is not a "rule" for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(f) and therefore not within our review authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under section 1204(f), the Board has original jurisdiction to review "any rule or regulation issued by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management in carrying out functions under section 1103." The petitioner contends that the advisory opinion is a rule because it "interprets the legal effect of a rule," namely 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(1)(i). Therefore, according to the petitioner, it meets the definition of a "rule" under the Administrative <span id="Page_812"></span>Procedures Act (APA). The APA defines "rule" to mean, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "the whole or part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency...." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 551(4). The petitioner states that the APA definition is so broad that it includes "nearly every statement an Agency may make." RF, Tab 1 at 6 (quoting <span class="Italic">Chaney v. Heckler</span>, 718 F.2d 1174, 1186 (D.C. Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 470 U.S. 821 (1985)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's review authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(f) is not as far-reaching as the petitioner asserts. Generally, an OPM rule or regulation is one that was first published as a proposed rule in the Federal Register and subjected to notice and comment procedures. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1103(b). In some instances, the Board has held that an OPM issuance that meets the definition of a "rule" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 551(4) may be reviewable even if it was not subjected to notice and comment. <span class="Italic">See Pollard v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 566, 569 n.1 (1992) (finding that a provision of the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) is a rule for purposes of the Board's regulation review authority). The Board has emphasized, however, that such provisions are rules to the extent that they directly implement or interpret statutory provisions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Kligman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 614, &#x00B6; 14 (2006) (OPM's Delegated Examining Operations Handbook does not directly implement or interpret statutory provisions and therefore does not appear to be subject to the Board's regulation review authority); <span class="Italic">Brooks v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 207, 210 n.4 (1993) (The provisions of the FPM are rules for purposes of the Board's review authority because they directly implement and interpret statutory provisions). Here, the FLRA requested that OPM explain the effect of its regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(1)(i) on an arbitral remedy of a retroactive temporary promotion exceeding 120 days. <span class="Italic">See Veterans Affairs</span>, 60 F.L.R.A. at 47. OPM's advisory opinion interprets a regulation, but it does not purport to interpret or implement a statute. Therefore, it is not a "rule" within the Board's review authority. <span class="Italic">See Kligman</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 614, &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are further persuaded that the advisory opinion is not a "rule" because it was requested by the FLRA in the exercise of its adjudicatory functions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7105(i). OPM's advisory opinion was not binding on the FLRA. The advisory opinion had "general or particular applicability" only to the extent that the FLRA was persuaded by it and chose to apply it to the facts of the case before it. In that regard, we note that the FLRA's deference to OPM's interpretation of an OPM regulation is not the same as the FLRA being bound by the advisory opinion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, we hold that OPM's advisory opinion is not a "rule" for purposes of section 1204(f). Accordingly, the petitioner's request for regulation review is DENIED. This is the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board in this proceeding. Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations, section 1201.113(c) (5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.113(c).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A challenge should be to an OPM regulation, not to a regulation issued by its predecessor, the Civil Service Commission. <span class="Italic">Alver v. OPM</span>, 75 MSPR 465, 469 (1997) (seeking a review of the implementation of a 1957 CSC regulation). However, a covered or "issued" regulation "means published as an OPM regulation, regardless of whether the initial publication was made by the CSC." <span class="Italic">Fabros v. OPM</span>, 80 MSPR 575, 578 (1999) (rejecting the argument that Exec.
