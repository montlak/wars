<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-243"><span class="space">4.</span> Motion to Compel</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's regulations reflect an expectation that the parties will start and complete discovery with minimum intervention by the AJ. <span class="Italic">Alvarez v. USPS</span>, SF-0353-16-0102-I-1 (NP 9/9/2016). But discovery requests inevitably lead to objections, frivolous and otherwise, or failures to respond. To preserve a discovery issue, one must follow Board regulations to compel discovery when it is refused or ignored. The inquiring party may not initiate a discovery request, allow it to be ignored, and await the hearing to protest. Nor may a party fail to file a motion to compel discovery and then claim prejudice in a PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="italic">Beveridge v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SF-0752-17-0220-I-1 (NP 11/2/2022) ("because the appellant did not file a motion to compel below, he is precluded from raising discovery issues for the first time on review"); <span class="Italic">Tamburello v. USPS</span>, 45 MSPR 455, 469 (1990) (no basis to complain of inability to take depositions when no discovery motions were filed); <span class="Italic">O'Neil v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 12 MSPR 212, 216 (1982) ("Appellant's failure to make such a motion in a timely fashion precludes her now from arguing that the failure of the agency to respond to her interrogatories until after the hearing was adjudicatory error."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Christensen v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 681, 688 (1991) (appellant could not complain for the first time in a PFR that the AJ erroneously concluded in her prehearing memo that the agency complied with the discovery requested through the appellant's motion to compel). Just as the appellant may not ignore the necessity for a motion to compel, the AJ must rule on a motion to compel. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Russo v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 85 MSPR 12, 16 &#x00B6; 9 (1999).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 CFR 1201.74(a) (2022), motions for orders compelling discovery and motions to compel the appearance of nonparties in discovery are filed with the AJ. 5 CFR 1201.73 (2022) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Responses to discovery requests</span>. A party or nonparty must answer a discovery request within the time provided under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, either by furnishing to the requesting party the information requested or agreeing to make deponents available to testify within a reasonable time, or by stating an objection to the particular request and the reasons for the objection. Parties and nonparties may respond to discovery requests by electronic mail if authorized by the requesting party.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Motions to compel or issue a subpoena</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;If a party fails or refuses to respond in full to a discovery request, the requesting party may file a motion to compel discovery. If a nonparty fails or refuses to respond in full to a discovery request, the requesting party may file a motion for the issuance of a subpoena directed to the individual or entity from which the discovery is sought under the procedures described in 1201.81 of this part. The requesting party must serve a copy of the motion on the other party or nonparty. Before filing any motion to compel or issue a subpoena, the moving party shall discuss the anticipated motion with the opposing party or nonparty, and all those involved shall make a good faith effort to resolve the discovery dispute and narrow the areas of disagreement. The motion shall include:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;A copy of the original request and a statement showing that the information sought is discoverable under section 1201.72;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;A copy of the response to the request (including the objections to discovery) or, where appropriate, a statement that no response has been received, along with an affidavit or sworn statement under 28 U.S.C. 1746 supporting the statement (See appendix IV to part 1201); and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iii)&#x2003;A statement that the moving party has discussed or attempted to discuss the anticipated motion with the nonmoving party or nonparty and made a good faith effort to resolve the discovery dispute and narrow the areas of disagreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The party or nonparty from whom discovery was sought may respond to the motion to compel or the motion to issue a subpoena within the time limits stated in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Time limits</span>.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. McCarthy's primary contention is that the administrative judge abused his discretion in denying Mr. McCarthy's motions to compel. But according to the Commission, Mr. McCarthy's request failed to comply with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(e). That regulation states, in part, that "[before filing any motion to compel discovery, the moving party shall discuss the anticipated motion with the opposing party either in person or by telephone and the parties shall make a good faith effort to resolve the discovery dispute and narrow the areas of disagreement." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(e)(1). While Mr. McCarthy claims to have complied with this requirement, the Commission points out that Mr. McCarthy never meaningfully conferred before he filed the motion to compel and that his representatives simply demanded in a single email that the Commission withdraw all objections or he would file a motion to compel. After the administrative judge denied his motions to compel, Mr. McCarthy filed a motion for certification of an interlocutory appeal of the ruling, or in the alternative, for reconsideration. But Mr. McCarthy still failed to explain how he had complied with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(e).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">In practice, if there is a discovery dispute, the parties try to sort it out in advance; then, if a motion to compel must still be filed, the motion should state that there was an attempt to resolve the dispute and provide a brief summary of the resolution efforts. Another approach is to provide an advance copy of a motion to compel discovery to the other party, advise that party of the date the motion will be filed, and suggest that the other party offer a resolution that avoids the need for the motion or that reduces the scope of disputes encompassed by the motion. When the motion to compel is filed, there should be added a brief recitation of the resolution process that was attempted. On occasion the other party cannot be contacted in advance, or does not respond to a call requesting a conference. If that occurs, file the motion to compel on time, with an explanation of the effort to secure a conference with the other party or the reason that it was not possible to do so. Emails relating to resolution efforts may be attached to the motion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board expects the parties to sort out their differences, if possible, before filing a motion to compel. But the Board's rules provide no flexibility on the timing of a motion to compel. What if the party needing to produce discovery material needs additional time and asks the requesting party for an extension, or, as occurs, announces that it is producing documents on a "rolling" basis that will extend production indefinitely past the due date? Board regulations do not address informal adjustments, although parties in Board litigation often show flexibility that bends the rules. To avoid an AJ refusing to grant an otherwise justified motion to compel only because it was filed beyond the regulatory time following the other party's promise (and failure) to produce material, should a motion to extend the time for filing a motion to compel be filed when it is clear that the other side is attempting to provide the discovery responses but will not be able to do so within the time permitted by the discovery requests plus then ten days allowed for a motion to compel? That is a good, conservative approach. The Board did not address the situation directly, but suggested that if there is another critical date pending, for example, the closing of the record on the appeal, some protective action will be required, <span class="Italic">Stockton v. Dept. of Interior</span>, SF-0752-13-0434-I-1 (NP 7/18/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(d)(3), a motion for an order to compel discovery must be filed with the administrative judge within 10 days of the date of service of objections or, if no response is received, within 10 days after the time limit for a response has expired. The appellant served his request for discovery on the agency on May 30, 2013, and the agency's response was due on June 19, 2013. It is undisputed that the agency did not respond to the appellant's discovery requests or to a "reminder" that he sent to the agency via facsimile on June 19. On June 26, 2013, the administrative judge issued an order closing the record, which advised the parties that the record on jurisdiction would close on July 3, 2013, and that the parties' submissions must be received by that date. Thereafter, on June 27, 2013, the appellant sent a second facsimile to the agency stating that he still had not received a response to the discovery request or the reminder, but that he would "allow a few more days before filing a motion to compel." The appellant filed his motion to compel on July 5, 2013, after the close of the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends on review that he "made a good faith effort to work with the Agency by giving them more time to respond to the discovery requests" and that his "understanding of the process was that a 10-day period could be extended to give the Agency time to respond." However, we find, because the administrative judge established July 3, 2013, as the date for the close of the record on jurisdiction and the final date for receipt of submissions by the parties, it was unreasonable for the appellant not to seek an extension of time for discovery and instead to wait until after the close of the record to file his motion to compel, <span class="Italic">see Wagner</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. at 452; <span class="Italic">Radziewicz v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 692, 695-96 (1990); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(d)(4) (discovery must be completed within the time period designated by the judge or, if no such period is designated, no later than the prehearing or close of record conference). Therefore, we find that the administrative judge acted properly in denying the appellant's motion to compel discovery as untimely filed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Layton v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, SF-1221-14-0805-W-1 (NP 12/9/2015) ("The appellant could have requested an extension of the discovery deadlines pending a ruling on jurisdiction. He also could have requested additional time to attempt to resolve the discovery dispute from the administrative judge prior to the expiration of the deadline to file a motion to compel. He did neither. We find no abuse of discretion in the administrative judge enforcing the discovery time limits in the absence of a request for an extension by the appellant.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The vehicle for presenting a discovery dispute is a motion to compel discovery. This motion should be submitted to the AJ within 10 days of the date of service of objections to discovery or within 10 days of the expiration of the time limit for response if no response is received. 5 CFR 1201.73(d)(3) (2022). The motion should include copies and quotation of the discovery requests and responses, in addition to any argument in favor of compelling the discovery. <span class="Italic">McDaniel v. USPS</span>, 33 MSPR 647, 650 (1987). If no response was received to a discovery request, the moving party should accompany the motion with an affidavit or sworn statement, under 28 USC 1746, that the materials requested were not received. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bedynek-Stumm v. USDA</span>, 57 MSPR 176, 178-79 (1993); 5 CFR 1201.73(c)(1)(ii) (2022). The motion to compel discovery does not broaden the underlying discovery request. If the discovery request seeks the number of employees against whom actions have been taken, the AJ does not err by denying a motion to compel seeking the names of those employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Riley v. Dept. of Army</span>, 53 MSPR 683, 691 (1992). Under current practice, the motion describes the parties' efforts to resolve the dispute prior to the motion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The purpose of the motion to compel discovery is to acquaint the AJ with the nature of the discovery request and to persuade the AJ of the importance of the material sought through the request. Although there is no prescribed format for the motion, a simple method is to state the request or interrogatory, next state the response or objection, and then address the objection and explain the necessity for the request and the importance of what you expect to derive through the request. The explanation that you provide need not be tied to the record before the AJ (the appeal and the response to the appeal, and the attachments to both), but may include information outside the record. That explanation may include information you know (or reasonably suspect) that you gained from or apart from the litigation. Citations to Board decisions can be helpful; however, the narrative explanation of the scope and significance of your discovery request is important because it informs the AJ of why the requested information is relevant or may lead to discovery of relevant information.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Unless there is a motion to compel discovery, the Board is likely to conclude that a party did not preserve its right to discovery of arguably relevant material. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alvarez v. USPS</span>, SF-0353-16-0102-I-1 (NP 9/9/2016) ("[B]ecause the appellant did not file a motion to compel below, he is precluded from raising this discovery issue for the first time on review. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Szejner v.

<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant is to preserve and protect his right to discovery, he must make his requests in a timely fashion so that the timing of discovery fits within the deadlines set by the AJ (and regulations) for adjudication of the appeal. In <span class="Italic">Wagner v. EPA</span>, 54 MSPR 447, 453 (1992), the Board suggested it was unreasonable for the appellant to file discovery requests on June 10, call for responses on July 1, the same date set for completion of discovery, and then wait until after July 1 to file a motion to compel. The appellant should have sought an extension of time for discovery. An early case, <span class="Italic">Tinsley v. OPM</span>, 14 MSPR 639, 640 n.* (1983), suggested that a motion to compel may not be invoked against a nonparty, e.g., the Postal Service, from whom discovery was sought that could have aided the appellant in the appeal against the respondent, OPM. The Board's position in <span class="Italic">Tinsley</span> is poor policy, if it reflects a policy choice. The Board has plenary authority to enforce its orders; further, the Board appears to discourage the use of subpoenas (enforceable in district court through Board procedures) against federal agencies. An unfavorable ruling on a motion to compel should be met with a request for reconsideration and an objection to the outcome of that request if the discovery dispute is to be preserved for a PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Figueora v. DHS</span>, 119 MSPR 422, 2013 MSPB 33 (2013) (overruled on other grounds, <span class="italic">Singh v. USPS</span>, 2022 MSPB 15 (2022)).

<p class="Body-Text">Failure to closely follow regulations governing a motion to compel can result in the Board affirming an AJ's denial of a motion that probably should have been granted had it been procedurally correct. <span class="Italic">Worthington v. DOD</span>, 81 MSPR 532, 534 &#x00B6; 6 (1999), ascertained no prejudicial error by an AJ who denied a motion to compel that was filed by an appellant whose motion was premature (filed before the last date permitted for an agency response) and that was unaccompanied by a sworn statement that the agency failed to respond to the discovery request. The appeal was remanded for other reasons, however, and the Board noted that the appellant could refile his motion to compel upon remand. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Santana v. USPS,</span> SF-0752-14-0801-I-1 (NP 4/14/2015) ("However, the appellant failed to supply a copy of the agency's responses to his discovery requests, as required by the Board's regulation, only asserting that the responses were deficient. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.73(e)(1), 1201.74(a). Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.74(a), an administrative judge may deny a motion to compel discovery if a party fails to comply with the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(e)(1). The administrative judge did not abuse her discretion in denying the appellant's motion to compel the agency to provide extensive information concerning how the appellant's supervisor treated other employees, where, as here, the appellant failed to comply with the Board's regulations regarding discovery by not submitting the agency's responses to his discovery requests.<span class="Italic"> See</span> <span class="Italic">Lee v.

The AJ may set time limits for motions and the Board will not likely overturn an AJ's decision to deny motions to compel discovery that are not filed within those time limits. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cassel v. USDA</span>, 72 MSPR 542, 545 (1996) (recent retention of counsel did not excuse belated motions). But the Board also expects the AJ to be reasonable with <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellants.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues in his petition for review that the administrative judge erred in denying him discovery. The appellant requested documentation from the agency regarding selection actions for positions for which he had applied.

The appellant refiled his appeal on June 2, 2009, but did not advise the administrative judge until September 8, 2009, that he was still waiting for the agency to produce certain documents, documents which the agency asserted it had already provided. Construing the appellant's request as a motion to compel, the administrative judge denied it initially, and on reconsideration. The appellant had considerable time in which to try to resolve the discovery issue. To the extent that he was dissatisfied with the documents the agency provided, it was incumbent upon him to bring the matter to the administrative judge's attention in a timely manner. However, the appellant waited three months after refiling his appeal to co</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1mplain about the agency's response, and he at no time sought the imposition of sanctions. Having reviewed the matter, we find that the administrative judge did not abuse his discretion in handling the discovery matter. <span class="Italic">See Brasch v. Department of Transportation</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 145, &#x00B6; 17 (2006); <span class="Italic">Markland v.

<p class="Body-Text">Once a motion to compel discovery and a response are filed with the AJ (or, if no one was assigned, with the chief administrative judge), the procedure next followed is outlined at 5 CFR 1201.74 (2022), governing orders for discovery:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Motion for an order compelling discovery</span>. Motions for orders compelling discovery and motions for the appearance of nonparties must be filed with the judge in accordance with &#x00A7; 1201.73(c)(1) and (d)(3). An administrative judge may deny a motion to compel discovery if a party fails to comply with the requirements of 5 CFR 1201.73(c)(1) and (d)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Content of order</span>. Any order issued will include, where appropriate:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;A provision that the person to be deposed must be notified of the time and place of the deposition;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Any conditions or limits concerning the conduct or scope of the proceedings or the subject matter that may be necessary to prevent undue delay or to protect a party or other individual or entity from undue expense, embarrassment, or oppression;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Limits on the time for conducting depositions, answering written interrogatories, or producing documentary evidence; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Other restrictions upon the discovery process that the judge sets.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Noncompliance</span>. The judge may impose sanctions under &#x00A7; 1201.43 of this part for failure to comply with an order compelling discovery.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When the AJ orders document production, or <span class="Italic">in camera</span> submission of documents, the party producing the documents is to do so without obstruction or limitation of the process. If the AJ's order is objectionable, counsel should request reconsideration or certification of an interlocutory appeal. If the order is not complied with, sanctions may follow, as in <span class="Italic">Montgomery v. Dept. of Army</span>, 80 MSPR 435, 439-40 &#x00B6; 12 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even its submission to the AJ of this material reflected that the agency seriously misconstrued its obligations to comply with the Board's order. In its cover letter to the submission, the agency stated that "The records will not be reproduced or disseminated without additional written consent of The Inspector General" but then went on to advise that if any of the records were filed before the Board, they should be filed under seal, "with access restricted to the Board personnel and the parties and their legal representatives." The letter further stated that any materials not made a part of the Board record should be returned to the agency. This material, however, was not furnished to the AJ in response to a request. Instead, it was <span class="Italic">required</span> to be produced pursuant to a Board order. 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2). It was not up to the agency to place conditions on its compliance with a Board order. Likewise, the Board and its AJs are not subject to the agency's internal regulations. Thus, upon receipt of the material provided in response to his order, the AJ properly examined it <span class="Italic">in camera</span> and then furnished it to the appellant upon his determination that it was relevant and not privileged. Neither the Board's regulations nor the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to which we look for guidance, require that the AJ take any further action prior to dissemination.</p>
