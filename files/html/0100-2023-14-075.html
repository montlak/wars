<h4 class="h4" id="sec7-74"><span class="space">8.</span> Table of Penalties; Classification of Offense</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">There is no requirement that an agency use a standard table of offenses and penalties when taking an adverse action. <span class="Italic">Robb v. DOD</span>, 77 MSPR 130, 137 (1997); <span class="Italic">see Hunt v. DHHS</span>, 758 F.2d 608, 610 (Fed. Cir. 1985) ("Petitioner also argues that the agency here had no guidelines for penalties and no table of penalties. This is not disputed by the respondent. We have not been shown that this is a requirement of the law.... We do think that good administrative practice strongly suggests the wisdom of adopting a table of penalties as many agencies have done."). A table of penalties is but one factor to be considered in determining the appropriateness of a penalty. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Army</span>, 56 MSPR 583, 587 n.3 (1993); <span class="Italic">see Rosado v. DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 246 Fed. Appx. 682, 684 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP) ("The content of the agency's table of offenses and penalties clearly indicates that it is only a guide and was not meant to be binding on the agency. The description of offenses is incomplete and quite broad, and accompanied by a range of possible penalties."); <span class="Italic">Chatman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 73 MSPR 582, 587 (1997) ("[A]gency may deviate from the guidelines where the more severe penalty is appropriate[.] "); <span class="Italic">Facer v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 33 MSPR 243, 248-49 (1987) ("The table of penalties, however, is only one of the several guiding factors for determining the reasonableness of the penalty and must be considered in light of the other relevant factors."); <span class="Italic">Carson v. VA</span>, 29 MSPR 631, 634 (1986) (""the table of penalties is only one factor to be considered in determining the appropriateness of the penalty); <span class="Italic">Schoonover v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 16 MSPR 516, 519 (1983) (although the table of penalties set the length of a suspension for AWOL, the offense was aggravated because it occurred during a national strike of air traffic controllers); <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 9 MSPR 569, 575 (1982); <span class="Italic">Douglas v. VA</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 5 MSPR at 307 ("[A]gency tables of penalties should not be applied so inflexibly as to impair consideration of other factors relevant to the individual case.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are a couple of principal reasons for widespread use of penalty tables: they are convenient because they provide a shopping list of offenses that form convenient headings for charges in adverse action proposal letters; a well-constructed table of penalties provides a range of discipline for various types of offenses, providing some guidance to managers and supervisors as to a realistic appraisal of the severity of employee misconduct when it comes time to consider the initiation or imposition of discipline. Some agencies defeat the latter purpose by providing a range of discipline ranging from reprimand to removal for every listed offense.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There can be problems characterizing offenses. As to theft of about $99 worth of valves from the agency installation, the agency failed to establish that the penalty of removal for a major rather than minor theft was warranted under its table of penalties. For the latter classification of offense, the penalty for a first offense extended from a reprimand to a 10-day suspension. The penalty table established no objective test distinguishing major and minor thefts. The agency did not demonstrate that it put employees on notice that they would be removed for a first theft offense, regardless of value. The employee worked without incident from the time of his arrest to his removal almost 15 months later. Had the agency been particularly anxious about the employee, it could have placed him on indefinite suspension. The agency was required to adhere to its table of penalties or justify a deviation. Because the agency did not justify the application of the most severe offense category and the most severe penalty, it abused its discretion. The penalty was reduced to a 90-day suspension. <span class="Italic">Stead v. Dept. of Army</span>, 27 MSPR 630, 634-35 (1985) (citing <span class="Italic">Daub v. United States</span>, 292 F.2d 895 (Ct. Cl. 1981)). The agency maintains some discretion concerning the interpretation of its table of penalties. A termination will not be set aside because the employee's offense might be better classified in one section rather than another of the agency table of penalties. <span class="Italic">Helman v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-819).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When categories of offenses within a table of penalties overlap, the agency may decide the most applicable characterization of an offense, and its reasonable determination will receive deference from the Board, as in <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 95 MSPR 21, 29 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 13, 17 (2003), on remand from the Federal Circuit:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that where a governing statute is silent and the implementing regulations are ambiguous on the issue to be resolved, the implementing agency's interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to deference when it is reasonable and does not conflict with a governing statute, even if other interpretations are possible. <span class="Italic">See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc</span>., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984); <span class="Italic">Wassenaar v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 21 F.3d 1090, 1092 (Fed. Cir. 1994). In its decision in this case, the Federal Circuit agreed with the agency that paragraph 30 of the Guide was the proper penalty provision for the agency to apply. <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, 1 Fed. Appx. at 877. The court stated that "[a]n agency's interpretation of its disciplinary guidelines is entitled to deference," but that, because the record is unclear as to how the agency interprets paragraph 30(a), "it is not evident what interpretation we should be deferring to." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 878....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency's interpretation of its own regulation in this case is reasonable and entitled to deference. <span class="Italic">See United States v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We further note that an agency's table of penalties is only one factor to be considered in assessing the reasonableness of a penalty. <span class="Italic">Chatman v. Department of the Army,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 582, 587 (1997). This is especially true here, where the agency has described the table of penalties as a "Guide" that does not replace supervisory judgment or require specific penalties, but instead "provides a general framework within which supervisors may exercise sound judgment in dealing with particular circumstances...." <span class="Italic">[S]ee Farrell v. Department of the Interior,</span> 314 F.3d 584, 590-92 (Fed. Cir. 2002). As the administrative judge found, the Guide's provisions are not mandatory, and not all possible misconduct is delineated; thus, it was within the deciding official's discretion to apply the listed misconduct that most nearly resembled the circumstances in the appellant's case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Borrego v. DHS</span>, 296 Fed. Appx. 937 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP) (in an off-duty shoplifting offense involving a law enforcement officer, the agency could <span id="Page_2370"></span>rely on a penalty table provision, "conduct unbecoming" carrying a higher (removal) penalty, instead of a provision of the same table allowing a 14-day suspension for theft of a thing of value from another employee or a private citizen).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McGachey v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 394 Fed. Appx. 688, 692 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP), deferred to an agency's choice of classification of an offense within a penalty table:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. McGachey asserts that her removal constitutes an abuse of discretion because the agency's penalty guidelines suggest a much lower penalty for a second AWOL offense (cause action 4), a second failure to request leave (cause action 5), or a first unauthorized use of property offense (cause action 21a). However, the agency classified each charge as a "cause action 20," a category for which the guidelines suggest removal as the maximum penalty. We have some doubt as to whether Ms. McGachey's actions were properly classified as a "cause action 20," especially with respect to the misuse of government property charge. That category is for offenses such as "[I]nsubordinate defiance of authority, refusal to comply with proper orders, [or] wanton disregard of directives or insolence," and that language appears to describe scenarios more extreme than in this case. The employing agency is principally responsible for interpreting its own penalty guidelines, however, and we decline to override the agency's decision to interpret those guidelines to permit flexibility in the way the agency categorizes particular charges. Because the agency's application of its guidelines was not irrational, we cannot overturn the penalty chosen by the agency on the ground that it was based on a misapplication of those guidelines.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Tables of penalties may not always encompass specific types of conduct, particularly off-duty conduct, <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 229 F.3d 1356, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Cases involving off-duty misconduct often involve unusual facts that arise in a specific context, and the particular circumstances and context are often sufficiently distinctive that there are no closely analogous cases in which similar action has been taken. The fact that there may be no direct precedent for the action taken in a particular case does not, however, prohibit the agency from taking adverse action if it is consistent with general principles of federal employment law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The table of penalties is an advisory document, <span class="Italic">Farrell v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 314 F.3d 584, 590-94 (Fed. Cir. 2002):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant argues that paragraph 10 was the applicable portion of the Table. It covers: "Making false, malicious or highly irresponsible statements against supervisors, other employees, or subordinates." Its maximum penalty for a first offense is a 5-day suspension, and it contains no reference to Note 4. We agree with the appellant that paragraph 10 is the most relevant portion of the Table. Thus the Table itself does not prescribe the penalty that was imposed here. But that does not resolve the question of whether the departures from the Table are permissible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We accordingly must decide whether the Table of Penalties is binding on the Park Police. In <span class="Italic">Power v. United States</span>, Ct. Cl. 126, 531 F.2d 505 (1976), our predecessor court made clear that "[t]he first test for an invalid penalty is whether or not the sanction exceeds the range of permissible punishment specified by statute or regulation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 507. Here the parties agree that neither a statute nor an applicable regulation fixes the requisite punishment and that the Table was not promulgated as a formal regulation or as the result of notice and comment rulemaking.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an agency policy statement is intended to impose obligations or to limit the rights of members of the public, it is subject to the Administrative Procedure Act, and, with certain exceptions, must be published in the Federal Register as a regulation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 553(b)-(c) (2000). If it is not, it is invalid. <span class="Italic">See generally Nat'l Org. of Veterans' Advocates, Inc. v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs</span>, 260 F.3d 1365, 1374-75 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, however, we have a different situation. The issue is not whether the agency statement is binding on the public, but whether it is binding on the agency itself. The effect of such agency statements has been addressed frequently. The general consensus is that an agency statement, not issued as a formal regulation, binds the agency only if the agency intended the statement to be binding. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Vitarelli v. Seaton</span>, 359 U.S. 535, 539, 79 S. Ct. 968, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1012 (1959); <span class="Italic">Service v. Dulles</span>, 354 U.S. 363, 373-74, 377-82, 77 S. Ct. 1152, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1403 (1957)...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The primary consideration in determining the agency's intent is whether the text of the agency statement indicates that it was designed to be binding on the agency<span class="Italic">. Vitarelli</span>, 359 U.S. at 539, 79 S. Ct. 968; <span class="Italic">Service</span>, 354 U.S. at 373-74, 377-82, 77 S. Ct. 1152.... For example, in <span class="Italic">Service v. Dulles</span>, 354 U.S. 363, 77 S. Ct. 1152, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1403 (1957), a seminal case considering whether the Secretary of State could discharge an employee without following the procedures set forth in an unpublished manual, the Supreme Court held that the manual bound the Secretary in part because it "purported to set forth definitively the procedures and standards to be followed." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 376, 77 S. Ct. 1152. <span class="Italic">See also Vitarelli</span>, 359 U.S. at 539, 79 S. Ct. 968.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This methodology for determining whether an agency is bound by a previous statement is consistent with that taken in our previous cases. For example, in <span class="Italic">Hamlet v. United</span> States, 63 F.3d 1097 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 517 U.S. 1155, 116 S. Ct. 1542, 134 L. Ed. 2d 646 (1996), this court held that a statement in a federal personnel handbook, "regardless of whether [it] was published or promulgated under the standards set out in the APA...is a regulation entitled to the force and effect of law" only if, among other things, "the promulgating agency intended the provision to establish a binding rule." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1105.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This approach has also been specifically applied to penalty schedules. In <span class="Italic">Rapp</span>, the Tenth Circuit held that the Office of Thrift Supervision ("OTS") was free to depart from a penalty matrix it had published in the Federal Register and impose a harsher penalty because the "record established that the OTS never intended to bind itself to the matrix." 52 F.3d at 1522. In <span class="Italic">Daub v. United States</span>, 154 Ct. Cl. 434, 292 F.2d 895 (1961), our predecessor court considered a table of penalties which contained a preface that advised that it "will be used as a guide in imposing disciplinary action" and "may not successfully meet the demands of all situations," so that deciding officials must "use judgment in determining proper action for violations not covered." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 897. The court found that this advisory language made the table non-binding; it was "a guide to administrative officers, and not an immutable schedule." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the document is called a "Guide." For each offense, a range of penalties is given, sometimes without indication of how the penalty should be determined. It contains no mandatory language. The Table appears as Appendix A in a personnel manual applicable to the National Park Service as a whole, National Park Service Personnel Issuance Release No. 88: Discipline and Adverse Actions, Basic FPM, NPS FPM 752,1 (hereinafter "Manual"). The manual explains that the Table only</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">provides a general framework within which supervisors may exercise sound judgment in dealing with particular circumstances, although ordinarily the penalty selected will fall within the range provided by the guide. The guide does not replace supervisory judgment and, with the exception of misuse of a Government vehicle, does not require specific penalties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Manual at 36. Appendix A itself notes that a penalty "may vary from those contained in this guide.' <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 43. Moreover, a generally applicable portion of the manual instructs deciding officers to consider demotion "when misconduct by an individual in a supervisory position causes the individual's superior to lose confidence in his/her ability to supervise effectively," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 8, which belies Farrell's claim that the Table categorically excludes demotion for supervisors except when Note 4 applies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the Table is far from comprehensive. It does not cover the distribution of sexually explicit material such as "The Quest." It also does not prescribe penalties for the violation of the general orders that Park Police officers must follow, several of which Farrell violated in this case. Binding norms, by contrast, "so fill[ ] out the statutory scheme that upon application one need only determine whether a given case is within the rule's criteria." <span class="Italic">Prof'ls &#x0026; Patients for Customized</span> Care, 56 F.3d at 597 (quoting <span class="Italic">Ryder Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States</span>, 716 F.2d 1369, 1377 (11th Cir. 1983)). Like the scheme in <span class="Italic">Prof'ls &#x0026; Patients for Customized Care</span>, however, the Table is "broad, general, [and] elastic." 56 F.3d at 601. Rather than a binding norm, in this case "the table of penalties was intended to be a guide to administrative officers, and not an immutable schedule." <span class="Italic">Daub</span>, 292 F.2d at 897. The Park Police were not bound by the Table.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be sure, in <span class="Italic">Daub</span> our predecessor court considered departure from the Table of Penalties in holding that the particular penalty imposed in that case was so massively disproportionate to the offense as to be arbitrary and capricious, 292 F.2d at 897; but that was simply a recognition that compliance with an advisory (rather than binding) Table is one of many factors to be considered in judging whether a penalty is arbitrary or capricious, as subsequent cases recognize. <span class="Italic">Swentek v. United</span> States, 228 Ct. Cl. 468, 658 F.2d 791, 796 (1981); <span class="Italic">Power</span>, 531 F.2d at 507-08. Those factors were later summarized in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, which includes such a departure as one of twelve factors to be considered in determining "the appropriateness of a penalty." 5 M.S.P.R. at 306 ("(7) consistency of the penalty with any applicable agency table of penalties").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, there is no constitutional requirement that an agency provide advance notice of the possible range of penalties. Due process does not require that an agency post the specific penalties to which an employee could be subject for any particular violation. In <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of Navy</span>, 229 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2000), this court upheld the removal of a civilian employee who coordinated recreational services for the Marines for engaging in an adulterous affair with a Marine's spouse. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1363. Even though there had not been "formal notice" that the civilian employee could be subject to removal for such behavior, the employee's "common sense should have forewarned him." <span class="Italic">Id.; accord Mings v. Dep't of</span> Justice, 813 F.2d 384, 389 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (employee could be disciplined for conduct not specifically prohibited); <span class="Italic">Brown v.

United</span> States, 226 Ct. Cl. 199640 F.2d 1235, 1247 (Ct. Cl. 1981)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reaffirming the advisory, not mandatory, nature of a penalty table, and noting that an agency may consider the totality of multiple, distinct charges, <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 824 Fed. Appx. 1028 (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP), commented:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we address Jenkins's challenge that the Board erred in affirming the penalty of removal. Jenkins contends that the AJ made two errors in applying the relevant factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Admin</span>., 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305 (1981). First, Jenkins argues that the penalty of removal is improper because it lacks "consistency...with those imposed upon other employees for the same or similar offences." Appellant Br. 48 (quoting <span class="Italic">Williams v. Social Sec. Admin</span>., 586 F.3d 1365, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2009)). And second, Jenkins argues that the Board failed to consider whether she could be rehabilitated. We are unpersuaded by either argument.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of her argument that the penalty of removal is not consistent with others who have committed the same offenses, Jenkins points to the FAA Table of Disciplinary Offenses and Penalties, and to lists complied by Jenkins and by the Agency of allegedly comparable employees disciplined for making disparaging statements. Jenkins argues that the table only recommends reprimands or suspensions for a first offense of the misconduct with which she has been charged. And Jenkins contends that the Agency cannot point to any other employee who was removed for making offensive comments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Jenkins's argument is unavailing because the choice of penalty for an employee's misconduct is a matter largely committed to the discretion of the agency. <span class="Italic">See Quinton v. Dep't of Transp</span>., 808 F.2d 826, 829 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (citing <span class="Italic">Miguel v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 727 F.2d 1081, 1083 (Fed. Cir. 1984)). The FAA Table of Disciplinary Offenses and Penalties is provided as guidance rather than a mandate, <span class="Italic">see</span> J.A. 284-85, and, in any event, the table explicitly contemplates removal for a first offense of lack of candor. <span class="Italic">See</span> J.A. 215 (recommending that the penalty for a first offense of lack of candor be a 14-day suspension or removal). Additionally, as the Agency points out, Jenkins's arguments are predicated on separating her three offenses, which would effectively remove the Agency's discretion to impose a realistic penalty that accounts for her total misconduct. And, regarding Jenkins's arguments about comparable offenders, we are not able to second-guess the evidentiary and factual findings that led to the Board's determination that there were no comparable cases involving this type of prolonged and persistent egregious misconduct directed at the highest level of agency leadership by a person with such a high-level position as Jenkins.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The application of the table may be raised by the appellant or it may become an issue in the adjudication because the agency relies upon it. The Board considers a table of penalties when the agency includes the table in its submissions to the Board and when the deciding official testifies that the penalty imposed is in compliance with that table. <span class="Italic">Parker v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 343, 348 (1991); <span class="Italic">see Wusstig v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 49 MSPR 335, 340 (1991) (noting that a table of penalties should be submitted to the AJ during the appeal, not for the first time with a PFR without a showing that it is "new" evidence).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A penalty table has weight in Board adjudication. If an agency's table of penalties says that managers should not exceed the range of discipline stated except in unusual circumstances, the agency will be held to the regulation; unusual circumstances should be demonstrated to justify departure from the table. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 32 MSPR 347, 349 (1987) (deviation from penalty table: "if the agency cannot establish that a more severe penalty is within the bounds of reasonableness, it has abused its discretion"); <span class="Italic">see Harris v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 15 MSPR 464, 467 (1983) ("unusual circumstances have not been shown"). If the agency miscalculates the number of past disciplinary offenses, the Board may reevaluate the penalty to determine the proper penalty had the miscalculation not occurred. <span class="Italic">See Winston v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 49 MSPR 96, 101-02 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming that a penalty table describes the charged conduct, an agency should explain significant deviations from the table, <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 32 MSPR 347, 349 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Nevertheless, where the agency has a table of penalties, as in this case, it must adhere to the guidelines in the table unless it can show that a deviation from the suggested penalty is justified by the circumstances of the case. If the agency cannot establish that a more severe penalty is within the bounds of reasonableness, it has abused its discretion. <span class="Italic">See Stead v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant reasserts on review that the removal penalty exceeds the maximum penalty provided for under the agency's table of penalties for the sustained misconduct and, further, that it constitutes a disparate penalty in that it exceeds the penalties imposed on two other employees who were also found to have committed the same or similar misconduct. The Board has found that an agency's table of penalties is only one factor to be considered in assessing the reasonableness of a penalty. <span class="Italic">See Phillips v.

The appellant did not present any evidence below or on review establishing that the agency's table of penalties is mandatory and binding and not simply advisory, nor has he even made such an assertion. The deciding official testified that the agency's table of penalties is merely a guide and is not mandatory. Thus, we do not find the removal penalty to be unreasonable based solely on the fact that it exceeds the maximum penalty under the agency's table of penalties for the first instance of misconduct committed by the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Cosen v. Dept. of Army</span>, 264 Fed. Appx. 897, 900 (Fed.

The agency's table of penalties in this case specifically states that it is only a suggested guide.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the table of penalties provides for a range from reprimand to removal for an offense that may be relatively inconsequential, the penalty table may be given little weight by the Board. <span class="Italic">See Woodford v. Dept. of Army</span>, 75 MSPR 350, 358 (1997) ("[w]hen the penalty range is that broad, the deciding official's consideration and selection of a penalty within that range offers little support for concluding that removal is reasonable."), <span class="Italic">followed in Devall v.

That the penalty table does not precisely categorize the appellant's offenses will not cause the Board to disturb an otherwise appropriate penalty. <span class="Italic">See Dolezal v. Dept. of Army</span>, 58 MSPR 64, 69 (1993) ("[t]his was unique misconduct and, although there simply is no specific provision for it in the agency's table of penalties, that does not mean that the agency is prohibited from crafting an appropriate penalty to fit the misconduct, provided that the penalty is reasonable.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Penalty tables frequently describe ranges of punishment for many different offenses; for each offense, the ranges are usually stated for the first, second, and third offenses. The defense has been raised more than once that for a given offense, e.g., absence without leave, a first offense can carry no more than the penalty established by the table (perhaps a two-day suspension), despite a past record of other offenses (as, for example, loafing on the job and insubordination). The agency would argue to the contrary: the penalty for an AWOL charge can exceed the first offense category because of past unrelated offenses. A reviewing court determined in <span class="Italic">Villela v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 727 F.2d 1574, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1984), that the agency position was correct: an agency need not treat as a first offense under a penalty table a given instance of misconduct if there were other, past, unrelated offenses:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Villela's approach would restrict an agency to the first offense column, no matter how many other unrelated offenses the employee had committed. Absurdly, that view would allow each employee to commit <span id="Page_2372"></span>each of the regulation's many enumerated forms of misconduct at least once without ever facing the threat of removal.</p>

DODDS</span>, 5 MSPR 529, 530, 5 MSPB 519 (1981) (rejecting argument that only identical offenses could be considered cumulatively: table of penalties, by its terms, was suggestive only; "offenses cited...constituted a course of conduct which justified the penalty imposed by the agency"); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Lemons v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 12 MSPR 239, 243 (1982) ("Although the agency's penalty guide sets forth a separate category for the former action, guide category 5, the conduct is so related to guide category 4 to constitute an additional offense under the latter category."). <span class="Italic">But see Skates v. Dept. of Army</span>, 66 MSPR 135, 137 (1995) (majority opinion of the Board was joined by a dissent from Chairman Erdreich, who argued that a dissimilar offense five years earlier significantly diminished the weight of that prior discipline in the calculus of a proper penalty determination), <span class="Italic">vacated and remanded</span>, 60 F.3d 843 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, 69 MSPR 366, 368-70 (1996).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board similarly explained in <span class="Italic">Cobb v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 57 MSPR 47, 52 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the applicable item in the table of penalties was not Item 20 entitled "[I]nsubordinate defiance of authority, refusal to comply with proper orders, wanton disregard of directives or insolence," but Item 21a entitled "[l]oss of, damage to, unauthorized use or destruction of property (including motor vehicles and aircraft), records or information." He then found that, for a second offense under Item 21a, the recommended penalty was a reprimand to a 5-day suspension and that, therefore, the penalty of removal was inconsistent with the agency's table of penalties. Although we agree with the administrative judge that Item 21a is more appropriate for the charge of misuse of government property, we nevertheless find, as discussed below, that the penalty of removal is consistent with the table of penalties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the agency points out on review, instructions accompanying its table of penalties state that, in determining "which offense column of the [penalty] guide to use, it is not necessary to establish that prior offenses under consideration were of the same character as the current offense." Although the appellant was previously disciplined only once for the same type of offense (misuse of government resources), she was previously disciplined a total of three times. Thus, the agency correctly considered her current offense as her fourth under the table of penalties. <span class="Italic">See Parker</span>, 50 MSPR at 348. The table prescribes a penalty of a reprimand to removal for a third (or subsequent) offense under Item 21a. Therefore, the penalty of removal is consistent with the agency's table of penalties.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The table itself may establish a scheme for counting and characterizing dissimilar offenses, an approach accepted in <span class="Italic">Parker v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 343, 348 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...concluding that the maximum penalty for the appellant's offenses under the agency's table of penalties was a 10-day suspension, the administrative judge considered the charge of sleeping on the job as a first offense, but the charge of leaving the job without permission as a second offense. The agency points out that the instructions accompanying its table of penalties state that "[o]ffenses are counted as first, second, and third if they occur within a prescribed time frame. However, the time frames depend on the type of penalty for the previous offense(s) and not the type of offense itself. The instructions further state that the "time frames apply to any subsequent offense and are not limited to offenses of the same type as the previous offense."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these guidelines, both of the appellant's current offenses were properly classified as second offenses, following his prior discipline for being away from his job without permission and using insulting, abusive language to his supervisor. The penalty for second-offense sleeping on duty ranges from a five-day suspension to removal. The penalty for a second offense of leaving the job without permission is a five to ten-day suspension. The administrative judge thus erred in finding that removal exceeded the maximum penalty prescribed in the agency table.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may examine provisions of a penalty table for different types of offenses and strike what amounts to a balance to determine what might be reasonable for a combination of offenses, <span class="Italic">Little v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 112 MSPR 224, 236 &#x00B6; 31, 2009 MSPB 175 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, Mr. Miller indicated that he relied on the agency's table of penalties. We note that the penalty for a first offense of unauthorized absence without leave from the work site during duty hours, like the AWOL charge, ranges from a reprimand to a 5-day suspension, and the penalty for a first offense of "[p]roviding/making false, misleading, untruthful statements...in connection with any official inquiry, investigation, etc.," like the lack of candor charge, ranges from a 10-day suspension to removal. Although the table of penalties did not identify an offense similar to the charge of conduct unbecoming a manager, the demotion penalty falls within the given range for the two other sustained charges taken together.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency must do more than pay lip service to its table of penalties. It could not, for example, claim as to a three-tiered offense that a warning in a suspension notice, stating that "another infraction may result in more severe disciplinary action up to and including removal," warranted removal when the agency's penalty table suggested a less severe penalty for a second offense. <span class="Italic">Basquez v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 48 MSPR 215, 219 (1991) (attendance-related offenses). <span class="Italic">McLeod v. Dept. of Army</span>, 714 F.2d 918 (9th Cir. 1983), directed the Board to reevaluate a penalty of removal for a warehouse worker's off-duty use of marijuana. The agency table of penalties did not classify the offense, and the closest offense the court could locate was a one- to three-day suspension for drinking intoxicants on duty where safety of personnel or property is endangered. The court considered the two offenses similar because both result in unsafe operation of heavy machinery.</p>
