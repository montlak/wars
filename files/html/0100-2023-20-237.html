<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-229"><span class="space">2.</span> Initial Stay</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Explanation of the effect of the 1989 WPA on stay procedures was provided in the Board's 1989 <span class="Italic">Annual Report</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The procedures for the Special Counsel to obtain a stay of a personnel action from the Board are amended by the Act. The 3-stage procedure established by the CSRA is replaced by a 2-stage procedure. Any member of the Board may grant a Special Counsel stay request for 45 days. If the request is not denied within three calendar days, it is automatically granted by operation of the law. The full Board may extend the stay for any period it considers appropriate, after first allowing the agency to comment on any proposed extension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Spalding v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, CB-1208-22-0016-U-1 (NP 7/28/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1)(A)(i), OSC "may request any member of the Merit Systems Protection Board to order a stay of any personnel action for 45 days if [OSC] determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the personnel action was taken, or is to be taken, as a result of a prohibited personnel practice." Such a request "shall" be granted "unless the [Board] member determines that, under the facts and circumstances involved, such a stay would not be appropriate." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1)(A)(ii). OSC's stay request need only fall within the range of rationality to be granted, and the facts must be reviewed in the light most favorable to a finding of reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice was (or will be) committed. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel ex rel. Aran v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 6, &#x00B6; 9 (2010). Deference is given to OSC's initial determination, and a stay will be denied only when the asserted facts and circumstances appear to make the stay request inherently unreasonable. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 229, 231 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Stays are granted as to covered personnel actions, including placement of an appellant on administrative leave for disciplinary reasons. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. IRS</span>, 65 MSPR 146 (1994). OSC's determination concerning the existence of reasonable grounds for granting the stay is given deference. As long as OSC presents the "essential facts" supporting the initial stay request, the request will be granted unless the circumstances demonstrate the request is so intrinsically or inherently irrational as to be arbitrary or capricious. <span class="Italic">Wells v. Califano</span>, 1 MSPR 76, 1 MSPB 73 (1979); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. DHS</span>, 115 MSPR 6, 9 &#x00B6; 9, 2010 MSPB 182 (2010) ("OSC's stay request need merely fall within the 'range of rationality' to be granted, <span class="Italic">In re Kass,</span> 2 M.S.P.R. 79, 96 (1980) (interpreting the predecessor provision to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1208), and the facts must be reviewed in the light which is most favorable to a finding of reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice was (or will be) committed. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Department of Transportation,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. 552, 555 (1993)."); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. VA</span>, 45 MSPR 403, 405 (1990) (stay will be denied only when the asserted facts and circumstances appear to make the stay request inherently unreasonable; to provide the Special Counsel the opportunity to complete an investigation, the stay can be granted on the basis of relatively little information). [Refer to "<a href="0100-2023-20-133.html#sec13-129">Covered and Excluded Personnel Actions</a>" earlier in this chapter.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board explained the purpose of the initial stay in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Peace Corps</span>, 31 MSPR 225, 228 (1986), interpreting earlier law:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This analytical framework was developed to provide interim relief while the Special Counsel proceeds with an investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding an alleged prohibited personnel practice and, as the investigation proceeds, requires the Special Counsel to meet an ever increasing evidentiary burden at various stages of the stay process to show that a prohibited personnel practice has been committed. Accordingly, great deference shown the Special Counsel at the initial stages of the stay process in establishing the factual foundation for a prohibited personnel practice is consistent with this framework and the legislative history concerning the stay provisions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even the low burden of proof required for an initial stay application is not met if OSC fails to provide some factual information demonstrating a connection between the pending personnel action and protected activity. <span class="Italic">In re Dept. of State, Passport Office</span>, 1 MSPR 158 (1979). For examples of stays granted on the basis of allegations that reprisal in the form of reassignment closely followed protected disclosures, refer to <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. DEA</span>, 45 MSPR 368, 370-71 (1990), and <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 70 MSPR 578, 579-80 (1996) (staying reassignments).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The 1989 WPA provides for initial stays of 45 days. 5 USC 1214(b). The Act does not require the Board to consider a response from the agency unless OSC seeks an extension of an existing 45-day stay. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 59 MSPR 556 (1993). The standard of proof for the stay under the old and newer legislation is the same, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. FEMA</span>, 43 MSPR 527, 529-30 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The previous statute governing initial stays stated that such a stay shall be granted by a Board member unless, given the attendant facts and circumstances, "such a stay would not be appropriate." 5 USC 1208(a)(2). The Board has noted additionally, that because the initial stay is designed to provide the Special Counsel with time to complete an investigation, it "can be granted on the basis of relatively little information." <span class="Italic">In re Kass</span>, 2 MSPR 79, 85 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The present statute is virtually identical to its predecessor. As the Special Counsel noted in her request, the legislative history of the WPA indicates that Congress believed that the stay process had been utilized "far too sparingly." <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 100-413 at 20, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. (1988). The replacement of the provision for a 15-day stay followed by a 30-day stay with the provision for a 45-day stay was intended "[t]o make stays somewhat easier to obtain." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We believe, that given such legislative intent, and the plain language of the statute, the standard for granting an initial stay should remain the same.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The burden OSC must meet to obtain an stay on an initial application that is considered without regard to factual disputes raised by the agency was described in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Stephenson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, CB-1208-17-0016-U-1(NP 4/13/2017):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), OSC must demonstrate that: (1) the employee made a protected disclosure; (2) the official(s) who recommended, took, or threatened the personnel action had actual or constructive knowledge of the protected disclosure; (3) a personnel action was taken or not taken, or threatened to be taken or not taken; and (4) the protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the challenged personnel action. <span class="Italic">Office of Special Counsel ex rel. Hopkins v. Department of Transportation</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 154, &#x00B6; 4 (2001). Regarding the first element, a disclosure is protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) if the individual has a reasonable belief that the information being disclosed evidences any violation of law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. <span class="Italic">Bradley v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 547, &#x00B6; 7 (2016).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The burden on OSC is not heavy. The stay can be granted on the basis of little information. The facts and circumstances alleged by OSC must be considered <span id="Page_4056"></span>in the light most favorable to a finding of reasonable grounds to believe that the personnel action is the result of a prohibited personnel practice. The stay proceeding is not intended to be a substitute for a complete hearing on the merits. <span class="Italic">Acting Special Counsel v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 93 MSPR 409, 412-13 &#x00B6; 11 (2003). A Board member granting a stay application observed in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. StephensonPino v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 96 MSPR 311, 316 &#x00B6; 19 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I also note that OSC alleges that the agency's actions constitute retaliation for Ms. StephensonPino's whistleblowing under section 2302(b)(8). As noted above, OSC has provided no evidence, and only the barest of allegations, concerning this claim. For purposes of this stay request, I find that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the agency decided to terminate Ms. StephensonPino because of her protected activity under section 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Acting Special Counsel v. Department of Labor</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 409 &#x00B6; 11 (2003) (a stay can be granted on the basis of little information; a stay proceeding is not intended to be a substitute for a complete hearing on the merits). OSC is cautioned, however, that, if it intends to seek an extension of this stay on the basis of section 2302(b)(8), it should, in future requests, provide a much greater level of detail, as well as something more than the assertions of counsel, in support of its request.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under pre-WPA law, OSC's burden in an initial stay application was minimal. A Board member could deny the stay only if he or she determined that it would not be appropriate under the facts and circumstances. <span class="Italic">In re Frazier</span>, 1 MSPR 1, 5, 1 MSPB 2 (1979). If the stay request was not denied within three calendar days of the application, it was automatically granted. A demonstration of irreparable harm was unnecessary to support a stay application. Efforts by the affected employee to seek relief through other procedures did not preclude a stay application by OSC. <span class="Italic">In re Strickland</span>, 1 MSPR 105, 1 MSPB 100 (1979).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the standards of the WPA (the Board member "shall order such stay unless the member determines that, under the facts and circumstances involved, such a stay would not be appropriate"), a reasonable belief sufficient to support a stay may include consideration of the proximity of disciplinary actions and protected activities. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 45 MSPR 280 (1990). An example of the Board's summary of circumstances supporting a stay is taken from <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. VA</span>, 50 MSPR 229, 231 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...These employees allegedly made disclosures involving allegations of violations of law of a very serious nature. These disclosures were followed, in a little over two months, by a proposal to remove the employees. The asserted bases for the removals, in large part, are denied by the employees. The proposing official was allegedly aware that at least one of these employees was involved in the IG investigation of these disclosures and feared reprisal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency is not provided a regulatory right to respond to an OSC initial stay request. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Saunders v. SBA</span>, CB-1208-14-0020-U-1 n.2 (NP 8/20/2014) ("The agency has responded in opposition to OSC's stay request. However, unlike the situation where OSC requests the extension of a stay that has already been granted, the Board's regulations do not require that an agency be provided with an opportunity to comment on the initial stay request. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.136(a), (b). Thus, I have not considered the agency's response to OSC's stay request."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Schwarz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, CB-1208-17-0022-U-2 (NP 7/25/2017) (agency may not circumvent the initial 45-day stay through a motion to dismiss the stay based on a settlement agreement that arguably waives a Board appeal right; also noting that a stay application by OSC is not a Board appeal). Should the Board have concerns about the legitimacy of a stay request, it may issue a stay pending briefing on defined issues and a decision on those issues. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 45 MSPR 653, 656 (1990). Deflecting an agency's attempt to avoid an initial stay by offering evidence or argument that the persons charged with reprisal had no knowledge of the employee's protected disclosures, <span class="Italic">OSC ex rel. Missal v. Dept. of Interior</span>, CB-1208-17-0025-U-1 n.2 (NP 8/2/2017), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 1, 2017, the agency filed a response to OSC's initial stay request. The Board's regulations do not contemplate an agency response to an OSC initial stay request in original jurisdiction cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.134-.136. However, in its response, the agency disputes that the relevant management officials had knowledge of Mr. Missal's protected disclosures or activity and sets forth its reasons for removing Mr. Missal. A stay proceeding is not a substitute for a hearing on the merits, and the stay itself is not a final decision on the merits of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel ex rel. Shaw v. Social Security Administration</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 392, 395 (1997); <span class="Italic">see also Special Counsel v. Department of Transportation</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 87, 90 (1996). Therefore, at this stage, we do not resolve these disputed issues.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An initial stay was granted in a case with a weak legal basis, with instructions to OSC address to apparent infirmities in its position in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel Cefalu v. DOJ,</span> CB-1208-13-0006-U-1 (NP 10/23/2012) (stay extended, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Cefalu v. DOJ</span>, CB-1208-13-0006-U-2 (NP 12/6/2012); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Cefalu v.

DOJ</span>, CB-1208-13-0006-U-7 (NP 7/16/2013) (indefinite stay granted upon OSC's filing of corrective action petition (Member Robbins dissenting))):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its October 18, 2012 stay request, OSC alleges that Vincent Cefalu, a Criminal Investigator (Senior Operations Officer), GS-1811-13, for the Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), was removed, effective October 5, 2012, based on a single sustained charge of lack of candor. OSC alleges that the lack of candor charge was based on Mr. Cefalu's testimony, given under subpoena, in a hearing on a criminal defendant's motion to suppress evidence. OSC further alleges that the charge cannot be sustained because Mr. Cefalu was cross-examined about "the basis of his opinions," "he fully disclosed to the court the existence of limitations on his knowledge," "his subjective opinions were based on his earlier experience in dealing with local law enforcement officials," and he was "sincere." OSC further alleges that the agency's removal of Mr. Cefalu on these grounds constituted a violation of his First Amendment right to free speech and, thus, the merit system principle found at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(2). OSC states that its stay request presents the novel issue of "whether and under what circumstances it is a prohibited personnel practice for a federal employer to fire an employee for testimony provided under subpoena in a criminal case."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC requests a stay of Mr. Cefalu's removal for 45 days and an order that the ATF return Mr. Cefalu to full pay and duty status until the stay expires or is otherwise lifted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Analysis</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC "may request any member of the Merit Systems Protection Board to order a stay of any personnel action for 45 days if [OSC] determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the personnel action was taken, or is to be taken, as a result of a prohibited personnel practice." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1)(A)(i). Such a request "shall" be granted "unless...such a stay would not be appropriate." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1)(A)(ii); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.136(a). OSC's stay request need merely fall within the "range of rationality" to be granted, and "the facts should be viewed in the light which is most favorable to a finding of reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice was...committed." <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Perfetto v. Navy,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 169, &#x00B6; 11 (1999) (citations omitted). Deference is given to OSC's initial determination, and a stay will be denied only when the asserted facts and circumstances appear to make the stay request inherently unreasonable. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 229 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(12), it is a prohibited personnel practice to "take or fail to take any other personnel action if the taking of or failure to take such action violates any law, rule, or regulation implementing, or directly concerning, the merit system principles contained in section 2301 of this title." One of the merit system principles states that "[a]ll employees and applicants for employment should receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management...with proper regard for their privacy and constitutional rights." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(2). Given the deference that should be accorded to OSC and the allegations described by OSC in its stay request, <span class="Italic">In re Kass,</span> 2 M.S.P.R. 79, 91 (1980), I find that it would not be inappropriate to grant the stay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although I am granting this initial stay request, I note that OSC also asks the Board to hold that sworn testimony is entitled to First Amendment protection even if such testimony is given pursuant to official duty. Because of the deferential standard given to OSC, the allegations contained in its submission, and the Board's own precedent, which provides that an initial stay request "can be granted on the basis of relatively little information," so as to provide OSC with time to complete an investigation, I need not resolve this issue at this time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC's request for the Board to make a finding regarding Mr. Cefalu's entitlement to constitutional protection, particularly in the context of an initial stay request, implicates important legal and factual issues and requires further briefing and development of the record, which should be presented to--and addressed by--the full Board if OSC seeks an extension of the stay. The legal issues involve the interpretation and applicability of Supreme Court and circuit precedent. As for the factual issues, in order for the Board to fairly evaluate whether a stay of the agency's action should be extended, the Board should be provided with the entire transcript of Mr. Cefalu's testimony during the suppression hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, OSC's initial stay request relies on the merit system principle found at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(2) to conclude that the agency's action violates Mr. Cefalu's constitutional rights, but such reliance overlooks the well-established principle that the merit system principles are not self-executing. <span class="Italic">Wells v. Harris,</span> 1 M.S.P.R. 208, 215 &#x0026; n.11 (1979), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds, Gende v. Department of Justice,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. 604, 614 (1984). Given this principle, the Board has held that, to make out a prohibited personnel practice claim based on an asserted violation of a constitutional right, the complaining party must identify a law, rule, or regulation that implements or directly concerns the constitutional provision involved; the Constitution itself is not such a law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Radford v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 250, 254-55 (1995); <span class="Italic">Pollard v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 52 M.S.P.R. 566, 570 n.3 (1992). Here, <span id="Page_4057"></span>OSC does not allege that the agency's decision to remove Mr. Cefalu violated a law, rule, or regulation implementing or directly concerning the First Amendment. Nevertheless, in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel and Hubbard v. Environmental Protection Agency,</span> 70 M.S.P.R. 41, 55-56 (1996), the Board adopted an administrative law judge decision that found a prohibited personnel practice when a personnel action was taken in violation of an individual's First Amendment rights, without finding that the action violated a law, rule, or regulation implementing or directly concerning the First Amendment.[3] In any subsequent submissions, the parties should address the applicability of<span class="Italic"> Radford, Pollard, Hubbard,</span> and other relevant case law to the instant matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The Board later withdrew the <span class="Italic">Hubbard</span> decision reported at 70 M.S.P.R. 41, although in doing so it again affirmed the administrative law judge's finding that there had been a prohibited personnel practice. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel and Hubbard v. Environmental Protection Agency,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 542, 546 (1998),<span class="Italic"> aff'd sub nom. Hubbard v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 205 F.3d 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2000).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The determination to grant an initial stay may consider proximity of alleged retaliatory actions to protected disclosures, as in any whistleblower reprisal case, <span class="Italic">OSC ex rel. Missal v. Dept. of Interior</span>, CB-1208-17-0025-U-1 (NP 8/2/2017):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC further indicates that the investigation that led to Mr. Missal's removal began 2 months after his IG complaint and hours after it came to light that the IG was investigating Lease Sale 193, and he was removed a little over a year after he began making disclosures. Such assertions, if proven, would satisfy the timing component of the knowledge/timing test. <span class="Italic">See Mastrullo</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6; 21 (recognizing that a personnel action taken within approximately 1 to 2 years of an appellant's protected disclosures satisfies the knowledge/timing test). Although OSC seeks a stay of Mr. Missal's removal, the Board will consider evidence of the conduct of an agency investigation when it is so closely related to a personnel action that it could have been pretext for gathering evidence to use to retaliate against an employee for whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Johnson v. Department of Justice</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 624, &#x00B6; 7 (2007).</p>
