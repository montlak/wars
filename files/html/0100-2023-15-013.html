<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-14"><span class="space">4.</span> Leave-Requesting, Leave-Reporting Requirement</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">It is an axiom of civil service law that agency management may impose reasonable conditions on requests for leave and employees must comply with the lawful orders of their supervisors. <span class="Italic">McGann v. GSA</span>, DC-0752-14-0958-I-2 (NP 12/29/2016). The employee is responsible for requesting leave and providing the agency with sufficiently detailed supporting documentation, e.g., medical certificates. <span class="Italic">Cresson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 33 MSPR 178, 181-84 (1987). <span class="Italic">Cresson</span> described the appellant's responsibility to ensure the propriety of his own leave status:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency is required by statute to provide an employee with notice of an adverse action. However, it is not charged with the same requirement regarding an employee's leave status. Rather, it is the employee who is responsible for requesting leave and providing the agency with the necessary supporting medical documentation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dunn v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 9 MSPB 270, 9 MSPR 652, 655 (1982) (agency employee's unavailability for duty in position as letter carrier, by reason of injuries allegedly sustained in automobile accident, without any foreseeable end to his absence, warranted removal, particularly in view of facts that the agency had made several attempts to reach employee and <span class="Italic">it was his</span> <span class="Italic">responsibility to keep his employer informed concerning his</span> <span class="Italic">availability for work)</span> (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also Barner v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 10 MSPB 310, 11 MSPR 357, 361 (1982) (agency is under no obligation to approve leave unless it is requested and supported by a valid basis); <span class="Italic">Nunes v. EEOC,</span> 12 MSPB 20, 13 MSPR 428, 431 (1982) (agency was not required to tolerate employee's prolonged absence, relative to alleged medical condition, which had no foreseeable end, particularly in view of employee's deliberate refusal to contact his supervisor).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency did not hear from appellant, it allowed him to exhaust his leave, and then accepted the doctor's certificates as a request for LWOP. However, because many of the certificates listed no reason for appellant's absence and others made a general reference to "stomach problems" and because the agency had insufficient information regarding his condition or prognosis for recovery, it did not carry appellant in LWOP status longer than thirty days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, appellant's evidence at the Board hearing regarding his incapacity during the AWOL period does not provide a basis for voiding the agency's decision to carry appellant in an AWOL status and thereafter to remove him for excessive absenteeism. <span class="Italic">See Zeiss</span> <span class="Italic">v. Veterans Administration,</span> 7 MSPB 516, 8 MSPR 15, 18 (1981) (Board sustained a removal based upon an AWOL charge because appellant did not furnish requested medical information, notwithstanding a psychiatrist's testimony that the appellant was unable to work during the AWOL period)<span class="Italic">. See also Bentley v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 20 MSPR 208, 210 (1984) (an employee's absence "for which there is no foreseeable end in sight" is a burden which no agency is required to bear).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, we find that appellant did not request leave, the medical certificates he submitted to the agency failed to provide a sufficient medical basis for his absence, and there was no foreseeable end to his absence. Thus, the agency established by preponderant evidence that it acted properly in exercising its discretion by placing appellant in an AWOL status and thereafter removing him for excessive absenteeism. <span class="Italic">See Bavier v. Department of Transportation,</span> 5 MSPB 73, 4 MSPR 548, 550 (1981) (agency's obligation to support its decision by preponderance of the evidence extends to every element of its charges, including propriety of a decision to deny leave); <span class="Italic">Desiderio v. U.S. Department of the Navy,</span> 4 MSPB 171, 4 MSPR 84, 86 (1980) (authorization of LWOP is a matter of administrative discretion, and employees cannot demand that they be granted LWOP as a matter of right).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant had been employed by the agency as a payroll supervisor for almost fourteen years. His responsibilities included leave approval and recording and he had expertise in leave regulations. Thus, appellant was aware of his responsibility to make leave requests, the documentation which must support such requests, and the necessity for keeping the agency apprised of the estimated length of an anticipated absence. Because appellant was aware of leave requirements, it was error for the administrative judge to order appellant's removal cancelled on the basis of the agency's inability to notify appellant that he was required to keep the agency advised of his availability for work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant did not keep the agency advised of his status, and his actions made it impossible for the agency to contact him. He did not provide the agency with any telephone number or address at which he could be reached, nor did he make any attempt to contact the agency personally. In addition, appellant's physician testified at the Board hearing that the reason he did not respond to the agency's request for assistance in contacting appellant was because appellant had not authorized him to release any information. We may reasonably infer from this that appellant's physician discussed his receipt of the agency's March 4, 1984 letter requesting additional medical documentation with appellant at the time, and that the appellant must have known that the agency was trying to contact him. Finally, it appears incredible, in the absence of instructions from their father, that appellant's daughters, who received a letter and telegram for appellant regarding his leave status, would have told the agency that they would not forward their father's mail in the absence of instructions from appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board, in its previous order, found that the agency was obligated to communicate with appellant's attorney regarding his leave and the proposed action, the Board made the ruling without benefit of the hearing evidence. That evidence indicated that, at the time the action was proposed and effected, the agency was not authorized to communicate to the person purporting to be appellant's attorney regarding appellant's leave status or his removal. The agency advised the attorney in its April 17, 1984 letter, that it had not received the designation of representative form from appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 297.201(b)(3). At the time the agency effected appellant's removal, it was three weeks after it had advised the attorney that it could not release any personnel information to her in the absence of a designation form.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the designation form filed by appellant's attorney more than two weeks after the agency's removal action was effected, expressly limited the representation and the release of information to appellant's OWCP claim. Thus, even if the agency had held its final decision on appellant's removal in abeyance until it heard from appellant's attorney, the form would have been insufficient authorization for the agency to communicate to appellant's attorney on any issue other than his OWCP claim.</p>

Before discipline may be imposed upon the employee who fails to properly request leave, the employee must be charged with failure to request leave. The failure to follow leave procedures is not inherent in an AWOL charge that references the failure of an employee to request leave. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Riley v. Dept. of Army</span>, 53 MSPR 683, 688-89 (1992). Repeated failure to follow leave reporting requirements is a serious matter.

<p class="Body-Text">The failure to follow reporting requirements as to an absence is distinguishable from removal for the absence.

Although an employee who is ill <span id="Page_2446"></span>during a period charged AWOL is entitled to sick leave and the AWOL charge may not be sustained, there remains for consideration whether a penalty is appropriate for failure to follow agency regulations regarding notice and requests for leave. <span class="Italic">Haney v.

<p class="Body-Text">An agency may not discipline an employee for failure to follow leave procedures unless she is clearly on notice of the applicable requirements and that discipline for continued noncompliance is likely. <span class="Italic">Smith v.

If an agency is on notice that an appellant is hospitalized and requested leave for a certain period of time, and the employee continues to notify the agency of his condition, the agency should construe his conduct as a request for approved leave; under these circumstances, it is unreasonable for the agency to place an appellant in an AWOL status during periods of hospitalization. In circumstances of considerable use of approved leave for recuperation from illness, the Board found two instances of failure to adhere to proper procedures and rules for requesting and obtaining approval of leave sufficient to warrant a 15-day suspension as the maximum permissible penalty. <span class="Italic">Foster v. DHHS</span>, 18 MSPR 339, 343 (1983). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">White v.

<p class="Body-Text">If an AWOL charge depends on the failure of the employee to secure authorized leave, and if the employee does follow the established procedures, management cannot take adverse action. If an appellant has another employee notify a supervisor of the appellant's sickness and that notification is consistent with a collective bargaining contract and not contrary to OPM or agency regulations, the agency improperly removes the employee for AWOL if it is later presented with medical certification of the illness prior to the decision to remove the employee. <span class="Italic">Greenwood v.

If the employee testifies that he complied with call-in procedures established under a collective bargaining agreement and there is no rebuttal evidence on the point from the agency, the agency fails to prove AWOL. <span class="Italic">Matthews v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 21 MSPR 760, 763 (1984). But if the agency asserts that the employee did not notify proper personnel of the appellant's interest in taking leave, it is the appellant's burden to prove that he complied with proper procedures if he is to avoid an AWOL charge. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shamblen v.

<p class="Body-Text">If the agency is to support a charge of failure to adhere to leave-reporting requirements, that charge must be separately stated against the appellant.

The Board alluded to the distinction in treatment between AWOL and failure to follow procedures governing requests for leave, <span class="Italic">Nash v. USPS</span>, 8 MSPR 307, 309-11 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant contends in his petition that on July 17, 18 and 19 of 1979, he was under a doctor's care for treatment of an eye condition and was unable to work. Appellant argues that he therefore should have been given sick leave on those dates rather than charged with AWOL.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under regulations promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), an agency is required to grant sick leave in certain situations, including where, as here, an employee is incapacitated for the performance of his duties due to sickness.[7] However, Section 630.402 requires that an employee apply for sick leave within the time limits set by the agency, and section 630.403 provides that the agency may grant a request for sick leave only when such request is supported by demonstratively acceptable evidence. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Department of the Navy,</span> 5 MSPB 456, 5 MSPR 451 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;5 CFR &#x00A7; 630.401 provides that an agency shall grant sick leave to any employee when the employee: (1) receives medical, dental, or optical examination or treatment; (2) is incapacitated for the performance of duties by sickness, injury, or pregnancy and confinement; (3) is required to give care and attendance to a member of his immediate family who is affected with a contagious disease; or (4) would jeopardize the health of others by his presence at his post of duty because of exposure to a contagious disease.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record contains a doctor's certificate which the appellant submitted to the agency in support of his contention that he should have been given sick leave on July 17, 18, and 19 of 1979. Appellant did not, however, submit the statement to the agency upon his return to duty, but rather he submitted the statement on August 31, 1979, the day after he was issued the "Notice of Proposed Removal."[9]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;The agency contends that appellant was required to present medical evidence to support his absence upon his return to duty. In support of this argument, the agency has submitted a letter dated January 1, 1975, which was sent to the appellant advising him that because of an unacceptable attendance record, he was being placed on restricted leave privileges. The letter also advised the appellant that if he failed to submit evidence to support absences upon his return to work, he would be charged with AWOL.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since appellant submitted the medical evidence to the agency documenting that he was incapacitated for duty due to illness on July 17, 18 and 19, 1979, <span class="Italic">prior</span> to the agency's decision to remove him on AWOL charges, we find that he was improperly denied sick leave even though the submission was not timely in accordance with the agency's sick leave procedures.[10] The presiding official erroneously sustained the AWOL charges for those dates.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cf. Zeiss v. Veterans Administration,</span> 7 MSPB 516, 8 MSPR 15 (1981). In that case the Board held that although there may be circumstances where in an AWOL based adverse action the submission of medical evidence of illness for the first time on appeal may be determinative of the outcome, the presiding official did not err in determining that medical evidence presented by the appellant in support of a sick leave request for the first time on appeal did not warrant a reversal or reconsideration of the agency's decision to remove him for AWOL. The Board based its holding in <span class="Italic">Zeiss</span> on findings that: (1) the agency told the appellant to bring in a certificate from a doctor to substantiate his alleged illness for 88 hours upon his return to work; (2) the appellant was also given a notice of proposed removal which the personnel office informed him would be rescinded upon production of a doctor's certificate, and (3) by the date of the removal decision appellant had neither furnished the required medical evidence nor replied to the notice of proposed removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In the instant case, although appellant failed to submit the doctor's certificate in support of his illness promptly upon his return to duty (and in violation of the agency's sick leave procedures), he did submit the medical evidence <span class="Italic">prior</span> to the agency's decision to remove him and the agency erred in refusing to consider it. If the agency desired to discipline the appellant for his untimely submission, the proper procedure would not have been to propose[&#8197;] his removal for AWOL on the dates he was ill, but to charge him with disobeying agency directives and propose disciplinary action on that ground.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant does not attempt to refute the AWOL charges for August 7 and 27. He argues, however, that since four of the agency's six AWOL charges are not supported by a preponderance of the evidence, his removal should be reversed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Since the Board has found that the presiding official erroneously sustained three of the five AWOL charges, we have carefully considered whether the two remaining AWOL charges merited the appellant's removal. However, in light of the numerous past disciplinary actions taken against the appellant (all but one of which involved charges of AWOL) and in consideration of the principle of progressive discipline, we have concluded that the two remaining AWOL charges merited the appellant's removal under the circumstances of this case.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">An agency shall grant sick leave to an employee when the employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(a)&#x2003;Receives medical, dental, or optical examination or treatment;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(b)&#x2003;Is incapacitated for the performance of duties by sickness, injury, or pregnancy and confinement;</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under section 630.401, an agency is required to grant sick leave to an employee when any of the events listed in (a)-(d) occur<span class="Italic">. Wade v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 829 F.2d 1160 at 1109 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Miller v. Bond</span>, 641 F.2d 997, 1003 (D.C. Cir. 1981)....&#8197;As the court in <span class="Italic">Miller</span> explained, the use of the phrase "shall grant" emphasizes the fact that an agency must grant sick leave when requested to do so by an employee in the instances set forth by section 630.401(a)-(d). Accordingly, the court ruled that "[n]o agency has the discretion to refuse to grant sick leave to a qualified applicant." 641 F.2d at 1003.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR 630.403 provides that an agency may grant a request for sick leave only when such a request is supported by "administratively acceptable" evidence. As noted by the court in <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 641 F.2d at 1003, section 630.403 provides some general guidelines on what evidence will support an applicant's entitlement to be granted sick leave. Section 630.403 provides that "[r]egardless of the duration of the absence, an agency may consider an employee's certification as to the reason for [the employee's] absence as evidence administratively acceptable." However, for an absence in excess of 3 workdays, and for a lesser period when determined necessary by an agency, "the agency may also require a medical certificate, or other administratively acceptable evidence as to the reason for the absence." In short, "[t]he agency's discretion is limited only by the requirement of 'reasonableness.'" <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 641 F.2d at 1003-04.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR 630.402 requires that the employee must request sick leave within the time limits prescribed by the agency. However, the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), in interpreting and applying 5 CFR Part 630, subpart D, holds that an employee's duty to comply with the agency's sick leave procedures "is not...a condition precedent to the agency's duty to grant sick leave when presented with proper evidence of illness or injury." <span class="Italic">Atchley v. Dept. of Army</span>, 46 MSPR 297, 301 (1990). In MSPB's view, "[i]f an employee has provided administratively acceptable evidence of incapacity, prior to the agency's decision to remove him on AWOL charges, the agency must grant sick leave, regardless of the employee's failure to timely comply with the agency's sick leave procedures." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. [citing <span class="Italic">Nash v. USPS</span>, 8 MSPR 307, 310, n.10 (1981)]. The MSPB advises that if an agency wants to discipline an employee for failing to comply with established sick leave procedures, the proper action is to propose discipline on that basis and not on the basis that the employee was AWOL on dates that the employee was incapacitated for duty by sickness or injury<span class="Italic">. Atchley</span>, 46 MSPR at 301; <span class="Italic">Nash</span>, 8 MSPR at 310 n.10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Atchley</span>, the employee contended that he was incapacitated during the period for which he was charged with AWOL. The MSPB administrative judge sustained the removal based on the AWOL charge, finding that it was unnecessary to determine whether the employee was incapacitated because the employee had failed to follow the agency's sick leave procedures. Before the MSPB, the employee contended that reliance on his failure to follow sick leave procedures was erroneous because he was charged with AWOL and not with the failure to follow procedures. The MSPB agreed and held that the administrative judge erred in sustaining the AWOL charge solely on the basis of a failure to follow sick leave procedures without deciding whether the employee had provided administratively acceptable evidence of incapacity. The MSPB ruled that a failure to follow established agency sick leave procedures "cannot serve as a basis to sustain an AWOL charge."...&#8197;The MSPB explained that the dispositive issue in these types of cases is whether, prior to disciplinary action, the employee provided the agency with administratively acceptable evidence of incapacity during the period for which the employee was charged with AWOL.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the MSPB's interpretation and application of 5 CFR part 630, subpart D, and we will apply the MSPB's approach to disciplinary actions based on AWOL when resolving exceptions to arbitration awards under the Statute. Similar to the MSPB's holding in <span class="Italic">Atchley</span>, we hold in this case that the Arbitrator erred in sustaining the discipline of the grievant for AWOL solely on the basis of a failure to follow sick leave procedures without deciding whether the grievant had provided administratively acceptable evidence of incapacity for duty on April 3-5, 1989. The dispositive issue in this case is whether the grievant's statement of incapacity due to injury, the two doctor's certificates covering the period April 4-7, and the Agency's doctor's placement of the grievant on limited duty constituted administratively acceptable evidence of incapacity on April 3-5 within the meaning of section 630.403. However, this issue was not addressed or resolved by the Arbitrator in his award sustaining the suspension and denying the grievance. Instead, the Arbitrator relied on the grievant's failure to follow the procedure for requesting sick leave under Article 24, Section 24.01 of the parties' agreement, which procedure does not pertain to supporting evidence for sick leave requests. As decided by the MSPB, the issue of whether an employee followed established sick leave procedures, such as those set forth in the parties' agreement, is separate from the issue of whether an employee was entitled to have been granted sick leave under 5 CFR 630.401.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming that circumstances may warrant the imposition of discipline for leave-reporting errors, some demonstration of adverse impact should be shown, although the failure to follow proper procedures may have covered several weeks. <span class="Italic">Douglas v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/DOUGLAS_CURTIS_ET_AL_AT075299006_OPINION_AND_ORDER_253434.pdf">5 MSPR 280</a>, 321, 5 MSPB 313, 341 (1981), mitigated a removal to a 30-day suspension for an employee who failed to follow reporting procedures but who was not charged AWOL. The agency failed to show how the failure to use proper reporting procedures for sickness had an adverse impact upon the agency. Removal for improper leave requests was mitigated for an individual who was accused of incorrectly filing a leave request form; the agency did not demonstrate that the information said to be omitted was required on the forms. <span class="Italic">Beasley v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jones v. DOJ</span>, 98 MSPR 86, 87-96 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-22 (2004), sustained dismissal of an individual for both AWOL and for failure to provide timely reports of his medical condition--reports that the agency believed were required to allow it to determine whether the appellant would return to the job after a period of absence or whether the agency should take steps to fill the appellant's job with someone else. The significance of the decision is that the Board sustained the charge, supporting removal, that the employee did not provide timely medical reports concerning his prospective condition and readiness to return to work when those reports were requested during a period of approved absence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was a GS-0670-13 Health Systems Administrator with the agency's Federal Bureau of Prisons. On November 25, 2002, the agency notified the appellant that he was being transferred from Puerto Rico to the Federal Correctional Institution in Estill, South Carolina, effective February 23, 2003. It is uncontested that the appellant did not report for duty in South Carolina on February 23, 2003, or at any time prior to his removal. The appellant received approval to use sick leave from February 24, 2003, until March 23, 2003, due to the serious health condition of a family member. The appellant then submitted a March 17, 2003 medical certificate from his psychiatrist, Dr. Maria Sanchez-Bonilla, indicating that he had "Major Depression" and he received approved sick leave from March 23, 2003, until April 24, 2003. On April 29, 2003, the agency received a second medical certificate prepared by Dr. Sanchez-Bonilla indicating that the appellant was suffering from major depression, as well as a form from the appellant requesting sick leave from April 24, 2003, until June 16, 2003. The agency approved the appellant's sick leave request from April 29, 2003, until June 16, 2003, but placed the appellant in an absent without leave (AWOL) status for April 24-25, 28, 2003.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the appellant's extended absence on sick leave, the agency sent the appellant a June 4, 2003 letter requiring him to provide the agency with information regarding eight specific inquiries related to his medical condition and his ability to perform the duties of his position. The letter notified the appellant and his psychiatrist that it was not intended to authorize any treatment, tests, or diagnosis, but was only intended to obtain information currently available. The information was to be submitted to the agency by June 16, 2003. The appellant submitted a June 12, 2003 response requesting an extension of the June 16, 2003 deadline because his psychiatrist needed a more detailed authorization for the release from him for the medical information requested by the agency and because his psychiatrist required a fee of $400 to provide the additional information. The appellant also indicated that, although he was still under medical care, he was requesting that the agency carry him in an annual leave or compensatory time status. In a June 17, 2003 letter, the agency informed the appellant that: his request for annual leave or compensatory time was denied; his approved sick leave had expired; if he sought additional sick leave he would need to provide the additional information that the agency sought; and he would be listed as AWOL unless he was granted additional sick leave. The agency also informed the appellant that it was his responsibility to obtain the additional information from his psychiatrist.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 19, 2003, the appellant faxed the agency a request for sick leave from June 17, 2003, through July 19, 2003, with a June 19, 2003 medical certificate from his psychiatrist noting that the appellant could return to work on July 20, 2003, and indicating: "Diagnosis: Major Depression secondary to work related issues (exogenous causes). Prognosis: Condition will resolve with no expected lasting limitations as soon as work related issues starts [sic] to remitt [sic]." The appellant's psychiatrist also indicated that her fee for providing the additional information sought by the agency was $400. The agency informed the appellant that it would grant him additional sick leave from June 17-25, 2003, that he must submit the additional information the agency sought by June 25, 2003, and that he was responsible for obtaining and submitting the information from his psychiatrist. The agency also informed the appellant that he would be placed in an AWOL status if it did not receive the additional information by June 25, 2003. The appellant never provided the additional information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2448"></span>The agency issued an October 20, 2003 notice proposing the appellant's removal based on three charges: "Failure to Report to Work"; "Absent Without Leave" from April 24, 2003, through April 28, 2003, and from June 26, 2003, through the date of the proposal notice; and "Failure to Follow Instructions" as set forth in the agency's June 4, 2003 letter. The appellant submitted a written response, with evidence in support thereof, through his attorney. In a November 24, 2003 decision notice, the agency's deciding official, Warden Gerardo Maldonado, Jr., granted the appellant sick leave for April 24-25, 28, 2003, and, thus, he did not sustain that first specification in support of the second charge. The deciding official found that the evidence supported the remaining charges and specifications and that removal was the appropriate penalty under the circumstances. The appellant was removed effective November 29, 2003.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a June 4, 2003 letter to the appellant, the agency directed him to provide a letter from the agency to his psychiatrist seeking information regarding eight specific inquiries related to his medical condition and his ability to perform the duties of his position. The agency's letter to the appellant directed him to ensure that the information it sought from his psychiatrist was submitted to it by June 16, 2003. In a June 17, 2003 letter, the agency responded to the appellant's June 12, 2003 letter requesting an extension of the deadline for submitting the requested information from his psychiatrist and indicating that his psychiatrist required a $400 fee to provide the information. The agency informed the appellant that it was his responsibility to obtain and submit the information. The appellant then sent the agency a letter from Dr. Sanchez-Bonilla indicating that she required a $400 fee to perform additional testing so as to provide the information the agency sought. In a June 23, 2003 letter, the agency granted the appellant an extension of the submission deadline to June 25, 2003, and it again reminded him that it was his responsibility to obtain and submit the information from his psychiatrist. It is undisputed that the appellant never submitted the requested information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts on review that the AJ erred in determining that it was the agency's responsibility to pay for the unspecified additional testing that the appellant's psychiatrist asserted was necessary in order to respond to all eight of the agency's questions, and thus that the AJ erred in finding the appellant had complied with the agency's instruction to the extent that he was able to do so. Specifically, the agency asserts that it was the appellant's responsibility to ensure that his psychiatrist provided the information and that it was the appellant's responsibility to pay for any additional examinations that were necessary to provide such information. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's June 4, 2003 request for more detailed medical documentation of the appellant's condition was clearly reasonable in light of the appellant's extended absence on sick leave since March 23, 2003. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.403; <span class="Italic">Pope v. Department of the Navy,</span> 44 M.S.P.R. 289, 293 (1990). The appellant bore the responsibility to ensure that his chosen psychiatrist timely submitted the additional information requested by the agency, regardless of any delay or requirements imposed by his psychiatrist. <span class="Italic">See Frazier v. Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 11 M.S.P.R. 179, 182 (1982). Further, to the extent that the appellant's psychiatrist believed, after having treated the appellant since February 21, 2003, that a further medical evaluation was necessary in order to provide all of the information sought by the agency, the appellant, in seeking the benefit of sick leave, was obligated to pay for that evaluation, not the agency; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.304; <span class="Italic">see also Staten v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 206, 208 n.2 (1985). Moreover, the psychiatrist's testimony at the hearing established that, if the agency had informed her that it was not going to pay the $400 fee, she would have prepared the report without charging the appellant a fee. The agency had made it clear to the appellant that he was responsible for obtaining the additional medical information it sought. If the appellant had diligently informed Dr. Sanchez-Bonilla that the agency would not pay the requested $400 fee, according to the doctor's testimony, she would have provided the information. Thus, we reject the AJ's finding that the appellant followed the agency's instruction to the extent that he was able to do so. We find that the agency proved this charge by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">Accord Lewis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 254 &#x00B6; 9 (1999) (even if the agency may have initiated the appellant's absence, the initially involuntary absence became voluntary if the appellant failed to provide the agency with acceptable medical documentation to show that he was able to return to work, as requested by the agency); <span class="Italic">Nolan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 241 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (1998) (same).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the AWOL charge was based on the agency's findings that the appellant had not presented administratively acceptable evidence that he was incapacitated medically from performing the duties of his position starting June 26, 2003, and continuing through the date of the proposal notice. This is exactly the same period for which the agency charged and proved that the appellant failed to follow instructions by refusing to provide the necessary medical documentation to substantiate his alleged inability to work. Thus, the AWOL charge is based on the same facts that underlie the charge of failing to follow instructions since the appellant's failure to follow instructions and provide the medical documentation caused him to be AWOL. Thus, the AWOL charge merges into the charge of failure to follow instructions, and we need not consider it further, except to say that it is proven by virtue of its merger into the charge of failure to follow instructions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Southers v. Veterans Administration</span>, 813 F.2d 1223, 1225-26 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (where a charge is duplicative in nature, the Board need not consider it further); <span class="Italic">Bross v. Department of Commerce</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 662, 664 n.1 (2003) (where two charges are based on the same incident and the same misconduct, they merge into one charge), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Bross v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 389 F.3d 1212 (Fed. Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">Mann v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 1, 7 (1998) (charges merge when they are based on the same misconduct, and when proof of one charge constitutes proof of both charges);<span class="Italic"> Delgado v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 685, 688 (1988) (charge of leaving the job without permission and charge of being charged with AWOL for that same period merge into one offense).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where, as here, the Board sustains the agency's charges, the Board must give deference to an agency's decision regarding a penalty unless that penalty exceeds the range of allowable punishment specified by statute or regulation, or the penalty is "so harsh and unconscionably disproportionate to the offense that it amounts to an abuse of discretion<span class="Italic">."</span> <span class="Italic">Parker v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 819 F.2d 1113, 1116 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Devall,</span> 178 F.3d 1246, 1258 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (the Board may reject those penalties it finds abusive, but may not infringe on the agency's exclusive domain as workforce manager); <span class="Italic">Starks v. Department of the Army,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 95 &#x00B6; 9 (2003) (same). This is because the agency has the primary discretion in maintaining employee discipline and seeing that the efficiency of the service is served within its organization. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 179 &#x00B6; 4 (2004). The Board is not here to displace management's responsibility in this regard; our role is to ensure that managerial judgment has been properly exercised. <span class="Italic">Lavette v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 239 &#x00B6; 17 (2004). Warden Maldonado stated that any of the agency's three charges would have been independently sufficient to result in the appellant's removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In evaluating the penalty, the Board will consider, first and foremost, the nature and seriousness of the misconduct and its relation to the employee's duties, position, and responsibilities, including whether the offense was intentional or frequently repeated. <span class="Italic">Gaines v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 527 &#x00B6; 9 (2003). As the Health Systems Administrator for the agency's Federal Correctional Institution in Estill, South Carolina, the appellant was the head of the institution's Health Services Department, which provided medical services for the institution's approximately 1,250 inmates. The appellant was responsible for supervising the Health Services Department's practitioners, laboratory technicians, records technicians, dental officers, and dental hygienists, all of whom "really play a very vital role in the correctional environment." The information that the agency sought in its June 4, 2003 letter was obviously intended to assist the agency in determining whether the appellant was able to report for duty or whether the agency would need to place someone in the appellant's very important position on a short-term or permanent basis. The appellant's failure to provide the requested information to the agency by June 25, 2003, and his status as AWOL on and after that date, coupled with his already lengthy absence from his position, was not only directly related to his performance of the duties and responsibilities of his position, it also directly related to the agency's ability to assess its need to replace the appellant, temporarily or permanently, in order to carry out its mission efficiently.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, based on the appellant's hearing testimony, we find that he intentionally failed to provide the agency with the information it requested, despite being informed that it was his responsibility to obtain and submit the information, because of his view that it was the agency's responsibility to incur any cost associated with obtaining the information. This is particularly troubling because the appellant held an important supervisory and law enforcement officer position. Thus, the agency properly held him to a higher standard of conduct. <span class="Italic">See Mahan v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 140 &#x00B6; 11 (2001); <span class="Italic">Cantu v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 253 &#x00B6; 8 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the deciding official's assessment that the appellant has demonstrated a lack of dependability as a supervisor, such that his removal from his position is warranted based on this charge alone. The record reflects that the agency instructed the appellant in its June 23, 2003 letter to him that, if he did not provide the agency with the additional information it needed by June 25, 2003, he would be placed in an AWOL status subsequent to that date. Not only did the appellant fail to follow the agency's instruction to provide the additional information by June 25, 2003, he subsequently submitted five additional requests for sick leave that failed to provide the requested information as well. Further, the appellant testified inconsistently that he was well and able to return to work, and that he will never be totally well and that the agency was forcing him to return to work. Thus, the record reflects that the appellant lacks the potential for rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2449"></span>The Board has held that the failure to follow instructions may be sufficient cause for removal. <span class="Italic">Thompson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 41, 46 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 965 F.2d 1065 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). The appellant's serious misconduct directly related to his important supervisory and law enforcement officer position and to the agency's ability to carry out its mission efficiently. The evidence in this case supports the agency's determination that the appellant lacks the necessary dependability for his position. The agency's justified loss of trust in the appellant and his lack of rehabilitative potential are significant aggravating factors given the nature of the appellant's responsibilities, <span class="Italic">see Cantu,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 253 &#x00B6; 8, and we find that they outweigh the mitigating factors of the appellant's lengthy discipline-free service. Thus, we find that the agency's removal penalty is not abusive and is within the tolerable limits of reasonableness for the sustained misconduct under the facts of this case. <span class="Italic">See Thompson</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. at 46.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find no reason to disturb the agency's choice of penalty, and we therefore sustain the agency's removal action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee who walks off the job when she could easily have located a supervisor from whom to seek sick leave is responsible for an offense more serious than a technical violation of procedures governing leave requests. <span class="Italic">Tavitas v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 10 MSPR 165, 167 (1982). But an employee need not perform an act that would be futile. An employee may show that he had a good reason for requesting leave, that the agency knew of the reason for leave, but that agency supervisors made it clear that it would have been futile to request leave, so its denial was assured. <span class="Italic">Labrie v. FAA</span>, 16 MSPR 260, 262 (1983). Nor can the employee be charged with failing to request leave when her mental state precluded her from understanding the requirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McKinney v. VA</span>, 35 MSPR 412, 415 (1987).</p>
