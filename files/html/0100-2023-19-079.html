<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-75"><span class="space">a.</span> Dangerousness; Risk Assessment; Direct Threat</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Potential for dangerousness may render an employee disabled but not qualified for accommodation. Although the Board did not identify how it would quantify "dangerousness," in <span class="Italic">Mazzarella v. USPS</span>, 56 MSPR 47, 54-55 (1992), the employee was fired for disruptive conduct and some property damage at the office, constituting a violation of agency standards of conduct. Medical evidence established that the appellant was afflicted with an "explosive personality disorder, intermittent type." That led to a determination by the AJ, undisputed by the agency, that the employee was disabled. <span class="Italic">Mazzarella</span> examined the evidence involving the incident leading to the adverse action, and characterized it as "an episode fraught with danger to agency employees and property" that reflected, consistent with medical literature describing the appellant's condition, aggressiveness that was "grossly out of proportion to any precipitating psychosocial stressors." The Board discounted the AJ's evaluation of appellant's demeanor during the hearing by noting a reference to DSM-III-R indicating that "there are no signs of generalized impulsivity or aggressiveness between the episodes." The appellant's medical expert conceded that another violent outburst "could recur." From this possibility the Board concluded that the appellant was not a qualified disabled employee, that is, "a handicapped person who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position in question without endangering the health and safety of the individual or others...." <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.203 (2002) [now 29 CFR 1630.2 (2022)].The Board's analysis was followed in federal court. <span class="Italic">Mazzarella v. USPS</span>, 849 F. Supp. 89 (D. Mass. 1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When assessing an adverse action involving an individual with a disability, the agency may assert that the individual does not meet medical qualifications and that his or her retention on the job would be a direct threat to the appellant or to others in the workplace. Or, without involving medical standards, the individual's behavior may constitute a danger or threat of danger in the workplace sufficient to warrant adverse action. Refer to OPM regulations on medical qualification determinations at 5 CFR Part 339 (2022).<span class="Italic"> Johnson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SF-0752-12-0074-I-1 (NP 1/30/2014), explained application of a "direct threat" analysis when the appellant's position involves a medical standard:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant complains that the administrative judge improperly concluded that the appellant was not a "direct threat" and that the relevant EEOC guidelines should have been applied, which require that an individualized assessment be performed. We are not persuaded by this argument. The administrative judge noted in the initial decision that an agency may defend against a claim of disability discrimination by asserting that an individual poses a "direct threat" to the health or safety of herself and others in the workplace, and he noted that such a situation may arise when an agency asserts that an individual fails to meet the medical standards established for a position. ID at 24-25 &#x0026; n.12 (citing, among other things, <span class="Italic">Simpson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 346, &#x00B6; 14 (2010); <span class="Italic">Cano v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 284, &#x00B6; 14 (2007); <span class="Italic">Boots v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 500, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6 (2007); <span class="Italic">McAlexander v. Department of Defense</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 384, &#x00B6; 2 (2007); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.2(r), 1630.15(b)(2)). The administrative judge found that the agency was not obligated to prove that the appellant posed a "direct threat" in this case because it did not allege that she failed to meet the medical standards of her position. We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's removal for unacceptable behavior does not implicate any type of qualification standard, and thus, the direct threat defense is not applicable. We therefore discern no error with his analysis of this issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The "direct threat" test was restated, <span class="Italic">Hernandez-Torres v. Dept. of Army</span>, AT-0752-15-0664-I-1 (NP 9/12/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If, as here, an agency asserts that an individual fails to meet the minimum standards established for a position, it may defend against a claim of disability discrimination by asserting that an individual poses a "direct threat" to the health or safety of himself or others in the workplace. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12113(a)-(b); <span class="Italic">Simpson v.

"Direct threat means a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). Discrimination law requires an agency to conduct an individualized assessment of an employee's qualifications in determining whether an employee poses a direct threat because of a disability. <span class="Italic">McAlexander v. Department of Defense</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 384, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15 (2007).

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3463"></span>The appellant claims that the direct threat defense is not available to the agency because it required a "100% guarantee...that there would be no further problems related to [the] [a]ppellant's epilepsy." We disagree. The agency's physician considered such factors as the potential for "sudden incapacitation," as well as the risk of recurrence, which he assessed at between 18% to 60%, depending on the amount of time that had passed since the last seizure. <span class="Italic">See Cano v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 284, &#x00B6; 14 (2007) (indicating that factors relevant in determining whether an individual with a disability poses a direct threat include the nature of the risk, the severity of the potential harm, the probability that the potential harm will occur, and the imminence of the harm); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r) (stating the same factors slightly differently). He also considered the possible side effects of the appellant's medication and the nature of the appellant's job duties.

The holding of <span class="Italic">Slater</span> is derived from OPM's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206, which concerns disqualifications based on medical history from positions with medical standards or physical requirements or subject to medical evaluation programs.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Where, as here, the appellant does not occupy a position with medical standards or physical requirements or subject to medical evaluation programs, in order to establish a charge of physical inability to perform, the agency must prove a nexus between the employee's medical condition and observed deficiencies in her performance or conduct, or a high probability, given the nature of the work involved, that her condition may result in injury to herself or others. <span class="Italic">Marshall-Carter v.

However, for the limited purposes of proving the charge, the agency is not required to show that it was unable to reasonably accommodate the appellant by assigning her to a vacant position for which she was qualified; whether it could do so goes to the affirmative defense of disability discrimination and/or the reasonableness of the penalty. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-14.</p>

The finding of <span id="Page_3464"></span>discrimination in this case, therefore, does not initially involve the issue of whether the agency failed to provide a reasonable accommodation. Instead, the discrimination finding is based on the conclusion that the agency failed to establish the defense of "direct threat as a qualification standard," under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.15(b)(2).<span class="Italic"> See Fellows-Gilder v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, the issue of reasonable accommodation arises in the direct threat defense.

In discussing this section of the regulations, the EEOC's <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act</span> states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employer may require, as a qualification standard, that an individual not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of himself/herself or others. Like any other qualification standard, such a standard must apply to all applicants or employees and not just to individuals with disabilities. If, however, an individual poses a direct threat as a result of a disability, the employer must determine whether a reasonable accommodation would either eliminate the risk or reduce it to an acceptable level. If no accommodation exists that would either eliminate or reduce the risk, the employer may refuse to hire an applicant or may discharge an employee who poses a direct threat.</p>

Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Parker v.

Mr. Slater was removed from his job as a Federal Protective Service police officer because he was afflicted with complications of diabetes, including a limited range of motion in the left wrist and a decrease in grip strength in the left hand. The question before the Board--one that it previously dealt with inconsistently--was how to enumerate or measure for decisionmakers (agency officials or AJs) the job-related impairment in terms of risk of an individual who previously performed a job at an acceptable level but who may not be able to perform the job safely over a long time due to a continuing or episodic impairment.

The record evidence demonstrates that the agency removed the appellant solely on the basis of his alleged medical disqualification. The proper standard for evaluating an employee's fitness to perform the duties of his position, for positions with medical standards or physical requirements, or positions subject to medical evaluation programs, is 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206. <span class="Italic">Lassiter v.

Rather, the standard promulgated by OPM in its regulations is the proper one: To justify disqualification based upon a medical condition alone, the agency must show that the condition itself is disqualifying, its recurrence cannot be <span id="Page_3465"></span>ruled out, and the duties of the position are such that a recurrence would pose a reasonable probability of substantial harm. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206. Such a finding is a legitimate reason for an adverse action under title 5 chapter 75. <span class="Italic">See Lassiter,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. at 147-48. To the extent that they applied the "high probability of hazard" standard, the Board's five prior decisions, issued after the OPM regulations came into effect on March 8, 1989, are overruled.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The diagnoses of S.H. Sabnani, M.D. and Bijan Zardouz, M.D. established that the appellant suffered from polyneuropathy in his hands, legs, and feet, caused by his diabetes mellitus. Dr. Zardouz stated that diabetes can cause polyneuropathy to progress over time and that the appellant's problems with his hands and feet would likely worsen over time. Dr. Sabnani also diagnosed the appellant with an old fracture in his left wrist, which has caused a significant reduction in range of motion and grip strength in the left wrist and hand. Dr. Saladino did not examine the appellant but reviewed all the medical reports and concluded that the appellant could not safely perform his duties. Dr. Saladino testified that the appellant's neuropathy appeared fairly serious and that neuropathy of that severity generally persists and progresses. He also testified that the appellant's lost range of motion in his wrist due to an old fracture is not recoverable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant produced contrary evidence first in brief letters signed by Physician's Assistant James Garmon, Luzmin Inderias, M.D., and Paul Morales, M.D. These brief letters, with almost identical language, summarily state that the authors examined the appellant and reviewed his position description and believe the appellant is medically qualified to perform his duties. These letters are devoid of any medical information or detail concerning the appellant's medical examination and the appellant admitted that he actually drafted each of these letters for Mr. Garmon, Dr. Inderias, and Dr. Morales to sign. The appellant also produced medical reports from Jin Kim, M.D. and Johanna Rosenthal, M.D. Dr. Kim concluded that the appellant has a slight deficit in range of motion in his left wrist that is not significant or limiting and that the appellant does not have diabetes. Dr. Rosenthal provided a more comprehensive report stating that the appellant has diabetes but that it is controlled by diet and that he has a slight history of peripheral neuropathy. She characterizes the neuropathy as "very minimal," states that the appellant responds to the pinprick and tuning fork tests, and asserts that the prior nerve conduction test results were at the lower limits of normal, but were not abnormal. Dr. Rosenthal states that the appellant has a prior wrist fracture but that he retains full range of motion. Dr. Rosenthal also calls into question the reliability of the prior results and conclusions concerning the appellant's neuropathy. In his testimony, Dr. Saladino called into question the objectivity and reliability of Dr. Rosenthal's report, which he characterized as advocating for the appellant's return to duty rather than as an objective medical assessment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In assessing the probative weight of medical opinion, the Board considers whether the opinion was based on a medical examination, whether the opinion provided a reasoned explanation for its findings as distinct from mere conclusory assertions, the qualifications of the expert rendering the opinion, and the extent and duration of the expert's familiarity with the treatment of the appellant. <span class="Italic">Lassiter,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. at 142. None of the doctors who examined the appellant testified at the hearing. Neither party sought the testimony of Drs. Inderias, Morales, Sabnani, or Zardouz, and the AJ denied the appellant's request for Drs. Rosenthal and Kim to testify because it was after the deadline he had set for requesting witnesses. Accordingly, the assessment of the probative value of these medical reports, as hearsay evidence, also depends on the circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">See Borninkhof v. Department of Justice,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 77, 83-87 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the letters of Dr. Morales, Dr. Inderias, and P.A. Gorman have very little probative value. They are entirely conclusory, devoid of any medical documentation or explanation in support of their conclusions. In addition, they were not written by their signatories, but rather by the appellant. The report of Dr. Kim is brief and lacking in explanation to support its conclusions, although it is appended with medical documentation. Dr. Kim's conclusion that the appellant does not have diabetes is questionable because it is in stark contrast to the other evidence and medical opinions in the record. The reports of Drs. Zardouz and Sabnani are corroborating with regard to their conclusions that the appellant suffers from peripheral polyneuropathy. Dr. Rosenthal concurs that the appellant suffers from neuropathy, but concludes that it is minimal and would not affect his ability to perform his duties. Dr. Rosenthal contradicts Dr. Sabnani with regard to the appellant's range of motion in his left wrist but does not address the appellant's grip strength. Despite Dr. Saladino's characterization of Dr. Rosenthal's report as a piece of advocacy, that Dr. Rosenthal highlighted in her report the conclusions that differed significantly from those of the agency's doctors does not undermine the report's credibility or reliability; rather, Dr. Rosenthal's report is a thorough, detailed, and relevant medical opinion addressing the medical issues of the agency's removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The contradictory reports of Drs. Kim and Rosenthal call into question the conclusions of Drs. Sabnani, Zardouz, and Saladino regarding the extent of the appellant's neuropathy and wrist ailments. Given these inconsistent medical reports and the absence of direct testimony by any examining doctor, we find that the agency did not prove by preponderant evidence that the appellant has a disqualifying medical condition or that it poses a reasonable probability of causing substantial harm. The agency therefore failed to meet its burden of proof and the ID reversing the agency's action is affirmed as modified by this Opinion and Order.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Turning to misconduct that is not implicated in analysis involving medical qualification standards, an employee with a history of depression had a right to reasonable accommodation, but the accommodative requirements did not include acquiescence to the employee's demands for deviation from agency labor relations procedures to avoid conflicts with the appellant. <span class="Italic">Siedle v.

<p class="Body-Text">An employee who, as a result of mental impairment, became enraged at a supervisor and assaulted him, with some injury to the supervisor, was not a qualified disabled employee, <span class="Italic">Colon v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 190, 199-201 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also alleges that the appellant has failed to articulate a reasonable accommodation of her handicapping condition. It therefore argues that the appellant has failed to show that she is a "qualified handicapped person," that is, "a handicapped person who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position in question without endangering the health and safety of the individual or others...." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.704(f). Moreover, the agency argues that it is highly speculative whether any accommodation would result in the successful rehabilitation of the appellant. It contends that the administrative judge ignored substantial portions of the medical testimony that reflect opinions that, although the appellant had potential for rehabilitation, the potential alone, without concerted, ongoing efforts, was insufficient for any progress toward recovery.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's finding that the appellant could perform the duties of her position with reasonable accommodation was based in part on evidence that the appellant was evaluated as a strong candidate for successful rehabilitation. The administrative judge noted that one medical expert opined that it was doubtful that there would be any further violent outbursts if there was an absence of sexual propositions. A second medical expert, he noted further, did not anticipate any further violent behavior in the course of the appellant's working relationships, given the fact that she had successfully performed her job previously despite the obstacles of her childhood.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the administrative judge found that the appellant's return to duty would constitute no risk to public safety and little, if any, risk to her coworkers. He noted that the agency had presented no testimony that any of the appellant's coworkers, with the exception of her immediate supervisor, opposed her return, and that her supervisor objected on the premise that the appellant had lied about him, and not on the premise that he feared another attack.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have indicated above, the administrative judge stated that the agency could accommodate the appellant by periodically granting her leave for treatment and by ensuring that she worked in an environment free of sexual harassment. The agency, as noted above, argues that it is entirely speculative whether any accommodation, including that described by the administrative judge, would be sufficient. For the reasons stated below, we agree with the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the four medical experts who testified in this case viewed the appellant as a good candidate for rehabilitation, each expressed the opinion that she needed to commit herself to an ongoing treatment program. Further, one expert stated that the appellant needed access to <span id="Page_3466"></span>a counselor at all times to further her treatment and rehabilitation. There is insufficient evidence that the appellant has committed herself to such a program. The appellant had not entered any such program at the time of the hearing, despite the evidence of her need for treatment, and there is no evidence in the record that the appellant had made arrangements to enter a treatment program following the adjudication of her appeal. In addition, although the appellant had been hospitalized in 1988 and 1989, those were emergency interventions, not long-term treatment. The evidence therefore does not indicate that the appellant is committed to the kind of treatment plan that the medical experts indicated was necessary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record also indicates that the appellant has engaged in violent behavior on other occasions....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the overall pattern of the appellant's behavior and the severity of her problems, the appellant has failed to articulate a reasonable accommodation that would preclude a recurrence of violent behavior. Additionally, the appellant's misconduct was so egregious that she was disqualified from her position<span class="Italic">. See Thompson v. Department of Justice</span>, 51 MSPR 43, 49 (1991). For these reasons, the appellant has failed to demonstrate that she is a "qualified handicapped person." Thus, she has failed to substantiate her allegation of handicap discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lawson v. VA</span>, NY-0752-10-0185-I-1 (NP 4/10/2014), examined a disability defense to an adverse action based on an allegedly threatening statement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant particularly emphasizes her allegations of disability discrimination and notes the medical evidence that was in the record below. Even considering the appellant's allegations of disability discrimination on review, she has failed to identify the existence of a genuine dispute of material fact warranting further adjudication on this issue. <span class="Italic">White v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 244, &#x00B6; 22 (2012); <span class="Italic">Redd v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 182, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5, 13-14 (2006). In particular, the appellant alleges that the agency should have accommodated her condition through means other than removal, such as by reassigning her or placing her on paid administrative leave. Although an agency must accommodate employees who are otherwise qualified for their jobs, employees who have committed misconduct are not considered "otherwise qualified." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Burton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 115, &#x00B6; 17 (2009). The appellant had a full and fair opportunity to contest the merits of the charges below. Because the agency proved that the appellant committed the misconduct in charges 1 and 4, the appellant was not "otherwise qualified" and the agency had no obligation under the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Rehabilitation Act to accommodate her asserted conditions in the manner she suggests. <span class="Italic">See id.; see also Fitzgerald v. Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6; 4 (2000); <span class="Italic">Laniewicz v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 477, &#x00B6; 8 (1999). Further, the law does not immunize a disabled employee from being disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, provided that the agency would impose the same discipline on an employee without a disability. <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6; 4; <span class="Italic">Laniewicz</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 477, &#x00B6; 5. The appellant has not alleged that the agency would not have imposed the same discipline on another employee without a disability who committed similar misconduct. Accordingly, her belated disability discrimination claim does not warrant disturbing the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A risk of suicide appeared to preclude consideration of an appellant as a qualified disabled person in <span class="Italic">DeDonato v. USPS</span>, 25 MSPR 286, 293 (1984), although the Board's analysis of the point was unclear:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds further that appellant has not presented sufficient evidence to establish that he is a "qualified handicapped person" under 29 CFR 1613.702(f) who is capable of safely performing the duties of his position without endangering the health or safety of himself or others. Appellant's medical evidence indicates that he has a severe and recurrent anxiety neuroses which has been intensified by his employment environment, and that he experiences a moderate to high fluctuation of a suicidal risk, with a guarded prognosis. Under these circumstances, the Board finds that appellant has failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case raising an inference of handicap discrimination....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without much analysis, the Board justified removal of a deputy marshal, required to carry a firearm, who experienced a paranoid delusional episode off duty, leading to an agency determination that the appellant could not be entrusted with a weapon. Discounting medical evidence favoring the appellant, the Board concluded that he "has not set forth clear evidence that his mental condition has been cured." <span class="Italic">Lassiter v. DOJ</span>, 60 MSPR 138, 146 n.3 (1993) (overruled, <span class="Italic">Haas v. DHS</span>, 2022 MSPB 36 (2022), to the extent that the Board applied 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206 to a charge of medical inability when the appellant was removed based on his current medical condition or impairment).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Frye v. Dept. of Army</span>, 63 MSPR 242, 245-46 (1994), determined that an agency discriminated against an alcoholism counselor with a bipolar disorder when the difficulties caused by that illness, affecting the appellant's behavior, could be controlled through lithium medication that the appellant agreed to take and did use for a substantial period of time:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...What is at issue here thus is not the prognosis for the appellant's medical condition but whether he will continue a course of treatment that will keep that condition under control.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge noted, then, the result in this appeal depends not upon an evaluation of medical evidence or the appellant's past behavior but upon an assessment of the risks involved on the agency's part if it is required to return him to duty as a Counselor. In certain cases, the Board has considered the risks involved in returning an appellant to work. It has found that a "well-grounded" concern existed that an appellant suffering from delusional paranoid disorder would commit violent acts in the future; that appellant, however, carried a gun as part of his duties as a Deputy United States Marshal and clearly suffered from a more serious disorder than the one at issue here, which has not manifested itself in violent conduct or threats of such conduct<span class="Italic">. See Lassiter</span>, 60 MSPR at 142-46. Moreover, the record in <span class="Italic">Lassiter</span> did not suggest that the appellant's condition could be completely controlled by medication<span class="Italic">. See</span> 60 MSPR at 142-47. Other cases in which the Board has emphasized the risks involved in returning an appellant to duty similarly have involved appellants with very serious mental and/or emotional illnesses who have engaged in violent behavior; in those cases, similarly, no showing was made that these conditions could be controlled so that the appellants could perform the duties of their positions without endangering themselves or others<span class="Italic">. See Flanagan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 56 MSPR 134, 135-38 (1992) (paranoid schizophrenic who had engaged in violent behavior); <span class="Italic">Mazzarella v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 56 MSPR 47, 51-55 (1992) (appellant with "explosive personality disorder" who had committed "extreme," "out-of-control," hyper-aggressive acts). Finally, we note that the Board has viewed with some caution an agency's generalized protestations of risk in this area, especially where an appellant's medical condition is under control and his job performance is satisfactory<span class="Italic">. See Anderson v. Department of Transportation</span>, 59 MSPR 585, 590-92 (1993);<span class="Italic"> Stanley v. Department of Justice</span>, 48 MSPR 1, 7-8 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, even if the medical evidence in this case is considered, the administrative judge's finding is supported by the record. As the dissent emphasizes below, medical opinion testimony was submitted that suggests that an individual who (like the appellant) has chosen not to take lithium regularly in the past is likely to do so again. Such testimony also revealed, however, that the possibility of compliance with lithium treatment is greater if the individual is forced to confront a significant change in his life, such as the possibility of the loss of his job and/or family, in the event of noncompliance. The administrative judge correctly noted that the agency's removal action certainly presents the appellant with the possibility of such a change and underscores the importance of compliance with lithium treatment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record suggests that the appellant has acknowledged the importance of such compliance, because his most recent treating physician (Dr. Cezayirli) has filed a statement asserting that the appellant was well, stable, and taking lithium regularly during the eight months that the appellant was under his care. We recognize that the Board has not always accorded the greatest weight to the most recent medical diagnoses, <span class="Italic">see Lassiter</span>, 60 MSPR at 145, but Dr. Cezayirli's report was based upon treatment of the appellant for a substantial amount of time, including a period predating the appellant's removal. It is therefore entitled to be accorded significant probative weight<span class="Italic">. See Bahm</span>, 38 MSPR at 632 (extent and duration of treatment by a physician is relevant in evaluating that physician's medical opinion). On balance, then, we conclude from the available medical evidence that the appellant will continue lithium treatment if returned to duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge noted, "[c]ertainly there is a risk which the agency must take if the appellant is returned to duty." We do not gainsay that risk. At the same time, however, the record before us as discussed above does not convince us that the risk here should be allowed to foreclose the appellant's employment as a Counselor or deny him the protections against handicap discrimination guaranteed under law to federal employees. For that reason, we affirm the initial decision and reverse the appellant's removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Merzweiler v. USPS</span>, 69 MSPR 274, 280-281 n.3 (1996) (sustaining the dismissal of an individual whose bipolar disorder led to behavior that in turn resulted in adverse action: "The instant appellant...has rejected several recommendations for treatment.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Declining to find lack of accommodation for a bipolar disorder of an individual who threatened his supervisor, <span class="Italic">Battle v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 63 MSPR 403, 408-10 (1994), determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant proved that he is handicapped by his mental condition, manic depression. The threatening behavior that the appellant engaged in was characterized by the agency's expert witness as a manic depressive incident. Individuals, such as the appellant, who, as a result of uncontrolled manic depression, make bold threats against the personal safety of their supervisors, are foreclosed from almost every workplace, and are substantially limited in their ability to work in all positions for <span id="Page_3467"></span>which they are otherwise qualified. <span class="Italic">See Trammell v. VA</span>, 60 MSPR 79, 84-88 (1993); <span class="Italic">Colon v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 190, 199-201 (1993); <span class="Italic">Flanagan v. USPS</span>, 56 MSPR 134, 136 (1992). Therefore, the appellant meets the portion of the definition of a handicapped employee requiring that he be foreclosed generally from the type of employment involved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the mere existence of a handicap is insufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that an appellant is a qualified handicapped employee; he must also articulate a reasonable accommodation that the agency could make to enable him to perform successfully<span class="Italic">. See Crew</span>, 58 MSPR at 602-03. After an earlier incident when the appellant threatened his supervisors, the agency attempted to accommodate the appellant's handicap. It had not taken adverse action based on the incident, had provided him with the opportunity to seek medical help and advice, and had afforded him counseling by agency personnel. After the later incident, which is the basis for this removal action, the appellant articulated the additional accommodation that the agency assure that he regularly took the medication which kept his manic depression, and the associated threatening behavior, under control.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that the accommodation that was provided to the appellant did not result in his being able to perform the essential functions of his position without endangering the health and safety of others. After he was afforded the accommodation, the appellant again threatened the safety of his coworkers. Further, the Board finds that the agency showed that the additional accommodation articulated by the appellant would be an undue hardship. Having agency officials supervise the appellant's medication schedule is highly impractical to effect. Moreover, it is inappropriate, because it causes the agency to assume the appellant's responsibility and interferes in the appellant's relationship with his physician. In short, the agency proved that the appellant is not a qualified handicapped individual because, with reasonable accommodation, he could not perform the duties of his position without endangering the safety of others, and the additional accommodation requested by the appellant after the agency proposed his removal imposed an undue hardship on the agency. The Board finds therefore that the appellant did not prove handicap discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bailey v. DOD</span>, 92 MSPR 59, 64-65 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-14 (2002) (individual was not disabled whose bipolar disorder was under control; further, threats against a coworker were serious and disruptive; statutes did not immunize disabled employees for workplace misconduct if the agency would impose the same discipline on an employee without a disability).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Flanagan v. USPS</span>, 56 MSPR 134, 139 (1992), explored the element of risk relative to removal of a clerk alleged to have assaulted a supervisor. The Board discredited a disability defense based on the mental illness of paranoid schizophrenia:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency does not dispute that the appellant is handicapped by his mental illness of paranoid schizophrenia but argues that he does not meet the criterion to establish his status as a "<span class="Italic">qualified</span> handicapped person."...&#8197;The agency essentially argues that the appellant engaged in serious misconduct which placed other employees at risk and that he has the potential for future unprovoked violent behavior.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The administrative judge noted the paucity of the medical evidence regarding whether the appellant's presence in the workplace posed a danger to himself or to others. He concluded, however, that the most recent evidence, as set forth in Dr. McLarnon's statement, considered with the fact that the appellant had worked for fourteen years after his paranoid schizophrenia was diagnosed and was now taking increased dosages of medication to prevent future problems, shows that the appellant is not a danger to himself or to others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we find that this record medical evidence coupled with the appellant's history of unprovoked workplace threats and disruption does not support this finding, we conclude that the appellant has not articulated a reasonable accommodation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this respect, we note that Dr. McLarnon's brief evaluations of November 21, 1991, and October 17, 1991, conflict with Dr. Moorhead's earlier discharge report which contained a diagnosis of homicidal ideations and a history of drinking and violent behavior. Furthermore, while the administrative judge found that the appellant testified that he had been treated regularly by Dr. McLarnon, the record shows that the appellant testified, in fact, that he had seen Dr. McLarnon only three or four times, while he had been treated regularly at the Veterans Administration since 1975. Therefore, we give greater probative weight to Dr. Moorhead's discharge-summary report than to Dr. McLarnon's evaluations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Moorhead's report shows that the appellant apparently received drug treatment, as well as occupational therapy and psychotherapy, and that he was deemed "competent and able to work." We accord this assessment little value, however. Dr. Moorhead's report refers generally to the appellant's "History of violent behavior at work" but contains no reference to the appellant's assault on a supervisor. The appellant thus may not have informed Dr. Moorhead about his assaulting a supervisor during the June 6, 1991 incident. We conclude that Dr. Moorhead's assessment that the appellant was competent to work is inadequate to support a finding that he does not pose a danger to himself or to others. In addition, we note that the appellant "was discharged AMA," i.e., against medical advice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the record shows that since April 1990 the agency had issued the appellant a letter of warning for attendance problems, had suspended him for fourteen days based in part on his threatening a manager and another employee and disrupting workroom activities, and had suspended him for fourteen days for being disrespectful to a postal manager.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore conclude that the appellant has failed to show that he can perform the essential functions of his position without endangering the health and safety of himself or others, and, in view of his diagnosed "antisocial personality traits," we find that the appellant's suggested accommodation of training his fellow employees in the proper way to treat him, i.e., apparently to avoid provoking him or to handle another potentially violent episode, is unreasonable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schmidt v. Bell</span>, 33 FEP Cases 839, 847 (E.D. Pa. 1983) (proposed accommodation of transfer to another supervisor held unreasonable in light of employee's history of emotional and physical outbursts). It is also well settled that the agency should not be required to assume the risk that the employee would jeopardize the safety of its employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">School Board of Nassau County, Florida v. Arline</span>, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 1131 (1987); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Rand v. Stone</span>, EEOC Request No. 039200005 (Jan. 30, 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we have upheld the agency's removal decision as nondiscriminatory under the 1973 Rehabilitation Act, we must consider whether the agency's removal penalty was within its broad selection discretion. We find the appellant's misconduct, particularly his unprovoked strangulation assault upon the postal manager, to be extremely serious and to fully warrant the agency's understandable concern for the physical well being of its employees, thereby outweighing possible mitigating factors, including the appellant's mental condition. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 42 MSPR 16, 19 (1989). An employee's unprovoked attack upon a supervisor constitutes a serious breach of the employer-employee relationship. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fowler v. DLA</span>, 38 MSPR 174, 176 (1988), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 878 F.2d 1446 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table). Consequently, we find that the removal penalty was within the bounds of reasonableness for the sustained offense and promotes the efficiency of the service....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A history of some violent or antisocial behavior caused by a mental disability will not require accommodation by the agency through continued employment of an employee whose disability could be controlled by medication, but who will not adhere to a treatment plan requiring the employee to take the medication on a regular basis. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Franklin v. USPS</span>, 687 F. Supp. 1214 (S.D. Ohio 1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because a disabling medical condition, aggravated by routine job stress, meant that the agency could not utilize the appellant as a food inspector or grader working with and around machinery and knives, the employee was not a qualified disabled employee whose accommodation was required. <span class="Italic">Bonde v. USDA</span>, 9 MSPR 545, 547 (1982). An employee whose duties had to be conducted with great care to avoid considerable damage to life and property was not a qualified disabled employee once it was established that he was involved in the use of "mind-altering drugs." <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 245, 252 (1994) (crane operator whose work required him to load explosive devices into the holds of ships: "The acceptable level of tolerance for the appellant's substance abuse problems is inversely proportional to the safety interest that must be safeguarded by the agency."); <span class="Italic">Bauman v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 55 MSPR 209, 213 (1992) (visual problems of an air conditioning mechanic made accommodation impossible when the job called for the operation of a crane and forklift; the operation of that equipment with the appellant's limitations would endanger the safety of the appellant and other employees).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee has a disabling condition under control and his job performance is satisfactory, the agency must be careful before attempting to remove the employee only on the basis that there is some risk that the condition may reoccur. As to an individual whose condition rendered him somewhat more susceptible to stroke and who occupied the law enforcement position of correctional officer, <span class="Italic">Stanley v. DOJ</span>, 48 MSPR 1, 8 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[E]ven if we assume <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant's risk of serious injury was greater than other employees, the agency had previously accommodated other physically handicapped employees by limiting their exposure to stress and risk while still permitting them to perform as Correctional Officers, and the agency has not shown that the appellant could not be similarly accommodated....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board does not accept generalized protestations of risk by agencies whose missions and organic statutes, although requiring a high regard for public safety, also require accommodation for disabilities. In <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 59 MSPR 585, 590-92 (1993), the agency argued that an air traffic control specialist position was so sensitive that individuals employed in that position who are afflicted by alcoholism should not be provided Rehabilitation Act protections. Although the employee ultimately did not prevail in his affirmative defense because he received reasonable accommodation, an element of risk was subsumed by an agency-specific accommodative requirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3468"></span>In its petition for review, the agency contends that the appellant was not a qualified handicapped person under 29 CFR 1613.702(f). It argues that, because of the critical nature of air traffic control functions, "safety-related" employees performing those functions should not be afforded the same protections under 29 CFR 1613.702 as individuals not so employed. The agency further argues that "the inherent safety concerns and risks associated with substance abuse must emphatically override any obligation the agency has to allow a demonstration of successful rehabilitation."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of its contention, the agency cites <span class="Italic">Borsari v. FAA</span>, 699 F.2d 106, 110-11 (2d Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 464 U.S. 833 (1983). There, the court found that removal of an air traffic controller would promote the efficiency of the service, where the controller had been found guilty of the sale and possession of illegal drugs. However, in that case, there was no allegation that the appellant was handicapped, and thus there was no determination as to whether the agency had a duty to accommodate the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also cites <span class="Italic">Kulling v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 24 MSPR 56, 59 (1984), in which the Board found that, due to the agency's overriding concern for public safety, the agency was not required to accommodate an air traffic controller who abused drugs; and it cites <span class="Italic">Cavallaro v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 20 MSPR 701, 706 (1984), in which the Board found that accommodation of an employee's alcoholism was not required where the condition caused the employee to engage in misconduct that threatened the agency's personnel and property. We agree that these decisions offer some support for the agency's position. We note, however, that, since the above-cited cases were decided, Congress has enacted section 614(c)(2) of the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act, Pub. L. 102-143 (1991), which amends Title VI of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, 49 App. USC 1421 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, and which provides, with regard to the agency, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Administrator shall establish and maintain a rehabilitation program which at a minimum provides for the identification and <span class="Italic">opportunity for treatment of those employees...whose duties include responsibility for safety-sensitive functions...who are in need of assistance in resolving problems with the use of alcohol</span> or controlled substances (emphasis supplied).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The plain language of this legislation evidences a specific legislative concern that an "opportunity for treatment" be afforded to employees of the agency who require assistance in dealing with alcoholism or substance abuse, even where those employees are responsible for safety-related functions. In our view, the agency's position on petition for review is simply incompatible with this legislative enactment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the agency's own EAP guidance manual, adopted subsequent to the issuance of the decisions relied upon by the agency, is also incompatible with the agency's position. Although that manual provides that a safety-related employee suffering from alcoholism will be removed from his normal safety-related duties and assigned to nonsafety-related duties during the initial phase of rehabilitation, it also provides that he may resume his safety-related duties during a later phase, when the EAP Manager and the flight surgeon have determined that he is alcohol-free. The EAP manual emphasizes that "[N]either the employee nor the agency is best served by having the employee unnecessarily delayed from returning to safety/sensitive-related duties."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, contrary to the agency's contentions, the fact that the appellant is employed as an air traffic controller does not preclude a finding that he is a qualified handicapped person under 29 CFR 1613.702(f), and does not relieve the agency of its obligation to provide reasonable accommodation, including a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate rehabilitation. Therefore, under all the circumstances of this case, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant was a qualified handicapped person under 29 CFR 1613.702.</p>
