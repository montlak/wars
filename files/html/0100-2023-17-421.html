<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-419"><span class="space">6.</span> Reasonable Amount; Fee Reduction</h4>
<p class="noindent">Relatively little litigation occurs over the reasonableness of the amount of a particular fee awarded by an arbitrator. <span class="Italic">DOL, OWC and AFGE Local 2513</span>, 72 FLRA 489, 491 (2021) (Member Abbott concurring), noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Authority has held that arbitrators must support their award with "a concise but clear explanation of [their] reasons for any reduction of the hours awarded."[28] The Authority has also found that a fact-finder must determine "whether the hours claimed are justified and...make a judgment--considering the nature of the case and the details of the request,...and defend his or her judgment in a reasoned (though brief) opinion--on what the case should have cost the party."[29]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[28]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Local 2002</span>, 70 FLRA at 814 (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of VA, Med. Ctr. Detroit, Mich.</span>, 64 FLRA 794, 796 (2010) (<span class="Italic">VA</span>)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[29]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">VA</span>, 64 FLRA at 797).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA opined that the measure of reasonableness under 5 USC 5596(b)(1)(A)(ii) and 5 USC 7701(b) is the same. <span class="Italic">Alabama ACT and DOD, Alabama NG</span>, 56 FLRA 231, 233 n.3 (2000). In <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-6 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Eustis</span>, 54 FLRA 1594, 1598-1600 (1998), the arbitrator reduced the fee award to a rate proportionate to the result achieved. The grievance requested as relief the award of eight hours of administrative leave. The arbitrator awarded two hours of leave and reduced the fees awarded to one-quarter of those fees. FLRA sustained the award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Consideration of a Grievant's Degree of Success In Determining Reasonable Attorney Fees Is Not Inconsistent With 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, Department of Defense Dependents Schools and Federal Education Association</span>, 54 FLRA 773, 791-93 (1998) (<span class="Italic">Dependents Schools</span>), the Authority resolved an exception to an arbitrator's award in which the agency contended that the amount of attorney fees awarded was not reasonable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g). As relevant here, the Authority applied the Supreme Court's formulation of "reasonableness" for attorney fees under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1988.[1] <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 791. In this regard, the Supreme Court held in <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby</span>, 506 U.S. 103, 114 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Farrar</span>), that the extent to which a plaintiff prevailed in the underlying litigation is the most critical factor to consider in determining reasonable attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Texas State Teachers</span>, 489 U.S. at 791-93 (finding that the extent of the plaintiff's overall success goes to the reasonableness of the award). The Court stated "that if 'a plaintiff has achieved only partial or limited success, the product of hours reasonably expended on the litigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly rate may be an excessive amount.'" <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, 506 U.S. at 114 (quoting <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 436 (1983) (<span class="Italic">Hensley</span>). The Supreme Court has also held that, in cases involving a single successful claim, "[a] reduced fee award is appropriate if the relief, however significant, is limited in comparison to the scope of the litigation as a whole." <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 440; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 435-36.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;The Authority has previously determined that the standards set forth by the Supreme Court for applying section 1988 are applicable to requests for attorney fees under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force Headquarters, 832D Combat Support Group DPCE, Luke Air Force Base, Arizona</span>, 32 FLRA 1084, 1100 (1988) (quoting the Supreme Court's statement that the standards set forth in <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. 424 are generally applicable to all cases in which Congress has authorized fees to a "prevailing party").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's application of the Supreme Court precedent in <span class="Italic">Dependents Schools</span>, 54 FLRA at 791, is consistent with decisions of the MSPB. The MSPB, also applying this precedent, has held that in determining the "reasonableness" of attorney fees under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g), it is necessary to consider whether a fee award should be reduced because the relief ordered was significantly less than what was sought. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Stein v. United States Postal Service</span>, 65 MSPR 685, 690 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Stein</span>). In this respect, the MSPB has stated that in circumstances where the relief ordered is significantly less than that sought, "an award may be reduced either by identifying the hours associated with unsuccessful claims or by simply reducing it to account for the limited success." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Smit v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 61 MSPR 612, 619 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Smit</span>)). The MSPB has also held that "when more than one claim for relief is made and the claims involve a common core of facts or are based on related legal theories, the fee determination should reflect the significance of the overall relief obtained in relation to the hours reasonably expended." <span class="Italic">Smit</span>, 61 MSPR at 618-19. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Heath v. Department of Transportation</span>, 66 MSPR 101, 105 (1995) (finding that in determining whether a fee request should be reduced "the result [of the litigation] is what matters").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator found that although the grievants did not recover the full amount of leave sought in the grievance, the grievants had prevailed within the meaning of section 7701(g)(1). The Arbitrator did not, as asserted by the Union, reduce the fees based on a finding that the grievants did not prevail. Instead, he found that the degree of the grievants' success affected what a "reasonable" fee award would be, and determined that because the grievants received only one-fourth of what they sought in the grievance, an award of the full fees requested would be unreasonable. This is consistent with the Court's holding in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, 506 U.S. 103, decisions of MSPB, such as <span class="Italic">Stein</span>, 65 MSPR at 690, applying that holding to fees awarded under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g), and the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Dependents Schools</span>, 54 FLRA at 791-93 following that precedent.[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Union does not assert that, even if the Arbitrator does have authority to reduce the attorney fee award from the amount the Union requested, the amount of fees awarded in this case is unreasonable. Accordingly, we do not reach that issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2479"></span>Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the Arbitrator's award of attorney fees is not deficient as contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Next, the Agency contends that the Arbitrator erred by awarding attorney fees for what it alleges are the Union's unsuccessful claims. Relying on <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, the Agency asserts that the Union's claims were distinct; the Union succeeded only on one of its claims; and the Authority should proportionately reduce the fee award to reflect the Union's lack of success.[64]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[64]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 15 (based on its contention that the Union succeeded on only one of its five claims, the Agency argues that an 80% reduction is proper, regardless of the number of hours that the Union attorneys spent on those allegedly unsuccessful claims). Even if we agreed that the Union's claims were distinct, the Court in <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> expressly rejected a reduction based on a ratio of successful to unsuccessful claims. 461 U.S. at 435 n.11; <span class="Italic">see also Guy v.

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, the Court stated that "the most critical factor" in determining the reasonableness of a fee award "is the degree of success obtained."[65] If a party "fail[s] to prevail on a claim that is distinct in <span class="Italic">all respects</span> from his successful claims, the[n the] hours spent on the unsuccessful claim should be excluded in considering the amount of a reasonable fee."[66] But where a prevailing party makes more than one claim, and the claims involve a "common core of facts" or are "based on related legal theories," the Court stated that the fee determination should reflect the significance of the overall relief obtained in relation to the hours reasonably expended.[67]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Union's claims arose from a common core of fact: the Agency limiting overtime to Saturdays. In the national grievance, the Union contended that <span class="Italic">by limiting overtime to Saturdays</span>, the Agency violated: Section 2.A's mandate to distribute overtime equitably; Section 2.D's requirement to "permit...employees to...work overtime on a regular workday"; and Title VII. Although the Union also alleged that the Agency violated Section 2.A by failing to provide the affected locals with the information required by that section, that allegation--like the others--was brought <span class="Italic">because</span> the Agency limited overtime offers to Saturdays. In addition, the Union's claim that the Agency committed a ULP was predicated on its claims that the Agency violated Article 24. Thus, the ULP claim was legally dependent on the Union's contractual claims.[71]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[71]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2241</span>, 49 FLRA 1403, 1406 (1994) (finding racial discrimination claim related to contractual claim, as both challenged the agency's decision to suspend the grievant); <span class="Italic">Morey v.

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of HHS, Gallup Indian Medical Center, Navajo Area Indian Health Service</span> (<span class="Italic">HHS</span>)[72] supports its contention that the Union's claims should be treated as distinct. However, unlike the union counsel in <span class="Italic">HHS</span>, the Union attorneys here devoted their time to the litigation as a whole. And, under <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, when counsel's time is <span class="Italic">not</span> "expended on a claim-by-claim basis," the "lawsuit <span class="Italic">cannot</span> be viewed as a series of discrete claims."[74] We must apply the Court's precedent. Accordingly, <span class="Italic">HHS</span> is not dispositive, and we conclude that the Union's claims are related.[75]</p>

Dep't of Treasury</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 612, 619 (1994) (finding three claims "related" because they "involved a common core of facts relating to the appellant's status as a whistleblower"). The Agency also reintroduces its contention that the Union pursued five, as opposed to four, claims. Exceptions Br. at 15, 17-18. Specifically, it argues that to the extent that the Arbitrator found that the Union raised four claims, that finding is based on a nonfact. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 15 n.8 (stating that the Arbitrator appeared to adopt the Union's argument that it alleged four claims in the national grievance).

As the Agency has not established that a central fact underlying the award is clearly erroneous, but for which the arbitrator would have reached a different result, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Union's claims are related, we must now consider whether the awarded fee is reasonable in light of the level of the Union's success.[76] Where, as here, "a lawsuit consists of related claims, a plaintiff who has won substantial relief should not have his attorney's fee reduced simply because [he did not prevail on] each contention."[77] The Court has stated that parties may raise alternative legal grounds, "and [a] court's rejection of[,] or failure to reach[,] certain grounds is not a sufficient reason for reducing a fee."[78] However, if a party "has achieved only partial or limited success, the product of hours reasonably expended on the litigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly rate may be an excessive amount."[79]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">To determine whether the Union achieved substantial success or limited success, we look first to the local settlement agreements. None of those agreements mention the specific claims against the Agency. And although the local agreements state that they represent a <span class="Italic">full</span> resolution of the claims arising out of the national grievance, they also provide that the Agency does not admit to violating "any statute, regulation, rule,...&#8197;or the [master] agreement." Therefore, the local settlement agreements do not provide any indication as to the degree of the Union's success on a specific claim.[81] Accordingly, to determine the degree of the Union's success, it is necessary to consider whether the relief that the Union obtained through the settlements was <span class="Italic">significantly</span> less than what it originally sought.[82]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[81]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Ill. Welfare Rights Org. v. Miller</span>, 723 F.2d 564, 567 (7th Cir. 1983) ("Although some settlement agreements may be structured so that they dispose of the original claims in a way that allows the court to decide whether a particular claim has been ultimately successful or unsuccessful, this will not always be the case.

U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 65 M.S.P.R. 685, 690 (1994)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union sought the following remedies in its grievance: a "cease and desist" order; backpay to all affected employees; and a notice posting stating that the Agency committed a ULP. Through the local settlement agreements, the Union obtained only the backpay remedy, but it was able to secure over $400,000 in backpay for hundreds of employees over "eight geographic locations." We agree with the Arbitrator that the value of the backpay remedy is "substantial" and not significantly diminished by the Union's failure to obtain a cease-and-desist order or a notice posting. As the Arbitrator found, the payment of the backpay remedy will provide notice to employees that the Agency erred and presumably deter the Agency from engaging in similar conduct in the future. Thus, although the Union did not obtain the precise relief that it initially requested, we cannot find that it achieved only limited success warranting a reduction in the awarded fee.[88]</p>

In this regard, the Supreme Court held in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, 506 U.S. at 114, that the extent to which a plaintiff prevailed in the underlying litigation is the most critical factor to consider in determining reasonable attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See also Texas State Teachers Association v. Grievant Independent School District</span>, 489 U.S. 782, 791-93 (1989) (finding that the extent of the plaintiff's overall success goes to the reasonableness of the award).

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's application of the Supreme Court precedent in <span class="Italic">Fort Eustis</span> is consistent with decisions of the MSPB. The MSPB has held that in determining the "reasonableness" of attorney fees under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g), it is necessary to consider whether a fee award should be reduced because the relief ordered was significantly less than what was sought. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Stein</span>, 65 M.S.P.B. at 690.

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found that the parties' agreement did not require the Agency to grant the grievant a noncompetitive accretion of duties promotion, as had been argued by the Union. Instead, the Arbitrator found that the grievant is entitled to back pay for time that he had not already been compensated for performing higher grade duties. The Arbitrator emphasized that the maximum amount of time that constituted an unfair personnel action in this case--"approximately seven months"--was relatively small, "compared to the forty-five months of retroactive [temporary] promotion back pay" which the Agency had, prior to the hearing, agreed to pay the grievant. Given the fact that the Union's attorney was not designated by the Union until the date of the hearing, the Arbitrator determined that the attorney's impact on the outcome of the case did not warrant the amount of fees requested by the Union. In addition, while not relied upon by the Arbitrator in his award, we note that the purpose of the arbitration hearing was to try to obtain a permanent accretion of duties promotion for the grievant. This did not occur, which reflects that the Union prevailed to a lesser extent than it had sought to accomplish. We further note that the Union presents no evidence to support its claim that the Arbitrator limited attorney fees in a manner that is contrary to the terms of the Back Pay Act. Accordingly, the reduction in fees is consistent with the cases cited above.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;The Authority has previously determined that the standards set forth by the Supreme Court for applying section 1988 are applicable to requests for attorney fees under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See Department of the Air Force Headquarters, 832D Combat Support Group DPCE, Luke Air Force Base, Arizona</span>, 32 FLRA 1084, 1100 (1988) (quoting the Supreme Court's statement that the standards set forth in <span class="Italic">Hensley v.

<p class="noindent-1">The threshold requirement for entitlement to attorney fees under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, is a finding that the grievant was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, which resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">Ala. Ass'n of Civilian Technicians</span>, 54 FLRA 229, 232 (1998) (<span class="Italic">Ala. Nat'l Guard</span>). Once such a finding is made, the Act further requires that an award of fees be: (1) in conjunction with an award of backpay to the grievant on correction of the personnel action; (2) reasonable and related to the personnel action; and (3) in accordance with the standards established under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g), which pertain to attorney fee awards by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). <span class="Italic">Ala. Nat'l Guard</span>, 54 FLRA at 232.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7701(g)'s standards for an award of attorney fees are as follows: (1) the employee must be the prevailing party; (2) the award of fees must be warranted in the interest of justice; (3) the amount of the fees must be reasonable; and (4) the fees must have been incurred by the employee. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Phila.

<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that to the extent that the Arbitrator found that the grievant was not the prevailing party, and on that basis awarded a reduced fee, the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority applies the definition of "prevailing party" adopted by the MSPB. Under this definition, an employee is the prevailing party within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) when the employee "received an enforceable judgment or settlement which directly benefited [the employee] at the time of the judgment or settlement." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 987</span>, 64 FLRA 884, 886 (2010) (quoting <span class="Italic">U.S. GSA, Ne. &#x0026; Caribbean Region, N.Y., N.Y., </span>61 FLRA 68, 70 (2005) (citation omitted)).

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's consideration of the Union's degree of success is consistent with the applicable legal standard. In this case, although the <span id="page_2481"></span>Arbitrator mitigated the penalty against the grievant from a fourteen-day suspension to a written reprimand, he also sustained both charges against the grievant that the parties pursued at arbitration. The Arbitrator concluded that a reasonable attorney fee award should reflect the grievant's degree of success. The Arbitrator's award in this regard, reducing the amount of fees requested, is consistent with the above-cited precedent. <span class="Italic">See also NAGE, Local R4-6, </span>54 FLRA 1594, 1599-1600 (1998) (upholding arbitrator's determination that it was reasonable to reduce requested attorney fees to an amount proportionate to degree of success achieved).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union acknowledges that an attorney fee award may be reduced by the number of hours devoted to unsuccessful claims.&#x2003;However, the Union contends that a proportionate attorney fee award is not appropriate in this case because there is no separate claim in which the grievant was unsuccessful.<span class="Italic"> </span>The Union's contention does not demonstrate that the award is deficient. As discussed above, under Authority precedent, arbitrators may reduce requested attorney fees based on the degree of success achieved even in situations involving a single successful claim. <span class="Italic">Forest Serv. Council, </span>56 FLRA at 742.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also claims that it should receive a fully compensatory fee because it obtained "truly excellent results." However, as stated above, arbitrators may reduce attorney fees based on the degree of success achieved. <span class="Italic">Forest Serv. Council, </span>56 FLRA at 742. Therefore, as the Arbitrator here found that the Union did not prevail in all aspects of the matter, it was not impermissible for him to reduce the attorney fees sought. Accordingly, we find that the Arbitrator's determination regarding the reasonableness of the fee is consistent with &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3354 and DOD, DCMA</span>, 66 FLRA 305, 306 (2011) (sustaining award reducing fees by 50% when arbitrator found just cause for discipline but mitigated suspension to letter of discipline: "The Union contends that the Arbitrator's decision to reduce the amount of fees is deficient because the Union succeeded on the only issue before the Arbitrator, i.e., whether the grievant's penalty should be reduced. Contrary to the Union's assertion, this issue was not the sole issue before the Arbitrator. Rather, the issues before him also included whether the grievant was guilty of the alleged misconduct.").</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">DOD, DFAS and AFGE Local 2510</span>, 60 FLRA 281, 286-89 (2004) (<span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 60 FLRA 636 (2005)), <span class="Italic">petition for review dismissed for lack of jurisdiction,</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2510 v. FLRA</span>, 453 F.3d 500 (D.C. Cir. 2006), FLRA reduced fees, rather than remanding the case to an arbitrator to reevaluate them, based on FLRA's perception that the amount of time put into the case was not warranted by the complexity of the issues. FLRA deemed the fees awarded by the arbitrator, $74,700, excessive for the case (a 14-day suspension); fees were reduced to $33,413:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency challenges the reasonableness of the hours expended on the case by the Union's attorney. The Agency asserts that the number of hours awarded to the Union is unreasonable because the nature of the case and the experience of the Union attorney make it "extremely unlikely that it was necessary to incur such a vast number of billable hours[.]" The Agency also claims that the Arbitrator failed to draw a distinction between in-office work and work requiring greater skill. In addition, the Agency maintains that the Union attorney should have been required to demonstrate that none of the hours claimed were attributable to the removal arbitration involving the grievant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In resolving exceptions to attorney fee awards under the Back Pay Act, the Authority applies the decisions of the MSPB and the Federal Circuit addressing the standards of &#x00A7; 7701(g) because these standards have been expressly adopted by the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1547</span>, 58 FLRA 241, 242-43 (2002). In addition, the Authority has also considered relevant decisions of other federal courts where appropriate. <span class="Italic">See, e.g, United States Dep't of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Wash., D.C. and Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Ray Brook, N.Y., </span>46 FLRA 1002 (1992) (Authority agreed with the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the District of Columbia and Ninth Circuits, which, contrary to the MSPB and the Federal Circuit, held that when a union maintains a legal representation fund, attorney fees for union-employed attorneys should be calculated on a market rate, rather than on a cost-plus, basis).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the Authority has recognized that identical or similar standards to those of &#x00A7; 7701(g) apply under other federal fee-shifting statutes, and has taken into account federal court decisions applying those other statutes. <span class="Italic">See AFGE Local 1547, </span>58 FLRA at 243 (adopting the definition of "prevailing party" set forth in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon Bd. &#x0026; Health Care, Inc. v.

Likewise, the MSPB and the Federal Circuit also look to decisions of other federal courts when applying the standards of &#x00A7; 7701(g). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Crumbaker v. Merit Systems Protection Bd.,</span> 781 F.2d 191, 195 (Fed.

Bd. of Educ.</span> <span class="Italic">of Memphis City Schools</span>, 611 F.2d 624, 636-37 (6th Cir. 1979)). Consequently, we will consider decisions of other federal courts, in addition to the Federal Circuit, that have applied federal fee-shifting statutes with standards identical to &#x00A7; 7701(g), such as the requirement that the amount of fees must be reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The starting point in the determination of whether an award of attorney fees is reasonable is the "number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate." <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force Headquarters, 832d Combat Support Group DPCE, Luke Air Force Base, Ariz.</span>, 32 FLRA 1084, 1100 (1988) (quoting <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983) <span class="Italic">(Hensley</span>)) (<span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span>). "[F]ee requests must be closely examined to ensure that the number of hours expended was reasonable." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Def. Educ.

The Authority scrutinizes the number of hours for which fees were awarded because the number of hours expended are not necessarily those "reasonably expended." <span class="Italic">See Luke AFB, </span>32 FLRA at 1101 (quoting <span class="Italic">Hensley, </span>461 U.S. at 434); <span class="Italic">accord Losure v.

Cir. 1980) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (<span class="Italic">Copeland</span>)) (<span class="Italic">Losure</span>)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In assessing whether the amount of an award of fees is reasonable within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7701(g), the MSPB imposes standards of "efficiency and economy of time." <span class="Italic">Kling v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 2 MSPR 464, 472-73 (1980). Accordingly, the MSPB has reduced an attorney fee award when the claimed number of hours is excessive or not necessary. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Rose v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 47 MSPR 5, 12 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Rose</span>). In <span class="Italic">Rose</span>, the MSPB also authorized the reduction of fees where there was insufficient evidence to establish that the requested fees were reasonable and approved percentage reductions of fees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 13, 17.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;In certain circumstances the MSPB will remand to the administrative judge (AJ) for further adjudication. <span class="Italic">See, for example, Martinez v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 89 MSPR 104 (2001) (AJ never determined reasonable market rate); <span class="Italic">Diehl v. United States Postal Serv., </span>88 MSPR 104 (2001)<span class="Italic"> </span>(remanded for AJ to determine which tasks were attributable to clerical work where fee agreement required lower rate); <span class="Italic">Lynch v.

Investigative Serv.</span>, 19 MSPR 462 (1984) (same). However, we do not view the remand policy of the MSPB to be binding on us in the review of arbitration awards under &#x00A7; 7122 of the Statute. The policy is not a standard set forth in &#x00A7; 7701(g).<span class="Italic"> See United States Dep't of Agric., Animal &#x0026; Plant Health Inspection Serv., Plant Prot. &#x0026; Quarantine</span>, 53 FLRA 1688, 1695 (1998) (Authority determined to no longer apply as a statutory requirement for an award of attorney fees the MSPB's requirement of its administrative judges that they resolve requests for attorney fees in a fully articulated, reasoned decision). Moreover, in resolving exceptions, the Authority has specifically acknowledged the differences between cases before the MSPB and cases before arbitrators and the Authority. <span class="Italic">See Naval Air Dev. Ctr., Dep't of the Navy, </span>21 FLRA 131, 135 (1986). With respect to remands, there are different financial consequences to parties between a remand by the MSPB to one of its own AJs in an administrative proceeding and an order of the Authority directing the parties to resubmit a matter to private arbitration. In any event, a remand is not necessary in this case because the fully developed record allowed the Arbitrator to address the reasonableness of the hours spent based on the time records submitted by the attorney, and similarly provides a sufficient basis for our determination herein. While the MSPB has also remanded when it has found that an administrative judge failed to address an agency's challenges with respect to hours claimed, <span class="Italic">see Casali</span> <span class="Italic">v. Dep't of the Treasury,</span> 81 MSPR 347, 353 (1999) (<span class="Italic">Casali</span>), the Arbitrator here made specific findings as to the reasonableness of the award which addressed the Agency's objections. The remedy of a reduction of fees is appropriate where the record does not show that the expenditure of the claimed hours was necessary. <span class="Italic">See Casali</span>, 81 MSPR at 354 (citing <span class="Italic">Wright v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, 53 MSPR 427, 433 (1992); <span class="Italic">Rose</span>, 47 MSPR at 12). The arbitrator is not required to evaluate every billable entry in a voluminous record. <span class="Italic">See Casali</span>, 81 MSPR at 354 (citing <span class="Italic">Crumbaker</span>, 781 F.2d at 195).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More specifically, in assessing efficiency and economy of time, the MSPB applies the factors set forth in the landmark case of<span class="Italic"> Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express,</span> 488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1974) (<span class="Italic">Johnson</span>). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kling v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 2 MSPR 464, 471 n.6 (1980). In <span class="Italic">Johnson, </span>the court suggested that fee awards be based on the following criteria: (1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of issues; (3) the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly; (4) the preclusion of other employment due to acceptance of the case; (5) the customary fee for similar work in <span id="page_2482"></span>the community; (6) the fixed or contingent nature of the fee; (7) time limitations imposed by the client or circumstances; (8) the amount involved and result obtained; (9) the experience, reputation and ability of the attorney; (10) the undesirability of the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases. Accordingly, under <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, a fee award is not reasonable if the amount of the attorney fees is significantly disproportionate to the amount involved in the case. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Copper Liquor, Inc., v. Adolph Coors Co., </span>684 F.2d 1087, 1097 (5th Cir. 1982), <span class="Italic">overruled as to other matters, Int'l Woodworkers of Am. v. Champion Int'l Corp., </span>790 F.2d 1174 (5th Cir. 1986) (amount of fee award reduced by 25% because it was significantly disproportionate to the amount involved) (<span class="Italic">Copper Liquor</span>); <span class="Italic">Watson v. State Farm Lloyds, </span>2000 WL 42174 (N.D. Tex. 2000) (fees totaling 55% of the amount involved were not reasonable).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In assessing efficiency and economy of time, the MSPB also takes into account the attorney's expertise in labor and employment law, which is reflected in the market rate for the services rendered. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Sailor-Nimocks v. OPM, </span>66 MSPR 438, 443-44 (1995) (amount of time allowed for research reduced, in part, because of the extent of the attorney's years of practice in federal sector labor law) (<span class="Italic">Sailor-Nimocks</span>); <span class="Italic">Emelio v. Postal Serv., </span>27 MSPR 233, 237 (1985) (because of counsel's claimed expertise in labor law, the MSPB determined that time spent on legal research was "unreasonably long") (<span class="Italic">Emelio</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court further advises that under fee-shifting statutes, attorneys who are not being compensated at market rates by their clients must exercise "billing judgment." <span class="Italic">Hensley, </span>461 U.S. at 434. In the Court's view, this requires an effort to exclude from a fee request hours that are "excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary." <span class="Italic">See id.</span>; <span class="Italic">accord Luke AFB, </span>32 FLRA at 1101 (quoting <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 434). The Court admonished that "[i]n the private sector, 'billing judgment' is an important component in fee setting. It is no less important here. Hours that are not properly billed to one's <span class="Italic">client</span> also are not properly billed to one's <span class="Italic">adversary</span> pursuant to statutory authority." <span class="Italic">Hensley, </span>461 U.S. at 434 (quoting <span class="Italic">Copeland, </span>641 F.2d at 891) (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In evaluating whether "billing judgment" has been exercised, a determination must be made as to "what the case should have cost the party who submitted the request." <span class="Italic">Crumbaker, </span>781 F.2d at 195.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying these principles here, we find, for the following reasons, that the amount of the attorney fees awarded by the Arbitrator is deficient because it is not reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the grievance concerned the 14-day suspension of the grievant, and the ancillary issues of the Agency's denial of access to the work site to the grievant during that suspension, and the Agency's failure to provide the Union with information. The award of attorney fees in the amount of $74,700 was based on the expenditure of 332 hours at an hourly rate of $225. Included in the 332 hours are approximately 33 hours for research, 44 hours for the post-hearing brief, and 31 hours for the fee application itself.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's determination of the hourly rate was based on a market determination in consideration of the attorney's experience in labor and employment law. As indicated in his affidavit in support of the attorney fee request, the attorney has been on the staff of the American Federation of Government Employees since 1979. In his affidavit, he stated that he has represented numerous employees before MSPB and arbitrators, has significant experience before the Authority and the courts at both trial and appellate levels, and has extensive experience in brief preparation, including briefs to the United States Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the attorney's extensive experience in labor and employment law, the 33 hours spent for research and the 44 hours spent on the post-hearing brief are excessive given the nature of the case; that is, one arising out of a 14-day suspension. The attorney's fee application detailed the activities for which he billed the Union and a breakdown of the number of hours associated with various activities. The attorney billed the Union for 44 hours in preparation of the post-hearing brief. In <span class="Italic">Emelio</span>, 27 MSPR at 237, the MSPB found the amount of time expended for research was excessive because of counsel's expertise in labor law, and reduced the hours claimed from 24.4 hours to 10 hours.<span class="Italic"> See also e.g., Sailor-Nimocks, </span>66 MSPR at 443-44 (amount of time allowed for research reduced, in part, because of the extent of the attorney's years of practice in federal sector labor law). Similarly, in the instant case we believe that is it is appropriate to reduce the amount of hours the attorney billed for research and the post-hearing brief, given the level of the attorney's experience in labor and employment law. Accordingly, the 33 hours claimed for research will be reduced to 13 hours. For the same reason, the 44 hours claimed for preparation of the post-hearing brief will be reduced to 18 hours. This reduces the total hours claimed in these categories from 77 hours to 31 hours, reducing the total hours from 332 hours to 286 hours.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The MSPB has also ruled that preparation of time charges and calculating fees is mostly clerical, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., McKinney v. Dep't of the Air Force, </span>26 MSPR 267, 269 (1985) (<span class="Italic">McKinney</span>), and has found the time spent preparing a motion for attorney fees to be excessive in several cases and reduced those hours significantly, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., May v. Dep't of Transp., </span>28 MSPR 357, 364 (1985) (time spent preparing motion for attorney fees reduced from 20.75 hours to 10 hours); <span class="Italic">Logan v. United States Dep't of Housing &#x0026; Urban Dev</span>., 23 MSPR 345, 351 (1984) (amount of time spent on attorney fee motion reduced by half); <span class="Italic">McKinney</span>, 26 MSPR at 269-70 (time spent in preparing time charges and calculating fees reduced from 2.5 hours to .5).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The hours that the attorney claimed for preparing the fee application in this case are excessive in light of the record before us.&#x2003;Consistent with the MSPB decisions cited above, the hours claimed in this category will be reduced from 31 hours to 9 hours, because the 31 hours claimed for the "preparation of application for fees" appear to be attributable to time spent on the motion for attorney fees as well as preparing time charges and calculating fees. This reduces the total hours claimed in this category from 31 hours to 9 hours, reducing the total hours from 286 hours to 264 hours.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we reduce the remaining hours claimed because the fee award is significantly disproportionate to the amount involved in this case and to account for a failure to exercise billing judgment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This matter was a fairly straightforward case: involving the 14-day suspension of the grievant, the Agency's denial of access to the grievant during that suspension, and the Agency's failure to provide the Union with information. We recognize that because the grievant also served as the local Union president, the Union had institutional interests beyond the 14 days of pay involved in the suspension. Nevertheless, in our view, the amount of the fee award is significantly disproportionate to the amount and interests involved and should be reduced accordingly.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, based on our finding that the hours claimed are excessive, we find no evidence of the exercise of billing judgment in this case. As the Supreme Court held in <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, hours that are not properly billed to one's client also are not properly billed to one's adversary pursuant to statutory authority. <span class="Italic">Hensley, </span>461 U.S. at 434. Under &#x00A7; 7701(g), the Federal Circuit considers what the case should have cost the grievant. <span class="Italic">See Crumbaker, </span>781 F.2d at 195.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we will reduce the remaining total hours to account for the fee award being significantly disproportionate to the amount involved and for the failure to exercise billing judgment. The Authority has not previously had occasion to apply a remedy for the failure to exercise billing judgment. Likewise, it appears that the Federal Circuit and the MSPB have not had occasion to apply a remedy for the failure to exercise billing judgment. However, several cases have applied the remedy of reducing the hours by a percentage. <span class="Italic">See Copper Liquor, </span>684 F.2d at 1097 (amount of fee award reduced by 25% because it was significantly disproportionate to the amount involved); <span class="Italic">Hopwood v. State of Texas</span>, 236 F.3d 256, 278-79 (5th Cir. 2000) (amount of fee award reduced by 25% for failure to exercise billing judgment); <span class="Italic">Walker v. United States Dep't of Housing &#x0026; Urban Dev., </span>99 F.3d 761, 770 (5th Cir. 1996) (proper remedy for failing to exercise billing judgment is to reduce compensable hours a percentage). We believe that such an approach is warranted here. As such, we reduce the remaining total hours by 25% to account for the fee award being significantly disproportionate to the amount involved and by another 25% for the failure to exercise billing judgment. This results in reducing the compensable hours from 264 hours to 148.5 hours, reducing the amount of attorney fees from $74,700 to $33,412.50.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we deny the Agency's claims that the amount of the award is deficient because the services may not be attributable solely to the grievant's suspension and because the amount should reflect distinctions on the basis of the type of service. The Agency has failed to demonstrate that any portion of the fee award is attributable to the removal case. Likewise, the Agency has failed to demonstrate that the standards established under &#x00A7; 7701(g) require distinctions based on the type of legal service performed. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Crumbaker</span>, 781 F.2d at 193-94 (the appropriate billing rate for travel time is the same billing rate for other time spent on a case because the attorney incurs an opportunity cost equal to the fee that would have been charged to another client had the attorney not been traveling)<span class="Italic">; accord NAGE Local R5-188,</span> 46 FLRA 458, 466 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA sustained an award that reduced fees in an arbitration successfully challenging a suspension when the union sought fees for time that was invested in a prior MSPB appeal. The arbitrator determined that the linkage of the two litigations was insufficient to permit the time, or all of the time, spent before the MSPB to be tacked onto the suspension case. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2002 and DHS, FLETC</span>, 70 FLRA 812 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting).</p>
