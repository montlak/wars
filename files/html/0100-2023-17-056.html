<h3 class="h3" id="sec9-55"><span class="space">D.</span> PROCEDURAL ARBITRABILITY ISSUES</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Bremerton MTC and Dept. of Navy, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard,</span> 64 FLRA 103, 105 (2009) (reconsideration denied., 64 FLRA 543 (2010)) states that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Procedural arbitrability involves procedural questions, such as whether the preliminary steps of the grievance procedure have been exhausted or excused. Substantive arbitrability involves questions regarding whether the subject matter of a dispute is arbitrable. <span class="Italic">Fraternal Order of Police, New Jersey Lodge 173,</span> 58 FLRA 384, 385 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting) (<span class="Italic">FOP</span>) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In particular, substantive arbitrability includes questions of subject matter jurisdiction--that is, whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate a particular category or type of dispute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Through 2018, FLRA allowed arbitrators to make their procedural arbitrability determinations, e.g., the timeliness of a grievance, with limited substantive review of those decisions. That deference stopped with when FLRA decided it would consider nonfact exceptions to arbitrators' procedural arbitrability determinations, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3294 and DHUD</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v70/70-90.html">70 FLRA 432</a>, 434 (2018) (Member DuBester concurring), enabling the FLRA to set aside awards that failed properly to apply clear contractual procedural, e.g., timeliness, requirements. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3294</span> did not completely abandon deference to arbitrators' contract interpretations, but the decision certainly limited that deference--depending on the facts and contract language. <span class="Italic">DODDEA and FEA</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-76.html">73 FLRA 398</a> (2022), signals a trend towards more deference to arbitrators' interpretations of contractual procedural requirements. [Refer to "<a href="0100-2023-17-130.html#sec9-128">Contract Interpretation</a>" for discussion of <span class="Italic">DODDEA</span>.] The decisions that follow show more deference to arbitrators' contract interpretations. than was provided starting in 2018--at least until. <span class="Italic">DODDEA</span> in 2020. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic"><span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons, Dublin and AFGE Local 3584</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-68.html">72 FLRA 343</a>, 344-45 (2021) (Chairman DuBester dissenting in part; Member Abbott concurring) (based on the timing of the union's knowledge of the violations, portion of award set aside when the union did not grieve an overtime distribution claim within the time set by the contract); <span class="Italic">Dept.</span> of State, Passport Services and NFFE Local 1998</span>, 71 FLRA 327, 328 (2019) (Chairman Kiko dissenting; Member DuBester concurring) ("It is important to note that procedural steps and requirements promote the timely, effective, and efficient processing of grievances. In recent cases, we have noted that parties and arbitrators may not simply ignore procedural requirements and that in many cases, the failure to meet such requirements--in particular those that establish timelines--may prove fatal," <span class="Italic">citing</span> "<span class="Italic">U.S. DOD Domestic Elementary &#x0026; Secondary Schs</span>., 71 FLRA 236 (2019) (Member Abbott concurring; Member DuBester dissenting) (union did not invoke arbitration within twenty days of last stage in grievance procedure); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,</span> 71 FLRA 179 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting) (union did not schedule hearing within six months of invoking arbitration); <span class="Italic">U.S. DOD Educ.

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority generally will not find an arbitrator's ruling on the procedural arbitrability of a grievance deficient on grounds that directly challenge the procedural arbitrability ruling itself. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3882</span>, 59 FLRA 469, 470 (2003).

For a procedural arbitrability determination to be found deficient as contrary to law, the appealing party must establish that the determination is contrary to procedural requirements established by statute that apply to the parties' negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., U.S. Customs &#x0026; Border Prot., U.S. Border Patrol, El Paso, Tex.</span>, 61 FLRA 122, 124 (2005).

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's argument that the Arbitrator's timeliness determination fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement directly challenges the Arbitrator's procedural arbitrability finding. Similarly, the Agency's contention that the timeliness determination is based on a nonfact because it penalizes the Agency's supposed compliance with the Statute also directly challenges the Arbitrator's procedural arbitrability determination. Because both of these arguments directly challenge the Arbitrator's procedural arbitrability determination, neither provide a basis for finding the award deficient. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 3615, </span>65 FLRA 647, 649 (2011) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Energy, Sw.

We, therefore, deny these claims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also construe the Agency's argument that the Arbitrator's timeliness determination is based on a nonfact because it punishes the Agency for allegedly complying with the Statute as an assertion that the award is contrary to law, specifically, the Statute. The Agency has not identified any specific procedural requirements established by the Statute that apply to the parties' negotiated grievance procedure with which the Arbitrator's award conflicts. Therefore, we find that the Agency's contention provides no basis for finding the Arbitrator's timeliness determination deficient. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Fla., </span>65 FLRA 1004, 1007-08 (2011) (denying party's claim that arbitrator's procedural arbitrability determination was contrary to law because party failed to identify any specific statutory procedural requirements that the award conflicted with).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">An arbitrator's determination as to whether an issue has been timely raised under a negotiated grievance procedure constitutes a determination regarding the procedural arbitrability of that issue. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., National</span> <span class="Italic">Labor Relations Board v. National Labor Relations</span> <span class="Italic">Board Union, </span>54 FLRA 56, 61 (1998). When an arbitrator finds that a grievance does not meet the specificity requirements of the parties' collective bargaining agreement and, consequently, declines to address the merits of that legal claim, the award is a procedural arbitrability determination. <span class="Italic">See General Services Administration</span> <span class="Italic">and American Federation of Government Employees,</span> <span class="Italic">Council 236, </span>53 FLRA 925, 937-38 (1997). An arbitrator's determination of the procedural arbitrability of an issue is subject to challenge only on grounds other than those that directly challenge the procedural arbitrability determination itself. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, United States Mint, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge F1-PA</span>, 51 FLRA 1683, 1685 (1996) (<span class="Italic">U.S. Mint</span>).[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;Such grounds include a showing that the Arbitrator was biased, or that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority. <span class="Italic">See U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Mint, </span>51 FLRA at 1685.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the grievant had not sufficiently raised, at the outset of the grievance, a claim of reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act. As a result, the Arbitrator found that the reasonable accommodation claim was not before him, and he declined to resolve the merits of that claim. The Arbitrator's determination constitutes a finding that the reasonable accommodation claim was not procedurally arbitrable. Because the Union's exceptions directly challenge the Arbitrator's procedural arbitrability determination itself, they do not provide a basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent">An example of a procedural issue is the determination by the arbitrator that a claim was not properly presented during the grievance process and for that reason will not be resolved on the merits, the situation in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3615 and SSA ODAR</span>, 65 FLRA 647, 649 (2011), involving a claim for a temporary promotion:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Arbitrator's determination that the Union did not plead Articles 26 and 27 with sufficient specificity does not draw its essence from Article 24, Section 9 of the Agreement. This exception involves the Arbitrator's procedural arbitrability determination. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1741</span>, 57 FLRA 696, 696 n.1 (2002). Procedural arbitrability involves questions of whether the procedural conditions to arbitrability have been met, while substantive arbitrability involves questions of whether the subject matter of a dispute is arbitrable. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin.</span>, 64 FLRA 680, 684 (2010). Here, the Arbitrator found the Union's temporary promotion claim was not arbitrable because it did not conform to the specificity requirements in Article 24, Section 9 of the Agreement and, thus, his conclusion is a procedural arbitrability determination. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 703</span>, 55 FLRA 507, 508 (1999) (finding an arbitrator's conclusion that a grievance did not meet the specificity requirements in the parties' agreement to be a procedural arbitrability determination).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority generally will not find an arbitrator's ruling on the procedural arbitrability of a grievance deficient on grounds that directly challenge the procedural arbitrability ruling itself. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 3882</span>, 59 FLRA 469, 470 (2003). However, the Authority has stated that a procedural arbitrability determination may be found deficient on the ground that it is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>(citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 933</span>, 58 FLRA 480, 481 (2003)).

<p class="noindent-1">The Union's argument that the Arbitrator's award fails to draw its essence from the Agreement directly challenges the Arbitrator's procedural arbitrability finding and does not provide a basis for finding the award deficient. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Energy, Sw.

<p class="noindent">As to FLRA's ability to review exceptions to procedural rulings, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., <span id="page_1771"></span>FAA and NATCA</span>, 64 FLRA 772, 773-74 (2010), observed that a procedural ruling may, under limited circumstances, be contrary to law if it implicates a statutory violation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Agency's contrary-to-law exception, a procedural-arbitrability determination can be found deficient as contrary to law. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., U.S. Customs &#x0026; Border Prot., U.S. Border Patrol, El Paso, Tex.,</span> 61 FLRA 122, 124 (2005) (<span class="Italic">DHS</span>). In this connection, the Authority has recognized that "procedural requirements may be established [by statute] that apply to negotiated grievance procedures and...that a statute could be enacted establishing a filing period for grievances." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 933,</span> 58 FLRA at 481. Consequently, in order for a procedural-arbitrability determination to be found deficient as contrary to law, the appealing party must establish that the determination is contrary to procedural requirements established by statute that apply to the parties' negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">DHS,</span> 61 FLRA at 124. As the Agency's reference to actions of the Authority's GC fails to establish any such procedural requirement, we deny this exception. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 405 and DOJ, Bureau Prisons, FCI Butner</span>, 66 FLRA 437, 437 (2012) (citing <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 64 FLRA 772, 774 (2010), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, for proposition that an "arbitrator's determination of procedural arbitrability of a grievance is not deficient when excepting party fails to establish that the determination is contrary to procedural requirements established by statute that apply to the parties' negotiated grievance procedure or is deficient on grounds that do not directly challenge the procedural-arbitrability determination"); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs Portland and UPTO</span>, 64 FLRA 271, 273 (2009) (whether grievant properly raised issue in grievance proceeding was one of procedural arbitrability); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 64 FLRA 612, 613 (2010) ("One of the grounds on which a procedural arbitrability determination is subject to challenge is exceeded authority, but only insofar as the exceeded-authority claim 'do[es] not directly challenge the [arbitrability] determination itself.' <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 104</span>, 61 FLRA at 683.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Assuming a truly procedural issue before the arbitrator, the law governing challenges to procedural determinations was summarized in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 104 and NARA</span>, 61 FLRA 681, 682-83 (2006), involving a dispute over whether the union could file an institutional grievance concerning the agency's discipline of a group of employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator was tasked to determine whether the Union could file an institutional grievance on behalf of a group of employees.&#x2003;The Arbitrator examined the language of Article 23, Section 8A of the parties' agreement and determined that an institutional grievance would not pertain to an individual or group of individuals. According to the Arbitrator, that agreement provision "clearly precludes the Union from pursuing this matter as an <span class="Italic">institutional </span>grievance. Therefore, the Arbitrator determined that the matter before him was not arbitrable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's award constitutes a procedural arbitrability determination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g. United States Dep't of Def., Dependents Schools, </span>55 FLRA 1108, 1110 (1999). The Authority generally will not find an arbitrator's ruling on the procedural arbitrability of a grievance deficient on grounds that directly challenge the procedural arbitrability ruling itself. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 3882</span>, 59 FLRA 469, 470 (2003). However, the Authority has stated that a procedural arbitrability determination may be found deficient on the ground that it is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. (<span class="Italic">citing AFGE, Local 933</span>, 58 FLRA 480, 481 (2003)). In addition, the Authority has stated that a procedural arbitrability determination may be found deficient on grounds that do not directly challenge the determination itself, which include claims that an arbitrator was biased or that the arbitrator exceeded his or her authority. <span class="Italic">See id.; see also United States Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n</span>, 60 FLRA 83, 86 (2004) (<span class="Italic">citing AFGE, Local 2921</span>, 50 FLRA 184, 185-86 (1995)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When a party's exceptions dispute an award's consistency with law or regulation, the Authority reviews the questions of law and regulation raised by the award and the exceptions <span class="Italic">de novo. See, e.g., United States Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Ctrs. for Medicare &#x0026; Medicaid Servs., Baltimore, Md.</span>, 57 FLRA 704, 706 (2002). In applying the standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority determines whether the Arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">See NFFE, Local 1437</span>, 53 FLRA 1703, 1710 (1998). In making that determination, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the Arbitrator's procedural arbitrability determination is contrary to law based on provisions of the Statute dealing with the determination of appropriate units, the representational rights and duties of a labor organization, and the grievance procedure. None of these contentions demonstrates that the Arbitrator's award is contrary to law. Rather, the Union's arguments reflect its right to represent employees in the bargaining unit. However, the award does not deny the Union the right to represent bargaining unit employees in arbitration, it only establishes what type of grievance (individual, group, or institutional) must be utilized for the Union to pursue this grievance to arbitration. As such, the award does not violate the Union's right to represent employees in the bargaining unit, and the exception does not establish that the award is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that under the Statute parties "may exclude any matter from the application of the grievance procedures...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(2). As such, parties may agree "'to a [grievance] procedure having narrower coverage[&#8197;]'" than permitted under the Statute. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, Customs Serv., Southeast Region</span>, 43 FLRA 921, 925 (1992) (<span class="Italic">citing AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 3669</span>, 3 FLRA 311, 314 (1980)). In this case, the parties provided for individual, group and institutional grievances and defined an institutional grievance "as a grievance, which pertain[s] solely to the Union as opposed to an individual or group of individuals." Therefore, insofar as the Arbitrator's award is alleged to be contrary to &#x00A7; 7112, it is not.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 64 FLRA 772, 773 (2010), defined some of the limitations on exceptions founded on procedural-arbitrability determinations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As acknowledged in <span class="Italic">FAA</span> [<span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA,</span> 64 FLRA 612 (2010], one of the grounds on which a procedural-arbitrability determination is subject to challenge is a claim that the arbitrator exceeded his or her authority, but only insofar as the exceeded-authority claim "do[es] not directly challenge the [arbitrability] determination itself." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 104</span>, 61 FLRA 681, 683 (2006)). In <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, the Authority denied the Agency's exceeded-authority exception because the Agency's exceeded-authority arguments directly challenged the arbitrator's arbitrability determination itself. 64 FLRA at 613. Here, the Agency's exceeded-authority arguments again directly challenge the Arbitrator's arbitrability determination itself. Consequently, the Agency's exceeded-authority exception provides no basis for finding the determination deficient, and we deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NAAE,</span> 63 FLRA 495, 499 (2009), restated FLRA's view of reviewability of exceptions based on procedural grounds:</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, CBP claims that the award does not draw its essence from the CBA because the grievant resigned before arbitration was invoked and thus relinquished her right under the CBA to complete the grievance process. Such contention challenges the Arbitrator's procedural arbitrability determination in relation to whether the grievant could grieve the matter under the parties' CBA and as such does not provide a basis for finding the award deficient. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1931,</span> 50 FLRA 279, 281 (1995) (arbitrator's finding that grievance was not arbitrable because the grievant did not fall within the contractual definition of employee under the parties' negotiated grievance procedure was a procedural arbitrability determination and did not provide a basis for finding the award deficient).</p>

Additionally, the Agency has not demonstrated that our procedural arbitrability precedent should be modified. Therefore, applying that precedent, we deny this Agency exception.</p>

[Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-17-055.html#sec9-55">Procedural Arbitrability Issue</a>," concerning <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3294</span>.]</p>
<p class="noindent">As to an arbitrator's determination that the union failed properly to file a grievance, and the union's challenge on that procedural issue, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1454 and VA Houston Reg'l Office,</span> 63 FLRA 329, 330 (2009), declared:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority generally will not find an arbitrator's ruling on the procedural arbitrability of a grievance deficient on grounds that directly challenge the procedural ruling itself. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 3882, </span>59 FLRA 469, 470 (2003). However, such ruling may be found deficient on the ground that it is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>(citing<span class="Italic"> AFGE, Local 933, </span>58 FLRA 480, 481 (2003)). In addition, such ruling may be found deficient on grounds that do not directly challenge the ruling itself, which include claims that an arbitrator was biased or exceeded his or her authority. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator concluded that the grievance was not properly before him, because the Union failed to properly file a grievance. The Arbitrator's ruling constitutes his determination that the grievance was not procedurally arbitrable. <span class="Italic">See Fraternal Order of Police, N.J. Lodge 173, </span>58 FLRA 384, 385 (2003) quoting Elkouri &#x0026; Elkouri, <span class="Italic">How</span> <span class="Italic">Arbitration</span> <span class="Italic">Works</span> 305 (Marlin M. Volz &#x0026; Edward P. Goggin eds., 5th ed. 1997 ("Procedural arbitrability involves 'procedural questions, such as whether the preliminary steps of the grievance procedure have been exhausted or excused,' and is distinguished from substantive arbitrability, which involves questions regarding whether the 'subject matter of a dispute is arbitrable.'"). <span class="Italic">See also, e.g., AFGE, Local 2459, </span>51 FLRA 1602, 1607 (1996) (noting that cases denied on procedural arbitrability grounds are disposed of "procedurally and not on the merits"). As the Authority generally will not find a procedural arbitrability ruling deficient on grounds that directly challenge that ruling, we deny the Union's unexplained nonfact exception. <span class="Italic">E.g., AFGE, Local 1242, Council of Prison Locals 33, </span>62 FLRA 477 (2008).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also fails to demonstrate that the Arbitrator's award is contrary to law. In order for the award to be found deficient on this basis, the Union must establish that it conflicts with applicable, statutory, procedural requirements. The Union has failed to identify any such requirements with which the award allegedly conflicts. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Homeland Sec., United States Customs and Border Prot., United States Border Patrol, El Paso, Tex.,</span> 61 FLRA 122, 124 (2005). Therefore, the Union's contrary to law exception is denied.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another recurring procedural matter involves bifurcation of the timeliness and the merits of a grievance, a matter within the arbitrator's discretion, <span class="Italic">NAGE and Dept. of Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr.</span>, 63 FLRA 7, n.* (2008):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union excepted to this arbitral award on the basis that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority by "bifurcat[ing]" the procedural question of the grievance's timeliness from the merits of the grievance--that is, by treating the procedural question as a threshold matter to be decided before proceeding to the merits. Absent statutory or contractual provisions to the contrary, it is presumed that arbitrators enjoy substantial latitude to manage such procedural issues as arbitrators deem appropriate to the circumstances of the matter before them, provided, of course, that arbitrators must at all times abide by basic notions of due process. United States DHS, U.S. Customs &#x0026; Border Prot., JFK Airport, Queens, N.Y., 62 FLRA 360, 362 (2008) (citing AFGE, Local 22, 51 FLRA 1496, 1497-98 (1996)).</p>
<p class="noindent">The determination by an arbitrator concerning who are the proper parties to, and controlled by, a labor agreement is a procedural issue, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, NAS Pensacola and AFGE Local 1960</span>, 65 FLRA 1004, 1006-07 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the award is contrary to law because the award fails to recognize that the Agency and the Union are not the proper parties to the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority generally will not find an arbitrator's ruling on the procedural arbitrability of a grievance deficient on grounds that directly challenge the procedural arbitrability ruling itself. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3882</span>, 59 FLRA 469, 470 (2003). However, a procedural arbitrability determination may be directly challenged and found deficient on the ground that it is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>(citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 933</span>, 58 FLRA 480, 481 (2003)). In order for a procedural arbitrability determination to be found deficient as contrary to law, the appealing party must establish that the determination is contrary to procedural requirements established by statute that apply to the parties' negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., U.S. Customs &#x0026; Border Prot., U.S. Border Patrol, El Paso, Tex.,</span> 61 FLRA 122, 124 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's determination that the Agency and the Union are the proper parties to the grievance concerns the grievance's procedural arbitrability. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Louis Stokes Med. Ctr., Cleveland, Ohio</span>, 64 FLRA 911, 912-13 (2010) (Authority determined that exception concerning whether employee was proper grievant involved arbitrator's procedural arbitrability determination); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1931</span>, 50 FLRA 279, 281 (1995) (arbitrator's finding that grievance was not arbitrable because grievant did not fall within contractual definition of employee under parties' negotiated grievance procedure was procedural arbitrability determination). However, the Agency has failed to identify any procedural requirements established by statute that apply to the parties' negotiated grievance procedure, with which the Arbitrator's award conflicts<span class="Italic">. </span>Therefore, the Agency's contention provides no basis for finding the Arbitrator's determination deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3976 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons FCI Estill</span>, 66 FLRA 289, 290 (2011) (denial of grievance when union failed to follow requirement concerning written identification of issue to be litigated: "Here, the Union's nonfact exception directly challenges the Arbitrator's procedural-arbitrability ruling; it does not contend that the ruling is deficient for reasons that do not directly challenge the determination itself. Accordingly, the exception provides no basis for finding the ruling deficient, and we deny this exception. With regard to the Union's contrary to law exception, the Union has not identified any procedural requirements established by statute that apply to the parties' negotiated grievance procedure, with which the Arbitrator's procedural-arbitrability determination conflicts.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Exceptions were denied as disagreements with the arbitrator's determination of the timeliness of the grievance and the identity of the grievant (individual or institutional), <span class="Italic">VA Stokes Med. Ctr. and AFGE Local 31</span>, 64 FLRA 911, 912-13 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority generally will not find an arbitrator's ruling on the procedural arbitrability of a grievance deficient on grounds that directly challenge the procedural arbitrability ruling itself. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3882</span>, 59 FLRA 469, 470 (2003). However, the Authority has stated that a procedural arbitrability determination may be found deficient on the ground that it is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>(citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 933</span>, 58 FLRA 480, 481 (2003)). In addition, the Authority has stated that a procedural arbitrability determination may be found deficient on grounds that do not directly challenge the determination itself, which include claims that an arbitrator was biased or that the arbitrator exceeded his or her authority. <span class="Italic">See id; see also U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n</span>, 60 FLRA 83, 86 (2004) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2921</span>, 50 FLRA 184, 185-86 (1995)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the award fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement because the award offers relief to S.C. Such contention directly challenges the Arbitrator's procedural arbitrability determination regarding whether S.C. was a proper grievant. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1931</span>, 50 FLRA 279, 281 (1995) (arbitrator's finding that grievance was not arbitrable because the grievant did not fall within the contractual definition of employee under the parties' negotiated grievance procedure <span id="page_1773"></span>was a procedural arbitrability determination and did not provide a basis for finding the award deficient). Accordingly, this exception does not provide a basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency further asserts that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority by offering relief to a person not named in the Union's grievance, S.C. This exception also involves the Arbitrator's procedural arbitrability determination regarding whether S.C. was a proper grievant. The Authority has previously noted that exceptions to the award on the grounds that an arbitrator exceeded his or her authority will be considered only regarding arguments that "do not directly challenge the [procedural-arbitrability] determination itself[.]" <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 104, </span>61 FLRA 681, 683 (2006). <span class="Italic">See also U.S. Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin., Portland, Me., </span>64 FLRA 772, 773 (2010) (agency's exception that arbitrator exceeded his authority not considered because based on grounds that directly challenge the arbitrability determination). Here, the Agency's assertion that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority directly challenges the Arbitrator's procedural conclusion that he had the ability to grant relief to S.C. Consequently, this exception does not provide a basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Agency contests the Arbitrator's finding that the grievance was timely filed. This contention also directly challenges the Arbitrator's procedural arbitrability determination. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1501</span>, 56 FLRA 632, 636 (2000) (finding arbitrator's determination regarding the timeliness of a grievance constitutes a determination regarding the procedural arbitrability of that grievance). As a result, this argument does not provide a basis for finding the award deficient. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Okla. City Air Logistics Ctr., Tinker Air Force Base, Okla.</span>, 42 FLRA 680, 684 (1991) (citing NTEU, 35 FLRA 501, 512 (1990) (an arbitrator's determination that a grievance was timely filed concerns a matter of procedural arbitrability and disagreement with that determination provides no basis for finding an award deficient)).</p>
<p class="noindent">Questions concerning compliance with the procedural requirements of a negotiated grievance procedure are for an arbitrator. <span class="Italic">EPA, Region IV, Atlanta and NFFE Local 1907</span>, 5 FLRA 277, 279 (1981). In the context of an award determining the timeliness of a request to FMCS for appointment of a list of arbitrators, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, U.S. Mint, Philadelphia and FOP</span>, 51 FLRA 1683, 1685 (1996), determined:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award does not draw its essence from the agreement.&#x2003;According to the Agency, Article 29, Section 2 requires strict compliance by the party invoking arbitration. Thus, the Agency asserts, the Union's failure to contact the FMCS in accordance with this provision rendered the grievance nonarbitrable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's claim that the award does not draw its essence from the agreement is not properly before us. Awards resolving questions of procedural arbitrability are subject to challenge only on grounds other than those that directly challenge the determination of procedural arbitrability. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2921 and U.S. Department of the Army, Army &#x0026; Air Force Exchange Service, Dallas, Texas</span>, 50 FLRA 184, 185-86 (1995) (<span class="Italic">AFGE</span>). Such grounds include bias on the part of the Arbitrator or a showing that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 186.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Cf. VAMC Poplar Bluff and AFGE Local 2338</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-96.html">72 FLRA 494</a>, 495 (2021) (Chairman DuBester concurring) (arbitrator's determination that one, rather than another, grievance was the one actually before him for decision was not properly resolved through an interlocutory exception since the agency "would still need to present its procedural arguments to the Arbitrator in further proceedings").</p>
<p class="noindent">The issue of when an arbitrability issue may be raised, e.g., for the first time during the arbitration hearing, is an arbitrability or procedural issue for disposition by the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Base, North Island, San Diego and Int'l Ass'n of Fire Fighters Local F-33</span>, 38 FLRA 1509, 1512 (1991).</p>
