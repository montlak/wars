<p class="Body-Text">The indefinite suspension, if it extends beyond 14 days, is an adverse action; statutory and regulatory due process requirements apply. The limitation, or condition subsequent, on the indefinite suspension should be stated in the agency proposal or decision letter. It is not harmful error, however, if the agency does not state the condition subsequent that terminates the suspension until the hearing on a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">Clark v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 548, 551 (1986); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">McClure v. USPS</span>, 83 MSPR 605, 608 &#x00B6; 6 (1990) ("We conclude that since this appellant's suspension lasted only 14 days, the Board did not have jurisdiction over it at any time."). <span class="Italic">Rawls v. USPS</span>, 98 MSPR 98, 101-05 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-15 (2004), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> <span class="Italic">Rawls v. USPS,</span> 179 Fed. Appx. 693 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP), <span class="Italic">post,</span> synthesizing and distinguishing prior decisions, essentially eliminated the requirement of precise identification of a condition subsequent in an indefinite suspension by relegating the requirement to analysis under the harmful error rule, shifting to the appellant the burden of proving that the result of an appeal would likely have differed had the regulatory requirement been met:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well-settled that an indefinite suspension, to be valid, must have an ascertainable end. <span class="Italic">E.g., Martin v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury</span>, 12 M.S.P.R. 12, 17, 20 (1982), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> <span class="Italic">in part</span>, <span class="Italic">rev'd</span> <span class="Italic">in part</span> <span class="Italic">on other grounds sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">Brown</span> <span class="Italic">v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Justice</span>, 715 F.2d 662 (D.C. Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> <span class="Italic">sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">Otherson v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Justice</span>, 728 F.2d 1513 (D.C. Cir. 1984),<span class="Italic"> modified on other grounds by</span> <span class="Italic">Barresi v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 656, 663 n.5 (1994). This "ascertainable end" requirement derives from the statutory definition of a "suspension"--"the placing of an employee, for disciplinary reasons, in a <span class="Italic">temporary</span> status without duties and pay." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7501(2) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(2); <span class="Italic">Martin,</span> 12 M.S.P.R. at 17. Because a suspension must be <span class="Italic">temporary</span>, the Board has stated that, "while the exact duration of an indefinite suspension may not be ascertainable, such an action must have a condition subsequent...which will terminate the suspension," and that an indefinite suspension imposed with no ascertainable end in sight is not sustainable. <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 12 M.S.P.R. at 17, 20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In effecting the indefinite suspension here, the agency did not issue a proposal notice, <span class="Italic">Rawls,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 614 &#x00B6; 13, and its decision notice did not explicitly identify a condition subsequent that would terminate the suspension. The decision notice simply informed the appellant that he was "indefinitely suspended...in accordance with Article 16.6 (Indefinite Suspension--Crime Situation) [of the applicable collective bargaining agreement (CBA)] because the agency found reasonable cause to believe that [he had] committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment c[ould] be imposed." Article 16.6 discusses the employee's right to grieve the suspension and his right to back pay if the agency decides to return him to work, and states that the agency "may take action to discharge an employee during the period of an indefinite suspension whether or not the criminal charges have been resolved...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the AJ that the agency's decision notice, even with reference to Article 16.6, did not explicitly identify the condition subsequent that would terminate the suspension. However, we also agree with the agency's argument on review that the suspension clearly, albeit implicitly, <span class="Italic">had</span> a condition subsequent since the suspension was based on a criminal charge which must be resolved, one way or another, through criminal proceedings. <span class="Italic">Cf. Brown v. Department of Justice</span>, 715 F.2d 662, 668-69 (D.C. Cir. 1983) ("a suspension solely on the basis of indictment...<span class="Italic">must necessarily</span> be a conditional suspension, conditioned on the outcome of the employee's involvement in the criminal justice system"). It is thus apparent under the circumstances that the appellant's indefinite suspension had an ascertainable end, conditioned on the outcome of his involvement in the criminal justice system.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reversing the indefinite suspension because the agency's decision notice did not explicitly identify a condition subsequent, the AJ relied on a single Board precedent--<span class="Italic">Tigner-Keir v. Department of Energy</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. 552 (1984). In <span class="Italic">Tigner-Keir</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. at 553, the indefinite suspension was "based on alleged threats made by appellant to her supervisors." The Board, relying on <span class="Italic">Martin,</span> reversed the suspension because "no specific event or requirement which would terminate the suspension was set forth" in the agency's decision notice. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 554. We find that <span class="Italic">Tigner-Keir</span> is distinguishable, however, because the suspension there was not based on a criminal charge, as here, but rather "appear[ed] to have been taken in an attempt to forego or delay removal of an employee with emotional problems."[1] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Because the suspension in <span class="Italic">Tigner-Keir</span> was not based on a criminal charge, it did not have an ascertainable end implicitly conditioned on the outcome of any criminal proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Giacobbi v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 30 M.S.P.R. 39, 41-42 (1986), the Board reversed an indefinite suspension where the agency failed to identify any condition subsequent explicitly in its notice suspending the appellant. <span class="Italic">Giacobbi</span> is also distinguishable<span class="Italic">,</span> however, because the agency there had completed its investigation of the appellant's alleged misconduct and there was no pending criminal charge at the time the agency imposed the indefinite suspension, so that a condition subsequent was not apparent from the circumstances at the time the suspension was imposed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ also relied on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(e), which provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Indefinite suspension</span> means the placing of an employee in a temporary status without duties and pay pending investigation, inquiry, or further agency action. The indefinite suspension continues for an indeterminate period of time and ends with the occurrence of the pending conditions set forth in the notice of action which may include the completion of any subsequent administrative action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(e) (second emphasis added). This regulatory definition, in the course of describing when the suspension should end, contemplates that the condition subsequent would be "set forth in the notice of action." And Board cases involving indefinite suspensions often note that the condition subsequent was set forth in the agency's decision notice. <span class="Italic">E.g., Jones v. Department of the Army,</span> 68 M.S.P.R. 398, 402 (1995) (the agency met the requirement for a condition subsequent where the agency's decision notice provided that the suspension would continue "through such time as the criminal proceedings end[ed] and through any proposal period for any additional action"). However, the regulatory definition merely contemplates, and does not necessarily mandate, that agencies explicitly identify the conditions subsequent in their decision notices, and nothing in the regulation or its regulatory history states or suggests that an agency's failure to identify a condition subsequent explicitly in its decision notice, without more, warrants reversal of the suspension. 53 Fed. Reg. 21,619 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, in finding that the indefinite suspensions were properly imposed in <span class="Italic">Martin,</span> the Board did not mention whether the decision notices explicitly identified a condition subsequent. The Board noted, as to appellant Martin, that "the ongoing agency investigative process and the referral to the U.S. Attorney support the 'temporary' nature of the suspension," and noted as to appellants Otherson, Brown, and Charest that, "since the appellants had been indicted and criminal proceedings were ongoing, the suspensions do contain clear conditions subsequent and so can be considered 'temporary.'" <span class="Italic">Martin,</span> 12 M.S.P.R. at 21. It thus appears in <span class="Italic">Martin</span> that the conditions subsequent were not identified in the agency's decision notices but could be inferred from the circumstances surrounding the indefinite suspensions. We therefore find that, while the better practice is for agencies to identify the conditions subsequent explicitly in their decision notices imposing indefinite suspensions, the pertinent requirement for a valid indefinite suspension is that the suspension <span class="Italic">have</span> a condition subsequent, rather than that the agency's decision notice <span class="Italic">explicitly identify</span> the condition subsequent. We further find, for the reasons discussed above, that the appellant's indefinite suspension here did have a condition subsequent or ascertainable end.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2118"></span>Even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the agency's failure to identify the condition subsequent explicitly in its decision notice constituted procedural error,[2] we find that it did not constitute harmful error warranting reversal of the indefinite suspension. In<span class="Italic"> Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 37 M.S.P.R. 388, 393 (1988), the agency did not specifically identify the condition subsequent in its proposal or decision notices, but "the deciding official...testified without contradiction that he placed the appellant on indefinite suspension pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings." The Board found under those circumstances "that the agency's delay in identifying the condition that will terminate the indefinite suspension does not constitute harmful error warranting reversal of the action." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see Brode v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 149, 152 (1987) (similar holding); <span class="Italic">Clark v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 548, 551 (1986) (similar holding). Here, the appellant has not alleged or shown that he failed to understand that the condition subsequent was the resolution of his criminal proceedings. In fact, shortly after his misdemeanor conviction, he wrote to the agency to inquire about returning to work, as part of a Work Release Program during his incarceration. Nor has he alleged or shown how he was harmed by the agency's failure to identify the condition subsequent explicitly in its decision notice. Under these circumstances, we find that any procedural error by the agency in this regard did not amount to harmful error warranting reversal of the indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">See Johnson,</span> 37 M.S.P.R. at 393; <span class="Italic">Brode</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. at 152; <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. at 551; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Stephen v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 681, 685 (1991) (harmful error cannot be presumed; an agency error is harmful only where the record shows that the procedural error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The condition-subsequent requirement may be more properly viewed as a substantive, rather than a procedural, one because it derives from the substantive requirement that a suspension must be "temporary." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7501(2); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(2); <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 12 M.S.P.R. at 17, 20 (because the "most essential criterion" of a suspension is that it must be "temporary," an indefinite suspension must have a condition subsequent which will terminate it). In fact, where the agency failed to satisfy this (substantive) requirement, the Board has reversed the indefinite suspension without examining whether the failure constituted harmful (procedural) error. <span class="Italic">See Giacobbi,</span> 30 M.S.P.R. at 41-42;<span class="Italic"> Tigner-Keir</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. at 554. We find it unnecessary to resolve definitively here whether the condition-subsequent requirement is a substantive or a procedural one because, in either case, it does not warrant reversal of the indefinite suspension for the reasons discussed above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find, for the reasons discussed below, that the agency properly continued the indefinite suspension beyond the appellant's conviction in March 2002, until his removal in June 2002. In <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 691, 695 (1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 833 F.2d 1024 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table), the Board stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In order for an agency to effectuate an indefinite suspension [that continues after resolution of the criminal proceedings until the agency effects the employee's removal]..., three criteria must be met. First, there must be a resolution of the charges. Second, the agency must have contemplated further action and advised the employee of the subsequent possibility of further adverse action when the initial indefinite suspension was proposed. Third, the agency must act within a reasonable period of time after resolution of the criminal charges to initiate the additional action....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See also Engdahl v. Department of the Navy</span>, 900 F.2d 1572, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (continuing the indefinite suspension beyond resolution of the criminal proceedings was appropriate where the employee was previously notified that the suspension "might continue past the resolution of the charges while the [agency] investigated further administrative action against him," and the agency "acted within reasonable time periods in considering, proposing, and finalizing his removal").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant's March 22, 2002 conviction resolved the criminal proceedings and confirmed the agency's original rationale for suspending him. In addition, as noted above, the agency informed the appellant, in its decision notice referencing Article 16.6 of the CBA, that he might be removed during the pendency of his indefinite suspension. Moreover, it is undisputed that the appellant did not inform the agency of his conviction until May 22, 2002, and the agency thereafter promptly initiated and effected his removal on June 21, 2002. Under these circumstances, the agency was not required to terminate the suspension and reinstate the appellant in order to initiate and effect his removal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Engdahl</span>, 900 F.2d at 1578;<span class="Italic"> Campbell</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. at 695.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties do not dispute on review the AJ's findings that the agency established the other criteria for a valid indefinite suspension. Nor do they dispute the AJ's findings that the appellant failed to prove his affirmative defenses of harmful error and race discrimination. Accordingly, we SUSTAIN the indefinite suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed, <span class="Italic">Rawls v. USPS,</span> 179 Fed. Appx. 693, 695-96 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rawls first argues that the Board erred as a matter of law in sustaining the indefinite suspension because the agency admitted that its notice did not set forth what conditions would end the suspension period, as contemplated by 5 C.F.R. 752.402(e).[3] He then asserts that the Board erred by engaging in a harmful error analysis, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 7701(c)(2)(A). We are not persuaded by either of these arguments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;This section provides in relevant part that an "indefinite suspension continues for an indeterminate period of time and ends with the occurrence of the pending conditions set forth in the notice of action which may include the completion of any subsequent administrative action."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that "while the better practice is for agencies to identify the conditions subsequent explicitly in their decision notices imposing indefinite suspensions, the pertinent requirement for a valid indefinite suspension is that the suspension <span class="Italic">have</span> a condition subsequent, rather than that the agency's decision notice <span class="Italic">explicitly identify</span> the condition subsequent." <span class="Italic">Rawls</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 98, at &#x00B6; 11 (emphasis in original). Rawls' indefinite suspension <span class="Italic">had</span> an ascertainable end--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the resolution of the pending criminal charges against him--and he clearly understood this. In fact, after his conviction, he wrote USPS asking if he could participate in the work release program while he was serving his time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the Board correctly found that the agency's failure to expressly state the condition subsequent in its notice was subject to the harmless error rule. <span class="Italic">See e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 388, 393 (July 19, 1988) (concluding that "the agency's delay in identifying the condition that will terminate the indefinite suspension does not constitute harmful error warranting reversal of the action"). Although Rawls does not challenge this factual finding on appeal, we also hold that substantial evidence supports the Board's ultimate conclusion that the error was harmless. Indeed, even under <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the harmless error finding stands.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, Rawls argues that the statutory notice requirement is absolute and any violation is <span class="Italic">per se</span> harmful. We do not agree. The Supreme Court "has applied harmless-error analysis to a wide range of errors and has recognized that most constitutional errors can be harmless." <span class="Italic">Arizona v. Fulminante</span>, 499 U.S. 279, 306 (U.S. 1991). It follows, a fortiori, that statutory and regulatory errors can be harmless, too.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Senyszyn v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 342 Fed. Appx. 593, 595 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP) ("Upon review of the record, it appears that Senyszyn was notified of the potential of future adverse action, specifically, removal from service, both when his indefinite suspension was proposed and initiated. In this context an agency may maintain an indefinite suspension for a reasonable time after resolution of criminal charges for the purpose of effectuating a removal from service."); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 388, 393 (1988) (failure of the agency to state the condition in the proposal letter was excused when agency management knew that the termination of criminal proceedings would also terminate the basis for the suspension and when management made monthly inquiries to determine the status of the criminal proceedings); <span class="Italic">Brode v. Dept. of Army</span>, 35 MSPR 149, 152 (1987) (appellant was aware of an internal agency memorandum of an ongoing investigation; the appellant also knew, as of the time of the hearing, that the FBI was still involved in investigating the situation; there was no harm from the agency's delay in identifying condition that would terminate the suspension).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The duration of the indefinite suspension may be reasonably implied by the basis for it, e.g., an indictment, followed by a suspension that would continue pending investigation of probable criminal conduct, <span class="Italic">Harding v. VA</span>, 115 MSPR 284, 290-92 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-18, 2010 MSPB 241 (2010) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Harding v. VA</span>, 451 Fed. Appx. 947 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the indefinite suspension lacked an ascertainable end because the agency indicated that the suspension would continue "pending investigation of probable criminal conduct," and that the use of the word "pending" implied that the agency could simply continue the suspension as long as it wanted by claiming that its investigation into the matter remained open. The agency argues on petition for review that the ascertainable end of the indefinite suspension was the termination of criminal proceedings against the appellant. For the reasons set forth below, we agree with the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well-settled that an indefinite suspension, to be valid, must have an ascertainable end. <span class="Italic">Rawls v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 98, &#x00B6; 6 (2004). This "ascertainable end" requirement derives from the statutory definition of a "suspension"--"the placing of an employee, for disciplinary reasons, in a <span class="Italic">temporary</span> status without duties and pay." <span class="Italic">Rawls</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 98, &#x00B6; 6 (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7501(2) (emphasis added), and citing &#x00A7; 7511(a)(2)). Because a suspension must be <span class="Italic">temporary</span>, the Board has stated that, "while the exact duration of an indefinite suspension may not be ascertainable, such an action must have a condition subsequent...which will terminate the suspension," and that an indefinite suspension <span id="Page_2119"></span>imposed with no ascertainable end in sight is not sustainable. <span class="Italic">Rawls</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 98, &#x00B6; 6 (quoting <span class="Italic">Martin v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Rawls</span>, the agency did not specifically identify a condition subsequent that would terminate the suspension in its decision imposing the indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">Rawls</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 98, &#x00B6; 7. However, the appellant had been charged with attempted murder, <span class="Italic">id.</span>, &#x00B6; 2, and the agency indicated in its decision notice that it found reasonable cause to believe that the appellant had committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment could be imposed, <span class="Italic">id.</span>, &#x00B6; 7. The Board found that it was apparent from the circumstances that the condition subsequent that would trigger the end of the indefinite suspension was the resolution of the criminal charges against the appellant through criminal proceedings. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 8. The Board stated that "while the better practice is for agencies to identify the conditions subsequent explicitly in their decision notices imposing indefinite suspensions, the pertinent requirement for a valid indefinite suspension is that the suspension <span class="Italic">have</span> a condition subsequent, rather than that the agency's decision notice <span class="Italic">explicitly identify</span> the condition subsequent." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 11 (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, as in <span class="Italic">Rawls</span>, the indefinite suspension was clearly based on the existence of pending criminal charges. In both cases, the agency indicated that it had reasonable cause to believe that the appellant might be guilty of a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see Rawls</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 98, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Rawls v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 614, &#x00B6; 3 (2003). Although the agency in the present case failed to explicitly state that the suspension would continue through the completion of criminal proceedings, we find, as the Board found in <span class="Italic">Rawls</span>, that the indefinite suspension nevertheless has an ascertainable end, i.e., the resolution of the criminal proceedings that are the grounds for the suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the appellant appears to have understood that the length of his indefinite suspension was tied to the outcome of the criminal proceedings against him. In his final written submission to the administrative judge, he argued, "This action has no end date: That being that when I'm cleared of these charges it does not state that I would be returned to a paid status; rather it only states that 'If they feel warranted they may propose my removal'" [sic]. Therefore, it appears that the appellant understood that the resolution of criminal charges should trigger the end of the suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Harding</span> was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Harding v. VA</span>, 451 Fed. Appx. 947, 949 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find no error in the Board's holding that Mr. Harding's indefinite suspension is valid. The Board acknowledged that for an indefinite suspension to be valid, it must have an ascertainable end. While the better practice would be for the agency to explicitly identify the condition subsequent, what is necessary for a valid indefinite suspension is only that such a condition exists. In Mr. Harding's case, the Board acted within its discretion in holding that the ascertainable end to the indefinite suspension was "the resolution of the criminal proceedings that are the grounds for the suspension."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The indefinite suspension is supposed to terminate upon the condition subsequent identified in the suspension proposal. But the actual identification of a subsequent condition is blurred because the Board allows agencies to continue the suspension as they decide what next to do if the defined condition, e.g., disposition of an indictment or clearance revocation proceeding occurs. It is a rolling continuing suspension, with no clear end in sight, described in <span class="Italic">Freeze v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 122 MSPR 179, 183-84 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11, 2015 MSPB 9 (2015):</p>

Department of the Army</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 350, &#x00B6; 11 (2009). The Board, however, will not impose a condition subsequent different from the one identified by the agency in its decision imposing the indefinite suspension. The Board's role in an appeal alleging an impermissible continuation of an indefinite suspension is limited to reviewing whether the condition subsequent identified by the agency has occurred and whether the agency acted within a reasonable amount of time to terminate the suspension following the satisfaction of the condition subsequent. <span class="Italic">See Sanchez v. Department of Energy</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 155, &#x00B6; 9 n.2 (2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the decision letter indefinitely suspending the appellant, the condition subsequent triggering the cessation of the appellant's suspension is the completion and disposition of all issues regarding his security clearance and the completion of the notice period of any possible subsequent adverse action.[2]...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We hereby overrule our decision in <span class="Italic">Ryan v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 460, &#x00B6; 14 (2014), to the extent that it holds that, where an agency indefinitely suspends an appellant based upon the suspension of her security clearance, the condition subsequent triggering the cessation of the suspension is the restoration of her security clearance. As explained above, the Board cannot impose a condition subsequent of restoration of an appellant's security clearance where the letter indefinitely suspending the appellant identifies the condition subsequent as the completion and disposition of all issues regarding the appellant's security clearance and the completion of the notice period of any possible subsequent adverse action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An indefinite suspension initiated when an appellant is arrested and charged with a crime is properly continued during the period of a subsequent indictment, even if the indictment is based on violations of the federal criminal code that differ from the violation charged in the original criminal complaint, when the notice of suspension stated that it would end upon completion of the investigation or resolution of the criminal charges. <span class="Italic">Senyszyn v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the indefinite suspension was proper when effected because it had an ascertainable end--the disposition of any criminal charges, or a determination whether to return the appellant to duty or to take a subsequent administrative action that may be warranted based upon the results of the investigation.

The administrative judge found, however, that the suspension became improper when it lasted more than 1 year because it was no longer temporary.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The record supports the conclusion that the first condition subsequent <span id="Page_2120"></span>that would end the proper indefinite suspension, disposition of any criminal charges, had not occurred at the time the administrative judge issued his initial decision on November 6, 2007. Indeed, the record below contains uncontroverted evidence that, as of October 15, 2007, the agency's Office of the Inspector General was conducting an ongoing criminal investigation into the appellant's alleged introduction of contraband. We further note that this evidence is consistent with the new evidence that the agency has submitted for the first time on review. This evidence shows that a grand jury indicted the appellant on November 28, 2007, for two counts of violating federal law by introducing contraband into the prison facility, and that, as of January 24, 2008, these criminal matters had not been finally resolved. We find it appropriate to consider this evidence because it was previously unavailable before the record closed despite the agency's due diligence, and it supports the agency's position that there is a valid reason for continuing the appellant's suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the condition subsequent that would end the appellant's indefinite suspension has not yet occurred, we conclude that the continuation of that indefinite suspension is proper. <span class="Italic">See Arrieta</span>, 2008 MSPB 64, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. 6 &#x00A7; 752.402(e). In light of this conclusion, we need not address the question of the appropriate date upon which the suspension should be deemed to have ended.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board permits an indefinite suspension to continue following the close of an investigation into criminal misconduct if the agency then plans promptly to initiate adverse action against the employee, <span class="Italic">Campbell v. DLA</span>, 31 MSPR 691, 694-95 (1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]n indefinite suspension must have a determinable condition subsequent which will bring the action to an end. Depending on the outcome of the agency investigation of the employee's suspected misconduct, or the manner in which the criminal proceedings against her are resolved, the agency must either promptly return the employee to duty or proceed expeditiously to take further administrative action. The rationale in the former situation is the desire to protect employees subsequently not convicted of the charged criminal conduct, and to insure their prompt return to duty. The Board in <span class="Italic">Martin</span> noted that an indefinite suspension may be found to have been reasonable when imposed, although facts later developed may cause the Board to find that the agency acted unreasonably in failing or refusing to vacate the action. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Covarrubias v. Department of Treasury</span>, 23 MSPR 458 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, the agency may continue the indefinite suspension after the criminal charges are resolved through the notice period of a subsequent adverse action, 31 MSPR at 695,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to <span class="Italic">Martin and Covarrubias,</span> however, in this case the agency's original rationale for invoking the indefinite suspension not only remained, but was confirmed by the guilty plea. Under these circumstances, we find that the agency was not required to reinstate the appellant in order to initiate further procedures to remove her permanently. The agency's initial justification for the invocation of the indefinite suspension which prohibited appellant from working had been enhanced by its own expeditious investigation and the subsequent conviction. Therefore, the public interest and that of the agency was well served by the continuation of the suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order for an agency to effectuate an indefinite suspension...three criteria must be met. First, there must be a resolution of the charges. Second, the agency must have contemplated further action and advised the employee of the subsequent possibility of further adverse action when the initial indefinite suspension was proposed. Third, the agency must act within a reasonable period of time after resolution of the criminal charges to initiate the additional action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Campbell</span> was extended by <span class="Italic">Shaffer v. DLA</span>, 35 MSPR 664, 667 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board held in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> that when an employee is placed on indefinite suspension based upon an indictment, and, prior to disposition of the criminal charges, the agency develops or otherwise gains information resulting in initiation of further adverse action based on the underlying alleged misconduct, the agency may continue the indefinite suspension through the notice period of the subsequent adverse action.... The Board reasoned that the agency's original rationale for invoking the indefinite suspension not only remained (following the agency's proposal to remove) but was confirmed by appellant's guilty plea, and that, therefore, the public interest and that of the agency were well served by the continuation of the suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit validated the <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> approach to indefinite suspensions, <span class="Italic">Engdahl v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 900 F.2d 1572, 1578-79 (Fed. Cir. 1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Engdahl asserts that even if it were initially proper, the suspension should have been lifted immediately upon resolution of the criminal charges. He argues that no investigation as to whether he committed a crime could exist once he entered his pleas and that suspensions can only be instituted pending investigations into misconduct. We conclude, however, that the original suspension was properly continued after the guilty pleas because Engdahl (1) had previously been provided notice that the suspension might continue past the resolution of the charges while the Navy investigated further administrative action against him, and (2) the Navy acted within reasonable time periods in considering, proposing, and finalizing his removal....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board determined the approximately fifteen-day period following Engdahl's pleas was a "reasonable" time for the government to complete its removal review and to initiate the removal action.... [C]ontinuation of the suspension was lawful because the government's investigation could not be finalized until Engdahl had his opportunity to reply and the subsequent decision to terminate could be implemented. This delay was reasonable because it provided Engdahl an opportunity to try to demonstrate that the proposed removal action was ill-founded.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Although Engdahl correctly notes that the government's investigation as to whether he actually committed a crime was effectively complete once he entered his pleas, the government must also always investigate whether there is a sufficient nexus between the crimes committed and the efficiency of the service to warrant removal. Investigation into this question is not completely resolved until the employee has had his right to reply.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board has not defined exactly what constitutes a "reasonable period" to institute a proposed removal following the completion of criminal proceedings if an indefinite suspension is to be continued. Sixty days, without justification, was too long in <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. DOJ</span>, 35 MSPR 669, 672 (1987). Two months was too long in <span class="Italic">Casey v. Dept. of Navy</span>, DC-0752-12-0698-I-1 (NP 9/6/2013). Two-and-a-half months taken by the agency following dismissal of an indictment and the agency decision to terminate the suspension was excessive in <span class="Italic">Jarvis v. DOJ</span>, 45 MSPR 104, 112 (1990), concluding that the agency should not have taken that much time to review files concerning the appellant--after having already conducted an investigation--prior to determining whether to pursue adverse action. Two weeks was not unreasonable. <span class="Italic">Engdahl v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 660, 664 (1989), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Engdahl v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board and its reviewing court have approved of the use of indefinite suspensions in only a few, limited circumstances. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6; 13 (2010). One of these is when the agency has reasonable cause to believe that an employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> To be valid, an indefinite suspension must also have an ascertainable end, i.e., a condition subsequent that will terminate the suspension. <span class="Italic">Harding v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that an indefinite suspension may be continued after resolution of criminal charges in an employee's favor where the agency provides advance notice of possible administrative action in the suspension proposal or decision notice and takes action within a reasonable time of the conclusion of the criminal proceedings. <span class="Italic">Albo v.

Department of Justice,</span> 35 M.S.P.R. 669, 672 (1987). This has been based on the concern that an agency investigation during the pendency of a criminal matter could create due process issues for the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Engdahl v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">A determination of whether an agency has acted within a reasonable time depends on the "attendant circumstances." <span class="Italic">Arrieta v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 372, &#x00B6; 10 (2008) (remanding a case for further development of the record as to reasonableness where the agency did not propose the employee's removal for almost 3 months after the completion of an internal investigation). In this case, the agency failed to provide a reason why the voluminous information <span id="Page_2121"></span>available to it from the criminal trial did not enable it to act promptly after the appellant's acquittal and why further extensive investigation was necessary. It has not provided any explanation why it has taken so long to conduct its investigation and determine if the appellant violated its conduct standards; the agency simply asserts that it should be permitted whatever time it takes. However, "[t]o permit the agency to take an unlimited amount of time to determine what action to take while keeping the appellant on an indefinite suspension would run contrary to the requirement that an indefinite suspension have an ascertainable end." <span class="Italic">Lemons v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency's failure to act for at least 6 months after the appellant's acquittal was an unreasonable extension of his indefinite suspension. Therefore, we find that the administrative judge correctly held that the agency did not act within a reasonable time after the appellant's acquittal to take an administrative action and properly ordered the agency to terminate his suspension. However, the administrative judge erred in finding that 30 days would have been a reasonable time in which to act. Where an agency is required to terminate an indefinite suspension after acquittal due to unreasonable delay in instituting administrative proceedings, the reinstatement must be effective on the date of the acquittal, which in this case was February 5, 2010. <span class="Italic">See Jarvis,</span> 45 M.S.P.R. at 111-12; <span class="Italic">Hernandez,</span> 35 M.S.P.R. at 672-73.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Camaj v. DHS</span>, 119 MSPR 95, 98-101 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-13, 2012 MSPB 133 (2012), determined that an indefinite suspension could properly continue pending completion of a pretrial diversion program, but once the requirements of that program were completed by the appellant, three months was too long for the agency to wait to restore the employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 13, 2009, the appellant entered into an Agreement for Pretrial Diversion (PTD) with the U.S. Attorney's Office. As part of the PTD agreement, the appellant agreed that the prosecution of his criminal offenses would be deferred for 6 months in exchange for his acceptance of responsibility for his conduct and agreement to complete the PTD program. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In the agreement, the appellant admitted that he knowingly conducted approximately 300 queries in TECS, in excess of his authorized access to TECS, that he had thereby obtained information from the agency, and that he had received training and was aware that the queries were in excess of his authorized access to agency computers. The agreement provided that the appellant's admissions, particularly with respect to his unauthorized access of TECS, "shall be admissible in any administrative proceeding[.]"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 8, 2009, the criminal complaint against the appellant was dismissed without prejudice on the basis that the prosecution was being "deferred" under the terms of the PTD agreement. By letter dated February 22, 2010, the U.S. District Court Pretrial Services Agency notified Andrew Kogan, Assistant U.S. Attorney, that the appellant had complied with the terms of the PTD agreement, and that it was therefore recommended that the pending charges be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the criminal charges against the appellant were dismissed, the agency proceeded to investigate the appellant regarding alleged misconduct apart from the incidents referred to in the criminal complaint and the PTD agreement. On March 10, 2010, the appellant filed the instant appeal, alleging that the agency had continued his indefinite suspension for an unreasonable period of time after the criminal case was dismissed. By notice dated May 19, 2010, the agency proposed to remove the appellant, based in part on alleged misconduct with which he was not charged in the criminal complaint. The following day, the parties jointly requested that the appeal be dismissed without prejudice, pending a decision on the proposed removal....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant, effective November 16, 2010, on charges of conduct unbecoming a law enforcement officer and misuse of an official government database. The latter charge included 133 specifications of unauthorized TECS access, including incidents not referred to in the criminal complaint. On November 29, 2010, the appellant refiled his appeal of the continuation of the indefinite suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, we find that the administrative judge erred in finding that the charges were resolved on September 8, 2009, when the charges were dismissed without prejudice pending the appellant's successful completion of the PTD program. In <span class="Italic">Cooper v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 7 (1999), the Board reversed an administrative judge's finding that criminal charges against the appellant were disposed of when the appellant was placed on pretrial probation. In doing so, the Board noted that the charge could still have been brought forward if the appellant did not meet the terms of the pretrial probation program. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8. The Board concluded that when a case may still be brought forward for prosecution, the agency will still have reasonable cause to believe that the appellant had committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment could be imposed, and may therefore continue the indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 402, &#x00B6; 3 (2001), charges against the appellant were deferred during a period of pretrial probation. Citing <span class="Italic">Cooper</span>, the Board again found that entry into a pretrial probationary program was not a disposition of criminal charges. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the PTD agreement provided that "[t]he United States Attorney may at any time within the period of the [appellant's] supervision initiate prosecution for these offenses should [the appellant] violate the conditions" of the PTD program. Moreover, the order filed by the U.S. Attorney's office on September 8, 2009, noted that the appellant's prosecution had been "deferred," and that the dismissal was "without prejudice." We therefore find that the charges were not resolved until February 22, 2010, when the Pretrial Services Agency certified the appellant's completion of the PTD and recommended that the pending charges be dismissed. Until that date, the agency had reasonable cause to believe a sentence of imprisonment could be imposed and was permitted to keep the appellant on indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">See Cooper</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9; <span class="Italic">see also Taylor</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 402, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The remaining question is whether the agency was permitted to continue the indefinite suspension beyond February 22, 2010. An indefinite suspension may be continued after resolution of criminal charges where the agency provides advance notice of possible administrative action in the suspension proposal or decision notice and takes action within a reasonable time <span id="Page_2122"></span>of the conclusion of the criminal proceedings. <span class="Italic">Engdahl v. Department of the Navy</span>, 900 F.2d 1572, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Albo v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 166, &#x00B6; 8 (2006); <span class="Italic">Rawls v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 98, &#x00B6; 13 (2004). However, an agency must provide reinstatement to the date of the resolution of criminal charges if it fails to implement an adverse action within a reasonable time. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Jarvis v. Department of Justice</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 104, 111-12 (1990); <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. Department of Justice</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 669, 672-73 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency did not issue a notice of proposed removal until May 19, 2010, nearly 3 months after resolution of the criminal charges. We note that the delay was at least in part the result of the agency's decision to investigate additional alleged misconduct before initiating adverse action proceedings against the appellant. However, the time required for that further investigation did not itself warrant continuation of the indefinite suspension, because the mere existence of an open agency investigation into alleged misconduct does not serve as cause for taking--or, as in this case, continuing--an adverse action under subchapter II of chapter 75. <span class="Italic">See Gonzalez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6; 28 (2010). Hence, in order to determine whether the agency was permitted to continue the indefinite suspension beyond February 22, 2010, we must determine whether the delay would have been reasonable had the agency instead elected to pursue an adverse action based solely on the conduct that formed the basis of the criminal charges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the delay would not have been reasonable under those circumstances. First, the agency investigation into the conduct that formed the basis of the criminal charges preceded the filing of the February 4, 2009 criminal complaint, which was based on the results of that same investigation. Moreover, the appellant admitted to that same conduct when he entered into the PTD agreement on September 8, 2009, and further agreed that his admissions could be used in any administrative proceeding. Thus, when the criminal charges against the appellant were resolved on February 22, 2010, the agency already had all the information it needed to commence adverse action proceedings based on the conduct underlying those charges. Accordingly, we find that it would not have been reasonable for the agency to wait until May 19, 2010, before proposing an adverse action based solely on that same conduct. <span class="Italic">See Jarvis</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. at 111-12 (an agency delay of 21/2 months to review files was not reasonable); <span class="Italic">Hernandez</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. at 672-73 (same result in regard to a delay of 60 days to issue a notice of proposed removal where the agency failed to provide justification for the delay). The agency must therefore reinstate the appellant effective February 22, 2010.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bonetto v. DOJ</span>, DE-0752-13-0228-I-2 (NP 2/6/2015), determined that an agency acted promptly to restore the appellant to duty after an indictment was dismissed, rejected an argument that the suspension could have continued in perpetuity, and decided that the agency need not have reinstated the appellant earlier based on deficiencies in the prosecutor's case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be valid, an indefinite suspension must have an ascertainable end. <span class="Italic">Harding v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 284, 290, &#x00B6; 15 (2010) <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 451 F. App'x 947 (Fed. Cir. 2011). The appellant argues that the suspension could have continued in perpetuity because the decision letter and proposal notice provided that the suspension would remain in place until resolution of the criminal case and/or until there was sufficient evidence to either return him to duty or to support an administrative action against him. It is well settled, however, that an agency may continue an indefinite suspension after resolution of criminal charges in an employee's favor where the agency provides advance notice of possible administrative action in the suspension proposal or decision notice and takes action within a reasonable time of the conclusion of the criminal proceedings. <span class="Italic">Camaj v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 95, &#x00B6; 11 (2012). Nevertheless, an agency must provide reinstatement to the date of the resolution of criminal charges in an appellant's favor if it fails to implement an adverse action within a reasonable time. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In the instant case, the agency provided the appellant notice that the indefinite suspension could extend beyond the resolution of the criminal charges and ultimately reinstated him within 2 days of the dismissal of the criminal charges. Accordingly, the indefinite suspension had an ascertainable end and the agency properly reinstated the appellant within a reasonable time after resolution of the criminal case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the agency should have reinstated him when it became aware that the indictment supporting the suspension was "not well supported" and that the "prosecution against [him] was falling apart." Where an indefinite suspension based on an indictment was proper when effected, however, the indefinite suspension will remain proper as long as that indictment remains outstanding. <span class="Italic">Jarvis v. Department of Justice</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 104, 109 (1990); <span class="Italic">see Camaj</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 95, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10. For the reasons discussed above and as the administrative judge determined, the agency properly imposed the indefinite suspension; accordingly, it remained proper so long as the criminal matter based on the indictment was pending. Thus, the agency had no obligation to independently evaluate the merits of the criminal case or to rescind the suspension due to any perceived weakness in the prosecution of the case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the employee is convicted, the indefinite suspension may continue until removal proceedings are initiated, apparently without regard to intervening delay, <span class="Italic">Whittaker v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, CH-0752-11-0693-I-1 (NP 12/7/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant alleges that the agency failed to timely initiate the removal action and that the indefinite suspension action should have ended effective September 22, 2010, the date of her conviction. However, these bare assertions fail to establish any error in the administrative judge's finding that the agency properly continued the indefinite suspension action from April 3, 2010, through March 3, 2011.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the Board has canceled an indefinite suspension as of the date that criminal charges were resolved based upon an agency's failure to act expeditiously to initiate an adverse action, the Board has only done so in cases where the indefinite suspension action continued for an unreasonable period of time after criminal charges were resolved in favor of the suspended employee. <span class="Italic">See Jarvis v. Department of Justice</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 104, 107, 111-12 (1990) (canceling the indefinite suspension effective the date of the dismissal of the employee's indictment where the agency continued the suspension for 21/2 months while it determined whether to initiate an adverse action); <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. Department of Justice</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 669, 671-73 (1987) (canceling the indefinite suspension as of the date that criminal charges were dismissed where the agency failed to provide any justification for waiting 2 months to initiate the removal action). The rationale for promptly returning a suspended employee to duty is the desire to protect employees subsequently not convicted of the charged criminal misconduct. <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. at 694.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the Board has held that an agency may continue a suspension action if its original rationale for invoking the indefinite suspension action was confirmed by the employee's subsequent guilty plea or conviction. <span class="Italic">See Engdahl v. Department of the Navy</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 660, 664 (1989), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 900 F.2d 1572 (Fed. Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. at 695. In <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, the Board found that the agency's initial justification for invoking the indefinite suspension was enhanced by Campbell's subsequent conviction, and therefore the public interest and that of the agency were well served by the continuation of the suspension. <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. at 695. We analogize the facts of this case to those in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, as the agency's original rationale for invoking the indefinite suspension action not only remained, but was confirmed by the appellant's conviction. Thus, we find that the public interest and the agency's interest were served by the continuation of the appellant's suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may properly continue a suspension action if it contemplates further administrative action and advises the employee of the possibility of a subsequent adverse action in the proposal notice of indefinite suspension, and the agency acts within a reasonable period of time after resolution of the criminal charges to initiate an adverse action. <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. at 695. Here, it is undisputed that the proposal notice apprised the appellant that the agency may continue the indefinite suspension after criminal proceedings have concluded to impose an administrative action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency could not allow an indictment to be dismissed, initiate no adverse action on dismissal of the indictment, and allow the suspension to continue during the government's appeal from the dismissal of the indictment. Under these circumstances, the suspension should have concluded when the indictment was dismissed. <span class="Italic">Lund v. DOD</span>, 41 MSPR 115, 119 (1989) ("We find no basis on which to permit an indefinite suspension to continue until the government exhausted all possible appeals"; "The court's order of dismissal is operative while an appeal is pending unless a stay has been granted."). <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Casey v. USPS</span>, 13 MSPR 263, 265 (1982) (agency could continue the indefinite suspension when a jury deadlocked at trial and the case was scheduled for a new trial). Nor could an agency continue an indefinite suspension following dismissal of an indictment in the erroneous belief that the appellant settled his criminal case by agreeing to resign from the agency. <span class="Italic">Hofmann v. USDA</span>, 42 MSPR 453, 458 (1989). If the employee is acquitted of the charges leading to the indefinite suspension, the suspension cannot be continued based on other charges unconnected to the original indictment. <span class="Italic">Torres v. USPS</span>, 35 MSPR 655, 661-62 (1987). [Refer to <span class="Italic">Newbold</span> later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-450.html#sec1-444">Remedy</a>."] Earlier decisions determined that although the duration of the suspension may not be determinable, an indefinite suspension continuing beyond the stated point of termination is improper. <span class="Italic">Morris v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 20 MSPR 623, 624 (1984), <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Albo v. USPS</span>, 104 MSPR 166, 2006 MSPB 341 (2006) (remanding for consideration of whether the agency improperly continued an indefinite suspension after notice that criminal proceedings were concluded); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">McWilliams v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 51 MSPR 422, 430 (1991) (attorney fees were granted on the basis of gross procedural error; an indefinite suspension continued past the completion of an agency investigation; the appellant was unaware that the suspension would be concluded upon the termination of a criminal investigation that was never linked to the original suspension).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to an indefinite suspension pending the outcome of a security clearance review, <span class="Italic">Romero v. DOD</span>, 104 MSPR 245, 248-50&#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-13, 2006 MSPB 354 (2006), remanded a case to the AJ to determine if the agency acted reasonably in delaying at least four months following the conclusion of a clearance revocation proceeding:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"[T]o be valid, an indefinite suspension must have an ascertainable end, that is, a determinable condition subsequent that will bring the suspension to a conclusion." <span class="Italic">Cooper v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 5 (1999). Here, the agency suspended the appellant pending DIA review of his "eligibility for access to SCI and collateral information, and any applicable personnel actions." Completion of an investigation into whether an employee's security clearance should be revoked is an appropriate condition subsequent for an indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Navy</span>, 978 F.2d 1223, 1226 (Fed. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It appears from documents submitted by the appellant below that DIA issued its final decision on December 7, 2005. In that decision, the DIA Security Appeals Board informed the appellant that it was affirming the original determination that he did not meet the minimum personnel security standards for SCI. It also stated that its decision was final and constituted the administrative review of the process. On December 16, 2005, the agency informed the appellant that it had reciprocally accepted the final decision of DIA and was therefore revoking the appellant's access to classified information and his eligibility to occupy a sensitive position. In its April 12, 2006 response to the petition for review, the agency stated that the appellant remained on indefinite suspension "pending final resolution of his employment status with the [a]gency."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency informed the appellant that his suspension might not end immediately upon completion of DIA review if "any applicable personnel actions" were pending. An indefinite suspension may extend through the completion of both a pending investigation and any subsequent administrative action. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(e). However, in such circumstances, an agency must initiate administrative action within a reasonable period of time after completion of the pending investigation. <span class="Italic">Engdahl v. Department of the Navy</span>, 900 F.2d 1572, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Therefore, once DIA review was completed, the agency was required either to promptly return the appellant to duty or to take some other personnel action within a reasonable period of time. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> If DIA and the agency have made a final determination that the appellant lacks the necessary security clearance to perform the duties of his job, the agency may propose his removal or take any other appropriate action. However, it must take such action within a reasonable period of time after resolution of the appellant's security clearances. <span class="Italic">See Campbell v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 691, 695 (1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 833 F.2d 1024 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table) (where the appellant's indefinite suspension was based on an indictment, the agency acted reasonably by proposing the appellant's removal 9 days after it learned of the appellant's guilty plea and continuing the indefinite suspension until the effective date of the appellant's removal). To permit the agency to take an unlimited amount of time to determine what action to take while keeping the appellant on an indefinite suspension would run contrary to the requirement that an indefinite suspension have an ascertainable end. <span class="Italic">See Martin v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 12 M.S.P.R. 12, 17, 20 (1982), <span class="Italic">aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds sub nom. Brown v. Department of Justice</span>, 715 F.2d 662 (D.C. Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">and</span> <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Otherson v. Department of Justice</span>, 728 F.2d 1513 (D.C. Cir. 1984), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds by Barresi v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 656, 663 n.5 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are unable to determine, based upon the record before us, whether the agency has acted reasonably upon learning that DIA had completed its review of the appellant's security clearance. It appears that the agency <span id="Page_2123"></span>took no further action with respect to the appellant's employment status for at least four months after DIA issued its final decision. However, a determination of whether such a delay is reasonable requires consideration of the attendant circumstances, and we do not possess sufficient information to make that determination. Therefore, we are remanding this case to the administrative judge for further proceedings to determine whether the agency has improperly continued the appellant's indefinite suspension. On remand, the administrative judge shall give the agency an opportunity to explain what, if any, action it has taken or is planning to take with respect to the appellant's employment, and to identify factors contributing to any delay in taking such action. The administrative judge shall also provide the appellant an opportunity to submit evidence and argument concerning the continuation of his indefinite suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once the agency made the clearance determination that was pending during an indefinite suspension, it was improper for the suspension to continue for an additional seven months of unexplained delay before the agency decided what next to do. <span class="Italic">Romero v. DOD</span>, 106 MSPR 284, 2007 MSPB 180 (2007) (clearance issue: delay was possibly explained by agency counsel's submission, but not by an affidavit or other submission that had evidentiary value). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Ryan v. DHS</span>, PH-0752-13-5283-I-1 (NP 8/18/2014), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, in <span class="Italic">Ryan v. DHS</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/14-3181.Opinion.7-9-2015.1.PDF">793 F.3d 1368</a>, 1373-1374 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (clearance issue, discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-13-121.html#sec6-120">Indefinite Prolongation of Suspension</a>.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An indefinite suspension does not appear to become a removal because the agency fills the position of the appellant. <span class="Italic">Harvell v. DHUD</span>, AT-0752-12-0549-I-1 (NP 2/28/2014) (criminal investigation), cryptically noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant asserts that the agency violated the appellant's due process rights because it removed him from his position, rather than suspending him. In support of this assertion, the appellant alleges that the agency has filled the appellant's position. The appellant's assertion is unavailing. The appellant has presented no basis to find error in the administrative judge's finding that an agency may double encumber a position. Further, at the time of the appellant's indefinite suspension, it was unknown when and if the appellant would return to his position....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There would ordinarily be no dispute over the date of the onset of an indefinite suspension. But there was a dispute in <span class="Italic">Glick v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SF-0752-13-0466-I-1 (NP 8/27/2014), when the agency decision notice stated that the appellant's administrative leave ended on April 17, 2013. Although the appellant then exhausted his annual leave over the next couple weeks, the suspension began on April 17, not the day in May when his annual leave ran out:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[3]&#x2003;The Standard Form 50 documenting the indefinite suspension indicates that the suspension became effective on May 7, 2013. However, for the following reasons, we find that the suspension began on April 18, 2013. When it proposed the indefinite suspension, the agency placed the appellant on administrative leave, pending a final decision. The agency's decision notice indicates that it terminated the appellant's administrative leave on April 17, 2013. The agency asserts that, because it permitted the appellant to exhaust his annual leave between April 18, 2013 and May 6, 2013, rather than placing him on leave without pay during that period, the indefinite suspension did not become effective until May 7, 2013. This is incorrect. The appellant's choice to exhaust his annual leave before being placed on leave without pay does not render his absence during that period voluntary because the fact is that he did not have the option of returning to work, given that the agency required him to remain off duty. <span class="Italic">See Abbott v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 294 (2014).</p>
