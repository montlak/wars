<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-27"><span class="space">10.</span> Waiver of Statutory Right; Release</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Any well-drafted settlement will include a release paragraph, sometimes several release paragraphs, of rights that the appellant (or the agency) is surrendering through the settlement. The language of release clauses varies. Some releases are broad, others specific. One right that will almost certainly be surrendered by the appellant will be the right to continue with the appeal or complaint that led to the settlement, except through enforcement proceedings based on the settlement. Through careful drafting, a release may do what a litigated result cannot: foreclose future litigation over past events that are not necessarily a component of the appeal that spawns the settlement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Polk v. Dept. of Army</span>, 40 MSPR 539, 545 (1989), advises:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The law is clear that a waiver of a right in a settlement agreement must be comprehensive, freely made and fair. <span class="Italic">McCall v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States Postal Service,</span> 839 F.2d 664, 668 (Fed. Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">citing Ferby v. United States Postal Service,</span> 26 MSPR 451, 456 (1985). Moreover, in order to be enforceable, a waiver of a statutory right must constitute the informed, intentional relinquishment of a known right. <span class="Italic">McCall,</span> 839 F.2d at 668; <span class="Italic">Ferby,</span> 26 MSPR at 455<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Rhoades v. United States Postal Service,</span> 36 MSPR 639, 642-45 (1988) (a settlement agreement cannot be deemed to encompass the statutory entitlement to attorney fees unless the language of the agreement itself, or the underlying circumstances, demonstrate the intent of the prevailing party to waive that right).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The waiver of a statutory right may include the right of a Board appeal. Waivers of appellate rights are frequently included in last chance agreements, but the waiver may appear in a settlement, reached after a Board appeal is filed from a removal, that converts the discharge to a resignation and cleanses the appellant's record. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Clede v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 72 MSPR 279, 282 (1996) ("An appellant's waiver of Board appeal rights in a settlement agreement is enforceable and not against public policy if the terms of the waiver are comprehensive, freely made, and fair, and the execution of the waiver was not the result of duress or bad faith on the part of the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Merriweather v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 64 MSPR 365, 375 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 56 F.3d 83 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table)."). [Refer to Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-160.html#sec2-158">Waiver of Appeal Through Last Chance or Other Preappeal Agreement.</a>"]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Any waiver of a right in a settlement agreement must constitute intentional relinquishment of that right. <span class="Italic">Hundley v. OPM</span>, 46 MSPR 466, 469 (1990) (construing a clause purportedly waiving counsel fees) (citing <span class="Italic">Ferby v. USPS</span>, 26 MSPR 451, 455 (1985)). Of implied waiver, <span class="Italic">Pittman v. USPS</span>, 29 MSPR 339, 343 (1985), cautioned that if a settlement agreement waives counsel fees without limitation, a counsel fee claim will not be considered in subsequent enforcement proceedings<span class="Italic">. But see</span> <span class="Italic">Paderick v. OPM</span>, 54 MSPR 456, 459-60 (1992) ("a release of a contractual right "is the discharge of a present right, not of one to accrue in the future. Such a discharge makes a subsequent breach of duty by the obligor impossible. The release, therefore is not a discharge of a future right to compensation for breach." 5A Corbin on Contracts &#x00A7; 1238 at 559. We therefore find that, in the instant case, the parties' settlement agreement does not express an intent to waive the intervenor's right to request an attorney fee award for the subsequent compliance proceeding."). [Refer to Chapter 15, "<a href="0100-2023-22-210.html#sec15-208">Waiver of Fee Through Settlement Agreement</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board will not construe waiver clauses in settlements beyond their intended scope. In <span class="Italic">Corsiglia v. USPS</span>, 69 MSPR 5, 9 (1995), the settlement called for appellant's reinstatement on a probationary basis following a year of satisfactory work with another employer. If, upon reinstatement, the employee failed to meet the requirements of his probation, the agency was authorized by the settlement to nullify the reinstatement and the employee waived any Board appeal right as to reinstatement, but not, apparently, as to the underlying termination. The employee claimed the agency breached the agreement by not reinstating him following completion of his work in the private sector. The employer defended by maintaining that the employee's job performance in the private sector was unsatisfactory and, further, that the employee waived any right of access to the Board concerning his reinstatement. The Board found that waiver of the right to appeal termination following reinstatement was an issue distinct from the underlying duty of the agency to reinstate the employee. The Board noted that "although the language of a settlement agreement should ordinarily be construed to give effect to all its terms, it must also be read in context so as to avoid absurd results which the parties could not have intended."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Coppola v. VA</span>, <a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/18-1301.Opinion.4-26-2019.pdf">770 Fed. Appx. 573</a>, 574-76 (Fed. Cir. 2019 NP), determined that settlement of an EEO complaint did not bar prosecution of an IRA whistleblower action when the release in the settlement was specifically tied to matters raised in the complaint:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 6, 2013, Dr. Coppola and the VA entered into an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Agreement of Compromise Settlement ("Settlement Agreement") with respect to his February 8, 2011 EEO complaint. In exchange for a lump sum payment of $3,750.00, Dr. Coppola agreed to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">expressly waive[ ] any and all actions, claims, complaints, EEO complaints, grievances, appeals and proceedings of whatever nature against the VA...which are now or hereafter may be asserted by him on his behalf <span class="Italic">regarding his allegations of unlawful disability and age discrimination and reprisal as set forth and defined in EEOC Case No. 550-2011-00588X</span>[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first step in the interpretation of a written agreement is to determine "whether the written understanding is clearly stated and was clearly understood by the parties." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If an ambiguity arises, "the judicial role is to implement the intent of the parties at the time the agreement was made." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The words of a contract "are given their ordinary meaning, unless it is established that the parties mutually intended and agreed to some alternative meaning." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Perry v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 992 F.2d 1575, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Hol-Gar Mfg. Corp. v. United States</span>, 351 F.2d 972, 976 (Ct. Cl. 1965)). In sum, "[o]ur task is to determine the intent of the parties at the time they contracted, as evidenced by the contract itself." <span class="Italic">Greco v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Coppola argues that the Settlement Agreement does not bar his appeal because it expressly limits the scope of waiver to claims arising from "his allegations of unlawful disability and age discrimination and reprisal as set forth and defined in EEOC Case No. 550-2011-00588X." We agree. The Board focuses on the indisputably broad language at the beginning of the clause, which imputes waiver to "any and all actions, claims, complaints, EEO complaints, grievances, appeals and proceedings of whatever nature against the VA." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The language at the end of the clause, however, narrows the scope of waiver to those actions, claims, and complaints that "may be asserted by [Dr. Coppola]...regarding his allegations of unlawful disability and age discrimination and reprisal as set forth and defined" in his EEO complaint. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This limiting language excludes waiver of any claim that is unrelated to Dr. Coppola's EEO complaint. Thus, Dr. Coppola's allegations regarding whistleblower retaliation, which arose from events occurring over a year after the filing of his EEO complaint, could not have been included in the Settlement Agreement waiver.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This unambiguous limitation on the scope of waiver stands in stark contrast to the broad waiver language in the cases cited by the Board. In <span class="Italic">Vogel</span>, for example, the waiver at issue applied to "any other actions, charges, complaints, class actions, appeals or other inquiries...with respect to any matter related to the Appellant's employment with the Department of the Navy <span class="Italic">occurring prior to this Settlement Agreement</span>." 2007 M.S.P.B. 200, &#x00B6; 2 (emphasis added). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Lee</span>, the settlement agreement at issue stated that "Mr. Lee further agrees to generally release...the Postal Service...<span class="Italic">from all claims of any nature ever arising from</span> <span class="Italic">his employment with the Postal Service up to and including the date of full execution of this agreement</span>." 2009 M.S.P.B. 121, &#x00B6; 7 (emphasis in original). <span id="Page_4781"></span>In both of these cases, the waiver clause barred <span class="Italic">all</span> claims relating to the petitioner's employment through the execution date. The more limited waiver clause at issue here stands in stark contrast to these broad clauses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VA argues that the phrase "and reprisal" in the waiver clause indicates that Dr. Coppola waived his right to bring an action regarding any reprisal claims that existed at the time of execution of the Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement expressly states, however, that waiver applies only to claims arising from Dr. Coppola's "allegations of...reprisal as set forth and defined in EEOC Case No. 550-2011-00588X." Thus, the agreement only bars claims for reprisal that could arise out of the facts alleged in Dr. Coppola's EEO complaint. Indeed, while the term "reprisal" is commonly used in the whistle-blower context, it also relates to retaliatory action against an employee for filing an EEO complaint alleging discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Spruill v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd</span>., 978 F.2d 679, 692 n.17 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (noting that "an employee's allegation of reprisal [for filing an EEO complaint] is itself a complaint of discrimination which shall be accorded full EEOC procedure").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VA also argues that the e-mail exchange between the parties indicates that they understood that the phrase "and reprisal" included any existing claim for reprisal, and did not bar claims for reprisal that arose after the date of the agreement. Even if we agreed with the VA that the email exchange establishes the understanding of the parties, which is far from clear, "[o]nly if there is ambiguity should parol evidence be considered." <span class="Italic">Greco</span>, 852 F.2d at 560. Here, the scope of the waiver is unambiguously limited to claims that could arise from Dr. Coppola's allegations as set forth in his EEO complaint. Any contrary determination by the Board is unsupported by law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, the Board's decision rests on an incorrect interpretation of the Settlement Agreement that expands the scope of Dr. Coppola's waiver beyond the claims that could arise from his allegations in the EEO complaint. Because Dr. Coppola's claims of whistleblower retaliation are entirely unrelated to the claims of age discrimination in his EEO complaint, the Board's determination that it lacks jurisdiction over Dr. Coppola's claims is legal error. While Dr. Coppola seeks a decision on the merits and other relief, the Board has not had an opportunity to review the case on its merits, and thus the appropriate remedy is to remand the case to the Board for consideration of the issues. Accordingly, we vacate the decision of the Board and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Waiver of statutory rights may be bidirectional. <span class="Italic">Beasley v. OPM</span>, 45 MSPR 333, 335 (1990), involved OPM's attempt to recover an annuity overpayment. Following an initial decision from MSPB finding that the annuitant owed what was claimed, but before the Board decided the annuitant's PFR, OPM wrote to the annuitant, stating that he should pay a sum less than what OPM had claimed. The annuitant sent a check for the lower amount, and the check was endorsed with a release:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Acceptance of the payment of $2431.00 as outlined in attached ltr., dtd., Jan. 19, 1990 from OPM, Reconsideration and Debt Collection Division, Washington, D.C., is a <span class="Italic">full</span> and <span class="Italic">complete</span> release of all Government's rights in this claim. Any and all agencies of the Government join in on this release of this claim against Ronald L. BEASLEY.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Beasley</span> dismissed the PFR by the annuitant as moot, 45 MSPR at 335-36:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The formation of a binding contract requires a bargain in which there is a manifestation of mutual assent to an exchange and a consideration.... An offer to form a contract may invite or require acceptance to be made by performing a specified act. In such cases, performance of the specified act constitutes an acceptance which is binding on the offeror....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's letter...unambiguously offered to accept the sum of $2,431.00 as complete payment of the appellant's indebtedness and specified the manner of acceptance--submission of a check in that amount within the 30 days.... Although the appellant was already obligated to pay OPM $5,131.00, there was consideration for his paying a lesser amount, since the appellant disputed this indebtedness and was forgoing his right to pursue his petition for review to the Board or a subsequent appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.... We therefore conclude that a binding settlement agreement was reached when the appellant submitted a check for $2,431.00 within 30 days of OPM's letter of January 22, 1990.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if OPM's January 22 letter did not constitute an offer to accept $2,431.00 in payment in full of the appellant's indebtedness, the appellant's submission of the check in that amount with the endorsement on the reverse would constitute an offer of settlement, and OPM's act in cashing the check would constitute a binding acceptance. <span class="Italic">See</span> 6 A. Corbin, <span class="Italic">Corbin on Contracts</span>, [sec.] 1279, at 127 (1962) (where the amount due is in dispute, and the debtor sends a check for less than the amount claimed, clearly expressing his intention that the check is being sent as a settlement in full, the creditor's cashing the check is almost always held to be an acceptance of the offer operating as a full satisfaction, even though the creditor may assert that the sum is received only in part payment).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">EEO claims may be--often are--barred by waiver clauses in settlement, as in <span class="Italic">Anderson v. DHHS</span>, DC-0752-16-0845-I-1 (NP 3/24/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The settlement agreement states that the appellant "agrees that any <span class="Italic">potential</span> complaint, grievance, or any other civil matter stemming from her employment with the Agency and arising prior to the effective date" of the agreement was covered under the agreement. The agency denied the appellant's request for a reasonable accommodation on November 27, 2013, months <span class="Italic">prior to</span> the effective date of the agreement, March 5, 2014....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Anyone who works on federal sector EEO cases knows well the limitation in settlements against the prospective waiver of EEO rights, <span class="Italic">Gaddy v. Dept. of Labor</span>, AT-0432-12-0550-I-1 n.4 (NP 10/8/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Such prospective waiver of an employee's rights under Title VII is void as against public policy. <span class="Italic">See Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co</span>., 415 U.S. 36, 51 (1974) ("[W]e think it clear that there can be no prospective waiver of an employee's rights under Title VII."). On the other hand, a knowing and voluntary waiver of Board appeal rights in an LCA is not void as a matter of public policy. <span class="Italic">McCall v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 666-67 (Fed. Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">distinguished by Alexander v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 264 F.3d 1067, 1070 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
