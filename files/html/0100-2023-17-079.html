<h4 class="h4" id="sec10-80"><span class="space">4.</span> Filling of Vacancies</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Once an agency invokes RIF regulations for proper reasons, the agency has discretion to organize the work force as it deems necessary. Although the Board will enforce rights mandated by agency regulations and well-established nondiscretionary policy, and although an agency regulation states that disruption should be minimized, the agency has no obligation to eliminate vacant positions before encumbered ones or to take any other specific action. <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 11 MSPR 11, 12 (1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Madsen v. VA</span>, 754 F.2d 343, 344 (Fed. Cir. 1985) ("Finally, Madsen's assertion that the agency should have avoided a RIF was also correctly rejected by the Board. Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. Sec. 351.201(b) (1983), an agency is not required, in conducting RIFs, to fill vacant positions. In addition, an agency, in deciding how to structure the workplace, is given wide discretion in determining which individuals are best qualified to perform particular functions. <span class="Italic">Wilmot v. United States</span>, 205 Ct. Cl. 666 (1974)."); <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 41 MSPR 575, 583 (1989) (enforcing a bureau policy of discretionary filling of vacancy despite arguable mandatory policy of department); <span class="Italic">Yarman v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 18 MSPR 436, 438 (1983) ("Appellant...failed to establish that agency policy requires it to fill vacancies while conducting a RIF"); <span class="Italic">Head v. Dept. of Army</span>, 4 MSPR 240, 243, 4 MSPB 315 (1980) (no evidence indicated that a negotiated agreement limited management discretion under OPM regulations not to fill vacancies during a RIF); <span class="Italic">Summers v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 4 MSPR 1, 1, 4 MSPB 95 (1980) (5 CFR 351.201(b) (1979), providing that agencies are not required to fill vacancies during a reduction in force, is not superseded by 5 USC 2302(b)(5), requiring that the federal work force be used efficiently and effectively); 5 CFR 351.201(b) (2022).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The process of filling vacancies during a RIF was described in <span class="Italic">Hanks v. FEMA</span>, 23 MSPR 567, 574-75 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...If...an agency chooses to fill a vacancy during the RIF, the agency must follow the regulations of 5 CFR Part 351....&#8197;No regulation in Part 351 requires the utilization of retention standing or tenure in the filling of vacancies pursuant to a RIF....&#8197;An agency must observe the requirements of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.701 in affording employees their assignment rights to vacant positions in a RIF....&#8197;This right of assignment may be satisfied by "bumping," which is the right to displace on the basis of subgroup priority, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.703(a)(1), or by "retreating," which is the right to displace if the position is one from or through which the employee was promoted or an essentially identical position. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.703(a)(2)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although an agency may establish a policy of filling vacancies during a RIF, nothing in statute or regulation requires an agency to place employees in vacant positions during a RIF. <span class="Italic">Hargis v. TVA</span>, 41 MSPR 490, 492 (1989). Even if the purpose of the RIF is to eliminate a series of temporary or term excepted positions and replace them with permanent, competitive service positions, the agency need not fill the latter group prior to separating employees in the former group. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Killingsworth v. DHHS</span>, 11 MSPR 273, 276 (1982). Nevertheless, should the agency implement a regulation or establish a policy requiring it to offer vacant positions in a reorganization, the policy will be enforced. <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 6 MSPR 500, 503, 6 MSPB 420 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Treese v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hardy v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 393 F.3d 1288, 1290-93 (Fed. Cir. 2005), explained that an agency is not obliged to fill a vacancy during a RIF unless an agency regulation or policy compels it to do so, and if the agency does fill a vacancy, it may select the vacancy, and the grade level of the vacancy, to fill:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hardy recognizes that under part 351 of 5 C.F.R., the Navy had discretion in choosing whether to fill vacant positions with RIF-displaced employees. She argues, however, that once the Navy decided to fill vacancies with RIF-displaced employees, she was entitled to an offer of placement in either the Manager 11 or Secretary 09 positions if she established her qualifications for those positions by satisfying the requirements set forth in section 351.703.[2] In this regard, Hardy claims that the substantial weight of the evidence readily demonstrates that she met both the education requirement and the capacity, adaptability, and special skills requirements contained within section 351.703. Thus, in essence, Hardy appears to contend that section 351.703 alone establishes entitlement to a vacancy of her choosing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Section 351.703 states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An agency may assign an employee to a vacant position under &#x00A7; 351.201(b) or &#x00A7; 351.701 of this part without regard to OPM's standards and requirements for the position if:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;The employee meets any minimum education requirement for the position; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;The agency determines that the employee has the capacity, adaptability, and special skills needed to satisfactorily perform the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hardy's argument is entirely off the mark. Section 351.703 does not <span id="Page_3078"></span>independently confer any assignment rights to vacancies on a RIF-displaced employee. Rather, section 351.703 is a dependent provision that only comes into play during a RIF action by way of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 351.201, 351.704, and 351.701. Nevertheless, Hardy entirely ignores these sections, relying exclusively on section 351.703.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When sections 351.201, 351.704, and 351.701 are applied in this case, none confer any assignment rights on Hardy, just as the Board found. Section 351.201 is directed generally to the applicability of the RIF regulations. Section 351.201(b) affords an agency discretion in deciding whether to fill vacancies with RIF-displaced employees, stating in pertinent part: "This part does not require an agency to fill a vacant position." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.201(b); <span class="Italic">see also Madsen v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 754 F.2d 343, 345 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (holding that an agency is not required to fill vacant positions in conducting a RIF). Section 351.704(a)(1) echoes the discretion afforded to an agency in filling vacancies during a RIF, stating in pertinent part: "An agency <span class="Italic">may</span> also offer an employee assignment under &#x00A7; 351.201(b) to a vacant position in lieu of separation by reduction in force under 5 CFR part 351." (Emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As just noted, section 351.703 provides that when an agency exercises its discretion under sections 351.201(b) and 351.704(a)(1) to place a RIF-displaced employee in a vacant position, it is permitted to do so even if the placement does not comply with normal OPM standards and requirements for the position. Section 351.703 states that "[a]n agency <span class="Italic">may</span> assign an employee to a vacant position under &#x00A7; 351.201(b)...of this part without regard to OPM's standards and requirements for the position" if specified conditions are met. (Emphasis added). In short, section 351.703 makes it easier to move a RIF-displaced employee into a vacant position if the agency wishes in its discretion to do so. It does not, however, grant a RIF-displaced employee any rights to a vacant position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only exception is where the agency, on its own, has adopted an agency regulation or mandatory policy of placing RIF-displaced employees in available vacancies. <span class="Italic">Spartin v. Gov't Printing Office</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 119, 123 (M.S.P.B. 1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 937 F.2d 623 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table) (holding that an agency is not obligated to offer vacancies to employees subject to a RIF action, absent a mandatory policy requiring an agency to fill vacant positions in lieu of separating RIF-displaced employees). Hardy has not alleged that the Navy had such a regulation or policy. The Navy, consequently, could have elected to fill the vacancies sought by Hardy before, during, or after the RIF with RIF-displaced employees. Alternatively, the Navy just as permissibly could have elected not to fill any of the vacancies in dispute or to fill them with outside applicants. On this basis, we conclude that the Board correctly determined that Hardy was not entitled to an offer of placement in either the vacant Manager 11 or Secretary 09 positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, the Navy, exercising its discretion, voluntarily offered to place Hardy into the vacant Secretary 07 position rather than release her from service. Having made this choice, the Navy was bound to follow applicable provisions of part 351. Section 351.201(b) states in pertinent part: "[W]hen an agency, <span class="Italic">at its discretion</span>, chooses to fill a vacancy by an employee who has been reached for release from a competitive level for one of the reasons in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, this part shall be followed." (Emphasis added). Thus, the issue on appeal is whether the Navy followed part 351 in offering to place Hardy in the Secretary 07 position as opposed to the Manager 11 or Secretary 09 positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 351.704 addresses the basic requirements that an agency must fulfill when it exercises its discretion to place a RIF-displaced employee in a vacant position. Section 351.704(a)(1) states in pertinent part: "Any offer of assignment under &#x00A7; 351.201(b) to a vacant position must meet the requirements set forth under &#x00A7; 351.701."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 351.701 sets forth the general assignment rights for a RIF-displaced employee. Section 351.701 provides in paragraph (a) as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When a group I or II competitive service employee with a current annual performance rating of record of minimally successful (Level 2) or equivalent, or higher, is released from a competitive level, an agency shall offer assignment, rather than furlough or separate, in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) or this section to another competitive position which requires no reduction, or the lease [sic] possible reduction, in representative rate. The employee must be qualified for the offered position. The offered position shall be in the same competitive area, last at least 3 months, and have the same type of work schedule (e.g., full-time, part-time, intermittent, or seasonal) as the position from which the employee is released. Upon accepting an offer of assignment, or displacing another employee under this part, an employee retains the same status and tenure in the new position. The promotion potential of the offered position is not a consideration in determining an employee's rights of assignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Paragraphs (b) and (c) of section 351.701 relate to bump and retreat rights, respectively.[3] Paragraph (d) qualifies the retreat rights set forth in paragraph (c). Other paragraphs of section 351.701 relate to pay rates (paragraph (e)) and the determination of applicable grades (or grade intervals) under sections 351.701(b)(2) and 351.701(c)(2) (paragraph (f)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;According to section 351.701(b):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A released employee shall be assigned in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and bump to a position that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Is held by another employee in a lower tenure group or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Is no more than three grades (or appropriate grade intervals or equivalent) below the position from which the employee was released.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">According to section 351.701(c):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A released employee shall be assigned in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section and retreat to a position that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Is held by another employee with lower retention standing in the same tenure group and subgroup; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Is not more than three grades (or appropriate grade intervals or equivalent) below the position from which the employee was released...; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Is the same position, or an essentially identical position, formerly held by the released employee on a permanent basis as a competing employee in a Federal agency....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While section 351.704(a)(1) explicitly refers to section 351.701, this section does not seem to have any substantive application in situations involving an offer of assignment to a vacant position. The reason is that section 351.701, beginning with its title "Assignment Involving Displacement," appears to be devoted to the situation in which an employee subject to a RIF displaces another employee by exercising bump or retreat rights. It does not say anything about the right of a RIF-displaced employee to be offered a vacant position, the subject addressed in section 351.704(a). The only possible connection between section 351.701 and section 351.704(a)(1) would be paragraph (a) of section 351.701, which states, in pertinent part, that "the employee must be qualified for the offered position." This paragraph may suggest that a RIF-displaced employee can only be placed into a vacancy position for which he is qualified under section 351.703. However, we need not and do not so decide here, but leave this issue for another day.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under both paragraphs (b) and (c) of section 351.701, a RIF-displaced employee can only exercise assignment rights to a position that is "held by another employee." A discretionary offer of assignment to a vacant position, which is all that is at issue in this case, cannot involve displacement of an incumbent employee. In any event, Hardy has never asserted that she was entitled to an encumbered position by reason of bump or retreat rights. Indeed, she could not, because the Manager 11 and Secretary 09 positions were vacant. Nor does Hardy argue section 351.701 otherwise supports her claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This conclusion, however, does not end our analysis. Despite not being clearly argued by Hardy, we still consider whether the Navy was obligated by any other provision of part 351 to offer Hardy placement in either of the two higher-graded vacancies. We conclude that no provision of the RIF regulations obligates an agency to offer placement in the highest-graded available vacancy. To the contrary, sections 351.201(b) and 351.704(a)(1) affirmatively provide complete discretion whether and how to fill vacancies during a RIF action. We have not been cited to, nor are we aware of, any RIF regulation that even implicitly obligates the agency to offer placement to the RIF-displaced employee in the highest-grade vacant position; the RIF regulations instead only obligate the agency to conform any discretionary assignment offer to section 351.701(a), meaning, at most, to evaluate qualifications for its chosen vacancy under section 351.703. An agency, therefore, can offer to place a RIF-displaced, but qualified, employee in any, all, or none of the vacancies without violating part 351.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that any requirement that an agency place a RIF-displaced employee in the highest-grade available vacancy could defeat the purpose of many RIF actions. Often, a government agency reduces the size of its workforce to match the available salary dollars appropriated by Congress. <span class="Italic">See Int'l Fed'n of Prof'l &#x0026; Technical Eng'rs</span>, 8 F.L.R.A. 212, 213 (1982) (noting that prerequisite conditions for a RIF include lack of work, shortage of funds, or agency reorganization). If an agency were required under the RIF regulations to offer to place every RIF-displaced employee in the highest-grade available vacancy for which such employee is qualified, then the agency might not be able to reduce its salary expenditures. Hence, an agency must be free to restructure its work force to meet the constraints placed upon it by Congress, including by not filling vacancies or only filling lower-grade and lower-pay vacancies. Any contrary interpretation of the RIF regulations, then, would be illogical and dysfunctional.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We thus conclude that Hardy has no legal basis for her challenge. The Navy was neither obligated under a mandatory policy nor under an <span id="Page_3079"></span>agency regulation to offer Hardy placement in a vacant position. Having opted in its discretion to try to do so, the Navy was not required to offer her placement in all vacant positions for which she was qualified. Instead, the Navy was entitled to elect whether to offer Hardy any, all, or none of those vacant positions. Accordingly, we conclude that the Board's decision upholding the Navy's offer to assign Hardy to the Secretary 07 position, but not the Manager 11 or Secretary 09 positions, must be <span class="Italic">AFFIRMED.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Baker v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 19 MSPR 432, 433 (1984), clarified the role of retention standing when employees from the same competitive level compete for the same vacancy during a RIF:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The RIF regulations state that an agency is not required to fill a vacancy during a RIF. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.201(b). However, if an agency chooses to fill a vacancy during the RIF with an employee released from his competitive level the personnel action must be consistent with RIF regulations. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The agency must determine the retention standing of each competing employee on the basis of tenure group, subgroup, and length of service. 5 CFR Part 351, Subparts D and E. A competing employee is released from his competitive level in the inverse order of retention standing....&#8197;This is the first round of RIF competition. The regulations at 5 CFR Part 351, Subpart G, set out the rights of a competing employee to displace an employee in a position in another competitive level. This right of assignment, which is the second round of RIF competition, may be satisfied by "bumping," which is the right to displace on the basis of subgroup priority, or by "retreating," which is the right to displace if the position is one from or through which the employee was promoted. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.701(b) and (c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the presiding official found that appellant was entitled to be placed in the vacant GS-12 Operations Planning and Control Specialist position because he had greater length of service than the individual placed in the position. The Board finds that the presiding official erred....&#8197;The RIF regulations do not require the agency to use retention standing to determine appellant's right to be assigned to a vacant position pursuant to a RIF. <span class="Italic">Klegman v. DHHS</span>, 16 MSPR 455 at 457 (1983). Appellant's right of assignment to the vacant position during the RIF must be by bumping or retreating.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Baker</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Berry v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 20 MSPR 507 (1984). <span class="Italic">Baker</span> was reconfirmed in <span class="Italic">Apodaca v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 19 MSPR 540, 545 (1984), concluding that once two employees are released from the same competitive level, the agency can fill a vacant position with the applicant of its choice; there is no right of assignment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. United States</span>, 153 Ct. Cl. 425 (1961). <span class="Italic">Baker</span> was again explained in <span class="Italic">Brumby v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 21 MSPR 773, n.1 (1984) (Table), and <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DHUD</span>, 22 MSPR 357, 360-61 (1984), determining as to the right to be placed in a vacancy filled through RIF procedures that if both competitors are in the same tenure group, one cannot displace the other by bumping, i.e., seniority does not control assignment to the vacancy.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The filling of vacancies was judicially reviewed in <span class="Italic">Wilburn v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 757 F.2d 260, 261-62 (Fed. Cir. 1985). During a RIF, appellant was demoted six grades below his GS-15 position. Appellant's position was abolished, along with several others of the same grade. Several GS-15 vacant positions in another office within the agency were offered to the appellant's coworkers. Two individuals accepted and one declined the positions, leaving one vacant GS-15 position. The agency then abolished the GS-15 position declined by one employee. Appellant maintained that the agency should have offered him the vacant position after the other individual declined it:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DOT asserts that the determination of whether to exclude the vacant position from consideration in the implementation of the reduction in force was a matter of unfettered agency discretion. Accordingly, DOT reasoned that it was not required to offer Wilburn the vacant GS-2101-15 position once Myers had declined it. However, 5 CFR 351.201(b) limits an agency's discretion in filling a vacancy. The regulation dictates that once an agency "chooses to fill a vacancy by an employee who has been reached for release from his...competitive level," the agency must follow the reduction-in-force regulations. In order to reflect properly the congressional concern for fairness, we strictly construe the regulation's limitation of agency discretion. To do otherwise would open the door to sham by manipulation of the reduction-in-force procedures. DOT does not contest the fact that Wilburn was qualified for the newly created vacant position; nevertheless DOT abolished the position once Myers had declined it, instead of offering it to Wilburn. In light of the fact that DOT created the vacant position prior to the effective date of the reduction in force, we must presume that DOT adequately considered the need for it as well as the relevant budgetary factors. Thus, DOT strongly appears to have abolished the newly created position for reasons personal to Wilburn. In so concluding, we have considered, but reject, DOT's argument that it changed its mind about a need for the position and that to do so was in its discretion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 reveals that the purpose of 5 USC 2301(b) (1982) is to protect employees against political coercion, discrimination, personal favoritism and unfair, arbitrary, or illegal action....&#8197;5 USC 2301(a)(1) specifically requires an executive agency, such as DOT, to adhere to merit system principles. Section 2301(b)(2) provides in part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">All employees and applicants for employment should receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the linchpin of federal personnel management is fairness, i.e., employees who are similarly situated are entitled to similar treatment....&#8197;The notion of fairness is implicit in the reduction-in-force regulations. 5 CFR 351.201(b) reflects the congressional concern for fairness, limiting an agency's discretion in filling a vacancy during a reduction in force.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...DOT's refusal to offer Wilburn the vacant position undercuts the merit system principles on which the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 was founded. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a reconsideration of the case in light of all pertinent regulations.</p>

Dept. of Energy</span>, 20 MSPR 135, 139 (1984) (when a vacancy was "artificially maintained until after the effective date of the RIF," the agency's actions caused a reversal of the RIF because "[I]ts actions violate[d] the spirit of the employee's rights under the reduction-in-force regulations."). <span class="Italic">Wilburn</span> was distinguished from another decision finding no manipulation in the creation and later disestablishment of a vacancy during the period of a RIF.
