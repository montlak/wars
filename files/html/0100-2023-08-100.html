<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-99"><span class="space">3.</span> Jurisdictional Issue; Right to Hearing</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Jurisdictional problems involved in probationary terminations should be handled with care. A probationer who does not have the right to appeal does not have a right to a Board hearing when the employing agency incorrectly states in his termination letter that he has a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">Metz v. USPS</span>, 1 MSPR 693, 694-95, 2 MSPB 103 (1980). If there is a substantial dispute as to whether the government's personnel records correctly reflect the nature of the appellant's appointment, such as whether the employee is or is not a probationer, the AJ should provide a hearing on jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. FAA</span>, 32 MSPR 100, 102-03 (1987); <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 6 MSPR 273, 275, 6 MSPB 233 (1981) ("Although the appellant has the burden of proof on the issued of jurisdiction, his submissions were sufficient to require the agency to come forward with credible evidence concerning the matters he asserted. <span class="Italic">Cardin v. Department of the Navy</span>, [4 MSPR 2] 4 MSPB 97 (1980). The agency's claim that the appellant was hired from a register and was, therefore, required to serve a probationary period, ignores some of the obvious questions. Therefore, because of the extraordinary facts and circumstances of this case, we vacate the initial decision and remand this appeal with instructions to the presiding official to reopen the record for the purpose of affording appellant a hearing on the issue of jurisdiction."). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-092.html#sec1-90">Representation by Agency that Probation is Not Required; Equitable Estoppel</a>," and later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-103.html#sec1-102">Harmful Error Analysis; <span class="Italic">Stephen</span></a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit explained the proper approach for Board analysis of jurisdiction and burdens of proof in a probationer's appeal, <span class="Italic">Stokes v. FAA</span>, 761 F.2d 682, 684-87 (Fed. Cir. 1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A probationary employee has no statutory right to appeal, 5 USC 7511-7514. Under an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulation, 5 CFR 315.806(b), the Board will, however, consider appeals from agency actions adverse to probationary employees when those employees allege that those actions were the result of partisan political or marital status discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having heard and considered the entire case, including the government's proof of a non-discriminatory basis for the adverse action, the presiding official based the dismissal on "lack of jurisdiction."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Jurisdiction means the right or power of a tribunal to act....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The OPM regulation, 5 CFR 315.806(b) states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">On discrimination</span>. An employee may appeal under this paragraph a termination not required by statute which he or she <span class="Italic">alleges</span> was based on partisan political reasons or marital status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board would thus have no jurisdiction to consider an appeal filed by a probationary employee who does not "allege" marital discrimination or partisan politics and may simply dismiss such an appeal on sight. The regulation, however, establishes a probationary employee's right to appeal, and thus the Board's initial jurisdiction to act, i.e., to consider that appeal, when the probationary employee does so allege....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The probationary employee bears the burden throughout of establishing jurisdiction.... That burden is not met, therefore, upon the mere filing of allegations....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he probationary employee faces initially a two-step process. First, he must include in his appeal an allegation of marital discrimination supported by factual assertions indicating that the allegation is not a <span class="Italic">pro-forma</span> pleading. A merely conclusory pleading is insufficient. When, as here, a facially non-frivolous allegation of marital discrimination has been supported, the probationary employee has a right to a hearing.... Second, at the hearing, he must support his allegation with a showing of facts which would, if not controverted, require a finding that marital discrimination was the basis for the discharge. If the probationary employee fails to make such a showing, the case may be dismissed for failure to support the jurisdictional allegation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the probationary employee does make the required showing in support of his allegation,...the agency may then proceed to refute that showing. It may do so by attacking the truth of that showing directly, or by establishing a non-discriminatory basis for its adverse action, or both.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;As a practical matter, the agency can be expected, as it did here, to take both approaches at the one hearing, when the facts so warrant. Convinced that it had fully controverted Stokes' fact allegations of marital discrimination, the agency could, at that point, have moved for dismissal for Stokes' failure to support his jurisdictional allegation, i.e., failure to carry his burden of establishing jurisdiction. We do not say that agencies should follow that practice, but cite its availability as illustrative of the need to maintain consistency in the allocation of burdens of proof.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency bears the burden of proving the legitimacy of its adverse action, in this case that it was taken on a non-discriminatory basis.... That the agency may more easily meet that burden in the case of a probationary employee, because it need only articulate a non-discriminatory reason, does not mean that it escapes the burden entirely. If the agency articulates a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the adverse action, the burden of going forward falls on the employee to rebut that reason by demonstrating that it is pretextual. If...the employee provides a rebuttal,...the agency must, as it did here, refute that rebuttal with evidence supporting its non-discriminatory articulation. Once the probationary employee establishes that a basis for the discharge could have been marital discrimination, the burden of persuading the decisionmaker that the discharge was not actually based on discrimination rests on the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the Board dismisses a probationary employee's appeal for failure to support the jurisdictional allegation of marital discrimination, "lack of jurisdiction" is, as above indicated, an adequate description of the basis for that dismissal. When, as here, the Board goes on to determine the entire case on its merits, i.e., to determine that the agency had articulated and supported a non-discriminatory reason and the probationary employee <span id="Page_144"></span>had not shown that reason to be mere pretext, that description of the basis for dismissal is, for a number of reasons, inappropriate....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...To say, under those circumstances, that the Board has decided only that it lacks jurisdiction is to say that it acted without authority in determining that the employee was discharged for non-discriminatory reasons.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Stokes</span>, the employee must support his allegation of jurisdiction by factual assertions demonstrating that the allegation is not <span class="Italic">pro forma</span>. <span class="Italic">Phillips v.

DHHS</span>, 36 MSPR 94, 98-99 (1987). Under <span class="Italic">Brown-Cummings</span>, the appellant reaches a hearing based upon nonfrivolous jurisdictional allegations. At the hearing, if the agency successfully controverts the factual showing made by the probationary employee in support of his jurisdictional allegation, it is as though no jurisdictional showing was made. The right to appeal and the Board's jurisdiction then constitute a unified dispositive issue.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has long held, as explained by our reviewing court in <span class="Italic">Stokes v. Federal Aviation Administration,</span> 761 F.2d 682 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, in order to establish Board jurisdiction over her appeal, the appellant relied solely on her allegation that Mr. Rogers told her the agency was returning her to her former non-supervisory position in part because she was a single mother. The administrative judge determined that the allegation was nonfrivolous and held a jurisdictional hearing, consistent with the first step outlined in <span class="Italic">Stokes.</span> <span class="Italic">Stokes,</span> 761 F.2d at 686. At the hearing, the administrative judge made a credibility determination regarding that alleged statement, finding Mr. Rogers's denial of making that statement credible. Under <span class="Italic">Stokes,</span> the agency successfully controverted the appellant's sole allegation of marital status discrimination at the jurisdictional hearing, thus precluding the appellant from meeting her burden on jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Stokes,</span> 761 F.2d at 686-87 (finding that the appellant "met his Waterloo when the agency succeeded in directly controverting [his] showing [in support of his jurisdictional allegation of marital status discrimination], and thus proving that<span class="Italic"> Stokes</span> had not met his burden of establishing his right to appeal and thus the Board's jurisdiction"). The administrative judge here, however, proceeded to weigh the evidence in support of the agency's stated reason for the action against the appellant's evidence of discrimination. Under<span class="Italic"> Stokes,</span> the administrative judge made a judgment on the merits of the appeal and not a jurisdictional determination.<span class="Italic"> Stokes,</span> 761 F.2d at 687. However, in light of the decision of our reviewing court in <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 437 F.3d 1322 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant in <span class="Italic">Garcia</span> filed an appeal with the Board alleging that she involuntarily accepted a reduction in grade because the agency failed to accommodate her disability. <span class="Italic">Garcia,</span> 437 F.3d at 1325-26. The administrative judge determined that she had not proven that her actions were involuntary, and dismissed her case for lack of jurisdiction without holding a hearing or reaching her discrimination claims.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1326. On appeal to the Federal Circuit, the appellant contended that she could establish jurisdiction merely by making a non-frivolous allegation that she accepted a position at a lower grade involuntarily. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1330. The Federal Circuit, however, held that, in determining jurisdiction over a constructive adverse action appeal, the Board should follow a two-step process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[O]nce a claimant makes non-frivolous claims of Board jurisdiction, namely claims that, if proven, establish the Board's jurisdiction, then the claimant has a right to a hearing. At the hearing, the claimant must prove jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. If the Board determines that the claimant fails to prove jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence, then the Board does not have jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1344. This process differs from the one described in <span class="Italic">Stokes</span> in requiring the appellant at the hearing not merely to provide evidence of jurisdiction which the agency does not directly controvert, but to prove the basis for jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the two-step process defined in <span class="Italic">Garcia</span> applies to an appeal brought under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.908.[2] Accordingly, we find that <span class="Italic">Stokes</span> has been abrogated by the Federal Circuit's subsequent <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Garcia.</span> Having won the right to a hearing by alleging facts that would, if proven, establish jurisdiction, the appellant in this case was required to prove the basis for jurisdiction, i.e., marital status discrimination, by a preponderance of the evidence. Thus, because the administrative judge properly found that the appellant failed to meet that ultimate burden, the Board lacks jurisdiction over her appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The court did not indicate in <span class="Italic">Garcia</span> whether the same process would apply outside the chapter 75 context. However, the court found in <span class="Italic">Bledsoe v.

Therefore, in light of <span class="Italic">Bledsoe,</span> we find that the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Garcia</span> applies to appeals brought under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.908.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant provides specific information suggesting that prior service would count toward completion of his probationary period, a hearing should be held on that issue if the appellant's contentions are disputed by the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Di Iorio v. Holocaust Memorial Council</span>, 69 MSPR 100, 105 (1995). An evidentiary hearing on a jurisdictional issue, for example, whether the employee is required to serve a probationary period and, if so, the proper dates of that period, should be held when the documents are inconsistent or ambiguous, or require explanation by witnesses. Affidavits are not sufficient if they include no more than conclusory statements. <span class="Italic">Bilodeau v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3106). But if the documentation is sufficient to resolve the jurisdictional issue, no hearing is required, <span class="Italic">Hardy v. MSPB</span>, 13 F.3d 1571, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hardy also argues that he should have had a hearing on the issues of his tour of duty, McKinley's authority to remove him, and the completion of his probationary period. "There is no statutory requirement that the Board hold a hearing on the threshold issue of jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Wilson v. MSPB</span>, 807 F.2d 1577, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1986).

<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant alleges partisan political or marital status discrimination, he should have at least the opportunity to show, through evidence or an offer of proof, that the allegation is nonfrivolous and warrants a hearing. <span class="Italic">Sweeting v.

Ordinarily the AJ's notice of pleading requirements will be set out in the acknowledgment order issued following the filing of the appeal or in a show cause order; sometimes the agency will raise the jurisdictional issue through a motion to dismiss the appeal.

<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_145"></span><span class="Italic">Bencosme v. Dept. of Transp.</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 96-3178), explained the requisites for a hearing in an appeal from a probationary dismissal for pre-employment conditions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Probationary employees who are dismissed due to preemployment conditions are given only limited rights to appeal their dismissal before the Board. Such probationary employees may appeal only on the following grounds: (1) discrimination based on partisan political reasons or marital status; or (2) failure to comply with the procedural requirements set forth at 5 CFR 315.805 (1994) where termination is based on conditions arising pre-employment. 5 CFR 315.806 (1994). The employee bears the burden of demonstrating that the Board has jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Stokes v. Federal Aviation Admin.</span>, 761 F.2d 682, 686 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A probationary employee faces a two-step process when he raises one of the above grounds for appeal. First, the employee must include in his appeal a facially non-frivolous allegation supporting jurisdiction, e.g., an allegation that the agency failed to follow the proper procedures as set forth in 5 CFR 315.805. This allegation must be "supported by factual assertions indicating that the allegation is not a <span class="Italic">pro-forma</span> pleading.<span class="Italic">" Stokes</span>, 761 F.2d at 686. A merely conclusory pleading is not sufficient to create jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the employee must support his allegation with a showing of factual evidence which, if not disputed, would be sufficient to require a finding that the ground alleged in support of jurisdiction was the basis for the employee's termination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If the employee fails to make such a showing, an appeal may properly be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board is not required by statute to hold an evidentiary hearing on the issue of jurisdiction, certain circumstances exist in which such a hearing is proper: for example, "it would be appropriate for the [Board] to honor a request for hearing where a petitioner's allegations raise non-frivolous issues of fact relating to jurisdiction which cannot be resolved simply on submissions of documentary evidence." <span class="Italic">Manning v. MSPB</span>, 742 F.2d 1424, 1428 (Fed. Cir. 1984). <span class="Italic">Manning</span> has been interpreted to mean that an employee is generally entitled to a hearing whenever "a facially non-frivolous allegation [of a proper jurisdictional basis] has been supported." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Stokes</span>, 761 F.2d at 686. However, a hearing need not be granted where the agency has submitted evidence refuting the employee's allegations and the employee has failed to respond to that evidence. <span class="Italic">See Manning</span>, 742 F.2d at 1428. Likewise, a hearing need not be granted where the Board has requested the submission of evidence and the employee has failed to comply with the Board's request. <span class="Italic">Briscoe v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, 55 F.3d 1571, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1995) ("Although an appellant need not prove her entire case before she is entitled to a hearing, the board may request sufficient evidence to determine if, in the first instance, there is any support for what otherwise might be bald allegations."). In those instances, the Board may properly decide the jurisdictional issue on the papers before it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Bencosme alleged that DOT failed to follow the procedural requirements set forth at 5 CFR 315.805 by failing to consider his response to the notice of termination. Such an allegation, if proven, would be sufficient to convey jurisdiction. Moreover, Bencosme supported his allegation with the factual assertion that DOT had made its decision to terminate his employment in late May, as evidenced by its decision to cancel his mandatory training session in Oklahoma, scheduled for May 31, 1995. Ordinarily, we might say such a factual assertion was sufficient to require the Board to grant Bencosme's request for a hearing on the jurisdictional issue. However, the AJ specifically ordered Bencosme to file argument and evidence to support his jurisdictional claim. Bencosme failed to submit any evidence. Thus, in light of Bencosme's failure to submit any evidence to support his allegation, the undisputed fact that DOT withdrew its initial proposed termination after Bencosme's response, and the undisputed fact that DOT's termination letter explicitly stated that the agency had considered Bencosme's response, the AJ did not abuse his discretion in deciding the jurisdictional issue on the papers and did not err in deciding that the Board lacked jurisdiction to hear Bencosme's appeal. <span class="Italic">See Briscoe</span>, 55 F.3d at 1573-74. Therefore, we <span class="Italic">affirm.</span></p>
