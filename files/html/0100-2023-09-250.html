<p class="Body-Text">The Board's rules governing deposition practice, 5 CFR 1201.73, 1201.75 (2022), provide:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Initiating discovery</span>. A party seeking discovery must start the process by serving a request for discovery on the representative of the party or nonparty, or, if there is no representative, on the party or nonparty themselves. The request for discovery must state the time limit for responding, as prescribed in 1201.73(d) of this part, and must specify the time and place of the taking of the deposition, if applicable. When a party directs a request for discovery to the official or employee of a Federal agency that is a party, the agency must make the officer or employee available on official time to respond to the request and must assist the officer or employee as necessary in providing relevant information that is available to the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Responses to discovery requests</span>. A party or nonparty must answer a discovery request within the time provided under paragraph (d)(2) of <span id="Page_1236"></span>this section, either by furnishing to the requesting party the information requested or agreeing to make deponents available to testify within a reasonable time, or by stating an objection to the particular request and the reasons for the objection. Parties and nonparties may respond to discovery requests by electronic mail if authorized by the requesting party.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Motions to compel or issue a subpoena</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;If a party fails or refuses to respond in full to a discovery request, the requesting party may file a motion to compel discovery. If a nonparty fails or refuses to respond in full to a discovery request, the requesting party may file a motion for the issuance of a subpoena directed to the individual or entity from which the discovery is sought under the procedures described in 1201.81 of this part. The requesting party must serve a copy of the motion on the other party or nonparty. Before filing any motion to compel or issue a subpoena, the moving party shall discuss the anticipated motion with the opposing party or nonparty, and all those involved shall make a good faith effort to resolve the discovery dispute and narrow the areas of disagreement. The motion shall include:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;A copy of the original request and a statement showing that the information sought is discoverable under section 1201.72;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;A copy of the response to the request (including the objections to discovery) or, where appropriate, a statement that no response has been received, along with an affidavit or sworn statement under 28 U.S.C. 1746 supporting the statement (See appendix IV to part 1201); and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iii)&#x2003;A statement that the moving party has discussed or attempted to discuss the anticipated motion with the nonmoving party or nonparty and made a good faith effort to resolve the discovery dispute and narrow the areas of disagreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The party or nonparty from whom discovery was sought may respond to the motion to compel or the motion to issue a subpoena within the time limits stated in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Time limits</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Unless otherwise directed by the judge, parties must serve their initial discovery requests within 30 days after the date on which the judge issues an order to the respondent agency to produce the agency file and response.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;A party or nonparty must serve a response to a discovery request promptly, but not later than 20 days after the date of service of the request or order of the judge. Any discovery requests following the initial request must be served within 10 days of the date of service of the prior response, unless the parties are otherwise directed by the judge. Deposition witnesses must give their testimony at the time and place stated in the request for deposition or in the subpoena, unless the parties agree on another time or place.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Limits on the number of discovery requests</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Absent prior approval by the judge or agreement by the parties, each party may not take more than 10 depositions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Requests to exceed the limitations set forth in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section may be granted at the discretion of the judge. In considering such requests, the judge shall consider the factors identified in &#x00A7; 1201.72(d) of this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1201.75 <span class="Italic">Taking depositions</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Depositions may be taken by any method agreed upon by the parties. The person providing information is subject to penalties for intentional false statements.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 1201.33 (2022) adds as to the responsibility of federal entities to make personnel available for depositions:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Every Federal agency or corporation, including nonparties, must make its employees or personnel available to furnish sworn statements or to appear at a deposition or hearing when ordered by the judge to do so. When providing those statements or appearing at a deposition or at the hearing, Federal employee witnesses will be in official duty status (i.e., entitled to pay and benefits including travel and per diem, where appropriate). When a desired witness is employed by an agency who is not a party to the Board proceeding, the requesting party may avail itself of the provisions of sections 1201.81 to 1201.85 of this part regarding subpoenas to ensure the attendance of the witness. In addition, the Board and the parties will implement this provision, to the maximum extent possible, to avoid conflict with other regulations governing the production of Federal employees in matters in litigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;A Federal employee who is denied the official time required by paragraph (a) of this section may file a written request that the judge order the employing agency to provide such official time. The judge will act on such a request promptly and, where warranted, will order the agency to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;An order obtained under paragraph (b) of this section may be enforced as provided under subpart F of this part.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Deposition practice in the federal courts is controlled by the Rules 30-32 of the FRCP.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Depositions produce live testimony and permit follow-up questions. They lock witnesses into their accounts of events. If finances permit and other means of investigation cannot obtain necessary information, depositions become invaluable. In <span class="Italic">Pedersen v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 9 MSPR 195, 199 (1981), the Board considered a discovery ruling by an ALJ who refused to require depositions because written statements from the witnesses were available. The right to discovery was infringed. The Board noted that one of the principal purposes of taking a deposition is to pin the witness down under oath on all relevant matters, providing a basis for impeaching the witness if he departs from that testimony at the hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Depositions permit recordation of testimony for later use at a hearing if there is good reason for use of a deposition transcript instead of in-person testimony at the hearing (still allowing for the possible introduction of a deposition of the appellant, or portions of it, as hearing evidence by the agency, and still allowing for use of deposition transcripts as impeachment evidence at hearings). It may occur that a witness whose testimony is essential cannot attend a Board hearing. The testimony may be taken through deposition, and the transcript entered into evidence at the hearing. If taken for later use at a hearing, it helps to ensure that the deposition is in a form that can be used by the Board. In <span class="Italic">Giltner v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 39 MSPR 253, 258 (1988), the deposition was by videotape. The AJ would not accept the tape because he had no facility for viewing it, a situation that must have suggested scenes from <span class="Italic">Alice's Restaurant</span> to appellant's counsel. The Board determined no harm was done because the AJ considered a transcript of the testimony taken at the deposition<span class="Italic">.</span> In another appeal, an AJ did not arrive at a hearing in sufficient time for a witness who could not remain at the hearing but whose testimony was taken by the parties and recorded by the stenographer. When that testimony was in deposition form, it was the responsibility of the party seeking its admission as evidence to ensure that it became part of the appeal record. It was insufficient to assume that the transcript would be entered by the stenographer into the hearing transcript. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pelletier v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 25 MSPR 411, 413-14 (1984) (alternatively concluding that the appellant did not show that omitted testimony affected the outcome of an appeal). If a deposition is submitted into the Board record, the party submitting the transcript should explain whether it is to be used for impeachment or as direct evidence. That would likely be explained in the prehearing submission (identifying exhibits) and discussed in the prehearing conference. <span class="italic">See</span> <span class="italic">Greer v. Dept. of Army</span>, SF-0752-15-0869-I-1 (NP 10/6/2022) ("The appellant further argues that the administrative judge previously accepted the deposition transcripts into the record. However, the appellant does not dispute the agency's contention that the administrative judge only intended to allow the appellant to use the deposition transcripts for impeachment purposes during the hearing.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The representatives of both parties normally attend the deposition. Under FLRA law, union representatives may have the right to notice of a deposition and presence during the deposition of a unit employee, but the union representative does not have a right to actively participate unless the union representative is also the appellant's representative before the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">INS, Border Patrol and AFGE, Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 47 FLRA 170 (1993). [Refer to Chapter 8, "Representation During Formal Discussions" of Broida's <span class="Italic">A Guide to Federal Labor Relations Authority Law and Practice</span> (<a href="https://deweypub.com/store/23FLRA.html">Dewey Publications, Inc</a>. 2023).]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">What happens if the representative of the party against whom the deposition will be offered cannot attend the deposition on any date scheduled before the hearing? That problem arose in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 15 MSPR 617, 620 (1983). The appellant's representative took and offered into evidence the deposition of the appellant's physician. Agency counsel could not attend the deposition and objected to the entry of the transcript as an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication. The Board dismissed the agency objection in <span class="Italic">Brown,</span> since that the agency could have but did not remedy its problem by having the physician subpoenaed to the hearing, by presenting rebuttal evidence at the hearing, or by requesting a postponement of the hearing to prepare rebuttal evidence. The Board may decline to admit evidence developed through a deposition attended by only one party if the Board concludes that the deposition was irregular or conducted in a manner to deny the other party due process. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Riethmaier v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 6 MSPR 73, 75, 6 MSPB 73 (1981); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Riethmaier v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 6 MSPR 73, 75-76, 6 MSPB 73 (1981) (agency could not conduct an <span class="Italic">ex-parte</span> interview and expect that the transcript would be considered by the Board in lieu of the agency's appearance and participation at the hearing before the AJ).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Earlier Board rules at 5 CFR 1201.73(a)(2) required that a copy of the deposition notice be served upon the individual to be deposed. <span class="Italic">West v. DHUD</span>, 20 MSPR 194, 195 (1984). The rules issued at the end of 1989 dropped the requirement that deposition notices be served directly on deponents, unless the deponents were private citizens or employees of nonparty federal agencies. The change in Board rules followed standard litigation practice. Federal procedure does not require service of the deposition notice on a deponent. Because depositions without subpoenas can normally be taken only of the agents or employees of a party involved in the litigation, it is left to counsel to notify his client of the need for deposition appearances of witnesses under the <span id="Page_1237"></span>client's control. Subpoenas are served on nonparties in federal civil litigation (although a subpoena is not needed if a nonparty witness agrees to appear for a deposition).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Deposition witnesses give their testimony at the time and place stated in the deposition notice or in the subpoena, unless there is an agreement to some other arrangement. 5 CFR 1201.73(d)(2) (2022). Representatives take note: the regulation means that your opponent may require witnesses to appear at his office. The routine press of business does not give an agency representative the right to insist that the representative seeking to take a deposition do so only at the activity offices. Managers and clerks alike may be required to endure the tiring journey to the office of appellant's counsel.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The deposition notice need only be a letter to opposing counsel requesting that he produce at your office deposition witnesses, on a certain date and time, witnesses within his control. Often counsel exchange emails identifying deponents, confer or exchange more email about dates and times that work for everyone, and confirm these exchanges with a written notice of depositions served on opposing counsel.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to securing attendance of witnesses at depositions, expert witnesses aside, the appellant controls no one but himself. The agency counsel should produce employees and officials of the organization. Deponents who are federal employees provide their testimony on official time. 5 CFR 1201.73(b) (2022). Depositions taken of nonparties may require the initial involvement of the AJ, through a motion seeking an order authorizing the deposition and issuance of a subpoena. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1201.73(c), 1201.81 (2022). The deposition notice is a formality, but it is an important formality. The agency is not obliged to make employees available at a deposition until their presence is properly required. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA v. Glover</span>, 23 MSPR 57, 66 (1984) (agency properly informed employees that they need not appear for depositions that were not noticed in accordance with the Board's discovery regulations); <span class="Italic">Oberman v. USPS</span>, 13 MSPR 218, 220 (1982) (same result as <span class="Italic">Glover</span>).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Deposition practice is regulated by Federal Rule 30 (not repeated here because of its length). Although the Federal Rules are not controlling, they do provide guidance. Depositions are generally taken under oath or affirmation. Under prior Board rules, the deposition was to be taken "before a person who had no interest in the outcome of the proceedings and was authorized by law to administer oaths." Under present rules, the depositions may be taken by any method agreed upon by the parties. If a "court reporter," i.e., a commercial stenographer, is used, the reporter will ordinarily be a notary who can administer an oath. If a reporter is not used, e.g., the deposition is recorded by tape or digital device by the parties, one can simply request the witness to affirm that he or she will tell the truth, or one can ask the witness to affirm that he or she understands that the testimony is being provided in a federal administrative proceeding governed by the Federal False Statements Act, 18 USC 1001, the procedure established by 5 CFR 1201.75 (2022) ("The person providing information is subject to penalties for intentional false statements"). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Yancy v. GSA</span>, 57 MSPR 192, 197-98 (1993) (under regulations after 1989, depositions may be taken by any method agreed upon by the parties; under an earlier regulation, deposition testimony was required to be under oath and an individual who took depositions had not established his authority to administer oaths); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Hubbard v. United States</span>, 115 S. Ct. 1754 (1995) (providing some interpretation of 18 USC 1001). Although FRCP 30(d)(1) limits a deposition to one day of seven hours, an AJ did not abuse his discretion by allowing a deposition to go longer. <span class="Italic">Chacon v. DHHS</span>, NY-1221-14-0372-W-1 (NP 1/4/2017) ("She argues that the administrative judge erred in permitting the agency to depose her over multiple days, which the appellant characterized as oppressive. However, the instant appeal involved numerous allegations of disclosures and retaliatory acts, implicating several management officials, over a number of years. Given the complexity of the case, we find that the administrative judge exercised proper discretion in granting the agency a second day to complete its deposition.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Depositions are conducted through question and answer. Opposing counsel may object to questions, but a witness associated with opposing counsel's client must answer the question unless directed not to do so by his counsel, and that should not occur unless the question calls for disclosure of privileged information. Alternatively, objections may all be reserved until the hearing when deposition testimony is offered as affirmative evidence or used during cross-examination. After the representative who called for the deposition completes his questions, opposing counsel may ask followup questions or may choose to ask none. The appellant may sit in on all depositions, for he is a party to the appeal. The depositions are not public gatherings; those with no business related to the deposition should not attend unless the parties otherwise agree. For example, agency counsel could reasonably agree that the spouse of a particularly anxious appellant could attend a deposition to provide emotional support during the appellant's deposition; or appellant's counsel could reasonably agree that another lawyer or two from the office of agency counsel could sit in the deposition as a training exercise if they restrain themselves and pledge to keep confidential the information discussed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Concerning objections during depositions, and the effect of those objections on testimony, Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(c)(2) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Objections</span>. An objection at the time of the examination--whether to evidence, to a party's conduct, to the officer's qualifications, to the manner of taking the deposition, or to any other aspect of the deposition--must be noted on the record, but the examination still proceeds; the testimony is taken subject to any objection. An objection must be stated concisely in a nonargumentative and nonsuggestive manner. A person may instruct a deponent not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation ordered by the court, or to present a motion under Rule 30(d)(3).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a witness refuses to answer questions, or should counsel for one side or another act improperly or obstructively during the deposition, a motion to sanction the offending party for obstructive conduct or to compel testimony of a witness who refuses to answer a question may be filed with the AJ. A joint phone call to the AJ when the problem arises or when a witness is instructed not to answer a question may do as well; it has the advantage of permitting the deposition to continue if the AJ informally and immediately resolves the dispute by ruling on the objection or by offering guidance to the parties. AJs may not be excited about monitoring deposition objections, but they may elect, or not elect, to become involved through telephone calls during the deposition. If they participate they will offer suggestions to resolve the objection, or they may prefer that the problem be presented through a motion to compel discovery. [Refer to Chapter 4, "<a href="0100-2023-11-060.html#sec4-61">Deposition</a>," particularly to the practice of signature requirements when depositions are transcribed.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Ordinarily, deposition testimony is transcribed. In Board practice, because deposition costs cannot be recovered in cases not involving EEO, IRA, or, possibly USERRA or VEOA claims, <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 699 F.2d 1140 (Fed. Cir. 1983), and agencies cannot recover these costs in any case, it makes sense to reduce expense. Transcripts cost about $4 to $5 per page; a deposition may run 200 pages or more for a day of testimony. To avoid the expense, consider an agreement to tape or digitally record the testimony, allowing anyone who desires a transcript to arrange for transcription of the recording. Or the other party may bring its own reporter to the deposition. The Board preserves testimony at hearings by audio recording, so there should be no fundamental objection to entering deposition tapes or digital files into evidence if a transcript of the deposition would be otherwise admissible; however, an AJ may decline to receive these offerings, and the party seeking to enter the deposition into evidence may have to pay to have it transcribed (an issue that should be raised during a status conference or through a motion prior to the prehearing submission date). Board regulations do not state that one or another recording method must be used; the parties are to agree on the means of recording a deposition. 5 CFR 1201.75 (2022). And if they do not agree? Let the AJ sort it out through a conference call, or if one must, through a motion to compel.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Dwelling for a moment more on the means of recording depositions, because the deposition is often used only for discovery and not for impeachment (meaning that the deposition itself need not be entered into evidence), the recording procedure permitted by the Federal Rules will significantly reduce expenses for everyone. FRCP 30(b)(3, 4) provides:</p> 
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;<span class="italic">Method of Recording</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;<span class="italic">Method Stated in the Notice</span>. The party who notices the deposition must state in the notice the method for recording the testimony. Unless the court orders otherwise, testimony may be recorded by audio, audiovisual, or stenographic means. The noticing party bears the recording costs. Any party may arrange to transcribe a deposition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;<span class="italic">Additional Method</span>. With prior notice to the deponent and other parties, any party may designate another method for recording the testimony in addition to that specified in the original notice. That party bears the expense of the additional record or transcript unless the court orders otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)&#x2003;<span class="italic">By Remote Means</span>. The parties may stipulate--or the court may on motion order--that a deposition be taken by telephone or other remote means. For the purpose of this rule and Rules 28(a), 37(a)(2), and 37(b)(1), the deposition takes place where the deponent answers the questions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the parties agree on the tape or digital recording procedure, agreement must also be reached on who will be responsible for copying the tape or distributing the digital file; alternatively everyone can bring a tape or digital recorder. The taping procedure received approval from the Board. An agency objection to the taping of depositions was overruled by ALJ McCarthy in <span class="Italic">McIntire v. CPSC</span>, 19 MSPR 437 (1984) (an unreported ALJ Decision was issued prior to the final decision reported in MSPR):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The depositions to be taken on January 15, 1982, may be recorded by means of a tape recorder or other similar device subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;The appellant shall arrange for the proper administration of the oath to witnesses;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;Appellant shall arrange for verification of the accuracy of the recording.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;A copy of the tape recording shall be made available to the agency, if requested, upon payment of the cost of providing a copy of the tape;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1238"></span>(4)&#x2003;Either party shall have the right to have a transcript prepared at the expense of the requesting party.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reason that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure recognize that a deposition may be recorded by other than stenographic means, the Board should be sympathetic to the requests of parties who wish to avoid the substantial expense involved in the stenographic recording of discovery depositions. With regard to transcriptions, the Board itself has recently been confronted with the problem of reducing its own expenses by restricting transcriptions of its hearings. Accordingly, requests of the parties, particularly individual appellants, to undertake discovery in the least expensive manner will be granted provided there are assurances that an accurate record is available and that any party will be able to obtain a transcript if desired.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to alternate means of taking depositions, Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Method of Recording.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Method Stated in the Notice.</span> The party who notices the deposition must state in the notice the method for recording the testimony. Unless the court orders otherwise, testimony may be recorded by audio, audiovisual, or stenographic means. The noticing party bears the recording costs. Any party may arrange to transcribe a deposition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Additional Method</span>. With prior notice to the deponent and other parties, any party may designate another method for recording the testimony in addition to that specified in the original notice. That party bears the expense of the additional record or transcript unless the court orders otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">By Remote Means</span>. The parties may stipulate--or the court may on motion order--that a deposition be taken by telephone or other remote means. For the purpose of this rule and Rules 28(a), 37(a)(2), and 37(b)(1), the deposition takes place where the deponent answers the questions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At the end of 1989, the Board revised its regulations to conform to federal litigation practice by providing at 5 CFR 1201.75 that depositions may be taken by any method agreed upon by the parties. The change reflected the Board's formal approval of tape-recorded or digitally-recorded depositions as a means the parties may agree upon for taking a deposition. If the other side does not agree to an audio recording or other means of preserving the deposition, presumably one is left with traditional commercial transcription if the matter is not resolved through motion to the AJ. If there is no agreement on any method of recordation, there is not likely going to be a deposition unless the AJ's assistance is invoked.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The audio recording procedure has benefits and burdens. Although much cheaper than stenographic recordation, an audio file or tape is much less convenient than a transcript. One must listen to it to find a particular section of interest. It is cumbersome to use a tape or audio recording to impeach a witness during a hearing. A compromise is to record the deposition and then have it commercially or informally transcribed by a typist working from the recording if the case does not settle and if the transcript proves beneficial in the adjudication of the appeal. It avoids disruptive objections at the hearing if a copy of an informal transcript is provided to opposing counsel in advance of the hearing to determine if there are objections to the accuracy of the transcription. If the transcript is prepared by a "court reporter," any party who desires to check its accuracy buys a copy. If a transcript is to be used, whether prepared by a "court reporter" or informally, the parties should also determine, in advance of the hearing (usually not later than the conclusion of the deposition), whether the deponent should have the opportunity to read and correct the transcript. If the deponent (or her lawyer) does not buy a copy but has the right to review the transcript for accuracy, the stenographic firm will make arrangements for the deponent to review the transcript in the stenographer's office.</p>
