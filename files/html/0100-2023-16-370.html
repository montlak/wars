<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-370"><span class="space">4.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Status Quo</span></span> Orders; Make Whole Remedies</h4>
<p class="noindent">Implementation of a decision to change positions from one pay system to another was negotiable. Because the decision process did not include a reasonable opportunity for bargaining, management was ordered to cancel pay system changes or job conversions until bargaining occurred. <span class="Italic">San Antonio Air Logistics Ctr., Kelly AFB and AFGE Local 1617</span>, 5 FLRA 173, 174 (1981) (ALJ Decision). A back pay award was appropriate to remedy management's failure to bargain over the termination of a negotiable pay premium. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation and AFGE Local 1978</span>, 33 FLRA 671, 680-81 (1988). Back pay was required as a component of a<span class="Italic"> status quo</span> remedy when an agency discontinued within-grade and quality step salary increases before completing negotiations over a new pay system that was substantively negotiable in <span class="Italic">SEC and NTEU</span>, 62 FLRA 432, 438-39 (2008) (enforced, <span class="Italic">SEC v. FLRA,</span> 568 F.3d 990, 997-98 (D.C. Cir. 2009), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his recommended order, the Judge awarded retroactive WIGIs to those employees who would have been entitled to such increases between May 19 and November 8, and ordered the Respondent to recalculate their placement on the new pay schedule. Accordingly, the Judge ordered the Respondent to make these employees whole by paying them backpay and interest. The Respondent excepts to the recommended order on the grounds that it committed no unjustified or unwarranted personnel action and that no employees actually lost money once the conversion to the new pay system was made.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1642"></span>The Authority has long held that under the Back Pay Act, backpay is authorized when employees have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of their pay, allowances or differentials. <span class="Italic">E.g., United States Dep't of Transportation, Fed. Aviation Admin., Atlanta, Ga</span>., 60 FLRA 985, 986 (2005) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring). A personnel action under the Back Pay Act specifically includes a failure to take an action or confer a benefit. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.803. Moreover, the Authority has expressly ruled that employees have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action "when it is determined that [employees] w[ere] affected by an unfair labor practice under the Statute." <span class="Italic">Fed. Aviation Admin., Washington, D.C.,</span> 27 FLRA 230, 232-33 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Respondent committed an unfair labor practice by violating &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute, employees were affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action within the meaning of the Back Pay Act. Moreover, it is undisputed that employees who would have otherwise received increases in pay through WIGIs prior to the Panel's decision did not receive those WIGIs. Accordingly, the Judge properly concluded that backpay was warranted under the Act because the employees entitled to a WIGI between May 19 and November 8 did not receive them and because they were converted into the new pay system at lower pay than they would have received had they received a WIGI. The Respondent's assertion that it would have submitted a different plan to the Panel if it had been necessary to pay these WIGIs provides no basis for rejecting the Judge's remedy that is warranted on the basis of the plan it actually submitted to the Panel and the plan ordered adopted by the Panel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's arguments that the Panel's decision precludes the payment of WIGIs and that the Union is getting a "second bite at the apple" are also unsupported. The Panel does not resolve unfair labor practice allegations. The Panel is responsible for providing "assistance in resolving negotiation impasses between agencies and exclusive representatives." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7119(c)(1). Furthermore, although the Panel rejected WIGIs and QSIs as part of the pay system that it ordered adopted, it is clear that the system was ordered adopted prospectively, and not retroactively, as claimed by the Respondent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Likewise, the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">SEC</span> did not preclude the Judge from concluding that the implementation of the pay system on May 19 was an unjustified or unwarranted action. The Respondent overstates the application of <span class="Italic">SEC</span> when it claims that the Authority held that the implementation of the pay system complied with the Pay Parity Act. In <span class="Italic">SEC</span>, the Authority addressed the narrow issue of whether the arbitrator erred by finding that the pay system reduced employee base pay in violation of the Pay Parity Act. The Authority's conclusion that the award was deficient was limited to the determination that locality pay may be considered part of base pay under the Pay Parity Act. This narrow holding has no preclusive application to the Judge's conclusion that the Respondent committed an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action when it instituted the pay system and terminated the previous system for WIGIs and QSIs without bargaining with the Union to the extent required by the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Respondent's assertion that the Judge's award of backpay goes beyond a make-whole remedy is also unsupported. Contrary to the claim of the Respondent, and as discussed above, employees were affected by an unwarranted action that resulted in a reduction of pay, allowances, or differentials--specifically, employees who were not granted WIGIs that they otherwise would have received and who, because of this, were converted into the new pay system at lower pay than they would have been had they received a WIGI. The Judge's award of backpay does no more than make these employees whole.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">SEC</span> back pay order was enforced, <span class="Italic">SEC v. FLRA,</span> 568 F.3d 990, 996 (D.C. Cir. 2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We review the FLRA's ordered remedy under the Back Pay Act <span class="Italic">de novo</span>, <span class="Italic">SSA v. FLRA,</span> 201 F.3d 465, 471 (D.C. Cir. 2000), and let it stand. To be entitled to an award of back pay, "1) the employee must have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; 2) the employee must have suffered a withdrawal or reduction of all or part of his pay, allowances, or differentials; and 3) but for the action, the employee would not have experienced the withdrawal or reduction." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 468.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under our precedent, back pay may be awarded if a mandatory salary upgrade was denied to an employee because of an unwarranted personnel action; loss of such a mandatory upgrade meets the "withdrawal or reduction" element of the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Sec'y of the Army,</span> 918 F.2d 214, 220 (D.C. Cir. 1990). As we described our conclusion in <span class="Italic">Brown,</span> "we comprehend the 1978 Back Pay Act definitional amendment to mean that if an upgrade is mandatory once specified conditions are met, the Act now affords a retrospective remedy. If an upgrade is not of that virtually automatic, noncompetitive kind, the Act affords no relief. Only in the former case will the employee be treated as one already 'duly appointed' to the higher position, so that the failure to confer the benefit constitutes a 'withdrawal or reduction' in compensation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> This conclusion controls the outcome of this case because the within-grade increases were virtually automatic and non-competitive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The SEC's final argument is that awarding back pay may give some employees an undue windfall. But any factual questions--such as whether any of the employees who were due a within-grade increase between May 19, 2002 and November 8, 2002 would actually have received higher pay under the new system had the SEC not implemented the change before the bargaining process was complete, and by how much--can be resolved in compliance proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA departed from its retroactive bargaining order approach concerning changes resulting in loss of pay or benefits when it imposes an SQA remedy, <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Local 1164</span>, 37 FLRA 278, 289-92 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Back Pay Act does not require that employees bear the insurmountable burden of demonstrating a "but for" relationship between the improper refusal to bargain and the loss of pay or benefits. Employees seeking this relief need only show the likelihood of a "causal nexus" between the two....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">FAA-II</span>, the Authority imposed a backpay remedy for the agency's failure to engage in impact and implementation bargaining before implementing a new reorganization plan. In <span class="Italic">FAA-I</span>, an earlier decision involving the same dispute, the Authority had ordered a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy for the same violation and had also ordered the agency to bargain with the union before implementing any future reorganization. In that decision, however, the Authority declined to order a make-whole remedy on the ground that such a remedy would not meet the test required by the Back Pay Act....&#8197;On review, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit disagreed with the Authority's refusal to order backpay in such circumstances, holding that "the Back Pay Act permits a back pay award to affected employees of an agency that has failed to engage in 'impact and implementation' bargaining, so long as the employees meet the initial burden of establishing a causal nexus between the violation and the loss of pay." <span class="Italic">PASS</span>, 809 F.2d at 860. On remand, the Authority initially held that in refusal to bargain cases it would view the unjustified personnel action...to be the agency's action of changing conditions of employment of unit employees without providing the exclusive representative with an opportunity to bargain. <span class="Italic">FAA-II</span>, 27 FLRA at 233. The Authority further concluded that after it determines that an employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that resulted in a withdrawal or reduction in the employee's pay, allowances or differentials, the causal nexus between the violation and the loss of pay can best be established by directing payment of backpay consistent with the outcome of ordered bargaining. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 234....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On further reflection we have decided that <span class="Italic">FAA-II</span> was wrong insofar as it requires the amount of backpay to be determined by the outcome of bargaining between the parties in cases where the remedy includes a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> award and it is clear that an improper personnel action, unlawfully taken without affording the union an opportunity to bargain, resulted in some loss of pay....&#8197;We now hold that in such cases the causal nexus required by the Back Pay Act is established when the Authority holds that an agency's action that gave rise to a violation resulted in a withdrawal or reduction in the pay...of employees. In our view, neither the Back Pay Act nor the D.C. Circuit's opinion in the <span class="Italic">PASS</span> case requires more. The question of the amount of backpay owed, as opposed to the issue of whether backpay should be ordered, is a matter for compliance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To allow the assessment of backpay to be determined by the outcome of negotiations...could have the effect of nullifying, or seriously weakening, a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, in such cases our orders are internally inconsistent insofar as they order impact...bargaining before an agency can implement any changes at all in the future, but permit the unlawful effects of past decisions taken without such bargaining to be mitigated by the far less effective means of retroactive bargaining....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We believe that this approach is appropriate for all cases involving changes in conditions of employment resulting from unlawful refusals to bargain, regardless of whether the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> award stems from a refusal to bargain over a decision or from an analysis conducted under <span class="Italic">Federal Correctional</span> concerning a failure to engage in impact and implementation bargaining. In either instance, the employer was not privileged to implement the decision without affording a bargaining opportunity to the representative of its employees. It is the wrongdoer, not the employees, that should bear the burden of the failure to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> until the requisite notice and bargaining is achieved.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We stress that this remedy is available only where it is clear that the violation has resulted in a loss of some pay, allowances, or differentials, that is, when the second requirement of the Back Pay Act has been met. Where the effect on employees is totally speculative, we will continue to deny make-whole relief....&#8197;Where, however, it is clear that some <span id="page_1643"></span>employees have been affected by the unlawful refusal to bargain, but there is no way to ascertain their identity through compliance proceedings, <span class="Italic">see</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">United States Department of Labor</span>, 16 FLRA 969 (1984), we will continue to apply the remedy established in <span class="Italic">FAA-II</span> and allow the parties to establish the causal nexus required by the Back Pay Act by determining through negotiations the extent of the make whole relief.</p>
<p class="noindent">An example of a remedial order requiring restoration of the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> pending impact bargaining, along with retroactive promotions, to remedy unilateral discontinuation or changes of promotion practices, is <span class="Italic">Air Force Flight Test Ctr., Edwards AFB and AFGE Local 3854</span>, 55 FLRA 116, 124-25 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The purpose of <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>relief is to place parties in the positions that they would have occupied had there been no unlawful conduct. <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center Asheville, North Carolina,</span> 51 FLRA 1572, 1580 (1996). The appropriateness of a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy is determined on a case-by-case basis, balancing the nature of a particular violation against the degree of disruption in government operations that would result from such a remedy<span class="Italic">. FCI,</span> 8 FLRA at 606. As this case involves the Respondent's failure to bargain over changes to the program, it was appropriate for the Judge to apply <span class="Italic">FCI </span>to determine whether <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>relief was warranted. <span class="Italic">See U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Army Corps of Engineers, Memphis District, Memphis,</span> <span class="Italic">Tennessee, </span>53 FLRA 79, 84 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Judge noted, a return to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> would not prohibit the Respondent from curtailing or eliminating the program at some future point; it would merely require the Respondent to reinstitute the program until the Respondent provides the Union with notice and an opportunity to bargain over the impact and implementation of changes to the program. For the reasons stated, we adopt the Judge's determination that <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>relief was proper.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Retroactive Promotions and Back Pay</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In excepting to the award of retroactive promotions and backpay, the Respondent concedes that the Judge could appropriately order such remedies in the case of an unwarranted personnel action. However, the Respondent asserts that the award is improper here because the affected employees did not perform work at the WG-12 level at the time of the November 1994 meeting. Also, the Respondent argues that the Judge's award amounts to a "classification" of the position. For the following reasons, we find that the Respondent's assertions are without merit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Respondent had already determined, before placing the employees in their respective training positions, that sufficient work existed at the WG-12 level to support promotion of the employees. The Aircraft Structures Mechanic position was already classified as having a target level of WG-12. Accordingly, the Respondent's claim that the Judge classified the position at the WG-12 level is incorrect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the preponderance of the evidence supports the Judge's finding that the only basis for denying an employee's promotion to the WG-12 level was the employee's failure to demonstrate the required proficiency. Two of the employees at issue (Hartung and Morehead) were certified by their supervisors as having the requisite skills to perform at the WG-12 level. The remaining two employees successfully completed training; one of them (Stevens) was one year into his rotations when the Respondent changed the program, and the other (Sanchez-Orsini) had just begun his shop rotations when the Respondent halted this practice. The Judge correctly found that the Respondent's suspension of the rotations prevented the two employees from completing the program.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A government employee found to have been affected by an improper or unwarranted personnel action resulting in the withdrawal or reduction of pay, allowances or differentials may be made whole under the authority of the Back Pay Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(a). <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Health and</span> <span class="Italic">Human Services and National Treasury Employees</span> <span class="Italic">Union, </span>54 FLRA 1210 (1998) <span class="Italic">(DHHS). </span>In determining that an award of backpay was warranted for the four employees in question, the Judge correctly applied the analytical framework set forth in <span class="Italic">DHHS, </span>for determining whether backpay remedies are appropriate in cases involving an agency's refusal to bargain over impact and implementation. The unilateral elimination of noncompetitive promotions to the WG-12 level constituted an unwarranted personnel action that is appropriately remedied by retroactive promotions and backpay. Accordingly, for the reasons stated, we adopt the Judge's conclusion that the remedy of backpay was appropriate.</p>
