<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-30"><span class="space">b.</span> Mixed Motives; Proof That Action Would Have Been Taken Without Discriminatory Motive</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The mixed motive analysis, governed by 42 USC 2000e-5(g)(2)(A)(2)(B)(ii), describes situations involving discrimination as one, but not the only, reason for a personnel action. An amendment to the 1964 Civil Rights Act was explained in <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Army</span>, 68 MSPR 398, 403-05 (1995), involving an indefinite suspension that the appellant believed resulted from discriminatory animus of the proposing official:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case must be remanded with respect to the appellant's allegation of race discrimination and other affirmative defenses. On remand, it must be determined whether the legal standard to be applied to the appellant's claim of race discrimination is that for "mixed-motive" cases set forth in <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228, 109 S. Ct. 1775, 104 L. Ed.2d 268 (1989), or that for "pretext" cases set forth in <span class="Italic">Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed.2d 207 (1981), and <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973)<span class="Italic">. See Davis v. Department of the Navy</span>, 67 MSPR 590, 598 (1995); <span class="Italic">Beam v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 66 MSPR 469, 474-75 &#x0026; n.1 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has defined a "mixed-motive" case as one in which an appellant presents "direct," rather than "circumstantial," evidence that discrimination was a motivating factor in the agency's action. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 61 MSPR 601, 604 (1994). In <span class="Italic">Beam</span>, 66 MSPR at 475 n.1, the Board noted that section 2000e-2(m) was added to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, effective November 21, 1991, to replace the former "mixed-motive" framework for analyzing "direct" evidence discrimination claims set forth in <span class="Italic">Price</span> <span class="Italic">Waterhouse.</span> Under 42 USC 2000e-2(m), "an unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice." The amendment at 42 USC 2000e-2(m) modified the rule of <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> to hold the employer "liable once the plaintiff shows that a protected characteristic played a motivating part in the employment decision (the employer's proof that the same employment decision would have been made in the absence of the impermissible motive goes only to the issue of relief)." <span class="Italic">Lam v. University of Hawaii</span>, 40 F.3d 1551, 1564 n.24 (9th Cir. 1994). In <span class="Italic">Beam</span>, the Board stated that, under 42 USC 2000e-2(m), an appellant will prevail if he can show by "direct" evidence that discrimination was a motivating factor in the agency's action. <span class="Italic">See Beam</span>, 66 MSPR at 475.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Direct evidence may consist of documentary or testimonial evidence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 234-36, 109 S.

Ct. at 1803-04 (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("stray remarks in the workplace," "statements by nondecision-makers," and "statements by decisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process itself" do not "justify requiring the employer to prove that its hiring or promotion decisions were based on legitimate criteria").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the record contains documentary evidence, i.e., the agency's August 18, 1994 investigatory report, that could constitute direct evidence of a racially discriminatory motive by the proposing official in proposing the indefinite suspension. The investigatory report includes statements by several witnesses regarding the proposing official's allegedly discriminatory remarks about the appellant, including several statements that he was going "to fire that Nigger," that he "intend[ed] to fire" the appellant, and that he was going to "get rid of" the appellant. The record also contains affidavits attesting that the proposing official repeatedly made racial slurs and racial jokes about the appellant, posted racially derogatory posters implicating the appellant, posted a dictionary of ethnic-type words allegedly used by the appellant, harassed the appellant, was harsher in his dealings with the appellant than with other employees, and intimidated and retaliated against employees who associated with or assisted the appellant. The investigatory report also contains an affidavit by the proposing official denying that he had engaged in racially discriminatory behavior against the appellant and affidavits by three other witnesses stating that they were unaware of any such behavior by the proposing official.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The witnesses' sworn statements of the repeated racial slurs and threats against the appellant that are attributed to the proposing official in the agency's investigatory report are similar to the statements of the witnesses in <span class="Italic">Alton Packaging Corp.</span> and <span class="Italic">Lee</span>. These sworn statements constitute more than the mere "stray remarks" to which Justice O'Connor referred in her concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">Price</span> <span class="Italic">Waterhouse. See Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 275-76, 109 S. Ct. at 1803-04. Further, while the proposing official was not the decisionmaker in the indefinite suspension, he was part of the decisionmaking process. Thus, the racial remarks attributed to him, if believed by the "trier of fact," in light of the conflicting sworn statements, could constitute direct evidence of a discriminatory motive, particularly since the proposing official sought out imposition of an indefinite suspension after the deciding official had merely reassigned the appellant following his arrest. <span class="Italic">See Lee</span>, 684 F.2d at 774. Thus, on remand, the administrative judge must make specific credibility findings as to these witnesses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following remand, the Board determined that the proposing official was biased and that he influenced the disciplinary process; however, no remedy was available because the agency would have acted against the appellant without discriminatory motive, <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Army</span>, 75 MSPR 115, 120-24 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to finding that the appellant's and Robinson's testimonies at the remand hearing corroborated the findings in the investigative report, the administrative judge also found that the proposing official "is a terrible supervisor, readily disposed to abusing his position and generally mistreating employees he disfavors," that "[h]e appears to be bigoted in a general sense," and that there "is no doubt that during the course of his employment, [the] appellant suffered abuse from his supervisor," the proposing official, that "includ[ed] some racially offensive behavior." The administrative judge further found that, although the appellant "established an abysmal work environment, the statements and actions of [the proposing official] are 'unrelated to the decisional process itself' that was utilized in effecting [the] appellant's suspension." In this regard, the administrative judge found that information regarding the appellant's arrest was transmitted to the agency's Management and Employee Relations (MER) personnel specialists in Fort Lewis, Washington, and that these personnel specialists determined that an indefinite suspension was appropriate. Further, the administrative judge noted that the deciding official testified that his reassignment of the appellant was only a temporary solution pending a decision on an appropriate action to take in the matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is always difficult to assess the evidence of a person's motivation and to determine the actual motives for an act. Although the administrative judge found no discrimination, we conclude that the better view of the facts here is that the appellant has proven that the proposing official's actions were based on the mixed-motive of unlawful discrimination and legitimate management concern. The direct evidence of record, including the documentary and testimonial evidence, establishes that the proposing official made the racial slurs and threats against the appellant as alleged and that his comments directed at the appellant were not general in nature and were not merely "stray remarks in the workplace." <span class="Italic">See Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 277, 109 S. Ct. at 1804 (O'Connor, J., concurring); <span class="Italic">see also Jones</span>, 68 MSPR at 404. Rather, the proposing official's racial comments and harassment of the appellant were continual and unrelenting, and he ultimately proposed the appellant's <span id="Page_3353"></span>indefinite suspension consistent with his threats that he would "fire" or "get rid of' the appellant. Further, irrespective of whether the MER first recommended the indefinite suspension or whether the proposing official influenced the deciding official into indefinitely suspending the appellant, the proposing official was still actively involved in the removal process by virtue of his submission of information regarding the appellant's arrest to the MER, his proposal of the indefinite suspension, and his advice to the deciding official that the appellant should be indefinitely suspended immediately rather than temporarily reassigned. <span class="Italic">See Jones</span>, 68 MSPR at 405.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, in view of the proposing official's racially improper comments and actions towards the appellant, his involvement in the indefinite suspension tainted the process. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant has proved by preponderant evidence his claim of race discrimination because he has established by direct evidence that race discrimination was a motivating factor in the agency's action and, therefore, as discussed below, his indefinite suspension was based on prohibited "mixed-motives." <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 USC 2000e-2(m); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Alton Packaging Corp.</span>, 901 F.2d 920, 922-23 (11th Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Lee v. Russell County Board of Education</span>, 684 F.2d 769, 772, 774 (11th Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DLA</span>, 61 MSPR 601, 604, 609 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the appellant requested, both below and on review, compensatory damages relating to his discrimination and retaliation claims. An appellant who prevails in an appeal before the Board based on a finding of discrimination may, in certain circumstances, recover compensatory damages from the agency pursuant to the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071 (codified in pertinent parts at 42 USC 1981a, 1981(b), 2000e-5)<span class="Italic">. See Totten v. USPS</span>, 68 MSPR 255, 257 n.2 (1995); <span class="Italic">Hocker v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 63 MSPR 497, 505 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 64 F.3d 676 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, __ U.S. __, 116 S. Ct. 918, 133 L. Ed.2d 848 (1996). Neither compensatory damages nor back pay can, however, be awarded in cases in which a finding of mixed-motive discrimination has been made and the agency has established that it would have taken the same action absent the discriminatory motive. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 USC 2000e-5(g)(2)(B)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, inasmuch as the appellant has established that race was a motivating factor in his indefinite suspension, the burden of production shifts to the agency to show that it would have taken the same action "in absence of the impermissible motivating factor[.] " 42 USC 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). Here, we find that the agency has met this burden. As we found in <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, 68 MSPR at 401-02, the agency established by preponderant evidence that it had reasonable cause to believe that the appellant had committed a crime for which imprisonment could be imposed, i.e., "burglary and possession of stolen property." The alleged criminal conduct of "burglary and possession of stolen property," some of which appeared to be government property, is very serious. Thus, with or without a discriminatory motive, we find it more likely than not that the agency would have taken the indefinite suspension action against the appellant pending an investigation into the matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, because the agency has demonstrated that it would have taken the indefinite suspension action even "in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor"--42 USC 2000e-5(g)(2)(A)(2)(B)(ii)--the Board is precluded by statute from awarding the appellant damages or back pay, or cancelling the indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">See id.; Tanca v. Nordberg</span>, 98 F.3d 680, 682 (1st Cir. 1996), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, __ U.S. __, 117 S. Ct. 1253, 137 L. Ed.2d 333 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant's burden of proof in a retaliation case is greater than his burden of proof in a mixed-motive discrimination case, as to prove retaliation he must establish, after careful balancing of the intensity of the motive to retaliate against the gravity of the misconduct, a nexus between the motive and the subsequent action. <span class="Italic">See Adair</span>, 66 MSPR at 165, <span class="Italic">Richard</span>, 66 MSPR at 154; <span class="Italic">see also Tanca</span>, 98 F.3d at 682-84 (the mixed-motives provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 do not apply to retaliation claims). Thus, no nexus was established between the appellant's EEO activity and the indefinite suspension action. After carefully balancing the intensity of the proposing official's motive to retaliate against the gravity of the appellant's alleged criminal misconduct, we agree with the administrative judge's ultimate finding that the appellant failed to establish the requisite nexus because he failed to show that the proposing official's motive to retaliate outweighed the gravity of the alleged misconduct involved. <span class="Italic">See Adair</span>, 66 MSPR at 165; <span class="Italic">Richard</span>, 66 MSPR at 154; <span class="Italic">see also Tanca</span>, 98 F.3d at 682-84.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he administrative judge employed the "mixed-motive" standard of analysis in reviewing the appellant's claim of discrimination and found that he had presented direct evidence of discrimination, that such discrimination was a motivating factor in the demotion action, and that, therefore, he was entitled to a finding that the agency had violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by taking gender and race into account in its placement procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has defined a "mixed-motive" case as one in which an appellant presents "direct," rather than "circumstantial," evidence that discrimination was a motivating factor in the agency's action<span class="Italic">.

The amendment at 42 USC 2000e-2(m) modified the rule of <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> to hold the employer "liable once the plaintiff shows that a protected characteristic played a motivating part in the employment decision (the employer's proof that the same employment decision would have been made in the absence of the impermissible motive goes only to the issue of relief)." <span class="Italic">Lam v.

Direct evidence may consist of documentary or testimonial evidence. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 68 MSPR 398, 403 (1995).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found, in the testimony of two members of the selection committee formed to fill positions in the reorganized Facilities Department, "direct and undeniable" evidence that the agency considered sex and race as factors in its placement process. One of the members of the committee was Louis Norris, at the time in question the Director, Office of Facilities, Program, Planning, and Management. He was the individual responsible for selecting positions to be filled in the Windsor Facilities Service Center, successor unit to the Boston Facilities Service Center at which the appellant was employed and which was abolished in the restructuring. The other member of the selection committee upon whose testimony the administrative judge relied was Philip Wilson, then the Director, Facilities Services Center in Windsor, Connecticut.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A brief explanation of the way in which the selection committee operated is in order, by way of background. In the restructuring, the Facilities Department, nationwide, underwent a complete reorganization, suffering a forty percent reduction, and going from twenty field offices to twelve, and from approximately 950 employees to approximately 450. Mr. Norris testified that a committee, composed of fifteen managers, met in a large room to make selections for a number of newly-created EAS positions, following a procedure rather like the "NFL draft." Positions were filled through a process of elimination. As each employee was "selected" for a position by an individual manager, the selection was placed on a bulletin board in full view of the committee members who then essentially ratified the selection. Each placement became the basis for an "offer" to the selectee, with final placement being subject to the selectee's concurrence. The committee had before it for its consideration PS Forms 991, Applicant Information, and a "Requirements by Applicant Matrix" which was a chart reflecting managers' ratings of candidates' demonstrated achievements in each KSA (Knowledge, Skill, and Ability) identified for each position for which he or she was being considered. The committee members were, of course, permitted to use any personal knowledge they had of the candidates. A special list of individuals designated as "high performers" was provided to the committee and these individuals were identified by a color-coded dot.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The testimony which the administrative judge found provided direct evidence that the agency considered race and sex as factors in the placement process was that other color-coded dots identified candidates as minorities and females. He found, based on this testimony, that the agency required the selection committee to consider whether a candidate was a woman and/or a minority in making its placement decisions, and that this represented conduct that undeniably revealed a discriminatory attitude that could not be reasonably construed as having a legitimate nondiscriminatory purpose.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In concluding that the committee members were required to consider the candidates' race and sex in making their selections, we find that the administrative judge misinterpreted the testimony, and that it did not, in fact, constitute direct evidence of discrimination. Mr. Norris testified that, <span id="Page_3354"></span><span class="Italic">after</span> selections were made, colored dots were applied to the names of the selectees who were females and minorities as a means of identification so that no candidate was overlooked because of his or her race or sex and for purposes of general equal employment opportunity reporting requirements. He denied that the dots influenced his selections or that there was any preestablished quota for minority or female selections. He also testified that, after the selections were made, and the dots affixed, no changes were made based on the race or sex of the selectees. Mr. Norris further testified that, apart from the dots, he was aware of the race and sex of the candidates from his personal knowledge. The testimony of Mr. Wilson was in accord.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of the above, we conclude that the testimonial evidence upon which the administrative judge relied does not support his finding that the selection committee considered candidates' race and sex in making its placement decisions. <span class="Italic">Weaver v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 2 MSPB 297, 2 MSPR 129, 133 (1980) (in reviewing an initial decision, the Board is free to substitute its own determinations of fact for those of the administrative judge, giving his findings only as much weight as may be warranted by the record and by the strength of his reasoning), <span class="Italic">review denied</span>, 669 F.2d 613 (9th Cir. 1982) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>). We further find that the testimonial evidence, as described above, does not constitute direct evidence of discrimination but rather suggests the agency's awareness of its equal employment opportunity obligations<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, 29 CFR 1614.601; <span class="Italic">cf. Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 234-36, 109 S. Ct. at 1782-83 (direct evidence of sex discrimination was found in documentary evidence of numerous negative gender remarks made about the employee by partners in the evaluation process and documentary evidence of the employer's reliance on those remarks in denying her admission as a partner in its accounting firm); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Alton Packaging Corp.</span>, 901 F.2d 920, 922-23 (11th Cir. 1990) (direct evidence of racial discrimination was found in testimony of witnesses that the employer's general manager had stated that "if it was his company he wouldn't hire any black people" and that the production manager had yelled at a black employee, "___ ___ it, you people can't do a ___ thing right"); <span class="Italic">Lee v. Russell County Bd. of Educ.</span>, 684 F.2d 769, 772, 774 (11th Cir. 1982) (direct evidence of discrimination against minorities was found in testimony by witnesses that there was no administrative reason not to re-employ the minority teachers and that the school board had expressed concern about "getting a greater 'white presence'" and stopping "white flight" at the school, and had asked the school principal to "build files" on those minority teachers); <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, 68 MSPR at 404-05 (statements by witnesses that the proposing official made discriminatory remarks, racial slurs, and racial jokes about the appellant, put up racially derogatory posters implicating the appellant, posted a dictionary of ethnic-type words allegedly used by the appellant, harassed him, was harsher in his dealings with the appellant than with other employees, and intimidated and retaliated against employees who associated with or assisted the appellant, if credible, could be direct evidence of racial discrimination); <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 61 MSPR at 609 (direct evidence of racial discrimination was found in the proposing official's "admission" that he had made racially derogatory comments about the appellant, including a comment that he was going to "burn [the appellant's] black ass"). Accordingly, in the absence of direct evidence of discrimination, the administrative judge's analysis of the appellant's claim under the "mixed-motive" theory was improper. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 604.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of direct evidence, we find that the appellant's evidence of discrimination is, at best, circumstantial, and that his claims must, therefore, be reviewed under the "pretext" standard of analysis. The Board has adopted the basic test for proving intentional discrimination as set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 1824-25, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973), and clarified in <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed.2d 407 (1993). To establish a claim of prohibited employment discrimination through circumstantial evidence under that theory, the employee first must establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case; the burden of going forward then shifts to the agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action; and, finally, the employee must show that the agency's stated reason is merely a pretext for prohibited discrimination. <span class="Italic">Beam</span>, 66 MSPR at 475. To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, an appellant must show that he is a member of a protected group, that he was similarly situated to an individual who was not a member of his protected group, and that he was treated more harshly than that individual. <span class="Italic">Coleman v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 66 MSPR 498, 508 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 79 F.3d 1165 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although many positions were filled at the EAS-25 level in the RIF, the appellant argues only that there were two such positions for which he was not selected based on his race and/or sex. The two positions were an EAS-25 Real Estate Specialist position in Windsor, Connecticut, filled by Kathleen Walker, a white female, and an EAS-25 Facility Requirements Specialist in Washington, D.C., filled by Marianne Sinclair, also a white female. The appellant, as a white employee, is protected by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, <span class="Italic">McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co.</span>, 427 U.S. 273, 280, 96 S. Ct. 2574, 2578, 49 L. Ed.2d 493 (1976), but because both selectees were also white, we find that he has not established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of race discrimination. Because both selectees were female, however, we find that the appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of sex discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency meets its burden to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason when it introduces evidence, "which <span class="Italic">taken as true</span>, would <span class="Italic">permit</span> the conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action," <span class="Italic">regardless</span> of whether the agency actually proves its charges. <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. at 508, 113 S. Ct. at 2748 (emphasis in original); <span class="Italic">Carter v. SBA</span>, 61 MSPR 656, 666 (1994). The Board has applied this analysis to RIF appeals. <span class="Italic">Di Pietro</span>, 65 MSPR at 262; <span class="Italic">Decker v. DHHS</span>, 40 MSPR 119, 132 (1989). Here, the agency produced evidence, in the form of testimony from the two individuals who selected Ms. Walker and Ms. Sinclair, that each was better qualified for the particular position in question than the appellant. Specifically, Mr. Norris testified that he selected Ms. Walker for the position of Real Estate Specialist because her entire work career, outside and inside the Postal Service, had revolved around real estate. In addition, she had a degree in real estate and was a certified property manager. She also was serving in the position of Real Estate Specialist, Sr., at the time of the selection. Mr. Norris further testified that the appellant's name was not among those listed on the "Placement Pool" for the Real Estate Specialist position, because he lacked the qualifications for it. Specifically, according to Mr. Norris, the only indication that the appellant had any real estate knowledge was that he had served a one-month detail, in 1989, as a manager of Realty Acquisition. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 129.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, Mr. Wilson testified that he selected Ms. Sinclair for the position of Facility Requirements Specialist because she was an EAS-24 Program Manager, Facilities Requirements, and because, prior to that, she had been an EAS-23 Facilities Requirements Specialist since 1986. Mr. Wilson further testified that Ms. Sinclair had a considerable amount of operations experience which he felt was very important to the job. According to Mr. Wilson, he was also swayed by the fact that Ms. Sinclair's former supervisor gave her a very high recommendation. Mr. Wilson testified that he did consider appellant for this job, even though his name was not among those on the "Placement Pool" for the Facility Requirements Specialist position, but that his operations experience was not as extensive as Ms. Sinclair's, and she had attained a higher level in the requirements function than the appellant, who had not been in the job for approximately two years. We find that this testimonial evidence, as supported by documentary evidence, if taken as true, clearly permits the conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for these two selections.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The burden then shifts to the appellant to show that the agency's reason is a pretext for discrimination. In this regard, the appellant must actually show, by a preponderance of the evidence, both that the stated reason was false, or not the real reason for the action, "<span class="Italic">and</span> that discrimination was the real reason" for the agency's action. <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. at 515, 113 S. Ct. at 2752 (emphasis in the original). On review, we do not find that the appellant has met this dual burden. As noted, he has not established that the stated reason for the action was false because he has not shown that he was better qualified, or even as well qualified, for the two positions in question, as were the selectees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an attempt to show that prohibited discrimination was the real reason for the demotion, the appellant argues that the Postal Service intended, by its placement decisions for higher-level positions, to achieve a forty percent quota of minorities and women. In this regard, he provided testimony from three employees who stated that they had been so advised at various meetings conducted in connection with the reorganization. Specifically, Domenic Giarratani, Supervisor, Customer Services, testified that Mr. Norris spoke at a meeting he attended in November 1992, and stated that forty percent of the new Facilities organization would be made up of women and minorities. Joseph Kenneally, Elevator/Boiler Inspector, testified that he was present when Mr. Wilson told a group that he addressed in October 1992 that forty percent of the positions would go to minorities. And Diane Gay, Confidential Secretary to the Manager of Finance testified that, at a meeting she attended in October or November 1992, management said that women and minorities would be considered first for the newly-created positions. The appellant, himself, testified that he was privy to several conversations wherein management emphasized the forty percent quota. Mr. Norris, however, denied any mention of preferential treatment for women or minorities or that there were any quotas, as did Mr. Wilson.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not make any credibility findings to resolve the conflict in the testimony. <span class="Italic">Spithaler v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant contends that Bland discriminated against him. We find that the appellant did not establish his affirmative defense of race discrimination. The administrative judge, however, applied the wrong legal standard to the appellant's discrimination claim.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In her initial decision, the administrative judge relied on <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 61 MSPR 601, 604 (1994), where the Board found that a case in which the agency responds to the employee's direct evidence of discrimination with a legitimate reason(s) for its adverse action is referred to as a "mixed motive" case. In such a case, the appellant must prove by direct evidence that membership in a protected category was a "substantial factor" in the employment decision at issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Since the appellant here presented solely circumstantial evidence to support his discrimination claim, the administrative judge should have applied the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework test rather than the <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> framework.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We further note that the Civil Rights Act of 1991 modified the framework for analyzing claims of discrimination based on direct evidence in <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse. See</span> 42 USC 2000e-2(m); <span class="Italic">Beam v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 66 MSPR 469, 475 n.1 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a claim of prohibited employment discrimination through circumstantial evidence under the <span class="Italic">McDonnell</span> <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> framework, the employee must first establish by preponderant evidence a <span class="Italic">prima facie case</span> by showing that: (1) He is a member of a protected group; (2) he was similarly situated to an individual who was not a member of his protected group; and (3) he was treated more harshly or disparately than the individual who was not a member of his protected group. <span class="Italic">See Coleman v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 66 MSPR 498, 508 (1995). The burden of going forward then shifts to the agency to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its action. <span class="Italic">See Carter v.

An agency meets this burden when it introduces evidence, which, taken as true, would permit the conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action, regardless of whether the agency actually proves the charges. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Finally, the employee must show by preponderant evidence that the agency's stated reason is merely a pretext for prohibited discrimination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., McDonnell Douglas Corp.</span>, 411 U.S. at 802-04, 93 S. Ct. at 1824-25; <span class="Italic">Carter</span>, 61 MSPR at 666 (1994). Thus, the appellant must actually show that both the stated reason was false, or not the real reason for the action, and that discrimination was the real reason for the action. <span class="Italic">See Carter</span>, 61 MSPR at 666 (citing <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, __ U.S. at __, 113 S. Ct. at 2742, 2752).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, although it is undisputed that the appellant is a member of a protected group (African-American), he has not established that he was similarly situated to an individual who was not a member of his protected group, and that he was treated more harshly or disparately than the individual who was not a member of the protected group. In this regard, we note that the appellant's evidence of discrimination suggests only that the appellant and Bland had a poor working relationship, and that Bland spent more time observing the appellant than white employees under his supervision. The record does not indicate that any of these employees had engaged in any kind of misconduct, that they faced discipline based on charges of failing to follow instructions and careless workmanship, or that they had a prior disciplinary record similar to that of the appellant. Therefore, since the appellant failed to demonstrate that he was similarly situated with regard to these employees, he did not establish all of the required elements of a <span class="Italic">prima</span> <span class="Italic">facie</span> case of disparate treatment based on race. <span class="Italic">See Golden v. United States Postal Service</span>, 60 MSPR 268, 274 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the appellant had established a <span class="Italic">prima</span> <span class="Italic">facie</span> case, however, the agency provided a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for removing him, i.e., the agency's claims that the appellant failed to follow instructions, and that his careless workmanship endangered the safety of others. Therefore, since the appellant produced no evidence to show that the agency's action was pretextual, he has not established his affirmative defense of discrimination by the requisite evidence. Consequently, the administrative judge's error in applying the <span class="Italic">Price</span> <span class="Italic">Waterhouse</span> framework provides no basis for reversal of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Panter v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...We...agree with the administrative judge that the statements described in Mr. Wagner's testimony constitute direct evidence that racial discrimination was a factor in the appellant's removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is apparent, however, that racial discrimination and reprisal were not the only factors motivating the appellant's removal. As we have indicated above, the administrative judge sustained the charge of excessive absence, and the appellant has not challenged her findings regarding the merits of that charge. This case therefore is one involving "mixed motives," i.e., one in which the action was motivated both by unlawful discrimination and reprisal and by a legitimate management concern. In such a case, the extent of the remedy available to the appellant may be limited if the agency proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it would have taken the action in question in the absence of the unlawful discrimination and reprisal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e-2(m), 2000e-5(g)(2)(B)(ii); <span class="Italic">Caronia v.

If the agency meets this burden in a removal appeal, the appellant is not entitled to reinstatement or back pay. <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, 75 MSPR at 121-22; <span class="Italic">see</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e-2(m), 2000e-5(g)(2)(B)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record includes some evidence that the agency may have removed the appellant in the absence of any racially discriminatory motive. It shows that the appellant had been absent from work for nearly 7 months by the time his removal was proposed, and that he was expected to be absent for at least an additional 6 months. Prolonged absences can provide just cause for removal. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Allen v.</span> Department <span class="Italic">of the Army,</span> 76 MSPR 564, 570 (1997); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Cresson v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 33 MSPR 178, 184-85 (1987) (removal for lengthy absence within parameters of reasonableness); <span class="Italic">McKenzie v. United States Postal Service</span>, 1 MSPB 480, 1 MSPR 496, 497 (1980) (prolonged absence with no foreseeable end constitutes just cause for removal). Moreover, in his position, the appellant performed important, safety related, responsibilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The existence of the evidence described above, however, does not necessarily establish that the agency would have considered the particular absence at issue in this case a sufficient basis for removal in the absence of any racially discriminatory motive. Moreover, the administrative judge did not specifically address the issue of whether improper discrimination caused the appellant's prolonged absence--an absence that is described in the record as related to stress and anxiety, and that is alleged to be work-related....&#8197;Such a causal relationship could evidence that the agency would not have removed the appellant in the absence of racial discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, we VACATE the initial decision insofar as it ordered cancellation of the appellant's removal. We also note that determining whether the removal would have been effected in the absence of improper discrimination is a factual matter that may require assessment of the credibility of witnesses. The administrative judge, who held the hearing in this case, who has had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses at that hearing, and who would hold any additional hearing that may be required in this case, is in the best position to determine whether the agency has met its burden of proof regarding this matter. <span class="Italic">See Jackson</span>, 768 F.2d at 1331-32. Accordingly, we find that remanding this case to the field office for the purpose of making that determination is appropriate.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We modify the administrative judge's analysis of the disability discrimination claim in one respect.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if we were to find on review that the appellant was disabled by migraines and depression during the relevant time frame, she has not met her burden to prove that her disability was "a motivating factor" in the agency's decision. Both the proposing and deciding officials credibly testified that they knew that the appellant had migraines, but neither was aware that the appellant suffered from depression. The proposal notice makes no mention of any medical condition. Rather, it appears that the appellant's medical condition was identified as an explanation for her April 8, 2011 misconduct in her response to the notice of proposed removal. <span class="Italic">See</span> IAF, Tab 9, Subtab 4D (describing the appellant as "a disabled person" who had "exhibited deteriorating medical conditions such as severe depression with accompanying migraine headaches, nausea, and loss of sleep" that led to the April 8, 2011 "break with reality").

The court reasoned that the ADA, like the ADEA, renders employers liable for decisions made "because of" a person's disability, and that this language in the ADA necessitated finding an employee alleging disability discrimination under the pre-2009 ADA must establish that his disability was the "but for" causation of the employer's adverse action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, the Seventh Circuit found that a plaintiff alleging that an employer took an adverse employment action proscribed by the ADA must prove by preponderant evidence that the employer took the action "because of" the plaintiff's disability and that the burden of persuasion does not shift to the employer to show that it would have taken the action regardless of disability, even when the plaintiff produced some evidence that disability was one motivating factor in the adverse employment action. <span class="Italic">See Serwatka</span>, 591 F.3d at 961-962.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;We note that the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA) removed the provision in the ADA that an employer may not discriminate "because of" an employee's disability, and amended the ADA to provide that an employer may not discriminate against an individual "on the basis of" disability. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a) (2009). To resolve this case, the Board need not make a finding on whether the phrase "on the basis of" means something different from "because of" and whether this, or other revisions to the ADA, affects the viability of a mixed-motive claim under the ADA for a disability discrimination case arising after the effective date of the ADAAA. The Board overrules <span class="Italic">Caronia v. Department of Justice</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 201, 214-16 (1998), <span class="Italic">overruled in part on other grounds by Carter v. Department of Justice</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 641, &#x00B6; 25 n.5 (2001), which held that, under the ADA, an appellant is entitled to some relief for discrimination on the basis of disability if he shows that the agency had "mixed-motives" for its action. However, the Board reserves for a future decision whether the reasoning employed in <span class="Italic">Caronia</span> remains applicable to cases arising under the ADAAA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Seventh Circuit's analysis and find that, in disability discrimination cases arising before the January 1, 2009 amendments to the ADA, the appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that the agency took an adverse action "because of" his disability, and that the burden of persuasion does not shift to the agency to show that it would have taken the action regardless of disability, even when the appellant produced some evidence that disability was one motivating factor in the adverse employment action. Accordingly, we must analyze the disability discrimination claim in this matter without relying on a mixed-motive framework.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Caronia v. DOJ</span>, 78 MSPR 201, 210-16 (1998) (overruled in part by <span class="Italic">Southerland v. DOD</span>, 119 MSPR 566, 577 &#x00B6; 24, 2013 MSPB 46 (2013)), explained that in a mixed motive case, when one charge is sustained against an employee but another charge is tainted by discrimination, the Board fashions a remedy appropriate to the sustained misconduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The remarks, referenced above, indicating what entered into the decision-making process regarding the appellant, show that the removal decision was made in reliance on the impermissible motive of the appellant's perceived disability. The evidence of discrimination therefore is tied directly to the alleged discriminatory animus, the perception of the appellant as disabled by his depression and treatment, and constitutes direct evidence of disability discrimination<span class="Italic">. See Fields v. New York State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities</span>, 115 F.3d 116, 122 (2d Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">Ostrowski v. Atlantic Mutual Insurance Cos.</span>, 968 F.2d 171, 181 (2d Cir. 1992). Where an appellant establishes direct evidence of discrimination on the basis of disability, to prevail, that is, to show that discrimination on the basis of disability was a motivating factor, he must also show that the agency's admittedly discriminatory action was prohibited, i.e., that he is a qualified disabled person against whom the agency may not discriminate<span class="Italic">. See Monette v. Electronic Data Systems Corp.</span>, 90 F.3d 1173, 1184 (6th Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Clark v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 MSPR 552, 561 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A "qualified" disabled person is a disabled person who can perform the essential functions of his position, with or without reasonable accommodation, without endangering the health and/or safety of himself and/or others. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a). The appellant showed that he was a qualified disabled person protected by the discrimination laws because, as discussed above with respect to the charges, the evidence showed that he was capable of performing his job duties without accommodation. Thus, in this case, the appellant established by direct evidence that his perceived disability was an impermissible "motivating factor" in the agency's removal action. The record shows, however, that another factor also motivated the agency's decision, specifically the sustained charge of bringing an unauthorized firearm onto the grounds of a correctional facility. Thus, the appellant's evidence of discrimination based on disability merely establishes that the agency had mixed-motives, both permissible and impermissible, for its decision<span class="Italic">. See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228, 246 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Rehabilitation Act, the remedies available to an employee who proves discrimination because of his disability are defined by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 794a. Under Title VII, a federal employee is entitled to some relief if he proves that his disability was a "motivating factor" in the decision made, "even though other factors also motivated" the agency's decision<span class="Italic">. See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e-2(m), 2000e-16; <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 MSPR 398, 406 (1995). In other words, a federal employee is entitled to some relief for discrimination on the basis of disability if he shows that the agency had "mixed-motives" for its action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency may limit the extent of the remedy available to the employee, however, if it proves that it would have made the same decision "in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor," i.e., discrimination on the basis of disability. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). In that event, the appellant is not entitled to the remedies of reinstatement, back pay, or damages<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Buchanan v. City of San Antonio</span>, 85 F.3d 1967 200 (5th Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Pedigo v. P.A.M. Transport, Inc</span>., 60 F.3d 1300 (8th Cir. 1995)<span class="Italic">. See also Jones v. Department of the Army</span>, 75 MSPR 115, 121-24 (1997) (applying the mixed-motive analysis in the context where a federal employee proved race discrimination was a motivating factor in the removal action for misconduct).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We must therefore decide whether the agency met its burden to prove by preponderant evidence that it would have taken the same action absent the impermissible motive. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B); 1 Barbara Lindemann and Paul Grossman, <span class="Italic">Employment Discrimination Law</span> 41 (3d ed. 1996). In other words, the Board must decide whether the agency met its burden of persuasion to prove that it would have taken the same action based on the sustained charge, which we find was not tainted by the impermissible motive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official testified that he viewed the appellant's misconduct of bringing an unauthorized weapon onto the grounds of the facility as it "an extreme breach of institutional security." He testified that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[e]ven though the parking lot [where the appellant parked the car in which the agency found the weapon] is not within...the secure perimeter of the institution, we have minimum security camp inmates who would have access to the parking lot, and therefore it creates an unacceptable security hazard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">He testified further that "even if one goes to a...considerable degree to conceal the weapon, make it hard for anybody to find it, nonetheless it's a very serious violation, especially a knowing violation." The deciding official testified further that he did not find credible the appellant's statement that he forgot that the weapon and ammunition were in his car. He testified that he believed that the appellant intended the firearms violation because he believed that the appellant lied to him by telling him that the appellant did not construct a hiding place for the gun in his car. Thus, the agency argues that it would have taken the removal action absent the impermissible motive based on both the seriousness of the sustained offense and whether the appellant committed a "knowing violation."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the appellant maintained both before the agency and before the Board that he brought the weapon and ammunition onto the grounds of the facility inadvertently. The appellant provided an explanation for forgetting that the weapon and the ammunition found by the agency were in his car. He testified that in June 1995, before he took stress leave beginning on June 22, 1995, he put the gun and ammunition, for security, into the family car before an outing. He testified further that he forgot that the gun and ammunition were in the car. He attributed his forgetfulness to his illnesses, depression, diverticulosis, and severe gastrointestinal reflux disease, which, shortly after the appellant placed the gun in the car, became so severe that he had to take stress leave while he was undergoing treatment. He indicated that, upon his return to work from stress leave, he and his wife usually drove her van to work, but they had begun driving the car where the gun was found a few days before the search because the car "had been sitting for so long and [the appellant] thought it would do some good to run [the car] and drive in to work."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3358"></span>The appellant also presented a plausible explanation for his statement that he did not construct a secret compartment as a hiding place for the gun that the agency found in his car. The appellant testified that he had constructed a compartment in which to hide valuables and a firearm in his van and that he had told his subordinate about this. He testified also, however, that he had not constructed a hiding place in the car. During the oral reply to the deciding official, he testified that he answered no to a question regarding whether he had constructed the hiding place for the gun that the agency found in his car. He testified that his answer had been accepted without follow-up questions, and thus he had not been able to explain the distinction between the constructed hiding place in his van and the existing hiding place where he placed the gun in his car.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Intent is a state of mind which generally is proven by circumstantial evidence<span class="Italic">. See Denney v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 MSPR 191, 193 (1995). Where proof of intent must be derived from circumstantial evidence, all of the evidence regarding intent must be considered<span class="Italic">. See Johnson v. Department of the Army</span>, 48 MSPR 54, 57 (1991). <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 960 F.2d 156 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). Plausible explanations are to be considered in determining intent<span class="Italic">. See Deskin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 76 MSPR 505, 510 (1997); <span class="Italic">Kuykendall v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 68 MSPR 314, 327 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As evidence of intent, the agency presented only the testimony of the deciding official that he did not believe the appellant's statement that he had forgotten that the gun and ammunition were in his car, and that the deciding official believed that the appellant lied when he stated that he did not construct the hiding place in his car where the agency found the gun. The appellant's plausible explanations for why he had forgotten the gun and ammunition, and why he answered no to the deciding official's question regarding whether the appellant had constructed a hiding place for a gun in his car, outweigh the agency's evidence. Thus, we find that the agency failed to prove that the appellant's bringing an unauthorized firearm and ammunition onto the grounds of a federal correctional facility were knowing violations. Additionally, the agency searched the appellant's car based on its reaction to his statements to coworkers as colored by its perception of him as disabled. Further, the deciding official linked the appellant's past ideation of harming his supervisor and the fact that the unauthorized weapon was found in his car in reaching the decision to remove him, and in his belief that the appellant knowingly had the gun and ammunition in his car. Thus, we find that the agency did not prove that it would have taken the same action, removal, based on the sustained charge in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor, discrimination on the basis of disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Title VII provides that, in a dual motive discrimination case, if an appellant establishes that an employment practice was motivated by impermissible and other factors, and an agency shows that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible factors, the appellant may not be awarded damages, reinstatement, or back pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e-2(m) and 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). Here, we have found that an employment practice, removal, was motivated by both an impermissible factor, disability discrimination, and another factor, the sustained misconduct of bringing an unauthorized firearm and ammunition onto the agency premises, but that the agency did not prove that it would have taken the same action, removal, in the absence of the impermissible factor. We find, however, that although a finding that the agency would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible factor would have disallowed an award of damages, reinstatement, or back pay, the contrary finding does not require the opposite result. Rather, as explained more fully below, the contrary finding merely allows the award of damages, reinstatement, and back pay, if those remedies are appropriate under all of the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Such a reading of the statute is a plausible construction of its language, <span class="Italic">see generally Miller v. Department of the Army,</span> 987 F.2d 1552, 1555 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (the starting point for statutory construction is the language of the statute itself). It also serves to assure that this provision of Title VII does not conflict with the Board's authority under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (CSRA), to determine whether, when not all of the charges are sustained, the penalty for the sustained charges is reasonable. <span class="Italic">See White v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 71 MSPR 521, 527-28 (1996); <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280, 308 (1981). It is well settled that the Board's statutory authority under the CSRA includes the authority to consider carefully whether the sustained charges merit the penalty imposed by the agency<span class="Italic">. Douglas,</span> 5 MSPR at 308. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 2b Singer, <span class="Italic">Sutherland Statutory Construction</span>, &#x00A7; 51.02 (5th ed.) (it is axiomatic that statutes should be construed to give effect to every provision, and must be construed to be in harmony, if possible). Further, such a reading of Title VII serves to assure that, where an appellant is guilty of misconduct, he will not avoid discipline because the agency has coupled a charge based on a permissible motive with one that may not be sustained because it has been tainted by an impermissible motive. Thus, we find that the appellant is not entitled to reinstatement and full back pay under the Rehabilitation Act, and we consider the appropriate penalty for the sustained offense under the CSRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that this rule is applicable only in cases of dual motivation, one permissible and the other impermissible. The rule is inapplicable in a case where an appellant proves that the agency's single motive for taking an adverse action was prohibited discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Ellshoff v. Department of the Interior</span>, 76 MSPR 54, 79 (1997). Where an appellant proves that the agency's single motive for taking an adverse action was prohibited discrimination, that is, the action was based solely on an impermissible motive, the remedy for the discrimination is to make the appellant whole. <span class="Italic">See Sublette v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 MSPR 82, 86 (1995). In a case where the Board finds that an impermissible motive, prohibited discrimination, was the sole motive for the agency's action, the Board will reverse the adverse action completely. <span class="Italic">See Ellshoff,</span> 76 MSPR at 80.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When, as in this case, not all of the agency's charges are sustained, the Board independently and responsibly balances the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors to determine a reasonable penalty. <span class="Italic">White,</span> 71 MSPR at 527. Here, the sustained charge is serious. Further, the appellant was on notice of the rule that he violated. As found above, however, the offense was not intentional. Additionally, the firearm found in the appellant's car was well concealed and was not within the secure perimeter of the prison. Further, the appellant had no prior disciplinary record, and his performance was above average. The agency's table of penalties prescribes a range of penalties for the sustained offense from official reprimand to removal for the first offense. There is no evidence of record to show that there was any notoriety associated with the appellant's offense. Finally, the appellant's misconduct resulted from inattention caused by his depression, for which he is undergoing a course of treatment, which had been so successful that he could return to work from stress leave. <span class="Italic">See Sublette,</span> 68 MSPR at 87. Under these circumstances, we find that his potential for rehabilitation is good. Balancing the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, we find that a reasonable penalty for the sustained misconduct is a 30-day suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the statutory revisions defining the mixed motive analysis, <span class="Italic">Duke v. Dept. of Army</span>, 20 MSPR 399, 400 (1984), determined that if discrimination is established as a substantial or motivating factor, along the lines of proof established in the <span class="Italic">Gerlach</span> case [refer to Chapter 13, "<a href="0100-2023-20-094.html#sec13-91">Collateral Jurisdiction Over EEO Claim Presented in IRA Appeal Not Involving Otherwise Appealable Action</a>"], the burden is on the agency to show that the action would have been taken even if there had been no discrimination, an approach permitting a degree of discriminatory taint:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency urges the Board to apply a "but-for" test and reverse the action only if the Board found the agency would not have taken the action but for the discrimination. We find, however, that the presiding official's analysis is in accord with the Supreme Court's decisions in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas v. Green,</span> 411 U.S. 792, 805, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 1825, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973), <span class="Italic">Texas Department of Community</span> <span class="Italic">Affairs v. Burdine,</span> 450 U.S. 248, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed.2d 207 (1981), and <span class="Italic">Furnco Construction Co. v. Waters,</span> 438 U.S. 567, 98 S. Ct. 2943, 57 L. Ed.2d 957 (1978). Contrary to the agency's contention, the Board held in <span class="Italic">Gerlach v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 8 MSPB 599 (1981), that in order to establish a prohibited personnel practice as an affirmative defense, the appellant must show only that the prohibited personnel practice--which includes discrimination based on sex--was a "substantial" or "motivating" factor in initiating and effecting an adverse action. The burden then shifts to the agency to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have taken the same action even if the protected conduct had not taken place....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Stromfeld v. DOJ</span>, 21 MSPR 428, 431 (1984), reiterated the <span class="Italic">Gerlach</span> analysis as a prelude to close factual examination of the motivation of the actors and the significance of the events:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that in order to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal under section 2302(b)(9), an appellant must demonstrate that he engaged in an activity protected by that section; that he subsequently was treated in an adverse fashion by the employer; that the deciding official had actual or constructive knowledge that the employee was engaged in the protected activity; and that there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Bodinus v. Department of Treasury,</span> 7 MSPB 385 at 387 (1981); <span class="Italic">In the Matter of Frazier,</span> 1 MSPB 159, 186 (1979). If the appellant establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and the agency demonstrates legitimate managerial reasons for its action, the Board will apply the two-part test enunciated in <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> <span class="Italic">City School District Board of Education v. Doyle,</span> 429 U.S. 274, 97 S. Ct. 568, 50 L. Ed.2d 471 (1977), for deciding dual motivation cases<span class="Italic">. See Gerlach v. Federal Trade Commission,</span> 8 MSPB 599 (1981). Once dual motivation is established, the employee must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the protected conduct was a "substantial" or "motivating" factor in the action. Then the burden shifts to the agency to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have taken the same action even if the protected conduct had not taken place. <span class="Italic">Gerlach, supra,</span> at 604.</p>
