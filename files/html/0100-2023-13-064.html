<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-65"><span class="space">k.</span> Failure to Accommodate Disability</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An explanation of the Board's jurisdiction over an allegedly forced disability retirement is taken from <span class="Italic">Pariseau v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 113 MSPR 370, 374-76 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-15, 2010 MSPB 46 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A retirement is presumed to be voluntary and therefore outside the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Vitale v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 17 (2007). An involuntary retirement, however, is equivalent to a forced removal within the Board's jurisdiction under chapter 75. <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 437 F.3d 1322, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). Generally, an appellant who claims that a retirement was involuntary may rebut the presumption of voluntariness in a variety of ways, for example, by showing that the retirement was the result of misinformation or deception by the agency, intolerable working conditions, or the unjustified threat of an adverse action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1328-29.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the Board has recognized that involuntary disability retirement cases are somewhat different from ordinary involuntary retirement cases. In an appeal of an alleged involuntary disability retirement, the appellant must show, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that there was an accommodation available that would have allowed him to continue his employment, and that the agency improperly failed to provide that accommodation. <span class="Italic">Nordhoff v. Department of the Navy,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 88, 91 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 185 F.3d 886 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (Table). If accommodation was impossible, then the appellant's disability retirement was not a constructive removal. Other theories of involuntariness, e.g., intolerable working conditions, cannot lead to a different conclusion because the essence of all claims of involuntary retirement is that the employee had a choice between retiring or continuing to work, but was forced to choose retirement by improper acts of the agency. <span class="Italic">Okleson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 415, &#x00B6; 7 (2001). An employee who is unable to work because of a medical condition that cannot be accommodated has no such choice in the first instance. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If, on the other hand, an appellant's condition could have been accommodated so that he could have continued working, then it is possible that his retirement was involuntary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In such a case, the appellant must also show that he informed the agency of his need and desire for an accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 8. The time period relevant for determining whether an appellant could have been accommodated begins on the date he requested accommodation and extends to the date of his separation. <span class="Italic">Rule v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 388, &#x00B6; 14 (2000). In sum, an appellant who alleges that his disability retirement was involuntary must show the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;that he indicated to the agency that he wished to continue working, but that his medical limitations required a modification of his work conditions or duties, i.e., accommodation;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;there was a reasonable accommodation available during the period between the date on which he indicated to the agency that he had medical limitations but desired to continue working and the date that he was separated, that would have allowed the appellant to continue working; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;the agency unjustifiably failed to offer that accommodation. <span class="Italic">Okleson,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 415, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an appellant makes a non-frivolous allegation casting doubt on the presumption of voluntariness, he is entitled to a hearing at which he must prove jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Garcia,</span> 437 F.3d at 1344. To meet the non-frivolous standard, an appellant need only plead allegations of fact that, if proven, could show jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Goodwin v. Department of Transportation,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 520, &#x00B6; 12 (2007). Mere <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> allegations are insufficient to meet the standard, however. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In determining whether the appellant has made such a non-frivolous allegation, the administrative judge may consider the agency's documentary submissions.

<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Board generally limits its jurisdiction over alleged involuntary disability retirement claims to cases where the agency improperly denied an appellant's request for accommodation, the Board has sometimes applied its general law on involuntary actions to determine whether a disability retirement was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Vaughan v.

<p class="Body-Text">Involuntary retirement appeals involving alleged failure to accommodate disabilities are factually complex--the usual situation in disability accommodation cases.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that he made a non-frivolous allegation of jurisdiction and is thus entitled to a jurisdictional hearing. An employee-initiated action, such as a retirement or resignation, is presumed to be voluntary, and thus outside the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Hosozawa v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6; 5 (2010). An involuntary retirement, however, is equivalent to a forced removal and therefore is within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). Generally, an appellant who claims that a retirement was involuntary may rebut the presumption of voluntariness in a variety of ways, for example, by showing that the retirement was the result of misinformation or deception by the agency, intolerable working conditions, or the unjustified threat of an adverse action.[3] <span class="Italic">Pariseau v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 370, &#x00B6; 11 (2010). The appellant has the burden of proving the Board's jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The appellant argued jurisdiction on the basis of intolerable working conditions, as well as disability. He claimed that by failing to accommodate his medical conditions, including his deafness, the agency created an intolerable work environment from which he had no choice but to retire. Because the appellant retired on disability, the administrative judge appropriately applied the criteria for involuntary disability retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recognized that involuntary disability retirement cases are somewhat different from ordinary involuntary retirement cases. An appellant who alleges that his disability retirement was involuntary must establish the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;that he indicated to the agency that he wished to continue working, but that his medical limitations required a modification of his work conditions or duties, i.e., accommodation;</p>

If accommodation was impossible, the appellant's disability retirement would not have been a constructive removal, and other theories of <span id="Page_2026"></span>involuntariness cannot lead to a different conclusion. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 7. The essence of other claims of involuntariness, including coercion, duress, and intolerable working conditions, is that the appellant had a choice between retiring and continuing to work, but was forced to choose retirement by improper acts of the agency. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> If the appellant was unable to work because of a medical condition that cannot be accommodated, he had no choice as to whether to continue working.[4] <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;This standard is correct to determine the Board's jurisdiction in most involuntary disability retirement appeals. However, in unusual circumstances, we have applied the principles for determining jurisdiction in regular involuntary retirements. <span class="Italic">See Hosford v.

To the extent that the agency's evidence constitutes mere factual contradiction of the appellant's otherwise adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, however, the administrative judge may not weigh evidence and resolve conflicting assertions of the parties, and the agency's evidence may not be dispositive. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. 325, 329 (1994)).

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant non-frivolously alleged that he indicated to the agency that he wished to continue working, but that his medical limitations required a modification of his work conditions or duties.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his sworn statement, the appellant alleged that he requested reassignment to any agency position in downtown Washington, D.C., that would both allow him to shorten his Alexandria-to-Beltsville commute and remove him from his "stress-inducing chain of command." The appellant further alleged that in September 2009, the agency's medical officer, O.I. Jacykewycz, M.D., found that he was eligible for reasonable accommodation as a disabled employee and sent to his line management his physician's recommendation that he be reassigned. The agency, however, explained that it had "no record of any requests by the appellant for reassignment outside the competitive process which he utilized."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant's November 13, 2009 e-mail inquiry regarding disability retirement appeared to be the first indication that he was "very sick," and that message does not state that he wished to continue working. The agency has not specifically disputed, however, the appellant's assertion made under oath that, in September 2009, Dr. Jacykewycz found that he was eligible for and recommended reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Aldridge v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 21, &#x00B6; 9 (2008) (sworn statements that are not rebutted are competent evidence of the matters asserted therein). The Enforcement Guidance from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) states that a person other than the individual with a disability, including a health professional, may request a reasonable accommodation on behalf of the individual. EEOC, Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act, Question 2, <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html">http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html</a> [now at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-reasonable-accommodation-and-undue-hardship-under-ada">https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-reasonable-accommodation-and-undue-hardship-under-ada</a>] (hereinafter EEOC Enforcement Guidance). Accordingly, the appellant has non-frivolously alleged that he indicated to the agency that he wished to continue working, but his medical limitations required a modification of his work conditions or duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant non-frivolously alleged that there was a reasonable accommodation available between the date on which he indicated to the agency that he had medical limitations, but desired to continue working, and the date that he was separated, that would have allowed him to continue working.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his sworn statement, the appellant explained that he requested reassignment to a number of specific positions located in Washington, D.C., in 2009 and 2010, as well as reassignment to the position of 508 Compliance Coordinator in Colorado, and was told that the hiring managers "could not accept [him] for reassignment without the agreement of [his] managers." The appellant provided a list of positions to which he had sought reassignment. In response, the agency argued that it was "not aware of the positions that the appellant allegedly requested reassignment to," but "[a]gency records confirm his voluntary application through the agency's competitive staffing process" for a group of positions listed in the agency's response. The agency pointed out that the appellant was unqualified for some of the positions for which he applied. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The agency said that the appellant was considered for some of the other positions, and even rated "best qualified" for one position, but he was not selected.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found the appellant's jurisdictional allegations to be insufficient. The administrative judge reasoned that the appellant appeared to have applied for positions under various vacancy announcements, and that "[a]n application for a position announced as a vacancy is not a request for an accommodation." The administrative judge also concluded that only one of the positions for which the appellant applied was available within the proper time frame, between the date of his e-mail inquiry regarding retirement, November 13, 2009, and his separation date, May 28, 2010. The available position was as a 508 Compliance Coordinator in Colorado. The administrative judge determined that the agency would not have been required to offer that position to him as a reasonable accommodation because it was outside of the appellant's commuting area.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, as the appellant correctly contends on review, an agency's reassignment obligation is not limited by geographical location, <span class="Italic">Gonzalez-Acosta v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 277, &#x00B6; 14 n.6 (2010) (citing EEOC Enforcement Guidance at 19-20 (Question 27)). The record thus shows that the appellant non-frivolously alleged that there was at least one position--as a 508 Compliance Coordinator in Colorado--available during the proper time frame. If the appellant can prove his allegation regarding the medical officer's September 2009 referral of his accommodation request, he potentially could have identified a total of three positions for which he was qualified that would have been available during the relevant time frame. Additionally, the agency identified two other Management Analyst positions for which the appellant had applied in early 2010 and had been deemed qualified. Accordingly, the appellant non-frivolously alleged that there was a reasonable accommodation that would have allowed him to continue working during the period between the date on which he indicated to the agency that he had medical limitations and the date that he was separated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant non-frivolously alleged that the agency unjustifiably failed to offer an available accommodation.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the administrative judge's jurisdictional order, the appellant asserted that he could have continued working "if he were reassigned to a job with an easier commute, productive work assignments, and non-hostile management." Citing all of the appellant's medical conditions, the administrative judge concluded that the appellant had not explained how these conditions would have been accommodated so that he could have continued working, if he could have been reassigned to a job with an easier commute, productive work assignments, and non-hostile management. The administrative judge found that the appellant failed to non-frivolously allege that, even if he had made a timely request for a reassignment as a reasonable accommodation, the agency's failure to reassign him would have been unjustified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, however, declared under penalty of perjury that his treating physicians advised him to request reassignment from Beltsville to Washington, D.C., which "would have reduced the stress of driving and the danger of driving while under drowsiness-inducing medication." He also explained that he went on leave under the FMLA because he "could no longer safely commute to the Beltsville office." <span class="Italic">Cf. Atkins v. Department of Commerce</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 246, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11 (1999) (remanding the appeal to give the appellant an additional opportunity to establish that his disability retirement was involuntary based on allegations that he applied for retirement, not because he wanted to retire, but to force the agency to reassign him to a less stressful and physically-demanding position that would not aggravate his underlying condition). Moreover, as explained above, the appellant non-frivolously alleged that he informed the agency he required an accommodation, and identified one or more positions to which he might have been reassigned that were apparently available during the applicable time frame.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on review that the agency failed to engage in an interactive process under the Rehabilitation Act to determine whether his condition could be accommodated, and this omission caused it to fail to provide a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Gonzalez-Acosta</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 277, &#x00B6; 16 (the failure to engage in the interactive process alone does not violate the Rehabilitation Act; rather the appellant must show that this omission resulted in failure to provide reasonable accommodation). During the interactive process, the appellant points out, the agency could have properly requested medical evidence and considered the likely effectiveness of various possible accommodations.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;As the EEOC Enforcement Guidance explains, the exact nature of the interactive process that a request for accommodation <span id="Page_2027"></span>triggers will vary between employees because the dialogue itself is intended to help the parties understand the employee's needs and what changes to working conditions might be possible. EEOC Enforcement Guidance, Question 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Once an employee informs the agency that he requires an accommodation, the agency must engage in an interactive process to determine an appropriate accommodation. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez-Acosta</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 277, &#x00B6; 15. Here, the record is unclear as to whether the agency ever engaged in such a process with the appellant. The appellant specifically stated under penalty of perjury that the agency did not engage in the interactive process: "At no time did management attempt to engage me in an interactive process to determine my need for the accommodation or to identify possible alternatives to it." The agency claimed that the appellant "was given the opportunity to have his doctor answer questions related to his medical conditions as it [sic] pertains to the essential functions of his position in order to consider reasonable accommodations for him," but he "did not provide any response to the Agency." The agency did not, however, offer any evidence that it engaged in the interactive process, and even if it had, such evidence is not dispositive at this point. <span class="Italic">See Pariseau</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 370, &#x00B6; 14 (citing <span class="Italic">Ferdon</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 329).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We cannot know from the record before us whether the agency engaged in the interactive process during the processing of the appellant's application for disability retirement. The agency file included the appellant's Applicant's Statement of Disability, Standard Form (SF) 3112A, and the agency medical officer's approval, but it did not contain the Supervisor's Statement. As part of the appellant's application for disability retirement, the agency would have been required to complete the Supervisor's Statement, which among other things, would have addressed its efforts to accommodate his condition. We thus conclude that the appellant non-frivolously alleged that the agency unjustifiably failed to offer an available accommodation. Accordingly, the appellant has made a non-frivolous allegation of jurisdiction entitling him to a jurisdictional hearing under <span class="Italic">Garcia.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another analysis on the facts and law of an involuntary retirement appeal based on alleged accommodative failure is taken from <span class="Italic">Fields v. Dept. of Interior</span>, SF-0752-17-0022-I-1 (NP 10/31/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that he was forced to retire because a loud generator that he worked near was causing him a loss of hearing and the agency refused to provide him with a reasonable accommodation. An agency's denial of a reasonable accommodation to an eligible employee is a factor to be considered in determining whether the agency coerced the employee's resignation or retirement. <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 16, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 469 F. App'x 852 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Based at least in part on her observation of witnesses testifying at the hearing, the administrative judge found that, prior to his retirement, the appellant was off ered reassignments that would have accommodated his concern about protecting his hearing ability. On review, the appellant has made no more than a bare assertion that the off ered reassignments, which he declined to take, would have failed to protect his ability to hear. Because we are aware of no suffi ciently sound reasons for disturbing the administrative judge's credibility fi ndings, we affi rm her conclusion that the agency off ered the appellant reassignments that would have protected his sense of hearing. <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">Voorhis v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 538, &#x00B6; 18 (2011), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 474 F. App'x 778 (Fed. Cir. 2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that, assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant may have been entitled to another form of reasonable accommodation that the agency failed to provide,[2] he still had the option of safely continuing his employment by accepting any of the off ered reassignments. <span class="Italic">See Brown</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 17 (finding that the appellant's performance with the agency, for more than 2 years after it denied her request for an accommodation, indicated that she had the option to continue working following the denial). If the appellant believed that the agency was failing to provide him with a reasonable accommodation to which he was entitled, then he also could have fi led an equal employment opportunity complaint. <span class="Italic">See Axsom v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 605, &#x00B6; 17 (2009). Accordingly, we fi nd that his decision to retire, rather than contest the agency's actions in the appropriate forum, was voluntary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2] Reassignment to the next lower-level position for which an employee is qualifi ed may constitute a reasonable accommodation if an equivalent position is unavailable. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez-Acosta v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 277, &#x00B6; 14 (2010). An agency's reassignment obligation is not limited by geographical area, facility or personnel system. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 14 n.6. Thus, if the agency failed to conduct an appropriate search for an available equivalent position before off ering the appellant a lower-level position, it may have overlooked a position to which he may have been entitled as a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also seems to argue that the agency's violation of its own procedures constituted a failure to engage in the interactive process.[3] However, the refusal to engage in the interactive process alone does not constitute a failure to accommodate. <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. Department of Energy</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 155, &#x00B6; 18 (2011). Regardless, for the reasons set forth above, we find that any procedural error did not deprive the appellant of choice in the matter of his retirement. <span class="Italic">See Bean v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 8 (2013). Absent an otherwise appealable action, his claims of discrimination and procedural error are not an independent source of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Brown</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 10 (finding that the Board will consider allegations of discrimination and reprisal only insofar as those allegations relate to the issue of voluntariness and not whether they would establish discrimination or reprisal as an affirmative defense).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3] The administrative judge indicated that the appellant should have submitted a written request for an accommodation in order to enter "the offi cial reasonable accommodation process." However, although an employee must generally inform their agency when an accommodation is needed, such a request need not be in writing. <span class="Italic">White v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 405, &#x00B6; 15 n.6 (2013). Any error on this point, however, is immaterial to the outcome for the reasons set forth in this Final Order.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Disability retirement cases are somewhat different from typical retirement cases because an appellant who meets the statutory requirements for disability retirement has "no true choice between working (with or without accommodation) and not working, and disability retirement cannot be considered as a removal within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(1)." <span class="Italic">Nordhoff v.

To invoke the Board's jurisdiction over involuntary disability retirement appeals, the appellant must raise nonfrivolous allegations that, if proven, would show that an accommodation was available between the time the appellant's medical condition arose and the date of his separation that would have allowed him to continue his employment; the appellant communicated to the agency his desire to continue working but that his medical limitations required a modification of his working conditions or duties; and the agency failed to provide the appellant that accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Okleson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">To meet the statutory requirements for disability retirement, an employee must be unable to render useful and efficient service at the time of her separation, either in her present position, or in a vacant position to which she could be reassigned. <span class="Italic">Nordhoff v.

As a result, the Board has found that, to establish a claim of involuntary disability retirement, an appellant must prove that: (1) After the onset of her disability and prior to her separation, she requested altered duties or working conditions, or indicated to the agency that she wished to continue working with a modification of her working conditions or duties; (2) there was a reasonable accommodation available prior to the date of her separation, either at or below her grade level, that would have allowed her to continue her employment; and (3) the agency did not provide her that accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Okleson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish jurisdiction in an appeal involving an alleged involuntary disability retirement, the appellant must show that there was an accommodation available on the date of her separation, either at or below her grade or level, that would have allowed her to continue working, and that the agency did not provide her with that accommodation. <span class="Italic">Deines v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the record establishes that the appellant suffers from Major Depression, Recurrent and Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia. The record also reflects that the appellant used an extensive amount of leave during calendar year 2004 and apparently did not report for work after approximately April 24, 2004. She was hospitalized for her condition for one week in May 2004. Also, she apparently requested to be accommodated on or before June 12, 2004, by being allowed to work a flexible schedule, to telecommute, to relocate her work cubicle, and to receive advanced sick leave and be placed in the leave-donor program. However, in a June 2, 2004 letter, the appellant's psychiatrist, Dennis T. Cozzens, M.D., stated that the appellant was totally incapacitated from work. Although Dr. Cozzens indicated that she might be able to return to duty in July 2004, the appellant did not return to work prior to her retirement in January 2005, and there is no medical evidence showing that she was able to perform her duties at the time of her separation, even with the requested accommodations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, the appellant has never claimed that she was able to work, even with accommodation, at the time of her separation and the outdated medical documentation in the record tends to show that she was not able to work.<span class="Italic"></span> As in <span class="Italic">Nordhoff</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 92, the appellant instead appears to claim that she could have been accommodated at some point prior to her separation but, by the time of her separation, she had become completely disabled. Because the appellant has not claimed that she was able to work at the time of her separation, she has not made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction entitling her to a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See Deines</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 389, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13; <span class="Italic">see also Collins v.

Under the circumstances, therefore, the administrative judge's failure to consider whether the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights and does not warrant reversal of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984) (an adjudicatory error that is not prejudicial to a party's substantive rights provides no basis for reversal of an initial decision).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">A succinct explanation of the connection between claims of involuntary retirement and disability discrimination through the failure of an agency to accommodate an employee who would not have retired were he provided job accommodation is provided by <span class="Italic">Flaminio v. DOJ</span>, 95 MSPR 520, 524 &#x00B6; 8 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An individual who retires on disability can show that his decision to retire was involuntary if his condition could have been accommodated so that he could have continued to work. An agency's failure to accommodate, standing alone, does not make an employee's decision to retire involuntary; rather, the employee can show that his disability retirement was a constructive removal by establishing that he indicated to the agency that he wished to continue working but that he had medical limitations requiring a modification of his working conditions or duties, i.e., accommodation, and there was a reasonable accommodation available that the agency unjustifiably failed to offer him<span class="Italic">. Lorenz v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 670 &#x00B6; 8 (2000). Under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(g), the agency's obligation to offer accommodation includes an offer to reassign the employee to a vacant funded position the essential functions of which he can perform, with or without reasonable accommodation, at the same or next highest available grade or level, located in the same commuting area and serviced by the same appointing authority. An appellant can establish that his disability retirement was involuntary if he can prove that there was such an accommodation available during the period between the date on which he indicated to the agency that he desired to continue working, despite his medical limitations, and the date of his separation<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, we find that the AJ should have considered, in his jurisdictional analysis, the appellant's claim of denial of a reasonable accommodation. The permissible scope of the Board's review of an appellant's discrimination claims on the question of coercion is not confined solely to the specific allegations accepted by the agency for investigation; rather, it may extend to any discrimination like or related to the substance of the allegations in the claim and which reasonably can be expected to grow out of the investigation triggered by the claim. <span class="Italic">See Pacheco v. Mineta,</span> 448 F.3d 783, 789 (5th Cir. 2006); <span class="Italic">E.E.O.C. v. Delight Wholesale Co.,</span> 973 F.2d 664, 668 (8th Cir. 1992).

General Motors Corp.,</span> 217 F.3d 621, 631 (8th Cir. 2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the record shows that the appellant raised a non-frivolous allegation that his retirement was involuntary so as to warrant a jurisdictional hearing. In his appeal, the appellant contended, in part, that his retirement was involuntary because the agency had denied his request for a reasonable accommodation. It is well settled that an appellant may show that his retirement was involuntary due to the agency's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation for his disability. <span class="Italic">E.g., Garcia,</span> 437 F.3d at 1324 (failure of agency to renovate the appellant's workspace to accommodate her needs may have forced the appellant to accept a demotion). The record before us contains an August 20, 2004 letter to the agency from the appellant's physician in support of his request for an accommodation (to allow the appellant to telecommute). This letter indicates that the appellant suffers from "serious lumbar radiculopathy," which causes the appellant to suffer "extensive pain." In addition, the letter states that the medications prescribed for the appellant frequently produce side effects, including "dizziness, sleep disturbance, vision changes, nausea, light-headedness, drowsiness, induction of sleep, and mental mood changes." In addition, the record includes a sworn statement from one of the appellant's colleagues, taken during the EEO investigation, in which she states that the appellant complained to her that he felt "overloaded" and that management expected "too much of him." She also states that when the agency announced that the appellant had retired, she had assumed that it was due to his health.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of the foregoing, we find that the appellant has made allegations of fact which, if proven, could establish the Board's jurisdiction over this matter. <span class="Italic">See Deines v. Department of Energy,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 389, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-18 (2005). The appellant is, therefore, entitled to a hearing on the jurisdictional issue.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;As the record reflects, the appellant clearly argued that he was forced to retire due to intolerable working conditions. Moreover, the conditions he identified explicitly included the agency's failure to provide him with a reasonable accommodation, i.e., telecommuting. To identify this claim, it is only necessary to read the four page document attached to the appellant's petition for appeal which is supported by documentary evidence. In his appeal, the appellant specifically alleged that he had been denied a reasonable accommodation. Notwithstanding the appellant's failure to advance any argument on his substantive claims in response to the AJ's jurisdictional order, the fact that this issue was not addressed was error. <span class="Italic">See Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 1 M.S.P.R. 587, 589 (1980) (an initial decision must identify all material issues of fact and law, summarize the evidence, resolve issues of credibility, and include the AJ's conclusions of law and his legal reasoning, as well as the authorities on which that reasoning rests).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit parsed the relation between involuntary retirement and an agency's failure to accommodate a disability, <span class="Italic">Watkins v. VA</span>, 117 Fed. Appx. 718 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A retirement, to include a disability retirement, is presumed to be voluntary and beyond the board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Shoaf v. Dep't of Agric.</span>, 260 F.3d 1336, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Watkins may avoid this presumption upon a showing that his disability retirement was involuntary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1341. establish a claim of involuntary disability retirement, Watkins must prove that (1) after the onset of his disability and prior to his retirement, he sought to continue working, despite his medical limitations, with an accommodation; (2) an accommodation was available on the date his retirement at, or above, his position level; and (3) the Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA") refused to provide him an accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Benavidez Dep't of the Navy</span>, 241 F.3d 1370, 137 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (affirming a board decision using these criteria).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question before the board was whether Watkins had made sufficient non-frivolous allegations of fact to establish that his retirement was involuntary. The record shows that in December of 1997 the VA provided Watkins with a five-week accommodation period in response to a medical condition. He does not allege or prove that he requested another accommodation prior to the expiration of the five-week accommodation period. Furthermore, he neither alleges nor proves that a further accommodation was requested and available, but not provided, prior to his June 1998 disability retirement. Therefor, Watkins fails to rebut the presumption that his disability retirement was voluntary, and fails to present any grounds that invoke the board's jurisdiction to review his retirement.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In essence, Mr. Howard argues that the Board's decision that his retirement was voluntary is not supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, Mr. Howard contends that the recommendation of the doctor who <span id="Page_2029"></span>performed the FFDE should not have led management to conclude that he was unfit to be accommodated and that the. Board failed to consider the circumstance-showing that he was "forced into retirement."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A retirement is presumed voluntary <span class="Italic">Terban v. Dep't of Energy</span>, 216 F.3d 1021, 1024 (Fed. Cir. 2000).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Board considered the possible accommodations that Mr. Howard presented on appeal in view of the evidence presented, including opinions of his personal physician and the doctor who performed the FFDE. The FFDE physician concluded that Mr. Howard could do "no kneeling, no repeated bending or stooping, no climbing or ladder work, no prolonged standing or walking." The analysis of the Board confirmed that in light of Mr. Howard's inability to perform duties associated with the job descriptions presented that there were no available accommodations for him. Further, the Board rejected Mr. Howard's assertion that he should be assigned a helper to perform his duties because USPS is not required to create a new position in order to accommodate a current employee. <span class="Italic">See e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Moon v. Dep't of Army</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 412, 422 (1994).

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Martin v. USDA</span>, 52 Fed. Appx. 132 (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP), explained the jurisdictional basis for involuntary retirement appeals based on inadequate accommodation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Martin was a Community Development Assistant in the Scottsburg, Indiana, field office of the Department of Agriculture, where she had worked for more than 19 years. In May 1997, her supervisor conducted a review of her work and found it to be unsatisfactory. On October 17, 1997, Ms. Martin received an unsatisfactory performance rating for the prior 12-month period and was placed on a 90-day Opportunity to Improve Plan for unsatisfactory performance of one of the critical elements of her position, loan processing. At that time, her supervisor relieved Ms. Martin of her duties involving loan servicing so that she could focus on her loan processing duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 29, 1997, Ms. Martin requested leave for her "state of depression." She stated that she felt harassed and discriminated against, and that she was medically disabled by stress, anxiety, and depression. Some time later, while still on extended leave, Ms. Martin applied for disability retirement. Her disability retirement application was approved on May 7, 1998, retroactive to March 10, 1998, the date of her separation from the agency. Prior to the approval of her retirement application, Ms. Martin filed an administrative complaint with the agency, contending that she had been discriminated against on various grounds and had been coerced into taking disability retirement. After the agency rejected her claim, she filed an appeal with the Board. In her Board action, she contended that she had been forced to take disability retirement because of the agency's refusal to accommodate her disability. Accordingly, she argued, her retirement was involuntary and she was entitled to be reinstated to her position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge assigned to the case ruled that Ms. Martin had failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction and thus was not entitled to a hearing on her involuntary retirement claim. The administrative judge therefore dismissed Ms. Martin's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. In particular, the administrative judge concluded that Ms. Martin had failed to indicate to the agency "that she was seeking to continue work with an accommodation for her disability," and that she had failed to make the agency "aware of her willingness to continue working with some form of accommodation, rather than seeking disability retirement."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review to this court, Ms. Martin contends that her allegations were sufficient to give the Board jurisdiction over her involuntary retirement claim and to entitle her to a hearing on her claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly stated the legal test for assessing a claim of involuntary disability retirement. As the administrative judge noted, retirements are presumed to be voluntary and thus outside the Board's jurisdiction. In order to establish a claim of involuntary disability retirement, the claimant must prove that (1) after the onset of her disability and prior to her separation, she requested altered duties or working conditions, or indicated to the agency that she wished to continue working with a modification of her working conditions or duties; (2) there was a reasonable accommodation available prior to the date of her separation, either at or below her grade level, that would have allowed her to continue her employment; and (3) the agency did not provide her that accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Okleson v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 415, 421-22 (2001); <span class="Italic">Timinski v. Dep't of Agric.</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 559, 562-64 (2001); <span class="Italic">As'Salaam v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 76, 89-91 (2000). A reasonable accommodation is a change in the working environment that enables the employee to continue to perform her job without interfering with the agency's mission. The employee, however, must be able, with an accommodation, to perform all the duties of her position or an alternative, available position. An agency is not required to accommodate a disabled employee by permanently assigning her to light-duty tasks when those tasks do not comprise a complete and separate position. <span class="Italic">See Mengine v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 123, 127-28 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question before the administrative judge was whether Ms. Martin had made sufficient nonfrivolous allegations to entitle her to a hearing on the jurisdictional issue. The administrative judge held that she had not, because she had failed adequately to allege that she "communicated to the agency any desire to keep working with an accommodation, including a reassignment, rather than applying for disability retirement."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is unclear to us why the administrative judge did not consider Ms. Martin's submissions to the Board to constitute nonfrivolous allegations that she had expressed a desire to continue working with an accommodation for her claimed disability. The administrative judge acknowledged that at the time Ms. Martin stopped working, she had asserted that she "felt harassed and discriminated against on the basis of her disability (stress, anxiety, depression disorder)." Moreover, Ms. Martin's allegation that she expressed a desire to continue working despite her disability was not limited to telling her supervisor some time after January 1998 that she wished to continue working until age 65. Rather, she asserted in her submission to the Board that during the months immediately before she left the workplace on extended leave she requested a transfer to a "less stressful office" and suggested that the office duties be realigned "so as to make the office function more smoothly," requests that she characterized in her submission as suggestions that "would have reasonably accommodated [her] condition." Indeed, a request for a transfer would seem to indicate a desire to continue working, rather than to retire, and a suggestion as to how the office could be restructured likewise would seem to indicate a desire to continue her employment. The government's brief is unhelpful in explaining why Ms. Martin's statements were not sufficient to constitute requests for an accommodation and expressions of a desire to continue working. Because it is unclear to us why the administrative judge regarded those statements as legally insufficient, we remand this case to the Board for a more complete explanation of why the administrative judge regarded those statements as inadequate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the issue on which she disposed of the case, the administrative judge did not find it necessary to address whether there was an available accommodation that could have been made for Ms. Martin's disability, either in the form of a transfer to another office or another position, or a change in the manner in which she performed the duties of the position she occupied. On remand, the administrative judge may wish to explore <span id="Page_2030"></span>that issue as well. If, upon reexamination of Ms. Martin's allegations in light of this opinion, the administrative judge concludes that Ms. Martin's has successfully raised nonfrivolous allegations as to each of the elements of a claim of involuntary disability retirement, the administrative judge should hold an evidentiary hearing on Ms. Martin's claim and determine whether she has met her burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, all the elements of an involuntary disability retirement claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Returning to Board decisions, its analysis of the related nature of involuntary retirement (or resignation) and disability claims was developed by <span class="Italic">Nordhoff v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 64 MSPR 478, 483-85 (1994). The appellant retired after the agency directed him to work in a position that the appellant believed was precluded by his disability. The Board suggested, as it remanded the appeal for additional analysis, that if the agency should have known that the appellant was raising a disability claim, its failure to further investigate the claim may have rendered the appellant's retirement involuntary:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the insufficiency of the appellant's medical evidence, there is a question whether that insufficiency, and ultimately the appellant's decision to apply for disability retirement, resulted from the agency's failure to inform him adequately about his right to reasonable accommodation of his disability. All that an agency needs before its duty to accommodate arises is a reasonable suspicion of a disabling condition, not definitive proof<span class="Italic">. Terry v. Department of the Navy,</span> 39 MSPR 565, 570 (1989); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Colon v. Department of the Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 190, 198-99 (1993) (although the appellant refused to discuss her diagnosis or lengthy absences, the agency knew of these matters, of the appellant's hospitalizations, and of other, related circumstances, and it accordingly knew or should have known of the appellant's disabling mental condition at the time it proposed her removal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the appellant's statements to his managers and human resources personnel that he was unable to work in Public Works because of personal and medical reasons, his offers to provide a doctor's statement to support that assertion, and his action in providing the agency with a doctor's statement, albeit a conclusory and inadequate one, the question arises whether the agency should have had a reasonable suspicion, prior to September 3, 1991, that the appellant was unable to work in the Public Works Department for medical reasons. If so, the question further arises whether the agency had a duty to make further inquiry into the appellant's ability to work in that department, perhaps including a duty to notify him of the necessity of his providing more detailed medical information,[7] before insisting that he make a choice among reporting to Public Works, applying for disability retirement, and facing disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;While the agency physician responsible for evaluating the appellant's disability may have had a need to know the basis for the appellant's fear of the Public Works Department and its buildings, there probably was no need for management officials to have this information. Medical conclusions regarding the effect of the appellant's fear would probably have sufficed for their purposes. In light of the appellant's expressed concern about providing management officials with detailed information about the reasons for his alleged inability to work in Public Works, agency officials may have had a duty to assure him that such disclosure was unnecessary. <span class="Italic">See Williams,</span> 44 MSPR at 451 (an agency's responsibility to provide adequate information includes an obligation to correct any erroneous information that it has reason to know an employee is relying on).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether the appellant's retirement was involuntary because it was based on incorrect or inadequate information was not discussed in the initial decision, and the parties apparently did not address it specifically below. Because the resolution of this issue may be outcome-determinative, we find it appropriate to remand the case to the regional office for this purpose. On remand, the administrative judge shall provide the parties with the opportunity to submit additional evidence and argument on the subject. If the administrative judge should find that the appellant's retirement was involuntary, he should also adjudicate the appellant's disability discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">See Marchese v. Department of the Navy,</span> 32 MSPR 461, 464 (1987) (the Board must decide a discrimination issue in a case even if the underlying action is overturned on other grounds)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A subsequent rendition of <span class="Italic">Nordhoff v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 78 MSPR 88, 90-92 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Nordhoff v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 98-3210), clarified the proof required of an individual claiming that a disability retirement was rendered involuntary by the agency's failure to provide accommodation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e now conclude that the relevant jurisdictional issue is whether the appellant could have been accommodated on October 23, 1991, the effective date of his disability retirement, not at some earlier time. We therefore modify our previous decisions in that regard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Absent a statutory exception, the Board's jurisdiction over an appeal is generally controlled by the person's status on the effective date of the action being appealed. <span class="Italic">Anderson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 MSPR 455, 457 (1995); <span class="Italic">Godfrey v. Veterans Administration</span>, 40 MSPR 438, 441 (1989). Focusing on the effective date is particularly appropriate when an employee retires on the basis of a disability. If the employee is unable to render useful and efficient service at the time of his separation, either in his present position, or in a vacant position to which he could be reassigned, he meets the statutory requirements for disability retirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 8337(a). Under these circumstances, there is no true choice between working (with or without accommodation) and not working, and disability retirement cannot be considered as a removal within the meaning of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512(1). To establish Board jurisdiction, an appellant who claims to have been constructively removed through an involuntary disability retirement must show that there was an accommodation available on the date of his separation that would have allowed him to continue his employment, and that the agency did not provide him that accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the effective date of the appellant's disability retirement was October 23, 1991, his retirement cannot be considered to be a constructive removal if he was unable to render useful and efficient service at that time, regardless of whether he was able to do so during some earlier period of time. The appellant has made numerous statements during the course of these proceedings which indicate his belief that, although his condition could have been accommodated by reassignment during the spring and summer of 1991, he was completely disabled by the time of his separation on October 23, 1991....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the undisputed evidence shows that the appellant was unable to render useful and efficient service, with or without accommodation, on the effective date of his disability retirement, the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal as a constructive removal. And in the absence of an adverse action over which it can exercise jurisdiction, the Board has no authority to consider whether the agency engaged in disability discrimination or any other wrongful action during the spring and summer of 1991.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rule v. VA</span>, 81 MSPR 282, 284-85 &#x00B6; 4 (1999) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Rule v. VA</span>, 85 MSPR 388 (2000), <span class="Italic">post</span>), summarized <span class="Italic">Nordhoff</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">Nordhoff,</span> we noted that disability retirement cases are somewhat different from typical retirement cases because an appellant who meets the statutory requirements for disability retirement has "no true choice between working (with or without accommodation) and not working, and disability retirement cannot be considered as a removal within the meaning of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512(1)." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 91. We therefore set forth the following standard:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">To establish Board jurisdiction, an appellant who claims to have been constructively removed through an involuntary disability retirement must show that there was an accommodation available on the date of his separation that would have allowed him to continue his employment, and that the agency did not provide him that accommodation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Atkins v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 81 MSPR 246, 249-52 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-11 (1999), also explained <span class="Italic">Nordhoff</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two Board decisions issued after the initial decision herein have a direct bearing on the unusual situation presented here, in which an employee who has been determined by OPM to be unable to render useful and efficient service in his position claims that his disability retirement was involuntary. In <span class="Italic">Nordhoff v. Department of the Navy,</span> 78 MSPR 88, 90-91 (1998), the Board held that if an individual receiving a disability annuity can show that his medical condition could have been accommodated on his date of separation, he may be able to establish that his disability retirement was involuntary. In <span class="Italic">Lamberson v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 80 MSPR 648 &#x00B6; 22 (1999), the Board held that an award of disability retirement from OPM is not an assurance that the employing agency considered all avenues of reasonable accommodation that would have allowed the employee to continue working; the Board further held that application for and acceptance of disability retirement is not necessarily an affirmation by the appellant that he could not be accommodated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under <span class="Italic">Nordhoff</span>, the threshold and potentially dispositive issue is whether the appellant's condition could have been accommodated. If accommodation as of the date of the appellant's separation was impossible then his disability retirement was voluntary, and other theories of involuntariness cannot lead to a different conclusion. The essence of the coercion, duress, and intolerable working conditions theories of involuntariness is that the employee had a choice between retiring or continuing to work and was forced to retire by improper acts of the agency; an employee who is unable to work because of a medical condition that cannot be accommodated simply does not have such a choice. Viewed another way, the remedies in an involuntary retirement appeal--reinstatement and back pay--are unavailable to an employee who is unable to work because of a permanent medical condition that cannot be accommodated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2031"></span>If, on the other hand, the appellant's condition could have been accommodated as of the date of his separation so that he could have continued working, then his retirement could be deemed involuntary. The agency's failure to accommodate, standing alone, would not make the appellant's decision to retire involuntary, but if under the circumstances a reasonable person in his position would have felt compelled to retire on disability then his retirement was involuntary. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hurwitz v. Department of the Army</span>, 61 MSPR 436, 439 (1994) (a retirement is deemed involuntary if discrimination or harassment by the agency made working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person in the appellant's position would have felt compelled to resign); <span class="Italic">accord</span> <span class="Italic">Markon v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">A retirement is presumed to be a voluntary act and, therefore, beyond the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Mintzmyer v.

The only situation in which the Board has jurisdiction over the propriety of an employee's retirement, other than in a direct appeal from an Office of Personnel Management final decision, is if the retirement, because involuntary, amounts to a constructive removal<span class="Italic">. See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction over an involuntary disability retirement claim is subject to greater limitations than is the case involving an ordinary retirement. In <span class="Italic">Nordhoff v. Department of the Navy</span>, 78 MSPR 88 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 185 F.3d 886 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (Table), relied upon by the AJ, we discussed the special circumstances that are implicated when an appellant claims that a disability retirement was involuntary. Disability retirement cases differ from typical retirement cases because an appellant who meets the statutory requirements for disability retirement has "no true choice between working (with or without accommodation) and not working, and disability retirement cannot be considered as a removal within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(l)." <span class="Italic">Nordhoff</span>, 78 MSPR at 91. Thus, we stated in <span class="Italic">Nordhoff</span> that the standard for determining whether a disability retirement was involuntary, and therefore tantamount to a removal, focused on the availability of an accommodation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">To establish Board jurisdiction, an appellant who claims to have been constructively removed through an involuntary disability retirement must show that there was an accommodation available on the date of his separation that would have allowed him to continue his employment, and that the agency did not provide him that accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> In addition to modifications to the employee's own position, an accommodation includes assignment to a position at or below the employee's grade or level that would have allowed continued employment. <span class="Italic">Rule v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 85 MSPR 388 &#x00B6; 4 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, when an appellant claims that a disability retirement was involuntary, the threshold and potentially dispositive issue is whether the employee's condition could have been accommodated<span class="Italic">. As'Salaam v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 85 MSPR 76 &#x00B6; 31 (2000). If accommodation was impossible, then the employee's disability retirement was not a constructive removal. Other theories cannot lead to a different conclusion because the essence of claims of involuntariness based upon coercion, duress, or intolerable working conditions is that the employee had a choice between retiring or continuing to work but was forced to choose retirement by improper acts of the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. An employee who is unable to work because of a medical condition that cannot be accommodated simply does not have such a choice. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If, on the other hand, the employee's condition could have been accommodated so that he could have continued working, then his retirement could be deemed involuntary. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 32. It is the employee's burden to show that his disability retirement was a constructive removal by establishing that he indicated to the agency that he wished to continue working but that he had medical limitations requiring a modification of his working conditions or duties, i.e., accommodation, and there was a reasonable accommodation available that the agency unjustifiably failed to offer him. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's failure to accommodate, standing alone, would not make the employee's decision to retire involuntary. <span class="Italic">Id.; see</span> <span class="Italic">also Rule</span>, 85 MSPR 388 &#x00B6; 14. The employee who applies for disability retirement generally must request altered duties or working conditions, or indicate to the agency that he would like to continue working if possible. Absent such notice to the agency of a desire to continue working, an employee who later claims in litigation that his disability retirement constituted a constructive removal because the agency failed to accommodate his condition generally should not prevail in such an appeal. <span class="Italic">As'Salaam</span>, 85 MSPR 76 &#x00B6; 32.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the AJ erred when she ruled that the relevant jurisdictional issue was whether the appellant could have been accommodated on October 31, 1997, the effective date of his disability retirement, not at some earlier time. We agree. The date of an employee's separation by disability retirement is not the only relevant date in deciding an involuntary disability retirement appeal. <span class="Italic">Lorenz v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 84 MSPR 670, 10 (2000). Instead, the relevant time period is the period from the date the appellant indicated to the agency that he desired to continue working, but that he had medical limitations, to the date that he was separated. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 11. Neither the AJ's acknowledgment order nor the agency's motion to dismiss informed the appellant of this standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that the appellant submitted to his supervisor a written request for accommodation on February 24, 1997, in which he identified his medical condition and set forth specific accommodation ideas for his GS-11 Community Development Specialist position, as well as a request "to be considered for a position which is a better match for my individual strengths.... By letter dated March 6, 1997, the appellant's psychiatrists informed the appellant's supervisor that the appellant had been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and that the appellant had difficulties with concentration, distractibility, organizational skills, and inconsistent completion of tasks. The psychiatrists described in detail the appellant's difficulties and suggested possible accommodations. Having shown that he requested accommodation in light of his identified medical condition, the appellant must now be afforded an opportunity to establish the Board's jurisdiction by further showing that an accommodation was available to him through modification of his duties, or an assignment to a vacant position at or below his grade or level, at any time during the period from his accommodation request on February 24, 1997 through the date of his separation. <span class="Italic">Rule</span>, 85 MSPR 388 &#x00B6; 13.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">A person may establish that his disability retirement was involuntary, however, if he shows that: (1) He indicated to the agency that he wished to continue working, but he had medical limitations requiring accommodation through modification of his working conditions or duties; (2) a reasonable accommodation was available that would have <span id="Page_2032"></span>enabled him to continue working; and (3) the agency unjustifiably failed to offer him this accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Flaminio v. Department of Justice</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 520, &#x00B6; 8 (2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addressing the issue of whether the agency unjustifiably failed to offer the appellant an accommodation that would have enabled him to continue working, the administrative judge in this case relied on the requirements of 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(g). That is, she cited that regulatory provision for the proposition that "the agency's obligation to offer accommodation includes an offer to reassign the employee to a vacant funded position, the essentials of which he can perform with or without reasonable accommodation," and she then stated that the "position must be at the same or next highest available grade or level, located in the same commuting area and serviced by the same appointing authority."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1614.203 of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, is entitled "Rehabilitation Act," and it was promulgated to implement section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which applied to employment in the federal government. <span class="Italic">See</span> Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Pub. L. No. 93-112, &#x00A7; 501;<span class="Italic"> see generally</span> 57 Fed. Reg. 12646 (Apr. 10, 1992). The paragraph of that section on which the administrative judge relied, however, along with other paragraphs of the same section, was repealed effective June 20, 2002. 67 Fed. Reg. 35732 (May 21, 2002). Since then, the standards used to determine whether a federal agency has violated section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended, have been the same as the employment-related standards applied under Titles I and V of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), as amended. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(b); 67 Fed. Reg. 35732, 35735 (May 21, 2002). Those standards are set out at 29 C.F.R. part 1630. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Although the administrative judge in this case did not refer to 29 C.F.R. part 1630 in her analysis of the appellant's claim that his retirement was involuntary, we find, for reasons stated below, that her analysis was not inconsistent with that part or with the ADA, and that the appellant has shown no error in her conclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on petition for review, as he did below, that the agency should have accommodated his disability by limiting his hours of work to 8 hours a day. He does not appear to deny, however, that providing this accommodation on a regular basis would have required the assignment of another employee to provide "auxiliary assistance" in order to ensure that all the mail he was assigned to deliver was in fact delivered.... Such an assignment would exceed the agency's obligations under the ADA. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dropinski v. Douglas County, Nebraska</span>, 298 F.3d 704, 710 (8th Cir. 2002) (an employer is not required to reassign existing workers to help a disabled employee perform his essential duties). We therefore agree with the administrative judge that the agency was not obligated to offer the appellant this accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that the appellant has not shown that any vacant position for which he qualified existed between the time he made his accommodation request and the time he retired. <span class="Italic">See Taylor</span>, 184 F.3d at 316 (the employee has the burden of showing that he can perform the essential functions of a vacant position). Although he has argued that the agency should have assigned him to a "CFS Markup" position, or given him "AIMS technician" duties, as it apparently did for other employees, he has not shown or even alleged that any such positions were vacant at the time he sought accommodation. Moreover, he has not challenged the administrative judge's finding...that the duties assigned to the comparison employees were assembled specifically for those employees because the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) had found that the employees had suffered job-related injuries and because the agency accordingly was required to create work assignments within those employees' limitations. In the absence of any indication that OWCP had made such a finding with respect to the appellant's medical limitations, the agency was under no obligation to create a position within the appellant's limitations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ammons v. Aramark Uniform Services, Inc.</span>, 368 F.3d 809, 819 (7th Cir. 2004) (creating a new position that would change the essential functions of a job is not an accommodation required by the ADA); <span class="Italic">Gile v. United Airlines, Inc.</span>, 95 F.3d 492, 499 (7th Cir. 1996) (while an employer may be obligated to reassign a disabled employee, this obligation extends only to vacant positions, and the employer is not "obligated to create a 'new' position for the disabled employee").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, and assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant was "disabled" as that term is used in the ADA, we find that he has not shown that the agency unjustifiably failed to offer him an accommodation that would have enabled him to continue working. He also has established no other basis on which to find that his retirement was other than voluntary. Accordingly, we find that the appellant's retirement was a voluntary action over which the Board lacks appellate jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Lorenz v. USPS</span>, 84 MSPR 670, 672-676 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-12 (2000), an appellant claiming that he was forced into disability retirement because the agency would not accommodate his disability did not prevail in a constructive removal appeal when he neither requested altered duties or working conditions nor made known to the employer before retiring that he wanted to continue working:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a PS-4 Mailhandler, was granted a disability retirement effective October 17, 1997. On April 7, 1999, the appellant filed a timely Board appeal alleging that the agency's harassment, misinformation, misrepresentation, and coercion had forced him into retirement involuntarily. He also alleged that the agency had discriminated against him because of his disability, and had retaliated against him for filing EEO complaints. After a hearing, the administrative judge (AJ) dismissed the appellant's appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Nordhoff v. Department of the Navy</span>, 78 MSPR 88, 91-92 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 185 F.3d 886 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (Table), however, we discussed the special circumstances that exist where an appellant claims that a disability retirement was involuntary. We held that an employee who claims to have been constructively removed through an involuntary disability retirement must show that there was an accommodation available that would have allowed him to continue his employment, and that the agency did not provide him that accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Handy v. Department of the Army</span>, 82 MSPR 683 &#x00B6; 5 (1999). When such a claim is made, the threshold and potentially dispositive issue is whether the employee's condition could have been accommodated. <span class="Italic">Atkins v. Department of Commerce</span>, 81 MSPR 246 &#x00B6; 10 (1999). If accommodation was impossible, then the employee's disability retirement was not a constructive removal, and other theories cannot lead to a different conclusion because the essence of coercion, duress, and intolerable working conditions claims of involuntariness is that the employee had a choice between retiring or continuing to work but was forced to choose retirement by improper acts of the agency. An employee who is unable to work because of a medical condition that cannot be accommodated simply does not have such a choice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If, on the other hand, the employee's condition could have been accommodated so that he could have continued working, then his retirement could be deemed involuntary. The agency's failure to accommodate, standing alone, would not make the employee's decision to retire involuntary. Rather, the employee can show that his disability retirement was a constructive removal by establishing that he indicated to the agency that he wished to continue working but that he had medical limitations requiring a modification of his working conditions or duties, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, accommodation, and there was a reasonable accommodation available that the agency unjustifiably failed to offer him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our formulation above of the standards for evaluating a claim of involuntary disability retirement is not a verbatim restatement of the holding set out in <span class="Italic">Nordhoff</span>, because the narrower holding in <span class="Italic">Nordhoff</span> was sufficient to dispose of that case under the facts presented there. Mr. Nordhoff's disability retirement could not have been a constructive removal because under the undisputed facts of that case he was totally disabled from any employment when he was separated. 78 MSPR at 91-92. However, <span class="Italic">Nordhoff</span> was not intended to hold that whenever an employee shows that his medical condition could have been accommodated, an involuntary disability retirement claim will automatically succeed. In a setting analogous to the present case, the Board held that if a disabled employee who is absent from work requests to return with altered duties or working conditions, and if there was a reasonable accommodation available that the agency was bound by the Rehabilitation Act to offer but did not, the employee's absence becomes a constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">Cf. Schultz v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 78 MSPR 159, 163 (1998). An employee who applies for disability retirement without ever requesting altered duties or working conditions, or without indicating to the agency that he would like to continue working if possible, but who later claims in litigation that his disability retirement constituted a constructive removal because the agency failed to accommodate his condition, generally should not prevail in such an appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, in <span class="Italic">Nordhoff</span>, the appellant's own evidence showed that he was totally disabled from any employment on the date of his separation by disability retirement. 78 MSPR at 91-92. Thus, the Board found that Mr. Nordhoff's disability retirement could not have been a constructive removal, regardless of whether he might have been able to work with accommodation on an earlier date. However, <span class="Italic">Nordhoff</span> was not intended to hold that the only relevant date is the date of separation. If, for example, an employee's medical condition could have been accommodated by reassignment to a position that was vacant one month before the effective date of his disability retirement, then the fact that by the time of the disabled employee's separation the position had been filled by someone else would not automatically foreclose a constructive removal claim. The disabled employee might be able to show (1) that he requested altered duties or working conditions, or indicated to the agency that he would like to continue working, and (2) that the agency should have reassigned him to the vacant position instead of the other employee, thereby allowing the disabled employee to continue working.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning back to the present case, the appellant has argued throughout <span id="Page_2033"></span>these proceedings that the agency could have accommodated him in a non-supervisory EAS position. In support of his argument the appellant has submitted a list of vacant non-supervisory EAS positions during the period from November 1, 1996 to June, 1997. However, as discussed above, the relevant time period in this involuntary disability retirement appeal is the period from the date the appellant indicated to the agency that he desired to continue working but that he had medical limitations (if he so indicated to the agency), and the date that he was separated, October 17, 1997. Moreover, since the appellant held the PS-4 Mailhandler position at the time of his separation, it is that position from which he bears the burden of showing an available accommodation. If the appellant was unable to perform his PS-4 Mailhandler duties, the agency was not required to consider reassigning him to a higher-graded EAS position as an accommodation<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(g) (an agency must consider reassigning a disabled employee to a vacant position "at the same grade or level," or in the absence of that, a vacant position "at the highest available grade or level below the employee's current grade or level") (emphasis supplied).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we must remand this appeal to the regional office to afford the appellant an adequate opportunity to establish jurisdiction, under the proper standard, over his alleged involuntary disability retirement. <span class="Italic">See Handy</span>, 82 MSPR 683 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5, 7; <span class="Italic">Rule v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 81 MSPR 282 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-5 (1999).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rule v. VA</span>, 85 MSPR 388 (2000) (following an earlier remand, <span class="Italic">Rule v. VA</span>, 81 MSPR 282 (1999), supra), also emphasized that, assuming the existence of an available position within the appellant's qualifications (including a possible downgrading), an appellant who challenges a disability retirement as involuntary must establish that he informed the agency that he wished to continue working despite his medical limitations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant argues that the administrative judge disregarded testimony that established that the appellant was capable of performing the essential functions of a GS-04 position located in the Medical Center's police monitoring room. At the hearing, Paul Abt, the former director of the Medical Center, testified that the duties of this position required the incumbent to sit in a chair and watch a police monitor. Dr. Zchiesche testified that these positions required sedentary work and were less stressful than the appellant's position. Dr. Zchiesche also implied that if she had known one of these positions was available, she would have looked at the position very carefully and probably would have recommended that the appellant should have been given a try at one of these sedentary jobs in a protected environment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Carol Smith, an employee relations assistant for the agency, testified concerning the agency's determination that it could not reassign the appellant. She stated that the medical examination provided that the appellant could have no stress or physical exertion, and that he could not work closely with others. Smith testified that there were no vacancies at the appellant's same grade and level, and that she did not look into lower-graded positions. When the appellant's attorney asked her specifically about the police monitoring positions, she stated that she did not consider these positions for the appellant because they were GS-04 positions. During redirect testimony, Smith testified that she did not know if any of these positions was available at the time of the appellant's retirement. The appellant testified, however, that the agency offered one of these positions to another employee 4 days after he received the notice of proposed removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision, the administrative judge stated, "[a]lthough the appellant pointed to several positions that the agency could have accommodated him in at the time of his retirement, he did not show that, number one, these positions were indeed vacant at the time he retired, or that they were at the same grade and level." The administrative judge also stated that "the testimony indicates that the only positions that he suggested he could have been able to perform...were not at the same grade or level." Thus, it appears that the administrative judge applied the <span class="Italic">Nordhoff</span> standard by requiring the appellant to prove that the agency could have accommodated him in a position at his same grade or level at the time he retired.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "accommodation," however, can have different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. For example, to be eligible for a disability retirement annuity under the CSRS, an employee must have completed 5 years of civilian service and must be unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in his or her position and must not be qualified for reassignment to a vacant position in the agency at the same grade or level in which he or she could render useful and efficient service. 5 USC &#x00A7; 8337(a); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.1203(a). OPM's implementing regulations further require that the disabling medical condition be expected to continue for at least 1 year from the date the application is filed and that the employing agency be unable to accommodate the disabling medical condition in the appellant's former position or in an existing vacant position. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.1203(a). Thus, for the purposes of determining an employee's eligibility for a disability retirement annuity, the term "accommodation" only refers to vacant positions at the employee's same grade or level. <span class="Italic">See</span> CSRS and FERS Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices, &#x00A7; 6OA2.1-5 (Aug. 15, 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the term is not so limited in the context of an agency's obligations under the Rehabilitation Act, 29 USC &#x00A7; 791 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations that implement the Rehabilitation Act require federal agencies to make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an employee who is a qualified individual with handicaps unless the agency can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operations of its programs. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(c)(1). If the employee cannot be reasonably accommodated in his position, the EEOC regulations require federal agencies to offer to reassign the employee to a funded vacant position located in the same commuting area and serviced by the same appointing authority, and at the same grade or level, the essential functions of which the employee would be able to perform with reasonable accommodation if necessary. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(g). If a position is not available at the employee's same grade or level, an agency must offer to reassign the employee to a vacant position at the highest available grade or level below the employee's current grade or level. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The regulations provide, however, that the availability of such a vacancy below the employee's current grade or level does not affect the employee's entitlement to disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, for the purposes of determining an agency's obligations regarding reassignment under the Rehabilitation Act, the term "accommodation" refers to positions that are at the employee's same grade and level, and, if no such positions are available, it includes positions below the employee's current grade or level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have reopened this appeal also to clarify the meaning of the term "accommodation" that should be used when applying the <span class="Italic">Nordhoff</span> standard in cases in which an appellant alleges that a disability retirement was involuntary. When the Board determines whether it has jurisdiction over a presumptively voluntary act such as a retirement or a resignation, the decisive factor is whether the appellant was effectively deprived of free choice in the matter. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g., Koury v. Department of Defense,</span> 84 MSPR 219, 226 &#x00B6; 10 (1999) ("The voluntariness of a resignation is determined based on whether the totality of the circumstances supports the conclusion that the employee was effectively deprived of free choice in the matter."); <span class="Italic">Henriksen v. Department of Energy</span>, 79 MSPR 213, 216 &#x00B6; 7 (1998). In the disability retirement context, an employee may choose to continue to work despite the fact that he is eligible for a disability retirement annuity. This situation occurs where the agency cannot accommodate the employee in a position at the same grade or level, but it can accommodate him by reassigning him to a lower-graded position. Because the availability of an accommodation at a lower-graded position does not affect the employee's entitlement to a disability retirement, the employee can choose to accept the reassignment or to retire with a disability retirement annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 8337(a); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.1203(a); 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(g). Thus, an appellant can establish that the agency deprived him of free choice with respect to disability retirement if he can prove that there was an accommodation available on the date of his separation, either at <span class="Italic">or</span> <span class="Italic">below</span> his grade or level, that would have allowed him to continue his employment<span class="Italic">. Nordhoff,</span> 78 MSPR at 91. To the extent that the administrative judge in this case suggested that the accommodation inquiry should be limited to vacant positions at the appellant's same grade or level, he erred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, any error the administrative judge may have committed with respect to the accommodation issue was harmless. <span class="Italic">Panter v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 22 MSPR 281, 282 (1984) (an adjudicatory error that is not prejudicial to a party's substantive rights provides no basis for reversal of an initial decision). The existence of a position in which the agency may reasonably accommodate an employee, standing alone, does not render an employee's decision to retire involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Atkins v. Department of</span> Commerce, 81 MSPR 246, 251, 1 10 (1999). Rather, the employee must also establish that he indicated to the agency that he wished to continue working despite his medical limitations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lorenz v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 84 MSPR 670, 674 &#x00B6; 8 (2000). If the appellant indicated that he wished to continue working, the relevant time period for the accommodation inquiry would run from that date through the date of the appellant's separation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 675 &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While Dr. Zchiesche's testimony suggested that the agency could have reasonably accommodated the appellant's medical condition in one of the police monitoring positions, there is no evidence to establish that the appellant indicated that he wished to continue working despite his medical limitations. The application for increased compensation based on unemployability that the appellant filed with the agency indicated that the appellant expected to receive disability retirement benefits. The appellant applied for a disability retirement annuity shortly after he received the notice of proposed removal. Although the agency provided the appellant the opportunity to reply to his proposed removal both orally and in writing, the appellant never indicated that he wished to continue <span id="Page_2034"></span>working. It appears that the appellant did not file a written reply, and a summary of the appellant's oral reply indicated that the appellant did not want to address the proposed removal; instead, he merely requested that the agency extend his authorized absence until his retirement application was approved. Because the appellant did not establish that he indicated to the agency that he wished to continue working despite his medical limitations, the appellant failed to establish that his disability retirement was involuntary. Therefore, the appellant failed to establish Board jurisdiction over his appeal, and the administrative judge properly dismissed the appellant's appeal for lack of jurisdiction....</p>

VA</span>, 89 MSPR 260, 264 &#x00B6; 6 (2001) (employee must have indicated to the agency that he wished to continue working despite medical limitations; the relevant time period for an accommodation inquiry then runs from the date of the employee's expression of interest through the date of his separation). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">West v. Smithsonian Inst.</span>, 38 Fed. Appx. 609, 611 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">To demonstrate a failure of accommodation through assignment to a different position, the appellant will either have to show that another similarly situated employee was treated more favorably or that a position was available at the time of the employee's disability, <span class="Italic">Estate of Pariseau v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> SF-0752-09-0278-B-2 (NP 9/16/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an appeal of an alleged involuntary disability retirement, the appellant must show, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that there was an accommodation available that would have allowed him to continue his employment and that the agency improperly failed to provide that accommodation to him. <span class="Italic">Nordhoff v. Department of the Navy</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 88, 91 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 185 F.3d 886 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (Table). If accommodation was impossible, then the appellant's disability retirement was not a constructive removal. Other theories of involuntariness, e.g., intolerable working conditions, cannot lead to a different conclusion because the essence of all claims of involuntary retirement is that the employee had a choice between retiring or continuing to work, but was forced to choose retirement by improper acts of the agency. <span class="Italic">Okleson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 415, &#x00B6; 7 (2001). An employee who is unable to work because of a medical condition that cannot be accommodated has no such choice in the first instance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant claims that Mr. Franklin's testimony concerning Mr. Whitecotton's light-duty assignment is evidence of discrimination, there is simply no basis to support such a conclusion. Here, there is no evidence that there was an accommodation available within the appellant's medical restrictions that would have allowed him to continue his employment. The appellant's medical restrictions precluded him from standing for more than 1 hour per day. As the administrative judge properly addressed in the remand initial decision, the agency performed searches in 2007 in the appellant's work component and base-wide for vacant, funded positions for which the appellant was qualified which also met his medical restrictions. The agency was unable to find any available positions within the appellant's qualifications and medical restrictions. This included a Tool and Parts Attendant ("Tool Crib") position that requires reaching, lifting heavy boxes, and more than 1 hour of standing per day. During the hearing, the appellant's witness Terry L. Ayres, who was the President of the American Federation of Government Employees Local, testified that he was aware of the appellant's medical limitations that he could stand for no more than 1 hour per day and that he could not sit for very long as well. Lifting and standing were the appellant's biggest obstacles. He further testified the appellant would have been unable to perform the duties of a Tool Crib position because of his limitations as incumbents of those positions have to carry a lot of heavy things and there is an awful lot of standing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the circumstances surrounding Mr. Whitecotton's accommodation are not relevant to this appeal as Mr. Whitecotton was accommodated in 2005 while the appellant's medical conditions required accommodation in 2007. The appellant requested an accommodation in approximately December 2006, and he retired effective December 7, 2007. Thus, the appellant must demonstrate that there was a reasonable accommodation available in 2007 and not during 2005. <span class="Italic">See Rule v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 388, &#x00B6; 14 (2000) (the time period relevant for determining whether an appellant could have been accommodated begins on the date he requested accommodation and extends to the date of his separation); <span class="Italic">see also Nordhoff</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 91-92 (because the effective date of the appellant's disability retirement was October 23, 1991, his retirement cannot be considered to be a constructive removal if he was unable to render useful and efficient service at that time, regardless of whether he was able to do so during some earlier period of time).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the appellant indicates that Mr. Whitecotton became blind because of diabetes, which is a very different medical restriction than the appellant's. It is unclear whether Mr. Whitecotton was accommodated by being reassigned to another position or whether he was assigned a number of light-duty tasks to accommodate his medical restrictions. In any event, the agency was not obliged to accommodate the appellant by permanently assigning him to light-duty tasks that do not constitute a complete and separate position. <span class="Italic">See McFadden v. Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 18, &#x00B6; 20 (1999). For the same reason, the appellant was not entitled to reassignment to a temporary limited- or light-duty position that was not within his medical restrictions because an agency need not reassign an employee to a position that is not within his restrictions. <span class="Italic">See Baker v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 680, 698 (1996).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Browning v. USPS,</span> DA-0752-10-0305-I-1 (NP 2/22/2011), if the employee seeks accommodation he must reasonably pursue that request before separating from employment and asserting that the retirement was involuntary because of intolerable working conditions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues in his petition for review that the agency created intolerable working conditions when it denied his request to return to work on December 4, 2008, with a temporary reduction in his hours. Although Ragland denied the request, he subsequently referred the issue to the District Reasonable Accommodation Committee (DRAC). As the administrative judge stated, the appellant's decision to retire prevented DRAC from addressing his request to return to work. Ragland's initial determination is not sufficient to establish that the agency coerced the appellant's retirement or that a reasonable employee in his position would have found the situation so oppressive that he was compelled to retire. Rather, a realistic alternative would have been for the appellant to pursue the reasonable accommodation process before DRAC. Therefore, we find that the administrative judge properly held that the appellant did not show that the agency created intolerable working conditions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's request to return to work with temporarily less than full-time hours was a request for reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Paris v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 17 (2006) (an employee need only let his employer know in general terms that he needs accommodation for a medical condition). The agency was therefore required to undertake an interactive process to determine an appropriate accommodation. <span class="Italic">Paris,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 17; 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(3). The appellant was also required to cooperate in the interactive process. <span class="Italic">Collins v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 332, &#x00B6; 11 (2005) (both parties have an obligation to work in good faith to search for an appropriate accommodation). Ragland arguably should have undertaken this process when he first received the appellant's request to return to work with temporarily limited hours. However, his delay in referring the matter to DRAC was minimal. <span class="Italic">See EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, Notice No. 915.002, at 20 n.38 (revised Oct. 17, 2002) (the length of the delay in providing reasonable accommodation is one factor to consider in determining whether a delay constitutes denial of such accommodation). Moreover, the appellant's own conduct ultimately short-circuited the reasonable accommodation process.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Mengine v. USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 123, 127-29 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-12 (1999), the appellant failed to show that a temporary position constituted an accommodation that should have been continued in lieu of the disability retirement resulting from his inability to continue in his permanent job:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only accommodation that the appellant has ever raised in this appeal was a continuation of his light-duty work in collections. It is well established that an agency is not obligated to accommodate a disabled employee by permanently assigning him to light-duty tasks when those tasks do not comprise a complete and separate position<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Robinson v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 77 MSPR 486, 492 (1998); <span class="Italic">O'Connell v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 69 MSPR 438, 444 (1996); <span class="Italic">Warren v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 60 MSPR 97, 100 (1993). The fact that an employee performing light-duty tasks has sufficient work to engage him full time does not establish that the employee is performing the duties of a complete and separate position. <span class="Italic">Warren</span>, 60 MSPR at 100.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency submitted documentary evidence and sworn statements that the light-duty tasks in collections that the appellant performed were merely a temporary accommodation, not a complete and separate position....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In the instant appeal, the appellant has failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the light-duty tasks he performed in collections constituted a complete and separate position, and he has not articulated any other accommodation. He has thus failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that there was an accommodation available that would have allowed him to continue his employment. Absent such an allegation, there is no basis for a jurisdictional hearing.</p>

U.S. Postal Service,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 123, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-12 (1999); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Gometz v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 115, 123 (1995) (finding the appellant qualified for disability retirement because the agency was unable to accommodate her beyond temporary accommodations, which is not a sufficient accommodation of a disability).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board declined to find involuntary the removal of an individual for physical inability to perform his position in <span class="Italic">Taber v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 112 MSPR 124, 129-31 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-15, 2009 MSPB 156 (2009), noting that "the agency was not required to assign him to limited duties that do not comprise a complete and separate position":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A decision to retire is presumed to be a voluntary act outside the Board's jurisdiction, and the appellant bears the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that his retirement was involuntary and therefore tantamount to a forced removal. <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1329-30 (Fed. Cir. 2006). When an appellant raises allegations of discrimination in connection with an involuntariness claim, evidence of discrimination may be considered only in terms of the standard for voluntariness. <span class="Italic">Markon v. Department of State</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 574, 578 (1996). Thus, in an involuntary retirement or resignation appeal, evidence of discrimination goes to the ultimate question of coercion, i.e., whether under all of the circumstances working conditions were made so difficult by the agency, that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign or retire. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, where, as here, the appellant's involuntariness claim is based solely on his objections to the agency's finding that he was unable to perform the duties of his job, to its decision to remove him for that reason, and to its failure to accommodate his medical conditions, <span class="Italic">"</span>if the agency is able to show that it properly decided to remove the appellant based on physical inability to perform, then he could not establish that his retirement was involuntary." <span class="Italic">See Scalese,</span> 68 M.S.P.R. at 249. Because, as discussed below, we find no error in the administrative judge's determination that the agency properly decided to remove the appellant based on physical inability to perform, the appellant cannot establish that his retirement was involuntary, and the Board therefore lacks jurisdiction over his constructive removal appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not alleged error in the administrative judge's finding that his serious medical conditions preclude him from performing the essential functions of the position of Sheet Metal Mechanic, and we see none. Indeed, the appellant stated below that "[t]here is of course no denying that I was unable to perform the job of a Sheet Metal Mechanic...." Rather, the appellant argues, as he did below, that he can perform the duties of a Tool and Parts Attendant as those duties were modified to accommodate his medical restrictions, and that the agency was required to continue to assign him to perform those duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The undisputed documentary evidence, however, establishes that the Tool and Parts Attendant position was not a vacant, funded position the agency recruited to fill on a full-time, permanent basis; rather, the appellant was detailed to the position on a temporary basis only. Although the appellant might be able to perform the Tool and Parts Attendant duties he had previously been assigned, the agency was not required to assign him to limited duties that do not comprise a complete and separate position. <span class="Italic">See Green v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 661, 668 (1991). Further, the fact that an agency may have permitted an individual not to perform an essential function of his position for a period of time, as in this case, does not mean that it is required by law to do so. This would effectively entail creation of a new position for the appellant, which an agency is not required to do to accommodate an employee's medical restrictions. <span class="Italic">See Collins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 332, &#x00B6; 13 (2005). Finally, as the administrative judge noted, the appellant identified no other positions for which he was qualified and to which he might be assigned. [<span class="Italic">S]ee Collins</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 332, &#x00B6; 13 (the employee has the burden of showing that he can perform the essential functions of a vacant position).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the administrative judge correctly found that the agency properly decided to remove the appellant based on physical inability to perform the essential functions of the position of Sheet Metal Mechanic. The appellant cannot establish that his retirement was involuntary, therefore, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over his appeal. <span class="Italic">See Garcia</span> 437 F.3d at 1329-30; <span class="Italic">Scalese,</span> 68 M.S.P.R. at 249.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Morris v. NASA</span>, AT-0752-15-0015-I-1 (NP 8/19/2015) ("He has not alleged that he requested any accommodation from the agency that would allow him to continue in his position of record; rather, he sought relocation away from his existing chain of command. We conclude that the appellant has not alleged facts that could establish that the agency was remiss in any obligation related to accommodating his medical condition. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of Defense</span>, 397 F. App'x 649, 653 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP) ('[A] request for wholesale reassignment is different in nature from a request for accommodation that would allow an employee to continue her current employment.').").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pickens v. SSA</span>, 88 MSPR 525, 528-31 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-14 (2001), required a hearing for an employee who claimed her retirement was coerced by both disability discrimination and intolerable working conditions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argued below and reasserts on PFR that the agency's actions and her retirement were the result of disability discrimination. When allegations of discrimination and reprisal are alleged in connection with a determination of voluntariness, such evidence of discrimination or retaliation may only be addressed insofar as it relates to the issue of voluntariness and not whether the evidence would establish discrimination or reprisal as an affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">See Conover v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the</span> Army, 78 MSPR 605, 612 (1998). Thus, evidence of discrimination or reprisal goes to the ultimate question of coercion<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this instance, the appellant has raised a nonfrivolous allegation of disability discrimination sufficient to warrant a jurisdictional hearing. The elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination include a showing that the appellant is a qualified disabled person, that the action appealed was based on her disability, and, to the extent possible, an articulation of a reasonable accommodation under which the appellant believes that she could perform the essential duties of her position or of a vacant position to which she could be reassigned. <span class="Italic">Conover</span>, 78 MSPR at 611. Ultimately, the appellant must prove that she is a qualified person with disabilities, i.e., a disabled individual who can perform the essential duties of her position with or without reasonable accommodation, without endangering the health and/or safety of herself and/or others. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a); <span class="Italic">Conover</span>, 78 MSPR at 611. However, to meet her burden of proof with respect to establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the appellant need merely articulate a <span class="Italic">reasonable accommoda</span>tion under which she believes she could perform the essential duties of her position or of a vacant position to which she could be reassigned<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record evidence shows that the appellant has numerous chronic medical problems, such as migraine headaches, episodic diarrhea from irritable bowel syndrome, global gastric dysmotility, colon spasms, biliary tract disease, hypertension, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and acute stress disorder. Her primary physician, Dr. Jeffrey Halpern, stated in a Certification of Health Care Provider that the appellant's migraine headaches are episodic and occasionally lead to incapacity. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Robert Williams, stated in an attachment to the appellant's request for accommodation, that the appellant's medical conditions are aggravated by the intensity of the symptoms of her mental disorders, and that her medical conditions are chronic and unpredictably episodic. Dr. Williams stated further that, with reasonable accommodations, i.e., adequate time off to attend medical, psychiatric, and psychotherapy appointments, she should be able to perform the duties of her position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Further, the appellant clearly alleged that she was capable of performing the duties of her position when she was present at the work site and that she only submitted applications for both disability retirement and an immediate retirement because the agency had proposed her removal. She also asserted that allowing her to work at home when her medical conditions prevented her from traveling to the work site or reassigning her to a similar position in another agency office closer to her home would constitute reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that the agency proposed the appellant's removal based on her medically-related absences. However, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has rejected the argument that regular attendance is an essential element of any position. <span class="Italic">McNeil v. Runyon</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945685, 1998 WL 452079 (July 27, 1998). Instead, the EEOC places the burden on the agency to show that providing reasonable accommodation by excusing the absences related to the appellant's disability would cause an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, even though the appellant's request for reasonable accommodation was submitted on September 20, 1999, and the final date for accepting early-out retirement was September 25, 1999, the agency did not promptly consider the appellant's accommodation request. Rather, it appears that the agency granted the appellant's request for an immediate retirement on September 25, and then informed her that her request for accommodation was mooted by her retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of the foregoing, we find that the appellant has raised a nonfrivolous allegation that she is a qualified disabled person, and that the proposed removal was based on absences related to a disability or disabilities. Therefore, the appellant is entitled to a hearing because she raised a nonfrivolous allegation of fact that, if proven, would establish that her retirement was involuntary on the basis of disability discrimination. <span class="Italic">Conover</span>, 78 MSPR at 611-12. Thus, we find it necessary to remand this appeal to the Seattle Field Office for further adjudication.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also alleged that the proposed removal action was in reprisal for prior EEO activity and making whistleblowing disclosures concerning the proposing and deciding officials. She claimed that the pattern of reprisal surrounding the issuance of the notice of proposed <span id="Page_2036"></span>removal created a hostile work environment that caused her to retire, in effect, resulting in a constructive discharge. In cases where the appellant has alleged that intolerable working conditions led to her retirement, the Board has held that the appropriate test for involuntariness is "whether under all of the circumstances working conditions were made so difficult by the agency that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign [or retire]." <span class="Italic">McCray v. Department of the Navy</span>, 80 MSPR 154 &#x00B6; 8 (1998) (quoting <span class="Italic">Heining v. General Services Administration</span>, 68 MSPR 513, 520 (1995)). Among the appellant's allegations of such reprisal are the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The agency refused to recognize the provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act and proposed her removal based on absences covered under it;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">On the day that she received the notice of proposed removal, her supervisor gave her a total of 3 hours to pack her belongings and she was escorted from the premises;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Her supervisor notified all employees that she was going to be on indefinite leave and that she was not to obtain access into the building;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Her supervisor then changed the security access codes for entry into the workplace and notified the employees that she was not to obtain the new security code;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The appellant requested that the agency provide her with a fitness-for-duty examination to determine whether she could perform the essential functions of her position, with or without accommodation, but her request was denied;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The agency failed to act on her request for reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the actions described above caused her additional mental stress and exacerbated her physical conditions. She also contends that she was forced to retire on September 25, the final date for taking an early-out retirement, because it was the only way she could ensure that she could maintain her medical insurance coverage.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish entitlement to a jurisdictional hearing, an appellant need not allege facts which, if proven, definitely would establish that the resignation was involuntary; she need only allege facts, which if proven could establish such a claim. <span class="Italic">McCray</span>, 80 MSPR 154 &#x00B6; 11. Here, we find that the facts alleged by the appellant meet the standard and therefore are sufficient to entitle her to a jurisdictional hearing. On remand, the AJ should also consider the appellant's allegations of reprisal to determine whether, under the particular circumstances, a reasonable person would have felt compelled to retire and, in doing so, the AJ should consider the appellant's allegations of disability discrimination as a factor.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Remanded for hearing was an appeal dismissed by the AJ based on agency evidence challenging the appellant's evidence relating to accommodative requirements before the retirement. The appeal should not have been disposed of on paperwork submissions; the appellant was to have a hearing, <span class="Italic">Carey v. DHHS</span>, 112 MSPR 106, 109 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8, 2009 MSPB 154 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant submitted an affidavit in which she alleged that her retirement was involuntary because the agency denied her request for an accommodation (telecommuting) that, according to her doctors, would have permitted her to continue to work despite her allergies, vertigo, and chemical sensitivity. This suffices as a nonfrivolous allegation of the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1324 (failure to renovate the appellant's workspace to accommodate her medical condition may have forced her to accept a demotion).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Instead of providing the appellant an opportunity for a hearing, the AJ went on to assess the adequacy of the agency's alternative accommodation efforts, opined that she was not disabled, and suggested that she had a different motive for retiring. This was error because an AJ may not weigh evidence or resolve conflicting assertions regarding disputed facts material to the question of jurisdiction without affording the appellant the opportunity for a hearing. <span class="Italic">Ferdon</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 329-30.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An allegedly involuntary retirement will not be reversed if the appellant did not allow the accommodative process to function, <span class="Italic">Houser v. DHS,</span> NY-0752-14-0224-I-2 (NP 2/19/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to await the outcome of the reasonable accommodation process and, therefore, cannot establish that he retired involuntarily. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Collins v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 332, &#x00B6; 11 (2005) (explaining that both the employee and the agency have an obligation to assist in the search for an appropriate accommodation and to act in good faith in doing so). The appellant acknowledges that the agency informed him, on or about May 20, 2012, of its intention to conduct a new job search. He apparently surmised, based on the agency's previous alleged delay in providing him with an accommodation, that the agency would not perform this search promptly and that he would have to take "months of unpaid leave" in the meantime because he had exhausted all of his earned leave. He thus chose to retire just 2 weeks later to ensure that he would continue to receive some income. The appellant's speculation about the length of time it would take the agency to identify a position to which he could be reassigned did not relieve him of the obligation to cooperate in the interactive process. <span class="Italic">See Collins,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 332, &#x00B6; 11 (finding that the appellant's disability retirement was not involuntary because, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, he failed to act on the agency's suggestion to apply for positions for which he was physically qualified and his alleged reasonable belief that he would not be selected did not relieve him of the obligation to participate in the interactive process).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cannon v. Dept. of Interior,</span> DC-0752-15-0181-I-1 n.4 (NP 3/10/2016) ("Notably, she does not deny that she failed to request reconsideration of the agency's decision on her reasonable accommodation request and does not allege or establish that the alternative accommodations the agency offered were ineffective. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v.
