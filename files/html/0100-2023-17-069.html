<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-67"><span class="space">f.</span> Bifurcated Cases; Issues of Jurisdiction or Arbitrability; Jurisdictional Defect</h5>
<p class="noindent">It is not unusual for an arbitrator to bifurcate a ruling: questions of arbitrability are resolved, then the arbitrable disputes are resolved on the merits. Initially FLRA did not decide under what circumstances it would review an agency's objections to an arbitrability determination, but FLRA did suggest that if both sets of issues were being resolved in a single proceeding under circumstances involving an agency's attempt to secure review of arbitrability determinations at the same time the agency was involved in a hearing on the merits, FLRA would not consider agency exceptions until all issues in the arbitration were resolved by the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">DMA, Hydrographic/Topographic Ctr., Providence Field Office and AFGE Local 1884</span>, 4 FLRA 66, 66-67 (1980). FLRA then decided that if an arbitrator splits a case up into a determination of arbitrability and a determination on the merits, finding that the case is arbitrable, that determination is a threshold ruling and not a final award. No exceptions lie to that arbitrability ruling, treated by FLRA as interlocutory unless there are exceptional circumstances. <span class="Italic">Oakland Army Base and AFGE Local 1157</span>, 16 FLRA 829, 830 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Council of EEOC Locals, Local 216 and EEOC</span>, 41 FLRA 70, 72 (1991) (when arbitrator decided as arbitrability issue whether grievance was barred by prior ULP charge, retaining jurisdiction over the merits of the case, arbitrability ruling was interlocutory).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA will not determine that an arbitration award is defective on challenge to an arbitrability determination when an arbitrator rules that there is jurisdiction to determine whether there is a contract violation, reserving for a determination on the merits whether the union's complaint involves some management right beyond the authority of the arbitrator to address or redress. <span class="Italic">IRS, Chicago Dist. Office and NTEU Chap. 10</span>, 4 FLRA 681, 683-84 (1980); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">SSA Field Operations, New York Region and AFGE Local 3369</span>, 33 FLRA 834, 835 (1988) ("In this case, it is clear that the Arbitrator has not yet rendered a final award on this dispute. The record shows that the Arbitrator made a determination on the arbitrability of the grievance, while postponing a hearing on the merits until after he issued the interim award. No final disposition or remedy in the dispute has been made. Thus, the Union's exceptions are interlocutory and the facts and circumstances do not warrant review of the exceptions at this time"). An arbitrator's jurisdictional ruling on a motion for summary judgment that leaves the parties in a position of going to a hearing on other aspects of the case is interlocutory and will not support exceptions. <span class="Italic">Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 14 FLRA 448, 449 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent">With the cautionary note that in 2022 FLRA sharply limited the availability of exceptions to interlocutory awards to situations involving clear statutory jurisdictional issues, <span class="Italic">Army Materiel Command, Redstone Arsenal and NFFE Local 1332</span>, 73 FLRA 356, 356-62 (2022) (Member Kiko dissenting), <span class="Italic">supra,</span> FLRA's approach started to change as to the reviewability through exceptions of awards on issues of arbitrability. In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Los Angeles Dist. and NTEU, Los Angeles Joint Council</span>, 34 FLRA 1161, 1163-64 (1990), the arbitrator determined a case was arbitrable after there was a challenge to the bargaining unit status of the employee. FLRA determined in earlier case law that arbitrators could not determine unit questions; those issues were only for FLRA. After the arbitrator determined the unit question as an issue of arbitrability, the agency filed exceptions. FLRA entertained them, deciding that fundamental questions of jurisdiction (not arbitrability) may be raised following an initial award addressing the jurisdictional question:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e are of the view that the circumstances of this case warrant consideration of the Activity's exception at this stage of the proceedings. Section 2429.11 reflects the judicial policy of discouraging fragmentary appeals of the same case. The policy is not without exceptions, however. For example, the judicial procedure for the U.S. courts of appeals permits a departure from this policy for certain cases that involve a controlling question of law and where an immediate appeal may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1292(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, when an arbitrator finds, prior to ruling on the merits, that a matter is grievable and arbitrable and a party files an exception claiming that the arbitrator lacks jurisdiction because the matter is not grievable under the Statute, it does not serve the purposes and policies of the Statute to refuse to resolve that question as an interlocutory matter. Similar to cases immediately appealable in the Federal courts, these cases raise a controlling question of jurisdiction, the immediate resolution of which may advance the case's ultimate resolution. Accordingly, we conclude that the circumstances of this case warrant resolving the Activity's exception at this time.</p>
<p class="noindent">The exception established by <span class="Italic">IRS</span> was narrowed in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs and NFFE Local 341</span>, 55 FLRA 1230, 1231-32 (2000), involving a challenge to the jurisdiction of an arbitrator who resolved a grievance concerning a retroactive temporary promotion to a position that the agency alleged to FLRA constituted a nonunit, supervisory position. An interlocutory appeal could be taken if the award presented a "plausible jurisdictional defect" (the manner that FLRA will evaluate the clarity and strength of a jurisdictional challenge likely changed under <span class="Italic">Army Materiel Command, Redstone Arsenal and NFFE Local 1332</span>, <span class="blue">73 FLRA 356</span> (2022), <span class="Italic">supra</span>), although FLRA appeared to decide that before it would entertain the interlocutory appeal, the record before the arbitrator had to clearly present the issue of jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the merits, the Arbitrator ruled that the Agency violated the collective bargaining agreement when it failed to pay the grievant at a higher rate of pay while he was assigned the duties of the irrigation systems manager. However, the Arbitrator found insufficient guidance in the record to determine the appropriate remedy. As a result, he ordered the parties to negotiate an appropriate remedy, but retained jurisdiction for the purpose of determining a remedy if the parties were unable to agree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority ordered the Agency to show cause why its exceptions should not be dismissed because they were interlocutory.&#x2003;The Authority directed the Agency to show that the award completely resolved all submitted issues or that circumstances exist warranting resolution of the interlocutory exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response, the Agency concedes that all of its exceptions are interlocutory. However, the Agency argues that circumstances exist under <span class="Italic">U.S. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Los Angeles</span> <span class="Italic">District and National Treasury Employees Union, Los</span> <span class="Italic">Angeles Joint Council, </span>34 FLRA 1161 (1990) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>), warranting resolution of its contrary-to-law exceptions at this stage of the proceeding. The Agency asserts that as in <span class="Italic">IRS, </span>the Arbitrator resolved a question of bargaining-unit status, which warrants resolving its interlocutory exception. The Agency admits that the Arbitrator's award is vague, but asserts that the Arbitrator stated that the grievance covered the grievant's work as a unit employee from which it must be inferred that the Arbitrator determined that the grievant was a unit employee. The Agency further claims that its exception, which contends that the Arbitrator made a classification determination, also warrants resolution at this stage of the proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">V.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The Authority's Regulations Generally Preclude Interlocutory Appeals and the Agency's Exceptions are Interlocutory</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2429.11 of the Authority's Regulations provides that ordinarily the Authority will not consider interlocutory appeals. In an arbitration case, this means that the Authority ordinarily will not consider exceptions to an arbitrator's award until the arbitrator has issued a final decision completely determining all issues submitted to arbitration. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., IRS, </span>34 FLRA at 1163. In this case, the Arbitrator ordered the parties to negotiate an appropriate remedy and retained jurisdiction for the purpose of determining a remedy if the parties were unable to agree. Consequently, the award is not a final decision, and the Agency properly concedes that all of its exceptions are interlocutory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The Agency Fails to Establish Extraordinary Circumstances Warranting Review</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">IRS, </span>the Authority held that extraordinary circumstances would exist to immediately resolve an interlocutory exception claiming that an arbitrator lacked jurisdiction because the matter was not grievable under the Statute. The Authority based this holding on a conclusion that it would not serve the purposes and policies of the Statute to refuse to resolve that controlling question of jurisdiction as an interlocutory matter when its immediate resolution could advance the ultimate resolution of the case. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 1164.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The exceptions presented in this case convince us that the broad holding of <span class="Italic">IRS, </span>under which any jurisdictional issue that would control the outcome of the case warrants interlocutory review, should be modified. This standard, as described in <span class="Italic">IRS, </span>permits the interlocutory review of a case to be triggered by the mere assertion of a controlling jurisdictional issue by a party. In our view, however, interlocutory review should be reserved for those extraordinary situations where it is necessary. In particular, such review should only be undertaken where the arguments challenging an award in fact present a plausible jurisdictional defect, the resolution of which will advance the ultimate disposition of the case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the award at issue, the Arbitrator was not asked to, and did not, determine the bargaining-unit status of a position--a matter that would have been outside his jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. See SBA, </span>32 FLRA at 852. The Arbitrator simply observed that the case concerned the grievant's "<span class="Italic">work as a bargaining unit member</span>." Rather than making a bargaining-unit determination, this statement of fact simply reflected the uncontested record presented to the Arbitrator-that the grievant's former position, from which he had been promoted several days prior to filing the <span id="page_1791"></span>grievance, was in the bargaining unit. Any "determination" that this position was in the bargaining unit was made before the grievance was filed, and not by the Arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the award does not provide any support for the Agency's claim that the Arbitrator made a classification determination in violation of section 7121(c)(5). The Authority has uniformly and repeatedly held that grievances and arbitration awards over whether a grievant is entitled to a temporary promotion for performing the duties of a higher-graded position do not concern the classification of any position within the meaning of section 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Social Security</span> <span class="Italic">Administration, Office of Hearings and Appeals,</span> <span class="Italic">Mobile, Alabama and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3627, </span>55 FLRA 778, 779-80 (1999); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Warner Robins Air Force Logistics Center, Robins Air Force Base, Georgia and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 987, </span>37 FLRA 155 158-60 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the record does not support a determination that the claims, which establish the basis for interlocutory review, are sufficiently supported, we decline to take the extraordinary action of resolving the Agency's contrary-to-law exceptions at this stage of the proceedings. As noted, the Agency has already conceded that its other exception is interlocutory and does not warrant immediate review. Accordingly, we dismiss the Agency's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA rulings permitting interlocutory review following arbitration determinations on jurisdictional matters in the nature of employees' unit status were broadened, or better defined, in <span class="Italic">DOD NIMA and AFGE Local 1827</span>, 57 FLRA 837, 837 n.2 (2002) (overruled as legal authority in <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 302 and Dept. of Treasury, OCC</span>, 65 FLRA 746, 747-50 (2011) (overruled, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Energy, WAPA and AFGE Local 3824</span>, 71 FLRA 111 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting), <span class="Italic">post</span>)), involving the authority of an arbitrator to consider a grievance relating to NIMA pay-setting practices. After the arbitrator determined that the grievances were arbitrable, and ordered that the grievances be presented for resolution on the merits, FLRA considered, and resolved against the union, the agency's exceptions on the issue of jurisdiction--statutorily exclusive, nonnegotiable discretion of the agency head over pay-setting practices:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's exceptions are interlocutory because the Arbitrator's award is not a final disposition of the issues submitted to him. In this regard, we note that, at the conclusion of his award, the Arbitrator ordered the grievances to be presented to him for resolution on their respective merits. Although the Authority does not generally resolve interlocutory exceptions, we find that the circumstances of the case warrant consideration of the Agency's exceptions at this time because they raise an issue as to whether the Arbitrator lacked jurisdiction as a matter of law. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the</span> <span class="Italic">Interior, Bur. of Indian Affairs, Wapato Irrigation Project, Wapato, Wash</span>., 55 FLRA 1230, 1232 (2000) (interlocutory review is appropriate "where the arguments challenging an award in fact present a plausible jurisdictional defect, the resolution of which will advance the ultimate disposition of the case").</p>
<p class="noindent">As to whether resolution of a jurisdictional issue advances ultimate disposition of the case, <span class="Italic">DHS, CIS and AFGE Local 3923</span>, 65 FLRA 723, 725 (2011), noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to establishing a plausible jurisdictional defect, the excepting party must also establish that interlocutory review will advance the ultimate disposition of the case. <span class="Italic">BIA, </span>55 FLRA at 1232. The Authority has described this situation as one in which resolving the exceptions would end the litigation. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation</span>, 59 FLRA 686, 688 (2004) (<span class="Italic">Bureau of Reclamation</span>); <span class="Italic">IRS, </span>34 FLRA at 1163-64. For example, in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Reclamation, </span>the Authority found that, to the extent the appealing party was contesting the arbitrator's jurisdiction over grievants who had failed to opt in to the grievance, it was uncontested that the arbitrator had jurisdiction over other grievants who had opted in. Consequently, the Authority determined that immediate resolution of the jurisdictional defect would not advance the ultimate disposition of the case because the case would still proceed to arbitration on the merits of the grievance as it pertained to the grievants who had opted in. <span class="Italic">Bureau of Reclamation</span>, 59 FLRA at 687-88.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, ICE does not dispute that further arbitration proceedings may be necessary. Thus, even if we were to agree with ICE that it should be dismissed from further proceedings, ICE does not establish that interlocutory review of its exceptions will advance the ultimate disposition of this case. Moreover, no basis has been established to extend interlocutory review to alleged jurisdictional defects that do not preclude arbitration of the grievance as a matter of law. In this regard, the Authority has emphasized that the exceptional interlocutory review allowed by 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1292 for federal courts of appeal specifically requires that the case must involve a controlling question of law. <span class="Italic">IRS, </span>34 FLRA at 1163-64.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See Dept. of Education, Federal Student Aid and AFGE Council 252,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-61.html">72 FLRA 316</a>, 317 (2021) (Chairman DuBester concurring) (exceptions were interlocutory when the arbitrator's decision to place a case in abeyance depended on the outcome of a pending ULP proceeding that would determine what contract governed the grievance; "resolution of the exceptions could not advance the ultimate disposition of the case by ending litigation over the grievance, which is a requirement for interlocutory review under Authority precedent"); <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Terminal Island and AFGE Local 1680</span>, 66 FLRA 414, 415 (2011) ("Here, there is no dispute that the parties must still resolve the issues raised by the Authority in <span class="Italic">Terminal Island</span>. Those issues included determining which correctional officers actually performed compensable activities, and the amount of time they spent performing those activities. Thus, even assuming that a plausible jurisdictional defect exists, the Agency has not shown that interlocutory review will end the litigation, advancing the ultimate disposition of the case. Therefore, we find that interlocutory review is not warranted, and dismiss the Agency's exceptions, without prejudice.").</p>
<p class="noindent">The jurisdictional basis for interlocutory appeals was explained at greater length in a case involving, in part, a dispute over whether a grievance was barred by earlier resort to ULP procedures. FLRA declined to find that the earlier ULP case was an election of remedies, but in <span class="Italic">Library of Congress and FPO Library of Congress Labor Comm.</span>, 58 FLRA 486, 487-88 (2003), it outlined the analysis it would follow in determining whether arbitrators' determinations of preliminary jurisdictional or arbitrability issues warrant interlocutory consideration of exceptions to those preliminary rulings based on "a plausible jurisdictional defect," "one that, on its face, is a credible claim, the resolution of which will advance the ultimate disposition of the case":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2429.11 of the Authority's Regulations provides: "[T]he Authority...ordinarily will not consider interlocutory appeals." In arbitration cases, this means that ordinarily, the Authority will not resolve exceptions filed to an arbitration award unless the award constitutes a complete resolution of all of the issues submitted to arbitration. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of</span> <span class="Italic">Health and Human Services, Ctrs. for Medicare and</span> <span class="Italic">Medicaid Services, </span>57 FLRA 924 (2002); <span class="Italic">AFGE</span> <span class="Italic">National Council of EEOC Locals No. 216, </span>47 FLRA 525, 530 (1993). In this case, the Arbitrator addressed only the arbitrability of the grievance and ordered the parties to proceed to a hearing on the merits of the grievance. Therefore, the Arbitrator did not address all of the issues submitted to arbitration and, as the Agency acknowledges, the exceptions are interlocutory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, in cases where exceptions are interlocutory in nature, but raise a plausible jurisdictional defect, extraordinary circumstances may exist warranting review of the exceptions. In <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Interior,</span> 55 FLRA 1230, the Authority stated that "interlocutory review should be reserved for those extraordinary situations where it is necessary. In particular, such review should only be undertaken where the arguments challenging an award in fact present a plausible jurisdictional defect, the resolution of which will advance the ultimate disposition of the case." 55 FLRA at 1232. In so stating, the Authority modified the "broad holding" of <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, on which the Agency relies in this case, under which any jurisdictional challenge, plausible or otherwise, that would control the outcome of the case warranted interlocutory review.[3] <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, the Authority held that extraordinary circumstances would exist to immediately resolve an interlocutory exception claiming that an arbitrator lacked jurisdiction because the matter was not grievable under the Statute. The Authority based this holding on a conclusion that it would not serve the purposes and policies of the Statute to refuse to resolve that controlling question of jurisdiction as an interlocutory matter when its immediate resolution could advance the ultimate resolution of the case. <span class="Italic">See </span>34 FLRA at 1164.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority did not, however, explain what would constitute a plausible jurisdictional defect. Where a lack of jurisdiction is found to exist, clearly, a challenge that was based on an asserted jurisdictional defect would be plausible. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of</span> <span class="Italic">Defense, NIMA, St. Louis, Mo., </span>57 FLRA 837, 837 n.2 (2002) (Member Pope dissenting as to result) (review of interlocutory exception warranted where arbitrator erred in determining that grievances concerning employee compensation were arbitrable). To give full effect to the <span class="Italic">Dept of the Interior </span>standard, a "plausible" jurisdictional defect cannot simply refer to a jurisdictional defect that is found to exist. Rather, a plausible jurisdictional defect is one that, on its face, is a credible claim, the resolution of which will advance the ultimate disposition of the case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency asserts that the Arbitrator erred, as both a matter of law and contract, in finding that the grievance was not barred by an earlier-filed ULP charge. If the Agency is correct, and the Arbitrator erred in finding that the grievance was arbitrable under &#x00A7; 7116(d) of the Statute, there would be no need for the parties to proceed to a hearing on the merits of the grievance. As such, there would be no need for the parties to incur any additional, unnecessary expenditures in processing the merits of the grievance, including the time and costs associated with another arbitration hearing. Conversely, if there is no bar to the continued processing of the grievance, the parties may proceed to a hearing on the merits of the grievance, with the knowledge that the jurisdictional issue has been fully resolved.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the Agency's exceptions in this case raise a plausible jurisdictional defect, the resolution of which will advance the ultimate <span id="page_1792"></span>disposition of this case. Consequently, review of the exceptions is warranted at this time. On review, and for the reasons explained below, we find that the exceptions do not establish that the award is deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the factual circumstances in the charge and the grievance are the same.&#x2003;Specifically, the Agency asserts that the charge and the grievance "both emanated from the same factual circumstances--the [Agency's] denial of official time for Union representatives for off site meetings." The Agency also disputes the Arbitrator's reliance on the fact that two years elapsed between the filing of the charge and the grievance and that different Union representatives filed the charge and grievance. The Agency also asserts that the Arbitrator "confused 'facts' with 'issues'[,]" in finding that the charge and the grievance involved off-site meetings with different individuals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the grievance did not arise out of the same factual circumstances as the charge. The charge and the grievance not only involved requests for official time by different Union representatives but also involved denials of those requests by different Agency officials. The purposes for which the official time was requested varied as well. In the charge, the purpose of the request was to meet with a labor consultant to discuss pending arbitration cases. In the grievance, the official time was requested to meet with the Chairman of the U.S. Capitol Police Board to discuss work related issues within the Agency's police force. Although both requests may have involved "off-site" meetings, the requests were clearly different.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the standards of &#x00A7; 7116(d) of the Statute, which the parties agreed was applicable to their agreement, the Agency has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator erred in finding that the grievance and charge were based on different factual circumstances. As such, the Agency has not established that the Arbitrator erred in finding that the charge did not bar the grievance. As there is no bar to the processing of the grievance, the parties may now proceed to a hearing on, and the Arbitrator may resolve, the claimed denial of official time.</p>
<p class="noindent">Member Pope dissented in the <span class="Italic">Library of Congress</span> case, suggesting quite reasonably that if the test for an interlocutory appeal was "plausibility," "I question when--apart from a rare case where a claim is patently frivolous--a claim would not be plausible." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 489. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB and NLRBU</span>,<a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-13.html">72 FLRA 80</a> (2021) (Member Abbott dissenting) (interlocutory review proper to determine if a ULP charge blocked a later grievance). The matter of the sufficiency of the strength or clarity of a jurisdictional challenge may have been clarified by <span class="Italic">Army Materiel Command, Redstone Arsenal and NFFE Local 1332</span>, <span class="blue">73 FLRA 356</span> (2022), <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Wright-Patterson AFB and AFGE Local 1138</span>, 59 FLRA 64, 66-67 (2003), considered an interlocutory exception filed to the award considering a temporary promotion. The question was whether the arbitrator actually considered a classification issue excluded by statute from grievance arbitration. The arbitrator reserved jurisdiction for 60 days following the final award to resolve issues of back pay or compensation. FLRA determined that a plausible jurisdictional defect existed sufficient to warrant interlocutory review:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, the Union argues that the Agency's exceptions should be dismissed because they are interlocutory. However, even if exceptions are interlocutory, the Authority will consider them if they present a plausible jurisdictional defect, the resolution of which will advance the ultimate disposition of the case<span class="Italic">. See Library of Congress</span>, 58 FLRA 486, 487 (2003) (Member Pope dissenting); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Defense, NIMA, St. Louis, Mo.</span>, 57 FLRA 837, 837 n.2 (2002); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Interior, Bu. of Indian Affairs, Wapato Irrigation Project, Wapato, Wash.</span>, 55 FLRA 1230, 1232 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Wapato</span>). In this regard, we note that the Union does not assert that the exceptions fail to present a plausible jurisdictional defect, the resolution of which will advance the ultimate disposition of the case; it simply argues that the exceptions are interlocutory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that, whether or not the exceptions are interlocutory, they are properly before us. This is because: (1) if the exceptions are not interlocutory, then resolution of the exceptions is required; and (2) if the exceptions are interlocutory, then they present a plausible jurisdictional defect (inconsistency with &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute), the resolution which will advance the ultimate disposition of the case. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to determine, and we do not determine, whether the exceptions are interlocutory.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Section 2429.11 of the Authority's Regulations provides that "the Authority...ordinarily will not consider interlocutory appeals." Thus, in arbitration cases, the Authority ordinarily will not resolve exceptions to an arbitration award unless the award constitutes a complete resolution of all of the issues submitted to arbitration. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Army, Army Corps of Eng'rs, Norfolk Dist.</span>, 60 FLRA 247, 248 (2004). Consequently, an arbitration award that postpones the determination of an issue submitted, such as an appropriate remedy for violations found, does not constitute a final award subject to review. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> However, review of interlocutory exceptions is warranted where the exceptions present a plausible jurisdictional defect, the resolution of which would advance the ultimate disposition of the case. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Transp., FAA, Wash., D.C.</span>, 60 FLRA 333, 334 (2004) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency concedes that its exceptions are interlocutory but contends that review is warranted because the exceptions raise a plausible jurisdictional defect, the resolution of which would advance the ultimate disposition of this case. Specifically, the Agency contends that the Arbitrator lacked jurisdiction to determine whether an OPM qualification standard is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is long and well-established that the Authority does not have the power to assess whether an OPM regulation is invalid. <span class="Italic">See AFGE v.</span> FLRA, 794 F.2d 1013, 1015 (5th Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot, Corpus Christi, Tex., </span>56 FLRA 1057, 1065,<span class="Italic"> recons. denied, </span>57 FLRA 290 (2001);<span class="Italic"> AFGE, Local 4052, Council of Prison Locals</span>, 56 FLRA 414, 416-17 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Local 4052</span>); <span class="Italic">SSA, Balt., Md.</span>, 53 FLRA 1053, 1064 (1997); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 32</span>, 51 FLRA 491, 496 n.9 (1995). The Authority has held that arbitrators also do not have that power. <span class="Italic">See Local 4052</span>, 56 FLRA at 417.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that the thirty-hour requirement is an OPM regulation. Thus, Authority precedent supports a conclusion that the Arbitrator did not have the authority to assess the validity of the thirty-hour requirement. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> The fact that the Arbitrator did not direct any remedies does not alter the fact that the Arbitrator lacked jurisdiction to assess the validity of the requirement in the first place.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Arbitrator lacked jurisdiction to assess the validity of the thirty-hour requirement, we find that the Agency's exceptions present a plausible jurisdictional defect, the resolution of which will advance the ultimate disposition of this case. <span class="Italic">See FAA</span>, 60 FLRA at 334. Thus, we find that review of the exceptions is warranted and, on review, we find that the Arbitrator lacked jurisdiction to assess the validity of the thirty-hour requirement. Accordingly, we set aside that portion of the award.</p>
<p class="noindent">Despite the interlocutory nature of an award concerning a probationer's termination, challenged as discriminatory, FLRA granted an exception to the award on the basis of a jurisdictional defect and set aside the award, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor, BLS and AFGE Local 12</span>, 66 FLRA 282, 283-84 (2011):</p>

In addition, the Authority has found that resolving such exceptions would advance the ultimate disposition of the case when doing so would "end the litigation." <span class="Italic">DHS</span>, 65 FLRA at 725.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although there is no dispute that the Agency's exceptions are interlocutory, we find, for the reasons stated below, that the Agency has presented a plausible jurisdictional defect, the resolution of which will advance the ultimate disposition of the case. <span class="Italic">See Gen. Servs. Admin., Ne. &#x0026; Caribbean Region, N.Y.C., N.Y.</span>, 60 FLRA 452, 453 (2004) (Chairman Cabaniss writing separately).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, the Arbitrator found that the Agency's conduct precluded it from raising a challenge to arbitrability. However, the Arbitrator's determination cannot stand if he lacked jurisdiction to resolve the matter in the first place. <span class="Italic">Cf. U.S. Dep't of Agric., Food &#x0026; Consumer Serv., Dall., Tex.</span>, 60 FLRA 978, 981 (2005) (then-Member Pope dissenting as to other matters) (<span class="Italic">USDA</span>) ("[A] party's failure to present an issue to an arbitrator cannot have the effect of creating jurisdiction in an arbitrator over a matter that Congress...excluded."). Thus, we consider whether the Arbitrator had jurisdiction to resolve the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that a grievance concerning the termination of a probationary employee is excluded from the scope of negotiated grievance procedures as a matter of law.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See GSA, </span>58 FLRA at 589 (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2006</span>, 58 FLRA 297, 298 (2003) (<span class="Italic">AFGE</span>); <span class="Italic">Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., SSA</span>, 14 FLRA 164, 164-65 (1984)). Accordingly, the merits of a probationary employee's termination are not subject to review in arbitration. <span class="Italic">See AFGE</span>, 58 FLRA at 298. Additionally, the Authority has held that a proposal that entitled a probationary employee to file a grievance challenging his or her termination on the basis of discrimination was nonnegotiable. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 25 FLRA 1067, 1078 (1987). In upholding the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit stated that "to allow the mere allegation of discrimination to give a discharged probationary employee access to the grievance procedure, with concomitant power of the arbitrator to order reinstatement, would substantially thwart Congress's intention to allow summary termination of probationary employees." <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 848 F.2d at 1275.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The foregoing supports a conclusion that the Union may not grieve the Agency's decision to terminate the grievant, <span class="Italic">see GSA</span>, 58 FLRA at 589, even by alleging that the Agency based its decision on discrimination, <span class="Italic">see NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 848 F.2d at 1277. Further, the decisions cited by the Union are inapposite, as neither decision involved a grievance challenging a probationary employee's termination. <span class="Italic">See Teamsters</span>, 557 F.2d at 1349-51; <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 60 FLRA at 568-69. Accordingly, the Arbitrator's determination that the grievance is arbitrable is contrary to law, and we set aside the award.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA attempted to synthesize its law on the interplay between permissible interlocutory exceptions on jurisdictional issues and impermissible interlocutory exceptions in bifurcated cases involving merits disputes, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, BEP and Graphic Communications Int'l Union Local 4B</span>, 58 FLRA 745, 746 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although neither party raised the interlocutory nature of the award, we raise the issue<span class="Italic"> sua sponte</span> since the parties agreed to a bifurcated proceeding and the second part of that proceeding regarding backpay, interest and attorney fees has not been completed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2429.11 of the Authority's Regulations provides: "[T]he Authority...ordinarily will not consider interlocutory appeals." In arbitration cases, this means that ordinarily, the Authority will not resolve exceptions filed to an arbitration award unless the award constitutes a complete resolution of all of the issues submitted to arbitration<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., United States Dep't of Health and Human Services, Ctrs. for Medicare and Medicaid Services</span>, 57 FLRA 924, 926 (2002) (<span class="Italic">HHS</span>); <span class="Italic">AFGE National Council of EEOC Locals No. 216</span>, 47 FLRA 525, 530 (1993); <span class="Italic">Navy Public Works Ctr., San Diego, Cal.</span>, 27 FLRA 407, 408 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, an arbitration award that postpones the determination of an issue submitted does not constitute a final award subject to review<span class="Italic">. See HHS</span>, 57 FLRA at 926; <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12</span>, 38 FLRA 1240, 1246 (1990). Exceptions are considered interlocutory when the arbitrator has declined to make a final disposition as to a remedy<span class="Italic">. See HHS</span>, 57 FLRA at 926. Similarly, the parties' agreement to conduct a separate hearing on a threshold issue does not operate to convert the arbitrator's threshold ruling into a final award subject to exceptions being filed under &#x00A7; 7122 of the Statute<span class="Italic">. See HHS</span>, 57 FLRA at 926; <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Serv., Los Angeles Dist.</span>, 34 FLRA 1161, 1163 (1990); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Army, Oakland Army Base</span>, 16 FLRA 829, 830 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, in cases where exceptions are interlocutory in nature, but raise a plausible jurisdictional defect, the resolution of which would advance the ultimate disposition of the case, extraordinary circumstances may exist warranting review of the exceptions<span class="Italic">. See Library of Congress and Fraternal Order of Police, Library of Congress Labor Committee</span>, 58 FLRA 486 (2003) (Member Pope dissenting as to application of standard).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying our precedent to this case, we find that the Agency's exceptions are interlocutory. The Arbitrator did not make a final disposition as to monetary remedies. Instead, observing the bifurcated process outlined in the parties' stipulation, the issues of backpay, interest, and attorney fees were to be addressed in either a subsequent hearing or submission. As such, the award is not final and complete because it does not address these issues.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Agency's exceptions do not raise a plausible jurisdictional defect, the resolution of which would advance the ultimate disposition of the case. The Agency alleges only that the matter was excluded from the grievance/arbitration process under the parties' collective bargaining agreement. While the parties have agreed that certain matters not excluded by statute are not subject to their grievance/arbitration process, we do not view a purely contractual limit upon the substantive arbitrability of a particular matter as a plausible jurisdictional defect for which we will provide interlocutory review. In this regard, we note that the few cases in which the Authority has granted interlocutory review have involved jurisdictional issues that arise pursuant to a statute<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., United States Dep't of Defense, National Imagery and Mapping Agency, St. Louis, Mo.</span>, 57 FLRA 837, 837 n.2 (2002) (grievance validity, arbitrability determined by pay statute); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Interior, Bur. of Indian Affairs, Wapato Irrigation Project, Wapato, Wash.</span>, 55 FLRA 1230, 1232 (2000)) (grievance validity, arbitrability determined by statutes covering bargaining unit status and classification exclusion).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the award is not final, we find that the Agency's exceptions are interlocutory. Further, we find that the exceptions do not raise a plausible jurisdictional defect warranting review at this time. Accordingly, we find no basis for interlocutory review and the exceptions are dismissed without prejudice pursuant to &#x00A7; 2429.11 of our Regulations.</p>

<p class="noindent">An award in a bifurcated case involving assessment of FLSA liability was interlocutory when the award resolved the scope of claims encompassed by the grievance (an issue that depended upon interpretation of the FLSA "opt-in" provisions), but jurisdiction of the arbitrator was not at issue, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation and IFPTE Local 128</span>, 59 FLRA 686, 687-88 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2429.11 of the Authority's Regulations provides, in pertinent part, that "the Authority...ordinarily will not consider interlocutory appeals." Pursuant to this regulation, the Authority ordinarily will not resolve exceptions to an arbitration award unless the award constitutes a complete resolution of all the issues submitted to arbitration<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing, W. Currency Facility, Fort Worth, Tex.</span>, 58 FLRA 745, 746 (2003) (<span class="Italic">Dep't of Treasury</span>).

<p class="noindent-1">Review of interlocutory exceptions is warranted where the exceptions present a plausible jurisdictional defect, the resolution of which would advance the ultimate disposition of the case<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Wapato Irrigation Project, Wapato, Wash.</span>, 55 FLRA 1230, 1232 (2000). Recently, the Authority granted review of--and denied on the merits--an interlocutory exception, holding that the exception raised a plausible jurisdictional defect and that, whether or not the exception was meritorious, review would advance the ultimate disposition of the case<span class="Italic">. Library of Congress</span>, 58 FLRA 486, 487 (2003) (Member Pope dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the interim award resolved only the issues of whether the FLSA opt-in provision applies to Union-filed grievances and when the FLSA statute of limitations began to toll. The award does not resolve the merits of the Union's claims or provide any remedies and, as such, it does not resolve all the issues submitted to the Arbitrator. The fact that the Arbitrator declined to resolve the merits pursuant to the parties' agreement to bifurcate the proceedings does not convert the interim award into a final award<span class="Italic">. See Dep't of Treasury,</span> 58 FLRA at 746. Accordingly, the exceptions are interlocutory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that resolving the exceptions "would materially advance the ultimate resolution of this litigation" because "the parties would be apprised earlier as to the potential extent of any overtime back pay and damages." However, the Agency does not assert that the Arbitrator lacks <span class="Italic">jurisdiction</span> in this case. Moreover, even if we were to construe the Agency's claim as contesting the Arbitrator's jurisdiction over employees who have not submitted opt-in forms, the parties agreed to allow employees to submit opt-in forms during the course of the grievance and employees have done so. Thus, even if the Authority viewed the Agency's claim as jurisdictional and adopted the Agency's interpretation of the FLSA, the grievance would proceed to arbitration on the merits of the claims of employees who have opted into the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the foregoing, this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Library of Congress</span>, 58 FLRA 486, where the agency argued that the grievance was not arbitrable because it was barred by an earlier-filed unfair labor practice charge<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. The Authority found that, if the agency was correct, then there would be no need for the parties to proceed to a hearing on the merits and to incur any additional, unnecessary expenditures in processing the merits of the grievance<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> at 487. In this case, as discussed above, even if the Authority resolved the Agency's exceptions in its favor, this case would proceed to arbitration on the merits. Further, although the Agency asserts that resolving the exceptions may lead to the parties considering an earlier resolution of the grievance, the Agency provides no evidence in support of the assertion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, we conclude that the exceptions are interlocutory and do not raise a plausible jurisdictional defect, the resolution of which will advance the ultimate disposition of the case. Accordingly, we dismiss the exceptions without prejudice.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VA Western NY Healthcare Sys. and SEIU Local 200</span>, 61 FLRA 173, 174-75 (2005), involving a dispute over the manner of scheduling vacation time, suggested that a plausible jurisdictional defect will likely arise from a statutory impediment to the award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2429.11 of the Authority's Regulations provides: "[T]he Authority...ordinarily will not consider interlocutory appeals." In arbitration cases, this means that ordinarily, the Authority will not resolve exceptions filed to an arbitration award unless the award constitutes a complete resolution of all of the issues submitted to arbitration. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Services, Ctrs. for Medicare &#x0026; Medicaid Services</span>, 57 FLRA 924, 926 (2002) (<span class="Italic">HHS</span>); <span class="Italic">AFGE National Council of EEOC Locals No. 216</span>, 47 FLRA 525, 530 (1993); <span class="Italic">Navy Public Works Ctr., San Diego, Cal.</span>, 27 FLRA 407, 408 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, an arbitration award that postpones the determination of an issue submitted does not constitute a final award subject to review. <span class="Italic">See HHS</span>, 57 FLRA at 926; <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12</span>, 38 FLRA 1240, 1246 (1990). Exceptions are considered interlocutory when the arbitrator has declined to make a final disposition as to a remedy. <span class="Italic">See HHS</span>, 57 FLRA at 926. Consistent with this principle, the Authority has repeatedly held that where an arbitrator declines to issue a remedy, directing instead that the parties attempt to develop an appropriate remedy on their own, the award does not constitute a final decision to which exceptions can be filed. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Services, Navajo Area Indian Health Service</span>, 58 FLRA 356, 357 (2003); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Interior, Bur. of Indian Affairs, Wapato Irrigation Project, Wapato, Wash., </span>55 FLRA 1230, 1231-32 (2000) (<span class="Italic">BIA</span>); United <span class="Italic">States GPO, Wash., D.C</span>., 53 FLRA 17, 18 (1997) (<span class="Italic">GPO</span>); <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, 27 FLRA at 407-08.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In cases where exceptions are interlocutory in nature, but raise a plausible jurisdictional defect, the resolution of which would advance the ultimate disposition of the case, extraordinary circumstances may exist warranting review of the exceptions. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Washington, D.C.</span>, 60 FLRA 333 (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before the Arbitrator in this case, the parties stipulated the issues to be resolved as including the alleged violation of the parties' agreement as well as the appropriate remedy. The Arbitrator declined to issue a remedy, ordering instead that the Agency determine the appropriate remedy to comply with the parties' agreement, and retained jurisdiction for the purpose of assisting the parties with the interpretation and implementation of the award. Applying our precedent set forth above, we find that the Arbitrator's award--which did not resolve the issue of an appropriate remedy--is not a final decision and thus, the Agency's exceptions are interlocutory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Agency's contention does not establish a plausible jurisdictional defect, the resolution of which would advance the ultimate disposition of the case. In this regard, we note that the few cases in which the Authority has granted interlocutory review have involved jurisdictional issues that arise pursuant to a statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Defense, National Imagery &#x0026; Mapping Agency, St. Louis, Mo., </span>57 FLRA 837, 837 n.2 (2002) (grievance validity, arbitrability determined by pay statute); <span class="Italic">BIA</span>, 55 FLRA at 1232 (grievance validity, arbitrability determined by statutes covering bargaining unit status and classification exclusion).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the Arbitrator made a bargaining unit determination when she used the term "<span class="Italic">de facto</span> [work] unit" to refer to the bargaining unit employees in Buffalo and non-bargaining employees in Batavia. In the award at issue, the Arbitrator was not asked to, and did not, determine that the employees in the Buffalo laboratory and the employees in the Batavia laboratory constituted a single appropriate unit for labor organization representation--a matter that would have been outside her jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See United States Small Business Admin.</span>, 32 FLRA 847, 853 (1988) (the Authority has "exclusive jurisdiction to make appropriate unit determinations[&#8197;]"), <span class="Italic">reconsideration granted as to other matters, 3</span>6 FLRA 155 (1990). The Arbitrator merely observed that the evidence established that "for vacation purposes, the Buffalo and Batavia employees are a <span class="Italic">de facto</span> work unit." Rather than making a bargaining unit determination, the Arbitrator interpreted the agreement to find that, although these separate groups of employees are in different bargaining units, they should be treated as a single work unit for purposes of the allocation of vacation schedules by the Agency. Therefore, the Agency's contention does not present a plausible jurisdictional defect, the resolution of which would advance the ultimate disposition of the case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, because the award is not final, the Agency's exceptions are interlocutory. Further, the Agency's contention does not raise a plausible jurisdictional defect warranting review at this time. Accordingly, we find no basis for interlocutory review and the exceptions are dismissed without prejudice pursuant to &#x00A7; 2429.11 of our Regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">A statutory impediment did not rise to the level of a jurisdictional defect in a bifurcated case when the statutory issue was one of interpretation of management rights, <span class="Italic">DHUD and AFGE Local 3258</span>, 62 FLRA 52, 52-53 (2007):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2429.11 of the Authority's Regulations, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.11, provides, in pertinent part, that "the Authority...ordinarily will not consider interlocutory appeals."

<p class="noindent-1">To begin, we reject the Agency's contention that this case is similar to <span class="Italic">USIA,</span> which held that the agency's exceptions were not interlocutory because arbitrability was the sole issue submitted to and decided at arbitration. In <span class="Italic">USIA</span>, the only issue submitted to arbitration was whether the dispute was arbitrable, and there was no indication that the parties had agreed to bifurcate the arbitration process. In contrast, here, the parties agreed to bifurcate the proceedings and, consistent with the parties' agreement, the Arbitrator resolved the arbitrability issue as a threshold issue. In this regard, the Arbitrator stated that if he found the case arbitrable, then "we will have a hearing, at which both sides can present evidence and argument." Thus, the Agency's exceptions are interlocutory because <span id="page_1795"></span>the award to which the exceptions are filed is preliminary and was not intended to be a complete resolution of all of the issues submitted to arbitration. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Treasury,</span> 58 FLRA at 746 (parties' agreement to bifurcate the proceedings does not convert the interim award into a final award).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the Authority may resolve interlocutory exceptions when the exceptions raise a plausible jurisdictional defect and the resolution of the defect would advance the ultimate disposition of the case. <span class="Italic">Dep't of Transp.,</span> 61 FLRA at 635. The Agency contends that the exceptions raise a plausible jurisdictional defect because under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, management's right to determine internal security practices is not subject to arbitration. The Authority has consistently held, however, that the management rights provisions of &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute do not provide a basis for finding grievances nonarbitrable. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Homeland Sec., United States Customs &#x0026; Border Prot.,</span> 61 FLRA 113, 115 n.5 (2005); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy, Pac.

In particular, <span class="Italic">Newark AFS </span>held that the proper phase of the arbitration proceeding in which to determine the impact or application of &#x00A7; 7106 is not at the outset, effectively precluding an arbitrator from having jurisdiction over the matter, but, rather, when the arbitrator considers the substantive issues presented by the grievance and any possible remedy. <span class="Italic">Newark AFS,</span> 30 FLRA at 634. Because under Authority precedent the management rights provisions of &#x00A7; 7106 do not preclude arbitration, there is not a plausible jurisdictional defect supporting interlocutory review of the Agency's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent">An election of remedies under 5 USC 7121(d) between a grievance and an EEO complaint, both concerning a reprimand, established a plausible jurisdictional defect warranting review of an arbitrability determination in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr., Keyport and Bremerton MTC</span>, 69 FLRA 292 (2016).

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator designated his letter a "decision" on the issue of the witness' relevance. However, it is clear that the Arbitrator's "decision" is not a complete determination of the issues in this matter. In fact, in its response to the Order to Show Cause, the Agency admits that the Arbitrator's "decision" on the issue of the witness' relevance "does not finally resolve all of the issues at bar in the subject arbitration." In addition, the Agency does not dispute the Union's claim that "the underlying arbitration is ongoing." Further, the Arbitrator's "decision" indicates that other issues remain unresolved. Specifically, the Arbitrator notes "other matters" will be addressed and "updates" on "outstanding issues" will be provided at the "upcoming hearing[&#8197;]." As the award is not a complete resolution of all the issues submitted to arbitration and is not a final decision on the complete proceeding, the Agency's exception is interlocutory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that, if the Authority finds the exception to be interlocutory, then extraordinary circumstances exist permitting interlocutory review. In this regard, the Agency claims that the award fails to draw its essence from Article 48(K)(2) because it requires the Agency to pay travel costs and other expenses in a manner that is not authorized by the parties' agreement. This claim does not present a plausible jurisdictional defect, the resolution of which would advance the ultimate disposition of the case. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 446</span>, 59 FLRA at 453. Accordingly, the Agency has failed to demonstrate that extraordinary circumstances exist warranting consideration of its exception, and interlocutory review is not warranted. As such, we dismiss the Agency's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an arbitrator announced she would make some preliminary rulings and then recuse and permit another arbitrator to decide the merits of the grievance, made some preliminary rulings and withdrew her recusal, FLRA did not treat the withdrawal of jurisdiction as a final ruling or award. The recusal did not present a jurisdictional defect warranting an exception to the usual bar on interlocutory appeals. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, White Sands Missile Range and NFFE Local 2049</span>, 67 FLRA 1, 3 (2012) ("Exceptions raise a plausible jurisdictional defect when they present a credible claim that the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter as a matter of law. <span class="Italic">See, id. </span>at 851 (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., U.S. Citizenship &#x0026; Immigration Servs.</span>, 65 FLRA 723, 725 (2011); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Labor</span>, 63 FLRA 216, 217 (2009). However, the Authority has repeatedly declined to extend interlocutory review to alleged jurisdictional defects that do not preclude arbitration of the grievance as a matter of law. <span class="Italic">See Pope Air Force Base</span>, 66 FLRA at 851.").</p>
<p class="noindent">There is a qualification to FLRA's willingness to review preliminary rulings by an arbitrator implicating jurisdictional matters. For there to be a basis for interlocutory review, there must be a ruling by an arbitrator and the party filing exceptions must have first presented the issue to the arbitrator, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x2206;BP and NTEU Local 154</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-33.html">72 FLRA 166</a>, 167 (2021) (Chairman DuBester concurring):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that "extraordinary circumstances" warrant review because the Arbitrator failed to address the Agency's claim that the parties' agreement required the Arbitrator to resolve a purported arbitrability issue before conducting a hearing. However, the record shows that the Agency did not present this argument to the Arbitrator in its motion to exclude. As such, the Arbitrator did not address it in her decision. Without a decision on the procedural arbitrability issue, let alone the issues presented by the two grievances, there is still a need for further arbitral proceedings. Accordingly, we dismiss the exception.[16]</p>
