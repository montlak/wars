<h3 class="h3" id="sec10-70"><span class="space">A.</span> REGULATORY AND OPERATIONAL BASIS</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">The OPM regulations defining assignment rights provide, 5 CFR 351.701 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">General</span>. When a group I or II competitive service employee with a current annual performance rating of record of minimally successful (Level 2) or equivalent, or higher, is released from a competitive level, an agency shall offer assignment, rather than furlough or separate, in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section to another competitive position which requires no reduction, or the lease possible reduction, in representative rate. The employee must be qualified for the offered position. The offered position shall be in the same competitive area, last at least 3 months, and have the same type of work schedule (e.g., full-time, part-time, intermittent, or seasonal) as the position from which the employee is released. Upon accepting an offer of assignment, or displacing another employee under this part, an employee retains the same status and tenure in the new position. The promotion potential of the offered position is not a consideration in determining an employee's right of assignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Lower subgroup--bumping</span>. A released employee shall be assigned in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and bump to a position that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Is held by another employee in a lower tenure group or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Is no more than three grades (or appropriate grade intervals or equivalent) below the position from which the employee was released.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Same subgroup--retreating</span>. A released employee shall be assigned in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section and retreat to a position that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Is held by another employee with lower retention standing in the same tenure group and subgroup; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Is not more than three grades (or appropriate grade intervals or equivalent) below the position from which the employee was released, except that for a preference eligible employee with a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or more the limit is five grades (or appropriate grade intervals or equivalent). (The agency uses the grade progression of only the released employee's position of record to determine the applicable grades (or appropriate grade intervals or equivalent) of the employee's retreat right. The agency does not consider the grade progression of the position to which the employee has a retreat right.); and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Is the same position, or an essentially identical position, formerly held by the released employee on a permanent basis as a competing employee in a Federal agency (i.e., when held by the released employee in an executive, legislative, or judicial branch agency, the position would have been placed in tenure groups I, II, or III, or equivalent). In determining whether a position is essentially identical, the determination is based on the competitive level criteria found in &#x00A7; 351.403, but not necessarily in regard to the respective grade, classification series, type of work schedule, or type of service, of the two positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Limitation</span>. An employee with a current annual performance rating of record of minimally successful (Level 2) or equivalent may be assigned under paragraph (c) of this section only to a position held by another employee with a current annual performance rating of record no higher than minimally successful (Level 2) or equivalent.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jett v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 276, 279 (1997) (restating regulations governing assignment rights), <span class="Italic">post</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board decided as a matter of "common sense" to extend assignment rights protections to Postal Service preference-eligible employees despite the absence of OPM standards or requirements for Postal Service positions. <span class="Italic">Hoover v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 352, 357-64 (1998) (analysis of qualifications for various positions sought through assignment rights); <span class="Italic">Manescalchi v.

<p class="Body-Text">Valiant Army personnelists made an effort years ago to define assignment rights for the benefit of personnelists everywhere. Although the Army manual excerpted below contains dated material and does not encompass revisions in OPM regulations limiting the maximum extent of assignment rights, the significance of performance appraisals in the calculation of service credit, and the changes in the definition of retreat rights, the Army guidance remains useful. From Army PAM 690-6 (1982), <span class="Italic">Supervisor's and Employee's Guide to Reduction in Force</span>, we find first the itemization of tenure and service groups and subgroups:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;TENURE OF EMPLOYMENT determines an employee's retention group.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">METHOD OF RELEASE</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Displacing (reassignment within one's competitive level) someone in a RIF is a matter of wide concern and interest, and is quite often misunderstood. Whenever a person's job [is] abolished and there is someone lower than that person on the retention register, the person whose job is abolished has the right to displace the employee at the bottom of the retention register. The employee at the bottom register might be in another division or branch in the organization, but he or she will be in a very similar job and at the same grade. In such a case, the action to place the employee whose job was abolished will be handled as a reassignment, not a RIF action. If the employee whose job was abolished refuses reassignment, he or she may be separated, but not by RIF.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to reassignment, there are two other methods of displacing employees in a RIF. These methods are "bumping" and "retreating." Bumping is the more common and is accomplished first, if possible. Bumping involves displacement of persons in lower retention subgroups, while retreating involves displacement of employees in the same subgroup, but with less service. To help clarify this, additional information follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bumping (displacement under RIF procedures) is a term often misused and widely misunderstood. The proper use of the term applies when one employee who is being released from his or her competitive level, takes the job of another employee in a different competitive level and in a lower retention subgroup. An employee whose job has been abolished has the right to bump into the position of another employee when two conditions exist: (1) the employee bumping is qualified for the position, including any minimum education requirements, and (2) the employee being bumped is in a lower retention subgroup.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where several bumping possibilities exist, the RIF'D employee is offered that position which preserves his or her present grade and pay, if possible. If not possible, he or she is offered the highest of any lower-graded positions. If the employee must be placed in lower graded job, grade and pay retention may apply. An employee does not have the right to bump a higher-graded employee under any circumstances. If there is more than one job available that meets an employee's assignment rights, management decides which job will be offered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">THE BUMPING PROCESS WORKS AS FOLLOWS--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">IAD Employees: Career veterans with 30 percent or more disability, may bump a IA, IB, or anyone in group II or III, but may not bump another IAD.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">IA Employees: Other career veterans, may bump a IB or anyone in group II or III, but may not bump another IA or IAD.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">IB Employees: Career nonveterans, may bump a group II or III, but not another IB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">IIAD Employees: Career-conditional veterans 30 percent or more disabled, may bump a IIA, IIB or anyone in III, but not another IIAD.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">IIA Employees: Other career-conditional veterans, may bump a IIB or any group III, but not another IIA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">IIB Employees: Career-conditional nonveterans, may bump a group III, but not another IIB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Group III Employee: Have no displacement rights. However, they may be offered assignment to vacant positions for which they qualify.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[Examples]; [t]he position of a career veteran (category IA) is abolished, and the veteran is reassigned to another job in the same competitive level. The displaced employee (IB employee) is qualified for several other kinds of jobs at his or her same grade. The example above indicates that the IB employee is given RIF rights to a job in another competitive level which is occupied by an employee in lower subgroup (IIB). If he (IB) refuses the offer, he may be separated by RIF. If the IB accepts the offer, the RIF process is applied again, i.e., the displaced (IIB) may, if qualified, bump down into the GS-9 level, or if he cannot bump, is separated under RIF procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Retreating involves an employee who has been released from his or her competitive level displacing another employee in the same subgroup in another competitive level who has less service. An employee's retreat rights are only to positions which are the same or substantially similar to positions actually held in the past [omitting obsolete language]. The employee must still be qualified to perform the duties of the job to which they have retreat rights. The job must be held by someone in the same subgroup having less service than the person exercising the retreat rights. (If the employee with less service is also in a lower subgroup than the person under RIF, it becomes a bumping action, not retreat.) Retreat rights begin with current grade and are almost always to lower graded positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An example of a retreat right is as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee, Supply Specialist, GS-2001-11, is being affected by RIF (job abolished). The employee is a career veteran (IA). She was promoted into her present position from Inventory Management Specialist, GS-2010-9. There are no other Supply Specialists, GS-2001-11 in a lower subgroup in the Competitive Area (Depot). There is a career veteran (IA) in an Inventory Management Specialist, GS-2010-9 position that has less overall service than the employee being affected. Since the employee whose job is being abolished was promoted from 2010-9 (or one basically the same) she is entitled to retreat to the GS-2010-9 position. In so doing she displaces the employee now in the job and that employee is placed in a RIF situation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The failure to provide proper assignment rights to an employee denies him a significant procedural right, meaning that the RIF may not be sustained. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rasmussen v. United States</span>, 543 F.2d 134, 141 (Ct. Cl. 1976). For historical explanation of the development of bumping rights, refer to <span class="Italic">Parks v. United States</span>, 147 F. Supp. 261 (Ct. Cl. 1957). [Refer to "<a href="0100-2023-17-001.html#sec10-2">RIF Process</a>," particularly the guidance from OPM, at the beginning of this chapter for an overview of the operation of assignment rights.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jett v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 276, 279 (1997), provides an example of the straightforward application of assignment rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An employee released from his competitive level may "bump" to a position for which he is qualified held by another employee in a lower tenure group or a lower sub-group of the same tenure group, if the position is no more than three grade levels below the position from which he was released. 5 CFR 351.701. An individual may "retreat" into a position held by another employee with lower retention standing in the same tenure group and subgroup if, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that position is the same as, or essentially identical to, one previously held by the employee seeking to retreat<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.701(c)(1). The agency bears the burden of proof on the issue of whether the agency has afforded the appellant his assignment rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Buckler v. Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board</span>, 73 MSPR 476, 492 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant stipulated that he was in tenure group 1, subgroup A, and that his service computation date (SCD) was October 11, 1953. In 1995, the PCES-1 District Manager position was encumbered by Ronnie Eley, the PCES-1 Manager, Processing and Distribution Center position was encumbered by John Davis, and the PCES-1 Postmaster position was occupied by N.J. Alix all of whom were also tenure group 1-A employees. Thus, the appellant could not have displaced any of them by bumping.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Likewise, the appellant had no bumping rights to the EAS-25 Manager, Operations Support position encumbered in 1995 by Richard Sanchez, another tenure group 1-A employee. Because the appellant had once occupied that position, he might have had retreat rights to it. However, Sanchez's SCD was September 20, 1953, earlier than the appellant's October 11, 1953 SCD, and Sanchez's place on the retention register was consequently higher than the appellant's. Thus, the appellant could not retreat into Sanchez's position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Flores v. USPS</span>, 75 MSPR 546, 549 (1997) ("When an appellant raises the issue of his assignment rights, the burden is on the agency to prove that it properly followed the RIF regulations in effecting the appellant's assignment."); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Army</span>, 86 MSPR 282, 285 &#x00B6; 4 (2000) ("In determining whether the agency afforded the appellant his proper assignment rights, the Board must conduct a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review to determine whether the agency has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the appellant did not have 'the capacity, adaptability, and special skills needed to satisfactorily perform the duties of the position without undue interruption.'").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency may fulfill assignment rights by assigning an employee across a competitive area. <span class="Italic">Devall v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 19 MSPR 351, 354 (1984) (immaterial that in past RIFs the agency permitted employees to reject assignments across competitive areas in favor of other assignments; uniformity was required in any one RIF); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Crambert v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 22 MSPR 628, 634 (1984) (rejecting argument that agency acted inconsistently; employees who were assigned to other competitive areas were assigned to vacancies and there was no vacant position in another competitive area within appellant's qualifications). Assignment across a competitive area is not required. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Caviness v. Dept. of Army</span>, 39 MSPR 548, 554 (1989). If the appellant is the only employee in her competitive level and her competitive area is abolished, there no longer is an assignment right and separation is appropriate. <span class="Italic">Boone v. Dept. of Army</span>, 7 MSPR 292, 294-95, 7 MSPB 186 (1981). Employees occasionally accept assignments and then immediately retire or resign. When an employee informs the agency of his intent to do so, for the purpose of creating some entitlement to back pay or other benefits, the agency is not relieved of its responsibility for making the assignment. <span class="Italic">Okonski v. DHHS</span>, 31 MSPR 489, 492-93 (1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_3074"></span>Assignment rights are construed with regard for the purpose of statutory retention privileges. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Army</span>, 42 MSPR 680, 687-90 (1990), concluded that an agency erred by placing a preference eligible employee in a temporary position instead of first granting the appellant any assignment rights he may have had to a permanent position--even if the permanent position was classified at a lower grade:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the proceeding below and in his petition for review, Appellant Harrod argues that the agency should have afforded him assignment rights to the highest grade permanent position for which he qualified before offering him a reassignment to a vacant temporary position. In response, the agency contends that it was required to offer the appellant the WG-6 temporary position under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.701(a) because the permanent positions to which he had assignment rights were at a lower grade, and the temporary position was therefore the appellant's best offer. Additionally, the agency contends that the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant's reassignment to a temporary position was not an appealable RIF action under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.901. For the reasons set forth below, we disagree with both of the agency's contentions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the language and history of the Veterans Preference Act of 1944 (the Veterans Preference Act or the Act)[7] compel the conclusion that the agency was required to grant the appellant any assignment rights he had to permanent positions--even if such positions were classified at a lower grade--before offering him a temporary vacant position. The purpose of the Act was to broaden the preference given to veterans in terms of initial appointments and RIF retention under earlier statutes and executive orders. <span class="Italic">Hilton v. Sullivan,</span> 334 U.S. 323, 337, 68 S. Ct. 1020, 1026-27, 92 L. Ed. 1416 (1948). One provision of the Act, now codified at 5 USC &#x00A7; 3502(c), provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee who is entitled to retention preference and whose performance has not been rated unacceptable under a performance appraisal system implemented under chapter 43 of this title is entitled to be retained in preference to other competing employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Pub. L. No. 78-359, ch. 287, 58 Stat. 387.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court has interpreted this provision as giving preference eligibles absolute priority for retention in a RIF over non-preference eligibles, even those non-preference eligibles with more years of service. <span class="Italic">Hilton</span>, 334 U.S. at 335-36, 68 S. Ct. at 1025-26.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that Appellant Harrod is a preference eligible within the meaning of this provision who was therefore entitled to be retained over competing employees who are non-preference eligibles. We find that the agency's offer of a vacant temporary position in lieu of any assignment rights the appellant had to permanent positions did not fulfill the letter or the spirit of this statutory provision, notwithstanding the fact that it appears that the appellant will retain his tenure status as a career employee for the duration of the temporary position. For RIF retention purposes, there is a significant and long-standing distinction between temporary and permanent positions. In the competitive service, employees occupying temporary limited positions are not considered as competing employees in a RIF. <span class="Italic">Starling,</span> 757 F.2d at 273. Such employees are listed apart from the retention register, and they must be released from their positions before any group I, II, or III employees in that competitive level are released. 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 351.404(b)(1) and 351.602(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that Appellant Harrod's bump and retreat claims are valid, he could have been in a significantly more favorable position by displacing an employee occupying a permanent position, even one at a lower grade, than he would be in the temporary position at the same grade he held before the RIF. Although he would have been placed in a permanent position at a lower grade, the appellant could still have received retained grade and pay, as did Appellants Jones, Holmes, and Hutson. If a determination of Appellant Harrod's RIF rights is delayed until the expiration of his temporary position in July 1989, he may no longer be in a position to bump or retreat into positions to which he now has entitlement. For example, as of the date of his RIF notice in this appeal, the appellant was entitled to bump IIA employees who occupied permanent positions for which he qualified no more than three grades lower than his former WG-6 position. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.701(b). By the time the appellant's temporary position expires, however, some of these IIA employees may gain IA status, thus negating the appellant's right to bump them, since they will no longer be in a lower tenure group than the appellant's tenure group. Thus, delaying the determination of the appellant's assignment rights until the temporary position expires has the significant potential to denigrate or extinguish the retention rights to which he is entitled, as a preference eligible, under the Veterans Preference Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons, we cannot find that the agency's offer of a temporary position was equivalent to an offer of a permanent position, notwithstanding the fact that the appellant may retain his career tenure for the duration of the temporary position. Because the appellant will retain his career tenure on a temporary basis only, it is clear that his reassignment to this temporary position is not the type of reassignment that OPM has excluded, or is authorized to exclude, from coverage under the RIF regulations. In explaining why it was amending the RIF regulations to provide that reassignments occurring during a RIF were no longer appealable, OPM stated that the rationale for this change was that other reassignments which do not affect an employee's grade, pay, or tenure are not appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 51 Fed. Reg. 319 (1986). Where, as here, the appellant's retention of his career tenure is only temporary, there can be little doubt that the appellant was constructively--if not in fact--separated from his permanent position, and that such separations are appealable as RIF actions under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.901. We find no basis to conclude that Congress, in enacting the Veterans Preference Act, intended to allow agencies to circumvent the RIF retention rights of preference eligible employees to permanent positions by offering them temporary positions and delaying the determination of their RIF assignment rights until a future time when those rights may be denigrated or extinguished.[10] On this basis we find that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal as a RIF action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;Further, while we find no such evidence in this case, we note that an agency could readily circumvent the RIF regulations by reassigning to a temporary position a less-favored employee who had bumping or retreat rights to permanent, albeit lower-graded, positions, in order to retain favored employees with lower retention standing in permanent positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We thus conclude that Appellant Harrod was entitled to his RIF rights at the time he was released from his competitive level, and that the agency was required to offer him the highest-grade permanent position to which he was entitled through his bump or retreat rights before offering him a vacant temporary position. Additionally, we note that this conclusion is consistent with OPM's RIF guidance which provides that <span class="Italic">"[w]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">hen an agency determines that</span> <span class="Italic">a tenure group I or II employee has no RIF assignment right,</span> it may offer the employee a vacant position in lieu of RIF separation." FPM Letter 351-22, at 55 (emphasis supplied). In effect, the remedy which the appellant seeks in this case is that the Board ensure that the agency comply with the Veterans Preference Act as well as this FPM guidance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nguyen v. VA</span>, 92 MSPR 326, 329 &#x00B6; 7 (2002) ("When an agency offers a permanent employee a reassignment to a temporary position in lieu of a RIF separation, such reassignments are appealable RIF actions.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Generally, when an employee complains of improper assignment rights, the employee seeks either a specific (higher paid) position or cancelation of the RIF. The AJ should adjudicate the case in a way that avoids further erosion of the assignment rights of the employee. It is inequitable for the AJ, by finding fault with the agency processes, to "remedy" the fault through a diminution of the assignment rights already provided by the agency to the employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hutchinson v. DOD</span>, 26 MSPR 521, 523 (1985) (AJ should not have canceled the appellant's GS-13 excepted service appointment and ordered the agency to place him in a GS-5 position: "It would be inequitable for the Board to deny the appellant the higher graded position to which he was assigned as a remedy for having appealed to the Board and ostensibly prevailing.").</p>
