<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-163"><span class="space">16.</span> Mitigating Factors</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Not all insubordination leads the Board to sustain dismissal. <span class="Italic">Coffield v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 18 MSPR 496, 498 (1983), on remand from <span class="Italic">Coffield v. MSPB</span>, 707 F.2d 505 (4th Cir. 1983), mitigated removal to a 30-day suspension of an employee who used profane language to a supervisor and who disobeyed an order concerning an inspection the employee was directed to undertake. Disrespectful and offensive language directed to a fellow employee rather than to a supervisor warranted a 30-day suspension rather than a removal; the language would have a more disruptive effect when directed at a supervisor. <span class="Italic">Kullenberg v. VA</span>, 21 MSPR 513, 516 n.4 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. USDA</span>, 27 MSPR 79, 86 (1985) (mitigating the insubordinate refusal to report for a temporary assignment by reason of his wife's medical condition and the appellant's possible confusion about the reporting date); <span class="Italic">Marchand v. EEOC</span>, 12 MSPR 584, 586 (1982) (insubordinate supervisor's removal was mitigated to a demotion when the appellant could be expected to perform well without supervisory responsibilities); <span class="Italic">Schultz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 8 MSPR 585, 589 (1981) (removal was mitigated to a suspension: the language used by the appellant was common among shipyard employees, and supervisors who used insulting, abusive and obscene language were treated more leniently by the agency).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When some checks to a PX were dishonored and the appellant, after trying to and actually satisfying the debts, was discharged for refusing to bring his ID into authorities for overstamping, removal was too harsh. Appellant should have challenged rather than disobeyed the directive. There were mitigating circumstances: the appellant was not a supervisor; he believed he was the victim of a bank error; there was no evidence he could not do his job as a civil engineer; and he had no prior disciplinary record. The penalty was mitigated to a 30-day suspension. <span class="Italic">Blevins v. Dept. of Army</span>, 26 MSPR 101, 105 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Phillips v. GSA</span>, 878 F.2d 370, 373 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (unsuccessful attempt to accomplish an agency directive concerning the payment of debt was not the same as a refusal to obey the directive). Mitigation was to be considered for a petitioner who had 30 years of service, 13 of them with his present agency, who received prior awards and no past discipline, and whose insubordinate refusal to be interviewed by an agency official investigating appellant's actions as an escort for the air transfer of prisoners was caused in part by a medical condition and confusion over his legal rights. <span class="Italic">Brown v. DOJ</span>, 790 F.2d 89 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Table), <span class="Italic">on</span> <span class="Italic">remand,</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. DOJ</span>, 31 MSPR 211, 212 (1986) (mitigating removal to 30-day suspension).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are degrees of insubordination. Mild insubordination by a clerical employee who was provoked to some extent by an overbearing supervisor resulted in the reduction of a removal to a 14-day suspension<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Stockton v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 8 MSPR 43, 45, 7 MSPB 539 (1981); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Gill v. DOD</span>, 92 MSPR 23, 34 &#x00B6; 27 (2002) (reprimand was appropriate to appellant, a supervisor, who raised her voice to her supervisor during an exchange provoked by the <span id="Page_2648"></span>supervisor); <span class="Italic">Lynch v. DOJ</span>, 32 MSPR 33, 40 (1986) (discounting a charge of abusive language; the appellant's language was in frustration resulting from an inability to communicate with supervisor; the law enforcement status of the appellant was immaterial). One appellant disregarded a proper directive to type individual addresses on envelopes from a list of addresses rather than cutting out addresses from the list and pasting them on the envelopes, the past practice in her office. Although the incident technically constituted insubordination, it did not warrant a 30-day suspension; instead, it resulted in a 14-day suspension, the maximum reasonable discipline needed to impress upon appellant the importance of following superiors' directives. <span class="Italic">Nicholson v. DHHS</span>, 14 MSPR 513, 518 (1983). Another removal was mitigated to a 30-day suspension when the appellant had a long and satisfactory service record and that part of the problem was caused by the supervisor's failure to state clearly what he wanted the subordinate to do. <span class="Italic">Ford v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 495, 501-02 (1990). Removal was mitigated to a reprimand for the appellant's failure to personally contact his designated acting chief during his absences. The misconduct was <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">minimis;</span> the appellant's failure to make the personal contact did not result in any confusion or disruption to the agency; the charge was the only one sustained of several allegations brought; and the appellant had 15 years of service with outstanding performance evaluations marred only by several prior disciplinary actions that resulted from a hostile relationship with a supervisor who treated the appellant in a demeaning and humiliating manner. <span class="Italic">Cowins v. VA</span>, 64 MSPR 551, 558-59 (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A reviewer may mitigate insubordination because an employee, although wrong, did what he thought was right. The employee refused to deliver food trays from some carts that he thought were dirty. The Federal Circuit remanded the case for mitigation, <span class="Italic">Washington v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1992 NP No. 91-3592):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Washington's reason for refusing to deliver the food trays, although laudable, does not change the fact of his insubordination. He should have obeyed orders and protested in another way. Nevertheless, his reason for refusing to deliver the food trays must be taken into consideration. As Washington's counsel points out, we are dealing with an unsophisticated food worker in a WG-02 position. An employee who does not know the proper channels through which to funnel complaints against poor management and is frustrated through what he perceives as agency inaction could conceivably, although incorrectly, decide that refusal to perform an assigned task is an appropriate method of getting the message across. To sustain the penalty of removal under these circumstances would not promote the interests of VA patients and the efficiency of the service. The severity of the penalty can only have a chilling effect on any protest by a low level employee to hospital conditions affecting veterans.</p>

But see Aiello v. City of Wilmington,</span> <span class="Italic">Delaware,</span> 623 F.2d 845, 850-52 (3d Cir. 1980), in which the removal of a fireman for breaking into a record shop while inebriated was affirmed because "[e]ven though his drunken state may have effected the <span class="Italic">mens rea</span> necessary to classify his conduct as criminal, it did not deprive the City of the right to levy sanctions against employees who engage in such conduct."</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Suggs v. VA</span>, 113 MSPR 671, 674-77 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-15, 2010 MSPB 99 (2010), offered a brief summary of Board decisions considering mitigating factors as to disrespectful conduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There can be no dispute that disrespectful conduct is a serious offense. <span class="Italic">See Ray v. Department of the Army</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 101, &#x00B6; 58 (2004) ("[D]isrespectful conduct is unacceptable and not conducive to a stable working atmosphere, and...agencies are entitled to expect employees to conduct themselves in conformance with accepted standards.") (internal citations omitted), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 176 Fed. Appx. 110 (Fed. Cir. 2006); <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 472, &#x00B6; 8 (1998) ("[I]nsolent disrespect towards supervisors so seriously undermines the capacity of management to maintain employee efficiency and discipline that no agency should be expected to exercise forbearance for such conduct more than once.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's Table of Penalties is in the record at IAF, Tab 3, Subtab 4j. The sustained charge can be considered either "[d]isrespectful conduct, use of insulting, abusive, or obscene language to or about other personnel" (category number 16) or "insolent, abusive, or obscene language toward immediate or other supervisor having responsibility for the work of the employee" (category number 17). The Table of Penalties states that, for either category, the penalty for a first offense ranges from reprimand to removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also has prior disciplinary history. In October 2008, the agency proposed a 7-day suspension for failure to follow instructions and inappropriate conduct, and Ms. Carrier reduced the penalty to a 3-day suspension. The appellant requested arbitration regarding the discipline, but he was removed before the arbitration occurred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may consider an employee's past disciplinary record when setting a penalty for misconduct, even if it is the subject of a pending grievance. <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service v. Gregory,</span> 534 U.S. 1 (2001). Further, the Board's review of a prior disciplinary action is limited to determining whether that action is clearly erroneous, if the employee was informed of the action in writing, the action is a matter of record, and the employee was permitted to dispute the charges before a higher level of authority than the one that imposed the discipline. <span class="Italic">Bolling v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 9 M.S.P.R. 335, 339-40 (1981). As the administrative judge properly noted, the appellant was informed of the suspension in writing, the action was a matter of record, and he was permitted to dispute the charges to a higher authority, and it does not appear that the agency's action was clearly erroneous. Therefore, we may consider the appellant's 3-day suspension as part of our penalty determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, there are some significant mitigating factors. For instance, on June 29, 2009, after the effective date of the appellant's removal, the agency informed him that he was selected for the position of "Housekeeping Aid[e], WG-3566-3," and that his promotion was effective July 5, 2009. Moreover, the appellant's last performance appraisal, dated October 23, 2008, was "outstanding," and his prior evaluations were "successful" or "fully successful." Additionally, the agency's <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors analysis sheet was inaccurate, in that it stated that the appellant had only 16 months of service. In actuality, the appellant had almost 8 years of service with the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In most cases where removal was upheld based on a single charge of disrespectful conduct (or similarly titled misconduct), the misconduct involved either multiple specifications, an allegation of abusive or obscene language and/or physical action. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Gaines v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 9 (2003), the Board concluded that the administrative judge properly sustained the charge of inappropriate behavior towards his supervisor, explaining that the appellant's actions were serious, because, in response to an order for mandatory overtime, he "became very loud, physically confronted his supervisor in view of other employees, and then ridiculed his supervisor when he tried to summon security police to the workplace...." In <span class="Italic">Kirkland-Zuck v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 12, &#x00B6; 19 (2001), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 48 Fed. Appx. 749 (Fed. Cir. 2002), the Board noted that the appellant's disrespectful conduct was "intentional, repeated, and serious," and it was directed "toward supervisors, coworkers, and non-agency personnel over a several-month period." Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 472, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 11, the Board determined that the appellant's actions, including "interrupting her supervisor's meeting with a non-agency sales representative at least twice, yelling at her supervisor in the presence of co-workers, and advancing towards her menacingly constituted disrespectful conduct." Finally, in <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Department of Justice</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 303, 309-11 (1995), the agency alleged that, during a telephone conversation, the appellant "became irate and responded in a loud voice using obscene language," and in a meeting later that day, the appellant "failed to comport himself in a rational manner, made derogatory remarks, questioned the authority of his supervisors, ridiculed the service, and made several threatening and intimidating remarks using obscene and insulting language."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the other end of the penalty spectrum is <span class="Italic">Gill v. Department of Defense</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 23, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3 (2002), where the administrative judge sustained all three charges (disrespectful conduct, failure to follow instructions and unauthorized disclosure of information) and mitigated the agency's demotion penalty to a 5-day suspension. The Board, however, found that the agency only proved the disrespectful conduct charge. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-24. In discussing the penalty, the Board noted that there were significant mitigating factors, namely that the supervisor "contributed to the conflict by raising his voice and failing to conduct himself in an appropriate manner," the appellant suffered from anxiety and depression, which was known by the supervisor, as well as the appellant's 20 years of service and her recent performance evaluations, which were "excellent" or "outstanding." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 27. Due to the "numerous mitigating factors" in <span class="Italic">Gill</span>, the Board further mitigated the penalty to a letter of reprimand. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having considered this precedent, the fact that the administrative judge only sustained a single charge and specification of disrespectful conduct, and the numerous mitigating factors that are present in this appeal, we conclude that a 30-day suspension is the maximum reasonable penalty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If discord in the office results from an employee's protected activity, some <span id="Page_2649"></span>consideration may be warranted, despite the employee's insubordination, because of the interplay of the work environment and the exercise of protected activity. <span class="Italic">Caddell v. DOJ</span>, 96 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 1996), opined, although it did not result in a favorable outcome for the employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record further suggests that, given the general discord in the Tampa office as amply documented by the Inspector General, and particularly the understandably strained relationship between Caddell and Marshal Cox, a more responsive handling of the situation by the agency, responsive to the values that inhere in the WPA, may have been appropriate. Caddell clearly carried out the responsibilities intended by the Act, and the Government benefitted by his actions. That there was bad blood between him and the supervisor about whom he was whistleblowing should not be thought surprising. The purpose of the WPA is not merely to give an employee technical defenses to overt acts of retribution, but to create an atmosphere within government agencies favorable to the disclosure and correction of improper and illegal acts, especially when they are acts of management officials. <span class="Italic">See</span> WPA, Pub. L. No. 101-12, &#x00A7; 2(b), 103 Stat. 16 (stating that one "purpose of this Act is...to help eliminate wrongdoing within the Government"). In such cases the inevitable strains created within an organization while the improper conduct of supervisors is corrected may result in aberrant behavior, the treatment of which requires considerable sensitivity by senior management. Courts alone cannot ensure the values expressed by Congress in its enactment of the WPA; the pursuit of justice must be a shared endeavor.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Despite occasional qualifications based on extenuating circumstances, insubordination is a serious offense. Past good performance does not compel mitigation of removal for repeated failure to follow instructions, a charge based on repeated misconduct in a short time following a prior suspension--conduct demonstrating a flagrant disregard for authority that undermines the ability of the agency to maintain discipline and execute its mission. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ott v. Dept. of Army</span>, 14 MSPR 642, 646-47 (1983), and 20 MSPR 90, 92 (1984) (violation of orders not to advise a volunteer teacher that she would be paid by the agency). Repeated instances of insubordination indicate little hope for rehabilitation and will sustain a discharge. <span class="Italic">Douglas v. VA</span>, <a href="hope for rehabilitation and will sustain a discharge = no link">5 MSPR 280</a>, 305, 5 MSPB 313, 337 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Redfearn v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 58 MSPR 307, 316 (1993) (dismissal for insubordination and insolent behavior: "[T]he appellant clearly exceeded the limits of acceptable behavior, and, as the administrative judge correctly noted, she has shown no remorse or purpose of amendment."). That the charged misconduct resulted in no harm may not deflect the seriousness of the offense. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Morton v. SSA</span>, AT-0752-14-0806-I-1 (NP 5/27/2015) (charge of failure to follow supervisory instructions and directives: "the appellant specifically asserts that the agency offered no evidence showing that his actions caused harm.

U.S. Postal Service,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 547, 556 (1996), and further, the proven charge itself is a serious offense, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">L'Bert v.

USPS</span>, PH-0752-15-0522-I-1 (NP 10/5/2016) ("This is not a case in which an employee engaged in essentially private defiant behavior towards a supervisor. The appellant broadcast over the walkie-talkie that he was not going to report for work on July 10 so that anyone within range could hear and then followed through by not reporting for duty.
