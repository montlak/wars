<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-253"><span class="space">w.</span> Recovery Period; Willful Violation; Time for Payment</h5>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">FAA and PASS</span>, 66 FLRA 441, 446 (2012), explained that in applying the FLSA, the limitation period of that statute controls, unless the negotiated agreement sets a shorter period of recovery:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the requirements--including time limits--that determine the arbitrability of a grievance are procedural, <span class="Italic">IFPTE, Local 386</span>, 66 FLRA 26, 30 (2011) (<span class="Italic">IFPTE</span>), the recovery period for an FLSA violation set forth in &#x00A7; 255(a) is a question of substantive law and not a procedural issue within the discretion of the arbitrator, <span class="Italic">Local 1741</span>, 62 FLRA at 117; <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA at 1493-94. Accordingly, the Authority has held that, at least where the parties have not agreed contractually to backpay periods different from those in &#x00A7; 255(a), the statutory recovery periods control. <span class="Italic">Local 1741</span>, 62 FLRA at 117. Specifically, the Authority has stated that &#x00A7; 255(a) "limits the period that an employee can recover backpay for [an FLSA] violation." <span class="Italic">IFPTE</span>, 66 FLRA at 29 (quoting <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA at 1488-89). This is especially important because "lengthening the period of recovery [would] expand[ ] an employer's exposure to liability for violating the FLSA," and "[w]hen the employer is a government entity, the FLSA operates as a limited waiver of sovereign immunity--specifically providing a limit on the length of recovery." <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA at 1494.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, &#x00A7; 255(a) sets a maximum recovery period of two years--or three years if the violation was willful. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a). As a matter of law, where an FLSA violation involves the failure to make proper overtime payments, a cause of action accrues with each deficient paycheck, and plaintiffs are entitled to recover for any violations that occurred in the two (or three) years preceding the date of the filing of their claim. <span class="Italic">See Knight v. Columbus, Ga.</span>, 19 F.3d 579, 581 (11th Cir. 1994) (<span class="Italic">Knight</span>); <span class="Italic">Doyle v. United States</span>, 20 Cl. Ct. 495, 503 (Cl. Ct. 1990) (<span class="Italic">Doyle</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator relied upon the parties' agreement to find that the grievance was timely filed under the negotiated grievance procedure. But, as the Union concedes, the only recovery period relied upon by the Arbitrator was the period found in &#x00A7; 255(a).[11] Thus, the Arbitrator was required to apply &#x00A7; 255(a) to any award of backpay. <span class="Italic">Local 1741</span>, 62 FLRA at 117-18; <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA at 1494. Because we deny the Agency's exception challenging the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency's FLSA violations were willful, the three-year recovery period applies here. <span class="Italic">See </span>29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;It is clear that the Arbitrator expressly relied upon &#x00A7; 255 to determine the recovery period. Indeed, the Union acknowledges that the FLSA--and &#x00A7; 255 specifically--provided the basis for the Arbitrator's award, <span class="Italic">see </span>Opp'n at 13 (stating that "the FLSA dictated, and was relied on by the Arbitrator, to define the proper remedy," and that the Arbitrator relied on &#x00A7; 255 "as the foundation for the decision"), and neither of the parties disputes that he was correct to do so. Notably, the dissent cites no other applicable waiver of sovereign immunity--a required element in any arbitral award of monetary damages against a government agency. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Minot Air Force Base, N.D.</span>, 61 FLRA 366, 370 (2005) (then-Member Pope dissenting in part as to another matter). In addition, the authorities relied upon by the dissent to argue that &#x00A7; 255 does not apply are distinguishable because--among other reasons--those authorities are based on the application of equitable doctrines, which, for the reasons discussed <span class="Italic">supra </span>section IV.A.2.b., are not properly before us. <span class="Italic">See Burnett v. N.Y. Cent. R.R. Co.</span>, 380 U.S. 424, 429 (1965) (discussing equitable tolling); <span class="Italic">Nerseth v. United States</span>, 17 Cl.

Kearns ed., 2d ed. 2010) (discussing equitable tolling and equitable estoppel).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the holiday-pay issue, it is undisputed that there were no holiday-pay-overtime underpayments that occurred in the three years preceding the date of the grievance, i.e. June 12, 2006 through June 12, 2009. Therefore, &#x00A7; 255(a) bars the recovery of any holiday-pay overtime. <span class="Italic">See Knight</span>, 19 F.3d at 581; <span class="Italic">Doyle</span>, 20 Cl. Ct. at 503. <span class="Italic">Cf. IFPTE</span>, 66 FLRA at 30 ("the contractual time limit for initiating a grievance claiming a FLSA violation [does not] expand[ ] employer liability"). Accordingly, we set aside the merits award insofar as it provides compensatory and liquidated damages for the Agency's holiday-pay-overtime underpayments.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and FDIC</span>, 53 FLRA 1469, 1484-95 (1998), reversed a line of contrary authority and determined that arbitrators deciding FLSA overtime claims are required to apply the limitations periods expressed in that statute rather than in other statutory limitation periods:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress established in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a) that any action brought under the FLSA "may be commenced within two years after the cause of action accrued,...except that a cause of action arising out of a willful violation may be commenced within three years after the cause of action accrued[.]" However, the Authority has previously held that arbitrators are not required to apply this statute of limitations when awarding backpay for a violation of the FLSA<span class="Italic">. See U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social</span> <span class="Italic">Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland and American</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of Government Employees</span>, 49 FLRA 483, 488-89 (1994) (award granting recovery for 6 years under the Back Pay Act not deficient) (<span class="Italic">SSA III</span>); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 22 <span id="page_2168"></span>and U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Base, Norfolk, Virginia</span>, 48 FLRA 708, 713-14 (1993) (award granting recovery for 6 years "under pertinent laws and regulations, including the Barring Act" not deficient) (<span class="Italic">Naval Base</span>); <span class="Italic">SSA II</span>, 47 FLRA at 829 (award granting recovery for 6 years under the Back Pay Act not deficient). The Authority based this conclusion, first reached in <span class="Italic">SSA II</span>, on four expressed reasons: (1) a remedy for a violation of the FLSA is awarded under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596; (2) nothing in the Back Pay Act limits the period of recovery; (3) no law requires application of the statute of limitations set forth in the FLSA; and (4) arbitrators are given wide latitude to fashion remedies. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA II</span>, 47 FLRA at 828-829.[11]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;In the two cases where the Authority followed the rule established in <span class="Italic">SSA II</span>, no additional reasons were provided for finding that section 255(a) does not apply to FLSA-based claims brought under the negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">See SSA III</span>, 49 FLRA 488-89; <span class="Italic">Naval Base</span>, 48 FLRA at 713-14.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asks us to reverse this Authority precedent, and apply the statute of limitations set forth in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a) to the award of backpay in this case. Our re-examination of the reasoning in <span class="Italic">SSA II</span>, and the parties' arguments here, lead us to conclude that this precedent was wrongly decided. Accordingly, for the reasons explained below, we will no longer follow <span class="Italic">SSA II</span> and its progeny to the extent this precedent holds that an arbitrator, resolving a claim brought under the FLSA, is not bound to apply 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a) to an award of backpay. <span class="Italic">See SSA III</span>, 49 FLRA at 483; <span class="Italic">Naval Base</span>, 48 FLRA at 708; and <span class="Italic">SSA II</span>, 47 FLRA at 819.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">A Violation of the FLSA is Remedied Under the FLSA, Not the Back Pay Act</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority first stated that a violation of the FLSA is remedied under the Back Pay Act in <span class="Italic">SSA I</span>, 44 FLRA at 797-98. However, the exceptions in that case did not question whether the Back Pay Act was the appropriate statutory scheme under which a grievant was entitled to backpay for a violation of the FLSA. This question was squarely presented for the first time in <span class="Italic">SSA II</span>.[12] In concluding that the Back Pay Act applies, the Authority found that "consistent with <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span>, [the arbitrator properly] resolved the dispute...in accordance with the Back Pay Act and the negotiated grievance procedure contained in the parties' collective bargaining agreement." <span class="Italic">SSA II</span>, 47 FLRA at 828 (citing <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span>, 909 F.2d at 1452). Other than this statement, however, the determination that remedies for violations of the FLSA are appropriately resolved under the Back Pay Act was not explained.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;As relevant here, the Authority addressed two exceptions in <span class="Italic">SSA II</span>: first, whether the arbitrator properly applied the applicable OPM regulations and second, whether the Agency had in fact committed an unjustified and unwarranted personnel action under the Back Pay Act. As to the former, the Authority concluded that the arbitrator applied the appropriate regulatory scheme. <span class="Italic">SSA II</span>, 47 FLRA at 829-30. As to the latter, without discussing whether the FLSA itself provided authority for the remedy, the Authority held that the arbitrator's Back Pay Act award was appropriate because the FLSA violation constituted an unjustified and unwarranted personnel action, and but for that action, the grievants would have been entitled to overtime compensation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 828-30.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On re-examination, we conclude that the Authority's reliance in <span class="Italic">SSA II</span> on <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span>, for finding that the Back Pay Act provides the authority for remedying FLSA violations, was misplaced. Nothing in <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span> indicates that the Back Pay Act, and not the FLSA, applies to remedies for violations of the FLSA. Specifically, there is no mention of the Back Pay Act in <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span>. Rather, the court resolved only the issue of its jurisdiction, holding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to address FLSA claims brought by Federal employees who had access to a negotiated grievance procedure.[13]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;The <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span> court based its ruling on section 7121(a) of the Statute, which provides that contractual grievance procedures are the exclusive procedures for resolving grievances. The court rejected the employees' reliance on section 216(b) of the FLSA, which expressly confers jurisdiction on the district court. The court did not address whether remedies for FLSA violations adjudicated in a negotiated grievance procedure are authorized under a statute other than the FLSA itself.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Union notes that, in October 1994, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) was amended to provide that the negotiated grievance procedure "shall be the exclusive <span class="Italic">administrative</span> procedure for resolving grievances which fall within its coverage." Pub. L. No. 103-424, &#x00A7; 9(c), 108 Stat. 4361, 4366 (Oct. 29, 1994) (emphasis added). According to the Union, this amendment effectively overruled <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span>. As this issue is not relevant to deciding this case, we do not address it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a slightly different context, however, the Authority has determined that awards of backpay are not properly granted under the Back Pay Act where there is an independent statutory basis for such an award. Specifically, in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, Army and Air Force Exchange Service and American Federation of Government Employees</span>, 45 FLRA 674, 685-90 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Army Air Force Exchange</span>), the Authority rejected an agency's contention that the sole source of an arbitrator's authority to award backpay is derived from the Back Pay Act. The Authority held that because there was an independent statutory right to recover money damages against the Government under the Prevailing Rate Systems Act and the Tucker Act, the Arbitrator's award was not inconsistent with the Back Pay Act, which did not authorize backpay to the grievants in that case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the FLSA, like the laws at issue in <span class="Italic">Army Air Force Exchange</span>, provides an independent statutory basis for an award of backpay. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> FLSA, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 201 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, <span class="Italic">with</span> Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1346(a)(2) and 1491, <span class="Italic">and</span> Prevailing Rate Systems Act of 1972, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5341-5349. The Authority has already implicitly recognized this in decisions applying the liquidated damages requirement in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 216(b). <span class="Italic">See SSA III</span>, 49 FLRA at 489-90; <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 46 FLRA at 1074. Arbitration awards granting liquidated damages are lawful because the FLSA independently provides entitlement to money damages against a Government employer. Specifically, an award of liquidated damages is proper because the FLSA constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity.[14]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[14]&#x2003;It is well established that the United States, as sovereign, is immune from suit unless it consents to be sued and that "'the terms of its consent to be sued in any court define that court's jurisdiction to entertain the suit.'" <span class="Italic">Department of the Army v. FLRA</span>, 56 F.3d 273, 275 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (quoting <span class="Italic">United States v. Sherwood</span>, 312 U.S. 584, 586 (1941)). In order to waive sovereign immunity, "Congress must 'unequivocally express[ ]' its desire to do so<span class="Italic">." Id.</span> at 277 (quoting <span class="Italic">Irwin v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 498 U.S. 89, 95 (1990)). It is also well established that the statutory waiver provision must unambiguously establish that it extends to and authorizes the award of money damages. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, the agency contended that the arbitrator could not properly award liquidated damages under section 216(b) for a violation of the FLSA because the FLSA does not waive the government's sovereign immunity. 46 FLRA at 1073. The Authority rejected that contention and found that 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 216(b) applies not only to suits brought in Federal or state court, but also to arbitration proceedings. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1072-73. The Authority, relying on <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span>, 909 F.2d at 1452 and <span class="Italic">Army Air Force Exchange</span>, 45 FLRA at 685-90, found that the United States Government, including the agency in that case, could be held liable for the payment of liquidated damages under the FLSA to remedy a violation of that Act despite the fact that an award of liquidated damages is not authorized under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 46 FLRA at 1073. Thus, the Authority found that liquidated damages are properly awarded in arbitration proceedings pursuant to the authority set forth in the FLSA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the FLSA itself is a waiver of sovereign immunity, and independently provides a statutory right to money damages, we find that application of the Back Pay Act is not necessary to award backpay for violations of the FLSA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Although Nothing In the Back Pay Act Limits the Period of Recovery, it is Expressly Limited Under the FLSA</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second premise relied on by the Authority in reaching its conclusion in <span class="Italic">SSA II</span> was that nothing in the Back Pay Act limits the period of recovery for an award of backpay authorized under that Act. This description of the Back Pay Act is not questioned. However, it is not relevant in this case since, as explained in the preceding section, the backpay at issue here is not awarded based on an "unjustified and unwarranted personnel action" under the Back Pay Act, but rather, is properly awarded under the FLSA itself.[15]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[15]&#x2003;We note that the cases relied on in <span class="Italic">SSA II</span> for the premise that the Back Pay Act does not limit a grievant's recovery period, with the exception of <span class="Italic">International Association of Firefighters, Local 13 and Panama Canal Commission, General Services Bureau, Balboa, Republic of Panama</span>, 43 FLRA 1012 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Panama Canal</span>), involved only a violation of the collective bargaining agreement, not an independent statutory scheme. In each of these cases, the violations of the collective bargaining agreement were the unjustified and unwarranted personnel actions that gave rise to awards of backpay under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Department of the Army, New Cumberland Army Depot, New Cumberland, Pennsylvania and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2004</span>, 40 FLRA 186 (1991); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Avionics Center, Indianapolis, Indiana and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1744</span>, 37 FLRA 406 (1990). In such circumstances, without the Back Pay Act, the grievants would not have been entitled to an award of backpay or attorney fees. In <span class="Italic">Panama Canal</span>, which involved application of the Barring Act to a backpay award for a violation of the FLSA, the Authority simply assumed that the Back Pay Act authorized the award, and did not address application of the FLSA itself.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a) specifically provides that an action <span id="page_2169"></span>brought under the FLSA "may be commenced within two years after the cause of action accrued,...except that a cause of action arising out of a willful violation may be commenced within three years after the cause of action accrued[.]" Section 255(a) both limits an employee's ability to bring a cause of action for a violation of the FLSA and limits the period that an employee can recover backpay for such a violation. <span class="Italic">See McLaughlin v. Richland Shoe Co.</span>, 486 U.S. 128 (1988) (section 255(a) encompasses the standards subjecting an employer to either two or three years of liability) (<span class="Italic">McLaughlin</span>). <span class="Italic">See also Ellison v. United States</span>, 25 Cl. Ct. 481, 488 (1992) ("[I]f the [employer's] actions are found to be 'willful' within the meaning of this statutory provision, the plaintiff will be entitled to back pay for a three-year period.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Law and Precedent Requires Application of the FLSA Statute of Limitations to Awards of Backpay for Violations of the FLSA</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The third premise relied on by the Authority in <span class="Italic">SSA II</span> was that there is no "law or precedent that requires arbitrators in deciding backpay cases for Federal employees under the FLSA to use the FLSA statute of limitations in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a) instead of the Back Pay Act in determining appropriate remedies for agency violations." <span class="Italic">SSA II</span>, 47 FLRA at 829. For the following reasons, we find that this premise is erroneous.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we note that the Authority did not explain its statement in <span class="Italic">SSA II</span> that arbitrators are not required by law to apply the FLSA statute of limitations for violations of that Act. This finding was subsequently challenged, however, in the agency's exception ruled on in <span class="Italic">Naval Base</span>. The agency claimed that the award of backpay for a violation of the FLSA was deficient because it was not limited in accordance with the FLSA statute of limitations in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a). <span class="Italic">Naval Base</span>, 48 FLRA at 711. In particular, the agency argued that awarding backpay without regard to section 255(a) was inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Acton v. United States</span>, 932 F.2d 1464, 1466 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (<span class="Italic">Acton</span>). According to the agency, <span class="Italic">Acton</span>, which held that the "Claims Court must use the statutory source of entitlement to the payment [of backpay] to determine the correct statute of limitations[,]" was similarly applicable in the context of the negotiated grievance procedure. 932 F.2d at 1466. Specifically, the agency claimed that arbitrators, like the claims court, must use the FLSA statute of limitations because the statutory source of entitlement to backpay is the FLSA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency also argued that in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, the Authority established that the FLSA provides a basis for a remedy without regard to the Back Pay Act and recognized that the FLSA contained provisions concerning entitlement to backpay that are different from the backpay provisions in Title 5. Specifically, the agency argued that if arbitrators can apply provisions of the FLSA that provide benefits beyond those authorized by Title 5, then the more restrictive provisions of the FLSA, such as the statute of limitations, must also be applied by arbitrators. <span class="Italic">Naval Base</span>, 48 FLRA at 712. In resolving the agency's exception, however, the Authority neither addressed these arguments nor reconciled this conflict in its precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a) is an integral part of the FLSA that operates as a substantive right under that Act. Generally, substantive rights afforded in a statute differ from procedural rights because substantive rights are incorporated into the negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">Cf. American Federation of Government Employees, Local 940 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</span>, 52 FLRA 1429, 1438-40 (1997) (finding that standards and burdens of proof are substantive and are therefore, applicable in the context of the negotiated grievance procedure). In this respect, statutes of limitations are considered an integral part of the substantive rights afforded by a statute because time limitations on enforcing a statutory right not only bar recovery but extinguish the underlying rights and liabilities of the parties. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., William v. Danzer Co. v. Gulf Rail Road</span>, 268 U.S. 633, 635-37 (1925); <span class="Italic">Kalmich v. Bruno</span>, 553 F.2d 549, 552 (7th Cir. 1977) ("State law barring an action because of a statute of limitations is sufficiently 'substantive' in the <span class="Italic">Erie</span>, sense that a federal court in that state exercising diversity jurisdiction must respect it.")<span class="Italic">. Cf. Guaranty Trust Co. of New York v. York</span>, 326 U.S. 99, 108 (state statutes of limitations are not of "a mere remedial character" that a Federal court can disregard); <span class="Italic">Moser v. Universal Engineering Corp.</span>, 11 F.3d 720, 724 n.6 (7th Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The conclusion that section 255(a) establishes a substantive right that should be applied in negotiated grievance procedures finds support in the policies and Congressional intent underlying the FLSA's statute of limitations. In particular, civil actions brought under the FLSA were originally governed by state statutes of limitations. <span class="Italic">McLaughlin</span>, 486 U.S. at 131. Congress, responding to the Supreme Court's expansive reading of the FLSA, enacted a 2-year statute of limitations. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 131-32. The Supreme Court interprets this history as evidencing Congress' intent both to limit the employer's liability and to ensure that employees are adequately compensated<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Congress also amended 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a) "to draw a significant distinction" between willful and nonwillful violations. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 132. This distinction in section 255(a) establishes standards by which violations of the FLSA are to be judged, and supports a finding that Congress viewed this section as a substantive part of the FLSA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress did not amend section 255(a) when it extended the FLSA to Federal employees. This supports the view that Congress intended that such claims be resolved under the same standards and statute of limitations applicable to private sector employees. The failure to apply 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a) in the context of negotiated grievance procedures would defeat the Congressional purpose in creating a two-tiered level of responsibility for violations of the FLSA and ignore a substantive part of the FLSA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with this, courts award backpay to Federal employees under the FLSA without regard to the Back Pay Act<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Amshey v. United States</span>, 26 Cl. Ct. 582 (Cl. Ct. 1992); <span class="Italic">Beebe v. United States</span>, 640 F.2d 1283 (Ct. Cl. 1981). In addition, OPM, which has statutory responsibility to administer the FLSA pursuant to 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 204(f), views application of section 255(a) as a substantive part of the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Matter of Ford</span>, 73 Comp. Gen. 157, 160 (1994) (where the Comptroller General discussed OPM's support for applying FLSA statutory time limitations to administrative claims brought by Federal employees) (<span class="Italic">Ford</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Ford</span>, the Comptroller General, who is charged with resolving claims under the FLSA, reversing his prior position, applied section 255(a) to claims brought by government employees. The Comptroller General had previously declined to apply section 255(a), and instead applied the 6-year statute of limitations set forth in 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3702(b) for claims filed against the Government Accounting Office (GAO). <span class="Italic">See id</span>. OPM urged the Comptroller General to change its practice and "point[ed] out that in the Federal Employees Pay Comparability (FEPCA) Act of 1990, Congress recognized the distinct and separate overtime entitlements of those [F]ederal employees covered by [the] FLSA and those FLSA-exempt [F]ederal employees covered by various title 5 pay provisions whose claims remain subject to a 6-year statute of limitations<span class="Italic">." Id.</span> OPM also pointed out that the courts apply section 255(a) to Federal employee overtime pay claims arising under that Act<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> The Comptroller General, after reviewing these arguments and other policy considerations, found that the "premise underlying [its] earlier decisions--that a limitation on claims expressed in terms of judicial actions should be distinguished from administrative proceedings to adjudicate the same claims--runs counter to general principles of law<span class="Italic">." Id.</span> Accordingly, the Comptroller General held that "a time limitation imposed on a statutorily created judicial cause of action will apply to administrative proceedings to adjudicate the same claims absent a specific provision to the contrary<span class="Italic">." Id.</span> at 161.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Ford</span> involved a claim brought before GAO and the position taken by OPM was persuasive in that context. We find that it is similarly compelling when applied to claims brought under the FLSA in a negotiated grievance procedure. Specifically, such claims are also brought by Federal employees pursuant to the same statutory structure. Thus, the positions of the Comptroller General and OPM support a conclusion that 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a) is a substantive right under the FLSA and is applicable to claims brought in the negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that any inconsistent statutory provisions of the FLSA and the Back Pay Act must be resolved in favor of applying the terms of the FLSA. This is consistent with the well-established principle of statutory construction that "[w]here one statute deals with a subject in general terms, and another deals with a part of the same subject in a more detailed way, the two should be harmonized if possible; but if there is a conflict, the latter will prevail." Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction &#x00A7; 51.05 (5th ed. 1992). Because the FLSA deals specifically with the narrow and precise subject of employee compensation and overtime entitlements, it is a "special act." <span class="Italic">See id.</span> In contrast, the Back Pay Act is a "general act," governing the universe of "unjustified and unwarranted personnel actions." As such, any conflicts between the remedial provisions of these two laws requires us to apply the FLSA and not the Back Pay Act, as controlling.[16]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[16]&#x2003;We note that the D.C. Circuit has held that the Back Pay Act can be viewed as an "auxiliary measure" in connection with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Secretary of the Army</span>, 918 F.2d 214, 217 (D.C. Cir. 1990). We do not reach the question of whether the Back Pay Act could ever provide "auxiliary" rights or obligations in a grievance arbitration regarding the FLSA, and herein address only the question of the statute of limitations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons explained here, we now find, contrary to the view previously stated in <span class="Italic">SSA II</span>, 47 FLRA at 828-29, that there is substantial law and precedent requiring that 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a) be applied in a negotiated grievance procedure. This provision is an integral part of the substantive statute giving rise to the award of backpay, and cannot be disregarded.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The FLSA Limits the Latitude Afforded Arbitrators to Fashion Remedies for Violations of the FLSA</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fourth and final premise underlying the Authority's ruling in <span class="Italic">SSA II</span> was the general proposition that arbitrators have "great latitude and discretion in fashioning remedies." <span class="Italic">SSA II</span>, 47 FLRA at 829. This principle derives from private sector cases involving the resolution of violations of contract provisions. <span class="Italic">See United Steel Workers of America v. Enterprise <span id="page_2170"></span>Wheel &#x0026; Car Corp.</span>, 363 U.S. 593, 597 (1960); <span class="Italic">Lodge No. 12, District No. 37, International Association of Machinists v. Cameron Iron Works, Inc.</span>, 292 F.2d 112, 119 (5th Cir. 1961). In applying this principle to arbitration awards involving enforcement of a statutory right, the Authority has not previously addressed whether a statutory basis for a grievance places any limits on an arbitrator's remedial latitude. Specifically, it is necessary to reconcile the premise that arbitrators have wide remedial latitude with the central principle that when arbitrators substitute for other adjudicators, they are bound by the same substantive standards as those other adjudicators.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, the purpose of arbitration in the Federal sector labor context is "not only to ensure compliance with collective bargaining agreements, but also 'to review or police compliance with controlling laws, rules, and regulations by [F]ederal agency employers and employees alike.'" <span class="Italic">Devine v.

<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court has held in the context of private sector arbitration "that '[b]y agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim, a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral, rather than a judicial, forum.'" <span class="Italic">Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.</span>, 500 U.S. 20, 26 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Gilmer</span>) (quoting <span class="Italic">Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.</span>, 473 U.S. 614, 628 (1985) (<span class="Italic">Mitsubishi</span>)). Additionally, the Court found that as "'long as the prospective litigant effectively may vindicate [his or her] statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum, the statute will continue to serve both its remedial and deterrent function.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 28 (quoting <span class="Italic">Mitsubishi</span>, 473 U.S. at 637) (discussing the Age Discrimination in Employment Act). Consistent with <span class="Italic">Gilmer</span>, the court in <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span> also ruled that a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by a statute by agreeing to arbitrate a claim brought under the FLSA. Specifically, the court acknowledged that "'the collective bargaining mechanisms created by Title VII [5 USC &#x00A7; 7101-7904) do not deprive employees of recourse to any of the remedies otherwise provided by statute or regulation[.]'" <span class="Italic">Carter v.

<p class="noindent-1">Disregarding the FLSA statute of limitations by reducing the period of recovery would deprive the grievants of their statutory right to recover for either a full 2 or 3 year period.&#x2003;Conversely, disregarding the statute of limitations by lengthening the period of recovery expands an employer's exposure to liability for violating the FLSA. When the employer is a government entity, the FLSA operates as a limited waiver of sovereign immunity--specifically providing a limit on the length of recovery. In <span class="Italic">United States v. Kubrick</span>, 444 U.S. 111 (1979) <span class="Italic">(Kubrick)</span>, the Supreme Court, addressing another law that similarly waives sovereign immunity, recognized that "[w]e should also have in mind that the Act waives the immunity of the United States and that in construing the statute of limitations, which is a condition of that waiver, we should not take it upon ourselves to extend the waiver beyond that which Congress intended<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 117-18. Moreover, disregarding section 255(a) when claims are pursued in negotiated grievance procedures would undermine the deterrent and remedial function of the FLSA's two-tiered statute of limitations, and thereby defeat part of the function of the FLSA based only on the fact that an arbitrator was resolving the claim rather than a court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Award is Deficient Because It is</span> <span class="Italic">Contrary to 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The foregoing analysis leads us to find that 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a) applies to grievances claiming violations of the FLSA, and thus, arbitrators are bound to apply that section<span class="Italic">. Accord</span> <span class="Italic">Acton</span>, 932 F.2d at 1466 (finding that in determining the appropriate statute of limitations period the statutory source of backpay entitlement should be utilized). Consistent with this finding, we will no longer follow <span class="Italic">SSA II</span> and its progeny to the extent this precedent holds that an arbitrator, resolving a claim brought under the FLSA, is not bound to apply 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a) to an award of backpay. <span class="Italic">See SSA III</span>, 49 FLRA at 483; <span class="Italic">Naval Base</span>, 48 FLRA at 708; and SSA <span class="Italic">II</span>, 47 FLRA at 819.[17]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[17]&#x2003;We note that the Authority has also held, relying on <span class="Italic">SSA</span> <span class="Italic">II</span>, that an award is not deficient where an arbitrator followed the period limiting the filing of grievances that the parties set in their collective bargaining agreement, rather than the statute of limitations established in section 255(a). <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane</span> <span class="Italic">Division, Crane, Indiana and American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Local 1415</span>, 49 FLRA 27, 31 (1994) (recovery for FLSA violation limited to 20 days based on the parties' agreement) <span class="Italic">(Naval Surface); National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. and</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1831</span>, 48 FLRA 841, 845 (1993) (recovery for FLSA violation limited to 30 days based on the parties' agreement, and claim for FLSA violation is barred unless brought within that period) <span class="Italic">(National Gallery).

<p class="noindent-2">The analysis here points to the likelihood that this precedent was also wrongly decided. However, as the Arbitrator in this case did not rely on, or even consider, the parties' agreement in limiting the grievants' recovery, the issue of whether, in a collective bargaining agreement, parties can agree to a recovery period different from that set forth in section 255(a) is not necessarily before us. Since we need not address this Authority precedent in order to resolve this case, we do not do so here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying section 255(a) to this case, we conclude that the time limit on the Arbitrator's award of backpay, which does not extend to the full period of recovery required in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a), is deficient. Because the Arbitrator did not determine whether the Agency's violation of the FLSA was willful under section 255(a), we are unable to determine whether the 2-year or the 3-year statute of limitations applies. Therefore, we remand the award to the parties for submission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for a determination as to the appropriate statute of limitations under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a) to be applied in computing the amount of backpay awarded to those liquidators and examiners who were wrongfully classified as exempt from the FLSA.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held, at least where parties have not agreed contractually to back pay periods different from those in &#x00A7; 255(a), that the statutory periods control. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute, Ind.,</span> 60 FLRA 298, 299-300 (2004) <span class="Italic">(BOP, Terre Haute); United States Dep't of Commerce, Nat'l Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin., Office of NOAA Corps Operations, Atlantic Marine Center, Norfolk, Va.,</span> 55 FLRA 816, 821 (1999) <span class="Italic">(NOAA); NTEU,</span> 53 FLRA 1469, 1494 (1998). Specifically, the Authority has concluded that this question is one of substantive law and not a procedural issue within the discretion of the arbitrator, <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> 53 FLRA at 1490, 1493-94, and that an award limiting the recovery period of back pay to the filing date of the grievance is contrary to law, <span class="Italic">NOAA,</span> 55 FLRA at 821.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found that the grievance was timely filed on January 14, 2000. However, he then limited the back pay remedy to April 3, 2001, the day he found the grievance became "effective" because the parties requested a panel of arbitrators. In reaching this conclusion, the Arbitrator relied on private sector arbitration awards limiting the back pay period of "continuing" grievances. The Arbitrator's failure to apply the FLSA statute of limitations in computing back pay is contrary to the above case law, which holds that an arbitrator does not have the discretion to ignore the FLSA recovery period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator's decision on the liability period is a matter of procedural arbitrability within the discretion of the Arbitrator, not the Authority. However, the Authority has held that a challenge concerning the recovery period for back pay under the FLSA is not an issue of procedural arbitrability. <span class="Italic">BOP, Terre Haute,</span> 60 FLRA at 299. As explained above, the Authority has specifically held that the recovery period under the FLSA is a substantive matter, rather than a procedural matter. <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> 53 FLRA at 1490, 1493-94; <span class="Italic">NOAA,</span> 55 FLRA at 821. The Agency's argument is thus unavailing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that the issue of the limitation period is "moot" because no violation was found and no damages awarded. It is well established that a dispute becomes moot when the parties no longer have a legally cognizable interest in the outcome and that the burden of demonstrating that neither party has a legally cognizable interest is a heavy one and is on the party urging mootness. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Metro. Detention Cent'r, Guaynabo, P.R.,</span> 59 FLRA 787, 790 (2004). The party urging mootness meets its burden by demonstrating that: (1) there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur; and (2) interim relief or events have completely or irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As explained above, because the back pay period extends 2 or 3 years prior to the time the grievance was filed in January 2000, depending on whether a violation is determined to be willful, the Union has a legally cognizable right to establish the Agency's liability for any part of that period. The Arbitrator refused to consider any evidence concerning the period prior to April 2001. September 23, 2004, As the Arbitrator did not have any evidence concerning these claims before him, his finding that the Agency did not violate the FLSA after this period does not resolve the prior claims. As these claims were properly before the Arbitrator and are unresolved, the Agency has not established that they are moot.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For these reasons, the Arbitrator's failure to apply the recovery period set out in the FLSA is deficient. As the Arbitrator did not permit the Union to present evidence concerning claims during this period and did not make <span id="page_2171"></span>any findings concerning this period, we do not have a sufficient record before us to resolve these claims. When the record does not contain sufficient findings for the Authority to resolve the necessary claims, it remands the award to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator, absent settlement, for further findings. <span class="Italic">E.g., NTEU,</span> 61 FLRA 729, 733 (2006) (when the arbitrator erred in finding the grievance not substantively arbitrable, award was remanded); <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1437,</span> 53 FLRA 1703, 1710-12 (1998) (remand when insufficient record evidence to resolve overtime pay claims); <span class="Italic">NOAA,</span> 55 FLRA at 821 (same). Accordingly, we remand this issue to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement.</p>
<p class="noindent">The statutory period of two years for FLSA recovery precludes an award covering less time if the contract does not set a shorter time, and an arbitrator's award will be modified to conform to the statute, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3955 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCC Tucson,</span> 69 FLRA 133, 134 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Arbitrator's award is contrary to the FLSA's statute of limitations because the award limits the period of recovery for liquidated damages to less than two years. Section 255(a) of Chapter 29 of the U.S. Code establishes that any action brought under the FLSA "may be commenced within two years after the cause of action accrued...except that a cause of action arising out of a willful violation may be commenced within three years after the cause of action accrued."[9] The Authority has previously held that, at least where there is no indication that the parties have agreed contractually to backpay recovery periods different from those in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a),[10] an "award limiting the recovery period for backpay to the filing date of the grievance[ ] is contrary to 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a)."[11]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator limited the recovery period to slightly more than one year--from May 29, 2014, the date that the Agency responded to the Union's grievance, to June 19, 2015, the date that the award issued. However, the parties do not claim, and the Arbitrator did not find, that they agreed contractually to a recovery period different from the recovery windows set forth in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a). Therefore, the award is contrary to 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a), as it violates the grievants' statutory right to recover liquidated damages for up to a two-year period. As such, we grant the Union's exception that the award is contrary to law insofar as the award restricts the recovery period for liquidated damages arising from violations of the FLSA to less than two years.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In order to determine whether a two or three-year recovery period should apply under the FLSA, it is necessary to determine whether the employer's actions were willful. <span class="Italic">See NOAA</span>, 55 FLRA at 821. An FLSA violation is willful if the employer knew or showed reckless disregard for whether its conduct was prohibited by the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See McLaughlin v. Richland Shoe Co.</span>, 486 U.S. 128, 133 (1988). If the employer acts unreasonably, but not recklessly, in determining its obligations under the FLSA, then the resulting actions are not willful. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 135 n.13; <span class="Italic">Lopez v. Corporaci&#x00F3;n Azucarera de P.R.</span>, 938 F.2d 1510, 1515 (1st Cir. 1991). An employer's violation is not willful if the employer made efforts to keep abreast of FLSA requirements but failed to do so because of mistaken interpretations of the law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mireles v. Frio Foods, Inc.</span>, 899 F.2d 1407, 1416 (5th Cir. 1990) (employer discussed regulations with Texas Employment Commission and received pertinent brochures and pamphlets). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Commerce, Nat'l Oceanic &#x0026; Atmospheric Admin., Office of Marine &#x0026; Aviation Operations, Marine Operations Ctr., Norfolk, Va.</span>, 57 FLRA 559, 564 (2001), <span class="Italic">recons. denied</span>, 57 FLRA 723 (2002) (employer directed experienced labor counsel to research issue and provide written report).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator did not make any factual findings regarding willfulness. As relevant here, the Arbitrator made no findings as to whether the Agency made efforts to ascertain the requirements of the FLSA and/or whether its violation of the FLSA resulted from mistaken interpretations of the law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the fact that the Arbitrator awarded liquidated damages does not demonstrate that a remand is unwarranted. In this regard, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 216(b) and 260 establish a presumption that liquidated damages are warranted, unless the employer meets its "substantial burden" of proving that its actions were in good faith and were reasonable.[4] <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Commerce, Nat'l Oceanic &#x0026; Atmospheric Admin., Office of Marine &#x0026; Aviation Operations, Marine Operations Ctr., Va.,</span> 57 FLRA 430, 435 (2001) (<span class="Italic">Marine Operations Ctr</span>.). By contrast, the party seeking backpay for a three-year period under &#x00A7; 255(a) has the burden of demonstrating willfulness. <span class="Italic">See Cox v. Brookshire Grocery Co.</span>, 919 F.2d 354, 356 (5th Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">Cox</span>). The fact that an agency has not overcome the presumption in favor of liquidated damages does not establish that the violation was willful. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA at 1496 &#x0026; 1484 (Authority remanded for willfulness determination even though liquidated damages were warranted). <span class="Italic">Cf. Marine Operations Ctr.</span>, 57 FLRA at 435 (arbitrator found agency actions not willful but Authority remanded award to determine whether liquidated damages were appropriate). <span class="Italic">Cf. also Cox</span>, 919 F.2d at 357 (finding violation not willful does not preclude award of liquidated damages).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 216(b) provides, in pertinent part, that an employer who violates the FLSA is liable for the amount of unpaid overtime and "an additional equal amount as liquidated damages." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260 provides, in pertinent part, that liquidated damages may be reduced or eliminated "if the employer shows...that the act or omission giving rise to such action was in good faith and that he had reasonable grounds for believing that his act or omission was not a violation of the [FLSA]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has remanded awards where an arbitrator did not make factual findings regarding whether an agency's actions were willful, and the record did not permit the Authority to make that determination. <span class="Italic">See NOAA</span>, 55 FLRA at 821; <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA at 1495. As the Arbitrator in this case made no factual findings concerning whether the Agency's violation was willful, and the record does not permit the Authority to make that determination, we remand the awards for a determination as to whether the Agency's actions were willful.</p>
<p class="noindent">The element of willfulness was considered by <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Jesup and AFGE Local 3981</span>, 69 FLRA 197, 205-06 (2016) (Member Pizzella dissenting in part):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the award is contrary to law because the Arbitrator applied the wrong legal standard when he concluded that the Agency did not willfully violate the FLSA.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">McLaughlin v. Richland Shoe Co</span>., the Supreme Court articulated the standard required for finding an employer's violation willful under the FLSA.[107] Under <span class="Italic">McLaughlin</span>, the plaintiff must establish that "the employer either knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the [FLSA]."[108] As relevant here, "reckless disregard" of the requirements of the FLSA "means failure to make adequate inquiry into whether conduct is in compliance with the [FLSA]."[109] That said, "failure to make adequate inquiry" means "more than a merely negligent or unreasonable failure."[110] In this respect, a willful violation occurs when an employer shows "evident indifference" to the FLSA's requirements.[111] For example, employers have been found to willfully violate the FLSA where they ignored the advice of legal counsel or a relevant regulatory agency, or were previously penalized for a similar FLSA violation.[112] In contrast, an employer does not willfully violate the FLSA if the employer made efforts to keep abreast of FLSA requirements, but failed to do so because of mistaken interpretations of the law.[113] Nor is an employer's violation necessarily willful if the employer simply fails to seek legal advice concerning its pay practices.[114]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator held that "if the Agency withheld paying overtime compensation for what it earnestly believed was a valid reason," then the Agency's violation was not willful. Conversely, he held that if the Agency "purposely" violated the FLSA, and, "with malice, knowingly [kept] employees from legitimate remuneration," then the Agency's violation was willful.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2172"></span>Applying this standard, the Arbitrator found that the "Agency demonstrated that it had a legitimate reason to question" whether the employees at issue were entitled to overtime pay. Accordingly, the Arbitrator concluded that "the Union did not bear its burden" to prove that the Agency "purposefully disregarded existing rules and/or practices by withholding overtime payments." Thus, the Arbitrator determined that the Agency's violation was not willful, and that employees were entitled to two, not three, years of backpay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that, by requiring that the Union prove that the Agency acted with purpose or malice to establish that the Agency willfully violated the FLSA, the Arbitrator failed to apply the appropriate standard. The Union is correct. The Union needed to demonstrate that the Agency either knew or showed reckless disregard for its failure to pay the employees' overtime--not that the Agency: "purposely" violated the FLSA; "with malice, knowingly [kept] employees from legitimate remuneration"; or "purposefully disregarded existing rules and/or practices by withholding overtime payments." Thus, the Arbitrator failed to apply the correct legal standard in determining whether the Agency's conduct was willful.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated previously, an arbitrator's failure to apply the correct legal analysis does not render the award deficient where the Authority determines that "the arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with law, based on the underlying factual findings."[122] However, the Authority's ability to review <span class="Italic">de novo</span> the arbitrator's legal conclusions is dependent on the sufficiency of the record before it.[123] Thus, if an award fails to contain the factual findings necessary to enable the Authority to assess the arbitrator's legal conclusions, and the necessary findings cannot be derived from the record, the award will be set aside and the case will be remanded to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator so that the requisite findings can be made.[124]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator did not make sufficient findings of fact for the Authority to determine, under the correct standard, whether the Agency's FLSA violation was willful.

<p class="noindent-1">In its exceptions, the Union argues that the Arbitrator's conclusion that the Agency did not willfully violate the FLSA is contrary to law because the Arbitrator: (1) misapplied the law; (2) failed to make factual findings regarding the Agency's investigation into, and interpretation of, the requirements of the FLSA; and (3) relied on the alleged nonfact that the Agency was not aware of the pay practices at other institutions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the FLSA, an employer's conduct is willful if the employer "either knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the statute."[37] And "[r]eckless disregard of the requirements of the [FLSA] means failure to make adequate inquiry into whether conduct is in compliance with the [FLSA]."[38] However, an employer that "acts unreasonably, but not recklessly, in determining its legal obligation" does not willfully violate the FLSA [39] because "failure to make adequate inquiry" means "more than a merely negligent or unreasonable failure."[40]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found that the Union failed to prove that the Agency willfully violated the FLSA because there was "no evidence" that management "knew its conduct violated the FLSA, yet refused to compensate its employees." In particular, the Arbitrator found that: (1) the Agency had engaged in the challenged pay practice for at least twenty-five years without any complaints or inquiries; (2) there was no evidence that management was aware of the pay practices at other institutions; and (3) management was not aware that its conduct violated the FLSA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Union's claim that the Agency had knowledge that its practice violated the FLSA because different institutions paid for similar travel time, we have denied the Union's nonfact exception challenging the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency was unaware of the practices at other institutions. Thus, we defer to that finding. Further, the Arbitrator's findings regarding willfulness are consistent with federal court decisions interpreting the FLSA's willfulness standard. For example, where, as here, an employer's incorrect determination that its pay practice complied with the FLSA went unchallenged for many years, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims found that this fact weighed against finding a willful FLSA violation.[43] In contrast, federal courts have found willful violations where, for example, an employer ignored the advice of legal counsel or a relevant regulatory agency, or had been penalized for a similar previous FLSA violation.[44] The Union does not argue that such circumstances are present here. Consequently, we find that the Union has not established that the Arbitrator erred, as a matter of law, in finding that the Agency did not willfully violate the FLSA.</p>

<p class="noindent">Although the FLSA sets a maximum recovery period, it does not limit the terminus of FLSA liability, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Army Tank-Automotive &#x0026; Armaments Command and AFGE Local 1658</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-124.html">61 FLRA 637</a>, 639-40 (2006):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the FLSA, a cause of action may be commenced within two years after the cause of action accrued, except that a cause of action arising out of a willful violation may be commenced within three years after the cause of action accrued. <span class="Italic">See </span>29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 551.702(a) and (c). Further, 5 C.F.R. <span id="page_2173"></span>&#x00A7; 551.702(c) states that "[i]f a claim for back pay is established, the claimant will be entitled to pay for a period of up to 2 years (3 years for a willful violation) back <span class="Italic">from the date the claim was received</span>." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.702(c) (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Agency's claim that the award is contrary to law because it awards backpay for the period of time after February 7, 2003--the date the grievance was filed--the Authority has held under similar circumstances that a statute of limitations operates to determine the earliest date that liability may be established; it does not establish when the liability ends. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin., Airways Facility Serv., Nat'l Airways Sys. Eng'g Div., Okla. City, Okla</span>., 60 FLRA 565, 569-70 (2005) (Back Pay Act). Consistent with this principle, the Authority has upheld an award of overtime pay for the period after a grievance was filed. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Commerce, Nat'l Oceanic &#x0026; Atmospheric Admin., Office of Marine &#x0026; Aviation Operations, Marine Operations Ctr., Va</span>., 57 FLRA 430 (2001) (<span class="Italic">NOAA</span>); <span class="Italic">see also Rushing v.

Based on the foregoing, we find that the Agency has not demonstrated that the award is contrary to law in this respect, and deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the Agency's claim that the award is contrary to law because it awards backpay retroactive to more than two years before the grievance was filed, the record establishes that the grievance was filed on February 7, 2003. Thus, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.702(c), the Arbitrator was prohibited from awarding backpay for disputed work performed prior to February 7, 2001. The Arbitrator ordered the Agency to pay grievant Hawk overtime beginning in October 2001, grievant Payne overtime beginning in November 2001, and grievant Lee overtime beginning in March 2003. As the awards were within the statutory period, we find that the Agency has not established that the award is contrary to law, and deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 987 and Dept. of Air Force, Robins AFB</span>, 66 FLRA 143, 147-48 (2011), also noted that the statutory maximum for ordinary FLSA recover is two years prior to the grievance, but no statute limits the period of recovery after the grievance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The award is deficient because it does not permit the grievant to recover underpayments for two years prior to the grievance filing, as well as for the time between the grievance filing and the arbitration record closing. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that, at least where there is no indication that parties have agreed contractually to backpay recovery periods different from those in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a), the question of the applicable recovery period is one of substantive law and not a procedural issue within the discretion of the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Penitentiary, Terre Haute, Ind.</span>, 60 FLRA 298, 299-300 (2004) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Commerce, Nat'l Oceanic &#x0026; Atmospheric Admin., Office of NOAA Corps Operations, Atl.

Specifically, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a) provides that a FLSA cause of action "may be commenced within two years after the cause of action accrued,...except that a cause of action arising out of a willful violation may be commenced within three years after the cause of action accrued."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where &#x00A7; 255(a) applies, the Authority has held that the provision "both limits an employee's ability to bring a cause of action for a violation of the FLSA and limits the period that an employee can recover backpay for such a violation." <span class="Italic">IFPTE, Local 386</span>, 66 FLRA 26, 29 (2011) (<span class="Italic">IFPTE</span>) (quoting <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA at 1488-89) (internal quotation marks omitted). <span class="Italic">See also </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.702(b) (implementing &#x00A7; 255(a) statute of limitations); <span class="Italic">id. </span>&#x00A7; 551.702(c) ("If a claim for back pay [for a non-willful FLSA violation] is established, the claimant will be entitled to pay for a period of up to [two] years...back from the date the claim was received."). Where there is no dispute as to the applicable recovery period and no indication that the parties have agreed contractually to a recovery period different from that set by &#x00A7; 255(a), the Authority has applied the &#x00A7; 255(a) recovery period to a grievant's FLSA claims. <span class="Italic">IFPTE</span>, 66 FLRA at 30 &#x0026; n.4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the grievant is entitled to damages "for the full statutory recovery period of two years prior to the filing of the grievance," which is consistent with the period provided by &#x00A7; 255(a) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.702(c) for non-willful FLSA violations. The Agency neither disputes the propriety of that recovery period nor proposes a different recovery period. <span class="Italic">See IFPTE</span>, 66 FLRA at 30 &#x0026; n.4. In addition, neither party identifies a provision of their collective bargaining agreement calling for a recovery period at odds with &#x00A7; 255(a) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.702(c). <span class="Italic">See id.; NOAA</span>, 55 FLRA at 821; <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA at 1494. Therefore, we modify the award to allow the grievant to recover underpayments for his liquidated aged comp time, as well as an equal amount in liquidated damages, for up to two years prior to the grievance filing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the grievant is entitled to recover for a period of time <span class="Italic">after </span>the filing of the grievance as well--specifically, the period of time between the grievance filing date and the date that the arbitration record closed. The Arbitrator found, and the parties do not dispute, that as of that latter date, the grievant was still not being paid for his liquidated aged comp time at the correct rate. <span class="Italic">See </span>Award at 4-5 (stating that grievant "might" have been paid some past due compensation <span class="Italic">after </span>the arbitration hearing). The Authority has held that the FLSA statute of limitations operates to determine the earliest date that liability may be established; it does not establish when the liability ends. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Army, Army Tank-Automotive &#x0026; Armaments Command, Warren, Mich.</span>, 61 FLRA 637, 639-40 (2006) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin., Airways Facility Serv., Nat'l Airways Sys. Eng'g Div., Okla. City, Okla.</span>, 60 FLRA 565, 569-70 (2005) (Back Pay Act)). Consistent with this principle, the Authority has upheld an award of overtime pay for the period after a grievance was filed. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>(citing <span class="Italic">Rushing v. Shelby Cnty. Gov't</span>, 8 F. Supp.2d 737, 747 (W.D. Tenn. 1997) (awarding FLSA back pay for two years prior to the filing of a complaint until the date of the employer's most recent violation); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Commerce, Nat'l Oceanic &#x0026; Atmospheric Admin., Office of Marine &#x0026; Aviation Operations, Marine Operations Ctr., Va.</span>, 57 FLRA 430 (2001)). Because the Agency's liability for this time period is undisputed, and in light of the nondiscretionary requirement in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 216(b) that an employer that violates &#x00A7; 207 "shall be liable" for unpaid overtime compensation and liquidated damages, we modify the award to permit the grievant to recover underpayments on his liquidated aged comp time, as well as an equal amount in liquidated damages, for the period of time between the filing of the grievance and the close of the arbitration hearing record.</p>
<p class="noindent">In cases decided before <span class="Italic">NTEU and FDIC</span>, 53 FLRA 1469 (1998), <span class="Italic">supra,</span> arbitrators appeared to be free to establish the limitation or recovery periods in overtime cases, <span class="Italic">Int'l Ass'n of Firefighters Local 13 and Panama Canal Comm'n, Gen. Servs. Bureau, Balboa</span>, 43 FLRA 1012, 1027 (1992), <span class="Italic">reconsideration</span> <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 44 FLRA 954 (1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's contention that the Arbitrator was barred by the statute of limitations contained in 31 U.S.C. 3702(b) from awarding backpay to the grievants for a period longer than 6 years prior to the filing of the grievance on November 25, 1989. The 6-year statute of limitations in 31 U.S.C. 3702(b), known as the Barring Act, "only applies to claims brought before the Comptroller General." <span class="Italic">Acton v. United States</span>, 21 Cl. Ct. 214, 223 (1990), <span class="Italic">reversed and remanded on other grounds</span>, 932 F.2d 1464 (Fed. Cir. 1991). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> 62 Comp. Gen. 80, 83 (1982) (Barring Act provides that claims against the United States made to the General Accounting Office must be made within 6 years from date accrued).</p>
<p class="noindent">Before <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, the FLRA reaffirmed that an arbitrator was not bound by the limitation period of 29 USC 255(a) or the six-year limitation of the Barring Act when the arbitrator fashions a remedy for denial of past overtime compensation. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE</span>, 47 FLRA 819, 829 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">As to the time for payment of FLSA overtime, it is ordinarily due during the pay period when it is earned. But there is an exception to that rule, and exceptions by a union were denied when an arbitrator determined that the agency met its obligations under OPM regulations concerning the promptness of overtime payments, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1612 and Bureau of Prisons, Medical Center for Federal Prisoners</span>, 72 FLRA 612, 613 (2022) (Chairman DuBester dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted by the Arbitrator, the regulation at issue--29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 778.106--does not require an agency to pay overtime in the same pay period it is earned when "the correct amount of overtime compensation cannot be determined until some time after the regular pay period." In those circumstances, overtime must be paid "as soon after the regular pay period as is practicable." On this point, the Arbitrator found that the Agency had established procedures to ensure that overtime was paid either in the pay period in which it was earned or as soon as was practicable....</p>
