<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-144"><span class="space">j.</span> Multiple Enforcement Petitions; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Res Judicata</span></span></h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's enforcement authority is broad and continuing. <span class="Italic">Peck v. OPM</span>, 35 MSPR 175, 179 (1987). Although the Board will not retain jurisdiction over an enforcement petition once the agency submits satisfactory evidence of compliance, <span class="Italic">Eikenberry v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 39 MSPR 119, 121 (1988), and <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz v. USPS</span>, 46 MSPR 689, 690 (1991), the Board will consider multiple petitions for enforcement. The filing of a PFR of a compliance decision rejecting one enforcement petition is not a prerequisite to the filing of subsequent enforcement petitions based on later agency actions evidencing noncompliance. <span class="Italic">Swafford v. TVA</span>, 26 MSPR 680, 682 (1985). An enforcement petition can be filed while another is pending. <span class="Italic">Wittl v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 36 MSPR 20, 25 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">James v. USPS</span>, 64 MSPR 376, 379 (1994) (permitting litigation of multiple enforcement petitions complaining of separate violations of settlement agreement). The Board may effect compliance through multiple petitions for enforcement. <span class="Italic">Castillo v. DHUD</span>, 51 MSPR 273, 275 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The finality date of the earliest compliance decision does not necessarily bar subsequent petitions for enforcement, although an AJ may could set a time limit for filing a subsequent enforcement petition. <span class="Italic">Mahnken v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 62, 64 (1986) (first enforcement petition was dismissed with leave to refile on stated conditions; that dismissal did not bar other enforcement petitions on other matters). An enforcement petition may be filed to secure compliance with a decision directing compliance ordered through an earlier enforcement petition. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Peck</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 35 MSPR at 179. But arguments that should have been raised in an earlier enforcement proceeding should not be raised in a later proceeding. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Brewer v. OPM</span>, 69 MSPR 609, 612 (1996) (allowing for the possibility of reopening the prior proceeding), <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">Brewer v. OPM</span>, 75 MSPR 163, 170 (1997) (<span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant's compliance proceeding was not barred as untimely, although he was earlier aware of some decisions that applied to his case, given the appellant's continuing efforts to correct his back pay problem and the responsibility of other agencies to have corrected the problem). Amendment of an enforcement petition is liberally permitted in the interest of justice, unless prejudice to the respondent is shown. <span class="Italic">Shelton v. OPM</span>, 38 MSPR 280, 283 (1988) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), providing that leave to amend will be freely given when justice requires it).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency makes representations of what it will do in an enforcement proceeding, leading the AJ to find compliance, and the agency then fails to make good its promises, the remedy is a new petition for enforcement, not a PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McGann v. DHUD</span>, 55 MSPR 216, 218 (1992). It may occur that an appellant may raise a compliance issue in a PFR concerning a different compliance issue. The Board may then treat the newly raised issue by remanding it to the regional office for adjudication. <span class="Italic">Lyon v. OPM</span>, 45 MSPR 179, 185 (1990) (appellant should raise his new compliance contentions through an additional petition with the region rather than tacking them on to other issues in the PFR); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 172, 174 (1988). Alternatively, the Board may decline to entertain the newly raised compliance issue at all and direct the appellant to file a petition for enforcement with the AJ. <span class="Italic">Colonel v.

<p class="Body-Text">In a murky decision interrelating the doctrines of <span class="Italic">res</span> <span class="Italic">judicata</span> and the law of the case in the context of an enforcement proceeding, <span class="Italic">Vargo v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 156, 159-60 (1994), declared:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An issue is <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> if there exists identity of the cause of action as well as identity of the parties. <span class="Italic">See Cody v. Department of Transportation</span>, 17 MSPR 572, 572 n.3 (1983) (citing <span class="Italic">Hall v. Tower Land and Investment Co.</span>, 512 F.2d 481 (5th Cir. 1975)). A final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in the action. <span class="Italic">Wilson v. US Postal Service,</span> 32 MSPR 244, 248 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Allen v. McCurry</span>, 449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S. Ct. 411, 414-15, 66 L. Ed.2d 308 (1980)). When the merits of an agency action are not examined, however, the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> cannot properly be applied. Wilson at 248. In the case at hand, the initial petition for enforcement was settled. There was therefore no examination of the merits of that action, and so the administrative judge improperly relied on the disposition of that action as the basis of his finding of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the law of the case doctrine, however, the Board will not reopen what has been previously decided in this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 53 MSPR 78, 81 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 988 F.2d 130 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table). The law of the case doctrine operates to prevent the appellant from relitigating the back pay issues, which were resolved by the settlement agreement. That doctrine nonetheless does not bar the appellant from litigating issues that could have been raised in the settled compliance action, such as the issue of his reinstatement. <span class="Italic">See Hoover v. Department of the Navy</span>, 57 MSPR 545, 552 n.3 (1993).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jordan v. USPS</span>, 65 Fed. Appx. 308, 312 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP), more directly addressed <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> as a basis for issue preclusion in serial enforcement petitions seeking interpretation of and compliance with settlement agreements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue in the 1997 proceedings was Jordan's claim that under the settlement agreement he was entitled to and was promised the "early retirement" package. The Board rejected that claim. It found "no ambiguity in the provision of the agreement that affirms the appellant's entitlement to all 'accrued benefits,' the payment of which he may not receive until he meets applicable statutory age or disbursement eligibility requirements. The agency's documentary evidence and certification that it has now satisfied all of the appellant's claims for disbursement of payable accrued benefits are unrebutted by any probative evidence or citation to relevant statutory authority." As the Board stated in the present case, it had determined in its 1997 decision that the Postal Service "was in compliance with the expressed provisions of the parties' settlement agreement," including the claim to "early retirement." The Board also pointed out in the present case: "It has previously been determined the appellant was not entitled to immediate retirement under the parties' agreement."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's 1997 decision did not explicitly address Jordan's contention that under the settlement agreement he was also entitled to be paid for his accrued sick leave. He could, and should, however, have raised and <span id="Page_4987"></span>litigated that issue there. His sick leave and "retirement package" claims both turned on the same legal issue whether they constituted "accrued benefits" that he was entitled to receive under the settlement agreement. Both of these claims stem from the same operative facts. Indeed, in the present case the Board viewed its 1997 decision as having covered the sick leave claim. It stated that the provisions of the settlement agreement that it there held the Postal Service had complied with "include those relating to...sick leave....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that in 1997 Jordan sought enforcement of the settlement agreement but here seeks its invalidation, is no reason to deny <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> effect to the earlier decision. The present case presents no issue regarding the scope of the relief to which Jordan would be entitled were he to prevail on the merits. The only dispute here is on the merits of his claim that he is entitled to and was promised early retirement benefits and payment for accrued sick leave. The inquiry in the application of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> necessarily relates to the issues in dispute in the second case and the preclusive effect on them of the decision in the first case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Res judicata</span> is designed to prevent repetitive and unnecessary, and therefore vexatious, litigation. <span class="Italic">Stearn</span>, 280 F.3d at 1380 (citation omitted). The present case, in which for the fourth time Jordan seeks to expand his benefits under the settlement agreement, is a classic example of the situation the doctrine was intended to cover.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit concluded that the Board properly barred successful enforcement petitions when one should have covered the problems encountered by the appellant, <span class="Italic">Carson v. Dept. of Energy</span>, <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1372086.html">398 F.3d 1369</a>, 1375-76 (Fed. Cir. 2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the government that the noncompliance claims raised in Carson's second enforcement action are barred by <span class="Italic">Carson II</span>. Claim preclusion prevents parties from litigating issues that could have been raised in a prior action. <span class="Italic">See Federated Dep't</span> <span class="Italic">Stores, Inc. v. Moitie</span>, 452 U.S. 394, 398 (1981); <span class="Italic">see also Peartree v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 332, 337 (1995).[8] The doctrine serves to "relieve parties of the cost and vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial resources, and, by preventing inconsistent decisions, encourage reliance on adjudication." <span class="Italic">Allen v. McCurry</span>, 449 U.S. 90, 94 (1980). This form of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> applies if (1) the prior decision was rendered by a forum with competent jurisdiction; (2) the prior decision was a final decision on the merits; and (3) the same cause of action and the same parties or their privies were involved in both cases. <span class="Italic">Peartree</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 337. Here, all three criteria are satisfied. <span class="Italic">Carson II</span> was a final decision, rendered by the full Board, which found the Agency in compliance with the remedial actions prescribed by <span class="Italic">Carson I</span>. In other words, <span class="Italic">Carson II</span> determined that Carson's new position at ORO--effective November 2000--entailed duties sufficiently similar to those of his prior EH position to place him "as nearly as possible" in the position he would have been in but for the Agency's retaliation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Carson's argument that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> does not apply speaks to issue preclusion rather than claim preclusion. Unlike issue preclusion, which only bars matters actually litigated in a prior proceeding, claim preclusion forecloses matters that, although never litigated or even raised, could have been advanced in an earlier suit. As the United States Supreme Court has explained,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">[t]he preclusive effects of former adjudication...are referred to collectively by most commentators as the doctrine of "<span class="Italic">res judicata</span>." <span class="Italic">Res judicata</span> is often analyzed further to consist of two preclusion concepts: "issue preclusion" and "claim preclusion." Issue preclusion refers to the effect of a judgment in foreclosing relitigation of a matter that has been litigated and decided. This effect is also referred to as direct or collateral estoppel. Claim preclusion refers to the effect of a judgment in foreclosing litigation of a matter that never has been litigated, because of a determination that it should have been advanced in an earlier suit. Claim preclusion therefore encompasses the law of merger and bar.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Migra v. Warren City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Ed.</span>, 465 U.S. 75, 77 n.1 (1984) (internal citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both <span class="Italic">Carson II</span> and the decision on his second enforcement petition now before us involved allegations of Agency noncompliance with <span class="Italic">Carson I</span>. Surely, Carson could have raised the retroactive reassignment and nonselection claims before the Board in his first enforcement proceeding. Indeed, in that action, the AJ directed Carson to identify all new allegations of noncompliance, if any, other than his second transfer to EH Headquarters. The AJ's order was dated August 23, 2000. As of that date, Carson had already applied and been rejected for the vacant GS-14 and GS-15 positions at ORO based on his non-incumbent status. Carson thus could--and should--have properly raised those noncompliance allegations before the AJ in the original enforcement action. He did not. And, although Carson attempted to raise his rejection for several GS-15 positions before the full Board in <span class="Italic">Carson II</span>, the Board properly declined to review that claim as not adjudicated by the AJ, or, as the Board put it, "not appropriately before [it]." <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Banks v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 268, 271 (1980) (the Board will not consider an argument raised for the first time in a petition for review absent a showing that it is based on new and material evidence not previously available despite the party's due diligence).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the Board's unappealed Final Order in <span class="Italic">Carson II--</span>that the Agency had complied with the full scope of relief accorded Carson in his original IRA appeal--precludes all claims of noncompliance that could have been raised in his original enforcement action. Stated differently, by failing to raise them in <span class="Italic">Carson II</span>, Carson waived his present claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we hold Carson's belated noncompliance claims precluded, we note that they would have failed in any event. <span class="Italic">Carson I</span> did not provide for retroactive reassignment. Instead, the Agency was simply required to, among other things, "return the appellant to the full range of duties and work assignments consistent with his position description and past assignments." Similarly, the AJ's Recommendation on Carson's initial petition to enforce simply ordered that the Agency "assign the appellant to the position so identified [a GS-14 position in the Oak Ridge commuting area] that most closely complies with the Board's February 3, 2000 Final Order." Neither decision mentioned retroactivity; neither specified ORO as the place of reassignment. While retroactive reassignment to ORO may now appear preferable to Carson, he failed to properly request such a remedy. Carson cannot use successive enforcement petitions to expand the scope of relief afforded by the Board's final decision in <span class="Italic">Carson I</span>. As the AJ remarked, these proceedings are designed "to protect an appellant from being deprived of Board-ordered relief" rather than referee "every real or perceived grievance between the employee and the agency for years to come."</p>

Dept. of Defense</span>, SF-0752-13-0336-C-2 (NP 12/22/2016) ("We agree with the administrative judge that the issues regarding back pay, shift differential, overtime pay, premium pay, and holiday pay were precluded by <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. Importantly, these issues were or could have been raised in the first petition for enforcement proceeding, the decision on that petition for enforcement was rendered by the Board, which is a forum with competent jurisdiction, the prior decision was a final judgment on the merits, and the same cause of action and the same parties were involved in both cases. <span class="Italic">Senyszyn v.

Dept. of Navy</span>, 69 MSPR 679, 683 (1996) ("Because a compliance issue is an addendum to the decision on the merits and not a reconsideration of the evidence in a new light, it is not appropriate to reconsider the merits issues in a compliance proceeding."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Anthony v.
