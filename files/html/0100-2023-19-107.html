<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-103"><span class="space">2.</span> Undue Hardship</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board provided general analysis concerning the defense of undue hardship in <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 148, 151-55 (1988), involving an appellant suffering asbestosis who unsuccessfully resisted removal when the agency could not accommodate his medical restrictions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A federal agency is required to make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of a qualified handicapped employee unless the agency can demonstrate that the accommodation would pose an undue hardship on the operation of its program. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.704(a)<span class="Italic">. See also</span> 29 USC &#x00A7; 794. Failure to make reasonable accommodation in accordance with this requirement constitutes discrimination on the basis of handicap, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Stalkfleet v. United States Postal Service,</span> 6 MSPB 536, 6 MSPR 637, 647 (1981), and an action that resulted from such discrimination cannot be sustained on appeal to the Board, 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2302(b)(1)(D), 7701(c)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant in a removal or demotion appeal who raises the affirmative defense of discrimination based on handicap has the burden of proving this defense by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56; <span class="Italic">Clancy v. Department of the Navy,</span> 6 MSPB 173, 6 MSPR 196, 199 (1981). In doing so, he must first establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. While the necessary elements of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case vary according to the particular facts and circumstances at issue, <span class="Italic">see Stalkfleet,</span> 6 MSPR at 647, they generally include (1) a showing that the appellant is a "handicapped person" under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(a)[1] and that the action appealed to the Board was based on his handicap; and (2) to the extent possible,[2] articulation of a "reasonable accommodation" under which the appellant believes he could perform the essential duties of his position or of a vacant position to which he could be reassigned. <span class="Italic">See Doe v. New York University,</span> 666 F.2d 761, 776 (2d Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">MacKay v. United States Postal Service,</span> 607 F. Supp. 271, 179 (E.D. Pa. 1985); <span class="Italic">Stalkfleet v. United States Postal Service,</span> 6 MSPR at 647.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;A "handicapped person" is defined in that section as "one who: (1) Has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of his major life activities, (2) has a record of such impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The extent to which an appellant is able to articulate a reasonable accommodation will vary depending on the issues and circumstances of the case. In general, however, the agency can be expected to know more than the appellant about the essential duties of the position or positions at issue, about its own ability to modify duties or working conditions, and about the availability of positions that could be filled by employees with certain limitations<span class="Italic">. See Prewitt v. United States Postal Service,</span> 662 F.2d 292, 308 (5th Cir. 1981). On the other hand, the appellant can be expected to know more than the agency about his qualifications and capabilities, and, as we have noted above, he bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in establishing his affirmative defense of handicap discrimination. Accordingly, although the agency has the ultimate burden of showing an inability to accommodate the appellant's handicap, the appellant "initially has the burden of coming forward with evidence to make at least a facial showing that his handicap can be accommodated." <span class="Italic">Treadwell v. Alexander,</span> 707 F.2d 473, 478 (11th Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant in the case now before the Board has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination. He has shown that he has a physical impairment (asbestosis) that substantially limits one or more of his major life activities;[3] and his removal was explicitly based on his resulting inability to perform the duties of his position. Furthermore, by requesting that the agency restructure his position, modify his work schedule, reassign him, and/or obtain and allow him to use equipment designed to protect him from exposure to a dirty environment, he has articulated methods by which he believes the agency could reasonably accommodate his handicap.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The term "major life activities" is defined as including the function of breathing, a function that has been shown to be impaired by the appellant's asbestosis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Once an appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination, the agency has the burden of showing that the action at issue was based on a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. <span class="Italic">Stalkfleet</span>, 6 MSPR at 647-48, citing <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</span> 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973). <span class="Italic">See also Mantolete v. Bolger,</span> 96 F.R.D. 179, 183 (Ariz. 1982); <span class="Italic">Norcross v. Sneed,</span> 573 F. Supp. 533, 543 (W.D. Ark. 1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 755 F.2d 113 (8th Cir. 1985). This burden can be met by showing that the action was not based on the appellant's handicap, or by showing that the appellant is not a "qualified handicapped person" as that term is used in 29 CFR Part 1613, Subpart G.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "qualified handicapped person," as it concerns employment, is defined in 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(f) as "a handicapped person who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position in question without endangering the health and safety of the individual or others...." "Reasonable accommodation," as that term is used in the same context, may include actions such as reassignment to a vacant position in the agency, <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. United States Postal Service</span>, 30 MSPR 471 (Spec. Pan. 1986), job restructuring, acquisition of equipment or other devices, and other, similar actions, 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.704(b). It does not, however, include accommodation that would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the agency in question. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.704(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Factors to be considered in determining whether a proposed accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of an agency include the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The overall size of the agency's program with respect to the number of employees, number and type of facilities and size of budget; (2) the type of agency operation, including the composition and structure of the agency's work force; and (3) the nature and the cost of the accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.704(c). <span class="Italic">See Prewitt v. United States Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 662 F.2d 292, 309 (5th Cir. 1981) (court found that 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.704(c) adequately responded to congressional concern expressed in connection with the legislation on which that section of the regulations was based). An agency is not required to make an accommodation unless any employment barrier posed by the appellant's handicap is surmountable without substantial modification in the requirements of the position at issue, and without undue administrative or financial burden on the agency. <span class="Italic">MacKay v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States Postal Service,</span> 607 F. Supp. 271, 279 (E.D. Pa. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency in this case has shown that the accommodations requested by the appellant would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its programs. The record establishes that the agency did attempt to reassign the appellant to other positions by placing him in its restricted duty program but that it was unable to find a vacant position in which the appellant could work within his medical restrictions. We find further that the administrative judge did not err in concluding that the appellant was not entitled to reassignment to positions that were not vacant. Although federal employers may have "affirmative action" obligations that extend beyond "mere 'evenhanded treatment,'"[4] we know of no basis for requiring agencies to remove other employees from their positions so that handicapped employees may be reassigned to those positions.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Shirey v. Devine</span>, 670 F.2d 1188, 1201 (D.C. Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">Whitlock v. Donovan,</span> 598 F. Supp. 126, 130 (D.D.C. 1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 790 F.2d 964 (D.C. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Both <span class="Italic">Shirey and Whitlock,</span> on which the appellant relies, concerned different issues from those in the case <span class="Italic">sub judice.</span> In <span class="Italic">Shirey,</span> the plaintiff was adversely affected during a reduction in force <span id="Page_3523"></span>because, for reasons related to his handicap, he had received an appointment in the excepted service, rather than an appointment in the competitive service. In <span class="Italic">Whitlock,</span> the plaintiff, an alcoholic employee, was not seeking reassignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record also supports the administrative judge's conclusion that job restructuring and modification of the appellant's work schedule were not reasonable accommodations because there was no practicable way to eliminate the appellant's continuing exposure in his position to dust and dirt. <span class="Italic">See Bristow v. Department of the Army</span>, 29 MSPR 417, 418-19 (1985) (appellant unable to perform essential functions of position even with requested accommodation). In addition, even the appellant's proposed use of an air-feed respirator was not a "reasonable accommodation" because its limited range (twenty-five feet) would preclude access to areas where plastic fabricators frequently were required to work, because the appellant would be able to work only for about twenty-five minutes at a time in the suit, and because another employee would be required to assist the appellant whenever he put on or took off the respirator.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also claims that the agency failed to consult with vocational or occupational experts, or with medical personnel, before determining that it could not reasonably accommodate the appellant's handicap. We see no basis, however, for finding that consultations of this nature were necessary. The medical restrictions that resulted in the appellant's inability to perform his duties were imposed as a result of examinations by the appellant's and the agency's physicians, and the appellant has failed to show that the agency needed further assistance in determining the extent of the appellant's handicap or the availability of reasonable methods of accommodating that handicap.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the facts of this case, the appellant cannot be considered a qualified handicapped individual because he is unable to perform the essential duties of his position, and because there is no reasonable or practicable accommodation that would enable him to do so without continuing to expose him to unacceptable levels of dust<span class="Italic">. See Rosiak v. Department of the Army</span>, 31 MSPR 140, 146 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that, if the agency meets the burden of production described above, the appellant must be afforded a fair opportunity to show that the agency's stated reason for failing to accommodate the appellant's handicap is in fact pretext for prohibited handicap discrimination. <span class="Italic">Stalkfleet</span>, 6 MSPR at 648, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas,</span> 411 U.S. at 804, 93 S. Ct. at 1825. The appellant in this case, however, has offered no evidence to support a finding of pretext.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Undue hardship can be established if an employee's productivity would suffer significantly--even with equipment designed to overcome a disability, <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 42 MSPR 10, 12-15 (1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a petition for review of this decision, contending that the administrative judge erred in denying his request to call a witness to rebut the agency's witness's testimony that he was unable to perform the duties of the positions in question. In <span class="Italic">Miller</span> <span class="Italic">v. Department of the Navy,</span> 38 MSPR 377 (1988), the Board agreed with the appellant, and remanded the case to provide him with the opportunity to present his rebuttal witnesses, and to allow the agency to present surrebuttal evidence. The Board also directed the administrative judge to issue a new initial decision that analyzes the appellant's claim of handicap discrimination under the principles set forth in <span class="Italic">Savage v. Department of the Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 148 (1988), and <span class="Italic">Clark v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 36 MSPR 162 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following a hearing on remand, the administrative judge again sustained the appellant's removal, finding that the appellant still failed to establish the affirmative defense of handicap discrimination. In reaching this conclusion, the administrative judge found that: (1) The appellant's expert witness testified that special equipment existed that would enable the appellant to perform the duties of the identified positions; (2) the cost of providing the equipment in question would not impose an undue burden on the agency; but (3) the appellant's use of the equipment would slow his production so significantly, that such use would constitute an undue burden on the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant contends that the administrative judge failed to consider all of the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Savage,</span> and that consideration of these factors establishes that the agency engaged in handicap discrimination in effecting his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, the Board explained the analytical framework to be used in determining whether an appellant has met his burden of proving the affirmative defense of handicap discrimination. The Board first found that an appellant must establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. The Board stated that an appellant may generally meet this burden by: (1) Showing that he is a handicapped person under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(a), and that the action appealed was based on the handicap; and (2) to the extent possible, articulating a reasonable accommodation under which the appellant believes that he could perform the essential duties of his position or of a vacant position to which he could be reassigned. 36 MSPR at 151-52.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant in the present case has met his burden of establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination. As the administrative judge found, the appellant was a handicapped person, he was removed for failing to meet the physical requirements of his position, and he identified other positions whose duties he believed he could perform with the use of special equipment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the agency has the burden of showing that its action was based on a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. <span class="Italic">Savage</span> at 153. The agency can meet this burden by showing that its action was not based on the appellant's handicap, or by showing that the appellant is not a "qualified handicapped employee" under 29 CFR Part 1613, Subpart G, because the accommodation under which the appellant can perform the duties in question imposes an undue hardship on the operation of the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The following factors should be considered in determining whether a proposed accommodation creates an undue hardship on the agency's operation: (1) The overall size of the agency's program with respect to the number of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget; (2) the type of agency operation, including the composition and structure of its work force; and (3) the nature and the cost of the accommodation<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying these factors to the present case yields the conclusion that the agency has rebutted the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by meeting its burden of showing that the appellant's requested accommodation, namely, performing the duties of the identified positions with the use of specialized equipment, imposes an undue hardship on its operations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the size and type of the agency's painting operation, the record establishes that the agency employs approximately 400 painters, and has a budget for its painting shops of over 7 million dollars. The accommodation at issue involves the use of specialized equipment to help the appellant move items that are heavier than he is allowed to move under his medical restrictions. As the administrative judge found, some of the required equipment is already available to the agency, and another piece of equipment has a catalog price of $992. In light of the scope of the agency's painting operations, we agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that the cost of the equipment does not impose an undue hardship on the agency. <span class="Italic">See Robinson v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy,</span> 36 MSPR 156, 160 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also found, however, that the additional time needed for the appellant to use the equipment results in a decrease in productivity that imposes an undue hardship on the agency. The administrative judge based this conclusion on the testimony of two agency witnesses, the former and current Shop Superintendents. The former Shop Superintendent stated that it would take the appellant twice as long to accomplish the same work as a nonhandicapped person, and the current Shop Superintendent testified that it would take the appellant at least 5 to 6 times as long to paint heavy items, and 20 times as long to paint lighter items.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that this evidence is not sufficient to satisfy the agency's burden of rebutting his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case because these testimonies were subjective, divergent regarding the estimates of the appellant's loss of productivity, and not backed by studies of this alleged loss. The appellant also asserts that the testimony of his witness, an expert in the field of rehabilitation technology, is entitled to greater evidentiary weight than the agency's witnesses' testimonies. This witness testified that the appellant's use of such equipment should not result in a significant decrease in productivity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that the appellant's assertions are not sufficient to set aside the administrative judge's findings on this issue. The administrative judge found that the agency's witnesses were persuasive because they were "very familiar with the actual performance of work in the shops in question" and "their view was the more logical." In reaching this conclusion, the administrative judge implicitly found that their testimonies were credible because they had the opportunity and capacity to observe the work in the shops in question, they were generally consistent that a significant decline in productivity would occur under the appellant's proposed accommodation, and it was inherently improbable that there would be no significant decline in the appellant's productivity under his proposed accommodation. We find that the administrative judge's findings meet the requirements set forth in <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 MSPR 453, 458-61 (1987), for resolving factual disputes, that the appellant's challenge constitutes mere disagreement with the administrative judge's credibility determinations and fact findings, and that the appellant's petition therefore does not provide a basis for granting review. <span class="Italic">See Weaver v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy,</span> 2 MSPB 297, 2 MSPR 129, 133-34 (1980), <span class="Italic">review denied,</span> 669 F.2d 613 (9th Cir. 1982) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>). Moreover, we also note that, although the appellant's witness testified that the appellant's use of the equipment in question should not result in a significant decrease in productivity, he could also not specifically state what the effect would be.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3524"></span>We, therefore, conclude that the appellant has failed to provide a basis for disturbing the administrative judge's findings that the appellant would require additional time to use the equipment in question, and that this time would result in a decrease in productivity that imposes an undue hardship on the agency. The administrative judge correctly found that the appellant failed to establish the affirmative defense of handicap discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Savage</span>, 36 MSPR at 153-55.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 156, 159-60 (1988), required an agency to offer proof, not only argument, of undue hardship as to job modification for an aircraft worker with back problems who was terminated for physical inability to perform his job. The agency's regulation required it to accommodate an impaired individual through reassignment to a vacancy or through placement in a position at a lower grade to determine whether the individual could perform work in the other position. The agency placed Mr. Robinson in a lower-graded materials sorter position and terminated the appellant when the agency determined that he could not perform the duties of that job. As to the appellant's plan for performing the responsibilities of that position in a manner that required minimal assistance with lifting:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...No counter evidence was presented that appellant's suggested manner of performing his duties (scooping out the pieces with a shovel until the basket was of a suitable weight) was unproductive or otherwise unsatisfactory. As regards appellant's allegation that he could perform if provided some assistance with the heavy lifting, the agency presented nothing more than the conclusory claims of appellant's second-line supervisor and the deciding official that such an accommodation would not be cost effective. This evidence, we find, is insufficient standing alone to meet the agency's burden....&#8197;With respect to the agency's contention that it would incur certain costs in having appellant's co-workers be available to assist him with heavy lifting, the agency did not offer testimony or documentary evidence as to how many man hours would be expended by such an effort, whether there would be a resultant loss in productivity, or the approximate costs involved. The necessity of incurring some actual costs to accommodate handicapped employees does not constitute undue economic hardship....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Clark v. DLA</span>, 36 MSPR 162, 167 (1988) (concerning proof of undue hardship); <span class="Italic">Mallard v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 28 MSPR 27, 31 (1985) (not undue hardship to provide a supervisory mechanic with assistance from others to do occasional heavy lifting).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Undue hardship may extend to a demonstration by the agency that for it to function, employees must be able to work in jobs without modification. <span class="Italic">Neal v. TVA</span>, 28 MSPR 284, 286 (1985) (without the responsibility to reassign, the agency could not, without undue hardship, accommodate a structural ironworker who could not work at heights above ten feet; all individuals employed in that position worked at heights far greater and were required to climb machinery, rigging, and structures); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Dept. of Army</span>, 27 MSPR 90, 92 (1985) (involving a job requiring typing that the appellant could not perform as a result of an on-the-job injury; providing a brief analysis of undue hardship and determining the employee was not a "qualified handicapped person," but reversing the removal and demoting the employee to a position she could perform as a matter of mitigation of the penalty).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Casillas v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 64 MSPR 627, 632-33 (1994), concluded that the agency would suffer undue hardship were it required to accommodate a disabled aircraft pneudraulic systems mechanic, even though it had accommodated other individuals holding his job, because of the difficulties in accommodating the appellant's particular disability, stemming from back injuries:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On cross-examination, Jose Chavez, the deciding official and the appellant's second line supervisor, acknowledged that two severely disabled employees in his division were currently working in aircraft maintenance positions under his supervision. One of these employees had 80% disability in both legs, and one had only one hand. Chavez stated that the functional requirements applicable to these employees' positions were "pretty much the same as" those applicable to the appellant's position; yet, these employees had apparently not been found physically incapable of performing their duties. Don Busby, the employee with 80% disability in his legs, testified by deposition that the agency allowed him to continue working after he successfully completed a special qualifying exam that the agency devised for him, tailored to his specific job requirements. This evidence suggests that the agency may have been able to accommodate the disabilities it perceived the appellant to have by modifying the functional requirements of his position instead of insisting, as his supervisors apparently did, on the appellant's full compliance with these functional requirements. We find that the appellant thus made "at least a facial showing that his handicap can be accommodated." <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 36 MSPR at 152 n.2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that the agency established that the accommodation suggested by the appellant would impose undue hardship on its operations. At the time that the agency effected the appellant's removal, the appellant was subject to permanent medical restrictions that had been imposed based on a physician's review of his condition in April and in June 1992. The agency stated that it was mandatory that the appellant be able to climb, bend, lift, push, walk, crawl, kneel, carry, and work from elevated areas using ladders or scaffolding in order to perform his duties, and that it would impose an undue burden on other employees if the agency were to modify the functional requirements of the position to the extent necessary for the appellant, given his restrictions. According to the medical reports that the agency had before it, prepared by the appellant's own physicians, the appellant could not perform any of these activities. Mr. Chavez, the deciding official, testified on redirect examination that neither of the other two severely disabled employees under his supervision was subject to the kind of medical restrictions that the appellant was subject to. He testified that the other two employees were able to walk, bend, and crawl, unlike the appellant. We thus find that the appellant was not similarly situated to the other two disabled employees in his department, and that it would have been an undue hardship for the agency to modify the appellant's duties to the extent necessary to enable him to continue working with his medical restrictions. We therefore find that the agency did not discriminate against the appellant by not modifying the functional requirements of his position<span class="Italic">. See Savage</span>, 36 MSPR at 154.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to an undue burden defense, past efforts at accommodation are evaluated by an AJ, but they are not dispositive of an appellant's disability claim. <span class="Italic">McCray v. DOD</span>, 68 MSPR 186, 194-95 (1995), involving a mental disability claim, explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We here make no finding on whether, and to what extent, the appellant requested leave as a reasonable accommodation and any obligation on the agency's part regarding such accommodation. In deciding to remand, however, we necessarily find that the agency's referral of the appellant to the EAP in 1992, almost two years prior to his removal, is not sufficient in-and-of-itself, under the circumstances of this case, to satisfy its burden of proof that it reasonably accommodated the appellant's disabling condition. While an agency need not consider every possible accommodation <span class="Italic">ad</span> <span class="Italic">infinitum</span> where it has given reasonable consideration to the matter, it should, nonetheless, take actions as necessary to bring fruitful results in order actually to effect an accommodation that enables an employee to perform. <span class="Italic">See Joe v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 62 MSPR 408, 414 (1994) (citing <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. USPS</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03840005, slip op. at 11 (Sept. 4, 1984)). Put another way, the prior accommodation efforts of the agency are only relevant insofar as they might indicate that future efforts to accommodate will likely be unsuccessful or that the cumulative efforts of the agency have placed an undue burden upon it--at which point further accommodation becomes unreasonable. Thus, if the appellant satisfies his burden of establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination, including having articulated a reasonable accommodation to Captain Manley, and if the administrative judge finds a causal connection between his disability and his poor performance, the question is whether the appellant's proposed accommodation is an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A hiring freeze may make a reassignment an undue hardship beyond the scope of a required accommodation, <span class="Italic">Joe v. Dept. of Army</span>, 62 MSPR 408, 413-14 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...While the existence of an agency hiring freeze does not necessarily relieve the agency of its obligation to accommodate by considering reassignment, it may constitute evidence of undue hardship. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Konieczko v. USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 509, 514-15 (1991) (evidence of a nondiscriminatory collective bargaining agreement that precludes the agency from reassigning a handicapped employee to a vacant position is sufficient to establish that the reassignment would place an undue burden on the agency). The record below suggests that there were some positions for which the appellant was qualified but not referred because the agency believed that the Department of Defense hiring freeze did not permit filling those vacancies. The agency may have had a duty to accommodate her by reassigning her to one of those vacancies if it cannot show that doing so would have created an undue burden.[4] The parties may offer evidence on this issue on remand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The hiring freeze at issue in this appeal was imposed by the agency. We do not decide here whether a hiring freeze imposed by an authority outside of the agency establishes, by itself, that the agency need not consider a handicapped employee for assignment to a position covered by the freeze. <span class="Italic">See Jones v.</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of the Army</span>, 35 MSPR 691, 693 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's analysis of undue hardship depends in part on who is assigned the burden of proof and how that burden is met. There are no real analytical guidelines. Rather, analysis can be structured to meet the result that is desired by the adjudicator. If the appellant articulates an accommodation that the Board desires to accept, even though the accommodation is somewhat speculatively characterized as "quite possibly" the type of accommodation needed to meet the conditions caused by a disability, the Board may characterize as conclusory the agency's efforts to show that the accommodation is either unnecessary or a burden. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lynch v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 37 MSPR 12, 15 (1988).
