<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-83"><span class="space">h.</span> Constructive Adverse Action Without Notice of Employee's Protest to Agency</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The preceding discussion concerned an agency's responsibility regarding notice of appeal rights when it learns that an employee believes that he experienced a constructive appealable action. What if the agency is not on notice of the employee's concerns? Is there any constraint on the time for initiating an appeal? A lot of law is on the books on this issue, not all cogent and not all consistent. Some decisions suggest that the appellant must (a) put the agency on notice of his belief that he undertook the appealed action involuntarily and file an appeal within the 30-day regulatory time limit, assuming the agency issues a notice of appeal rights after receiving the appellant's notice that he believes he was the object of a constructive adverse action; or (b) demonstrate that he diligently took action to discover whether he had a right of appeal if he should have, but did not, notify the agency of his concerns about the action and appeal within a reasonable time after discovery of appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Gingrich v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 583, 586-89 (1995); <span class="Italic">Krizman v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 233, 239-40 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Krizman v. MSPB</span>, 77 F.3d 434 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Jones v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 306, 309-14 (1994), <span class="Italic">post.</span> But at times the test is whether the employee exercised due diligence to appeal whenever he found out about appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Bautista v. OPM</span>, 74 MSPR 47, 50 (1997) (although the agency failed to provide the appellant with a notice of the right to appeal a suitability determination to the Board, an inquiry into the belated appeal also required the AJ to address whether the appellant exercised due diligence in filing once he discovered the appeal right). In the former situation, one may ask how an employee goes about exercising due diligence to learn about an otherwise unknown appeal right. [Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-022.html#sec6-23">Involuntary Downgrading</a>," for timing of appeals from constructive downgrades involving reassignments and subsequent upward reclassification of positions.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">First, hearkening to the decisions in the preceding subsection, in what appeared to be a constructive suspension appeal, <span class="Italic">Edge v. USPS</span>, 113 MSPR 692, 695-97 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-12, 2010 MSPB 102 (2010), the Board suggested that if the agency has a duty to place an employee on notice of an appeal right and does not, the employee need only exercise due diligence in filing an appeal once the employee discovers the appeal right:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issues of timeliness and jurisdiction are generally considered to be inextricably intertwined in a constructive suspension appeal because a failure to inform an employee of Board appeal rights may excuse an untimely filed appeal, and whether the agency was obligated to inform the employee of such appeal rights depends on whether the employee was affected by an appealable action. <span class="Italic">Hanna</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 6 (citing <span class="Italic">Parker v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 603, 608-10 (1993); <span class="Italic">Miller v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 417, 420 (1998); and <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of the Navy</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 184, 188-89 (1997)). As set forth above, the appellant alleges that the agency placed her on leave without pay status and prevented her from returning to duty until it made a new offer of modified assignment on October 16, 2008, and that she did not know that she could file a Board appeal until August 2009. Because the issues of timeliness and jurisdiction are inextricably intertwined, the administrative judge erred in dismissing this constructive suspension appeal as untimely filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that, in dismissing the appeal as untimely filed, the administrative judge cited <span class="Italic">Jones v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 306, 310-13 (1994), for the proposition that, when an agency is not required to provide a notice of appeal rights and the employee later files an appeal beyond the deadline, she must show that she exercised due diligence in attempting to discover and pursue her rights. Although this proposition of law is unobjectionable in itself,[4] the administrative judge concluded that the agency was not required to notify the appellant of her Board appeal rights on the grounds that the appellant had not responded to his direction that, if she "believed that the agency was required to notify her of appeal rights, she should so state and provide the factual and legal basis for her contention." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> However, the appellant was not in a position to articulate a legal basis for a contention that the agency was required to provide a notice of appeal rights where the administrative judge had not apprised her of the requirements to establish a nonfrivolous allegation of a constructive suspension or informed her that the issues of timeliness and jurisdiction are generally considered to be "inextricably intertwined" in such cases. Even without such notice from the administrative judge, the appellant raised a question as to whether her absence from the workplace was voluntary:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_977"></span>I did refuse on paper only the limited duty assignment but only four days after I was sent home, I returned to work with medical documentation and submitted this to my union steward as well as the station manager with my new medical information and she...replied that it had to go back to district.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;We note that <span class="Italic">Jones</span> was an unusual case in that the Board determined that the Postal Service could reasonably have believed that it did not need to follow the Office of Personnel Management's reduction in force procedures (RIF) during its national restructuring, "based on its quasi-independent status and the fact that a large portion of its workforce was not covered by civil service rules." <span class="Italic">Wylie v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 71, &#x00B6; 10 (2005). It was for this reason that the Board concluded that the Postal Service was not required to inform retirement-eligible employees about their RIF rights during the 1992-93 restructuring. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">Jones</span> with respect to RIF rights, the rules governing constructive suspensions have long been established. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Justice v.

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 417, 419 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As there is a question concerning the voluntariness of the appellant's absence from the workplace, it necessarily follows that a question exists regarding whether the agency was required to provide a notice of appeal rights. If it were, then the appellant's only duty <span class="Italic">vis-&#x00E0;-vis</span> the Board's filing deadline was to act promptly once she became aware of the basis of her claim. <span class="Italic">Gordy v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 736 F.2d 1505, 1508 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Here, the appellant stated that "I filed this as soon as I was aware that I could [do so]."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we find that, because resolution of the timeliness issue depends on whether the appellant was subjected to an appealable constructive suspension and because the administrative judge did not make jurisdictional findings, it was improper for the administrative judge to dismiss this appeal as untimely filed. <span class="Italic">See Higgins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 447, &#x00B6; 10 (2000).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">If the appellant can prove that he was constructively suspended, then he will have established that he was affected by an appealable action and the agency would have been obligated to inform him of his appeal rights. If the agency was so obligated, then the appellant's duty would have been to act promptly by filing his appeal once he became aware of the basis of his claim. <span class="Italic">Edge v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 692, &#x00B6; 11 (2010).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board begins with the (sometimes unarticulated) premise that "[a]lthough an employee is entitled to notice of his right to appeal to the Board from actions that are appealable to it, 5 CFR 1201.21, he is not entitled to notice of appeal rights from a voluntarily-initiated action." <span class="Italic">Ford v. USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 327, 329 &#x00B6; 8 (1999). Other decisions include broad statements that in constructive adverse action appeals, "[t]he period for filing an appeal to the Board is tolled until the agency informs the employee of his appeal rights." <span class="Italic">Lewis v.

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 583, 588 (1995)."). If the agency fails to provide notice of appeal rights after it knows or should have known of the involuntary character of an appealable personnel action, "as a general matter, its failure to [provide notice of appeal rights] will justify a waiver of the filing deadline." The question then becomes "whether the appellant was diligent in filing his appeal after he learned he could do so." <span class="Italic">Ford</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 329-30. There are also Board decisions suggesting that, assuming no notice of involuntariness by the appellant to the agency, the issue is whether the appellant took reasonable steps in a reasonable time to learn of and act upon Board appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The current state of the law seems to be best summarized by <span class="Italic">Harper v. VA</span>, 68 MSPR 594 (1995), <span class="Italic">Krizman v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 233 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Krizman v. MSPB</span>, 77 F.3d 434 (Fed. Cir. 1996), <span class="Italic">Gingrich v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 583 (1995), and <span class="Italic">Jones v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 306 (1994), all discussed subsequently in this section. Understanding the evolution of the rules in this minute area of Board law requires a lengthy review of many decisions spilling a lot of ink. Under <span class="Italic">Harper</span>, when an employee notifies an agency that he considers an action to be involuntary, the agency should notify the appellant of her appeal rights and, without that notice, delay is excused. Also under <span class="Italic">Harper</span>, however, if appellant learns from a source other than the agency of a right to appeal to the Board, continuing delay is not excused if the information to the appellant advises her of the time limit for the appeal and where and how to file the appeal. Under <span class="Italic">Krizman</span>, the Board will determine whether an employee acting without notice of appeal rights acted diligently to discover appeal rights. Under <span class="Italic">Gingrich</span>, the appellant must demonstrate that he was diligent in filing an appeal after he learned he could do so. And under <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, the determinants of timeliness were: (a) whether the agency was notified of the employee's concerns about the involuntariness of the action and whether the employer then gave the employee notice of appeal rights; and (b) in the absence of notice to and from the agency, whether the employee reasonably sought and acted upon information from other sources concerning appeal rights. Proceed with caution: the trail markers are often absent or faint. One can lose one's way.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Searcy v. MSPB</span>, 486 Fed. Appx. 117, 122-23 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP), summarized some of the law concerning timeliness of an appeal from a constructive adverse action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Resignations and retirements are presumed to be voluntary, however, as is separation by abandonment. <span class="Italic">See Latham v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 909 F.2d 500, 502 (Fed. Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Tolentino v. Dep't of Treasury</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 258, 262 (1999) (citing <span class="Italic">Poschl v. United States</span>, 206 Ct. Cl. 672 (1975)). Thus, because an agency normally has no way of knowing that such an employee considers his separation involuntary, the agency has no obligation to notify the employee of his right to an appeal to the Board unless the employee "puts the government on notice that he views his resignation as involuntary." <span class="Italic">Clark v. United States Postal Serv</span>., 989 F.2d 1164, 1169 (Fed. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where the agency has no obligation to inform an employee of his right to appeal a Board action, the employee must act diligently in discovering a right of appeal and promptly filing upon learning of the right of appeal. <span class="Italic">Gaynor v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> 43 M.S.P.R. 481, 484 (1990). The appellant here bears the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, with respect to timeliness of appeal. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(ii), 1201.22(c) (2012). This court will not substitute its own judgment for that of the Board in granting a waiver of a time limit based on a showing of good cause. <span class="Italic">Mendoza v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 966 F.2d 650, 653 (Fed. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Searcy argues the agency had an obligation to inform him of his right to appeal and that the Board abused its discretion by not waiving the filing deadline for his constructive resignation claim. The AJ below applied some of the factors from <span class="Italic">Walls v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 29 F.3d 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1994), in deciding whether there was good cause for waiving the deadline. Those non-exclusive factors are: (1) length of delay, (2) whether the appellant was notified of the time limit, (3) the existence of circumstances beyond the appellant's control which affected his ability to comply with the time limits, (4) the degree to which negligence by the appellant has been shown to be present or absent, and (5) circumstances which show that any neglect involved is excusable neglect. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1582.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ determined that, even assuming notice was required, Searcy's appeal of a purported adverse action is untimely. As the AJ stated, Searcy has not produced evidence showing when he first learned of his appeal rights and that he used diligence in filing his appeal. And the Board noted Searcy's initial EEOC appeal in 1999 as evidence that Searcy did not act with diligence in filing his appeal. The Board found, moreover, that there is nothing in the record which indicates that notice was required. The Board found that Searcy produced no evidence that he notified the USDA of a belief that his separation was involuntary, and that the long delay of thirty-three years between his separation and filing with the MSPB justified a ruling that Searcy did not act in a reasonably prudent fashion in discovering any appeal rights he might have possessed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree. Searcy does not allege that he put anyone on notice at the time he left the USDA employ that he considered his termination to be involuntary. Absent such notice by Searcy to the USDA, no notification to Searcy of his right to an appeal was required. <span class="Italic">See Clark</span>, 989 F.2d at 1169. Therefore, we find that the Board's conclusion that Searcy's appeal was untimely was not an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's decisions do not explain exactly--actually, they do not explain at all--how the uninformed potential appellant in a constructive adverse action or on noticeless enforced leave is supposed to be diligent in determining a previously unknown appeal right administered by a hitherto undiscovered adjudicator. Under <span class="Italic">Makse v. VA</span>, 98 MSPR 246, 249-50 &#x00B6; 11 (2005), for constructive suspension appeals that are arguably late:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board ordinarily will excuse untimeliness in filing a petition for appeal if an agency should have given notice of a right of appeal but did not, so long as the appellant "acted promptly and within the allowable time limits once he was aware of the basis of his claim." <span class="Italic">Gordy v.</span> <span class="Italic">Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 736 F.2d 1505, 1508 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Gingrich v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 583, 586 (1995) (an employee who should have been advised of his appeal rights upon separation, but was not, has no duty to exercise due diligence in attempting to discover those rights). If, on the other hand, an agency was not required to advise an employee of his potential right of appeal on separation, and if the employee later files an appeal beyond the deadline, he must show that he exercised due diligence in attempting to discover and pursue his rights. <span class="Italic">Jones v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 306, 310-13 (1994). In this case, the record has not been developed on the timeliness issue with the above principles in <span id="Page_978"></span>mind, and we therefore are unable to determine whether the appellant could show good cause for his lengthy delay in filing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wright v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 99 MSPR 112, 117 &#x00B6; 13 (2005) (restated the rule that the question is whether an appellant is diligent in pursuing an appeal after he learns of his right to do so if the agency fails to give a required notice of appeal rights).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Earlier decisions considered the timing of the appellant's recognition of an appealable action and appeal rights. If the agency did not provide notice of hearing rights concerning an involuntary resignation, an appeal delay of several months was reasonable. <span class="Italic">Spiegel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 2 MSPR 140, 142, 2 MSPB 307 (1980); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Shields v. USPS</span>, 19 MSPR 546, 547 (1984) (excusing a<span class="Italic"> pro se</span> appellant's three-month delay following an alleged involuntary downgrading without notice); <span class="Italic">Enriquez v. GSA</span>, 15 MSPR 309, 310 (1983) (appeal filed six months after reduction in grade); <span class="Italic">Boyling v. Dept. of Army</span>, 6 MSPR 276, 278, 6 MSPB 236 (1981) (applying <span class="Italic">Spiegel</span> to an involuntary resignation); <span class="Italic">Jovanovich v. VA</span>, 3 MSPR 438, 440, 3 MSPB 510 (1980) (relying upon <span class="Italic">Spiegel</span> and <span class="Italic">McCormack v. United States</span>, 204 Ct. Cl. 371 (1974)). Delay of an appeal for a few months was excused when the appellant received no notice of appeal rights following an alleged involuntary resignation that was triggered by a geographical reassignment that the appellant grieved. <span class="Italic">Renville v. DHHS</span>, 21 MSPR 737, 740 (1984); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Moore v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 581, 584 (1996) (appeal was remanded for further development of the timeliness issue when the appellant filed a grievance that should have alerted the agency to the appellant's protest over his termination under a last chance agreement).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Enforced leave and similar cases were generally treated under the analysis permitting an appeal filed with due diligence after the discovery of an appeal right when the agency should have given notice of the right to file an appeal from enforced leave. A period of 16 months between the placement of an appellant on enforced leave and his appeal was found justified in <span class="Italic">Miyai v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 32 MSPR 15, 19 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 49 MSPR 277, 280 (1991) (excusing 14 months of delay when the agency advised the appellant that the decision affirming the revocation of his security clearance, leading to his enforced leave, was without further right of administrative appeal); <span class="Italic">Bergh v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 17 MSPR 119, 123 (1983) (excusing a delay in appealing constructive suspensions in air traffic controller removal cases because of the agency's failure to provide a notice of appeal rights to employees).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A seven-year delay between the onset of enforced leave and the Board appeal was excused in <span class="Italic">Bivens v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 38 MSPR 67, 71 (1988). The leave began in July of 1980. OPM denied appellant's application for disability retirement in 1981 and again in 1982. The agency refused to return appellant to duty in 1982 after the OPM decision. Appellant was reinstated in 1983 after he completed a fitness examination. Appellant filed suit in the Claims Court in 1984 over the enforced leave, but that court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction in 1987, declaring that any redress lay with the Board. Although the appellant retained counsel and appellant engaged in judicial litigation, the Board determined the obligation to provide notice of an appeal right fell on the agency; the burden of discovery of the appeal right was not placed on counsel.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The analysis was not uniform, the theory not unified. <span class="Italic">Farrell v. DOJ</span>, 50 MSPR 504, 509 (1991), declined to entertain an involuntary retirement appeal, observing only that "the appellant expressed dissatisfaction about his retirement within five months of its effective date, but for two years, he neglected to attempt to discover possible avenues of relief from his unwanted disability retirement status. This neglect was not excusable." In <span class="Italic">Burkholder v. VA</span>, 13 MSPR 167, 169 (1982), a seven-month delay was not excused: "Although there is no indication that appellant was informed at the time of her separation that she had a right of appeal if her resignation was involuntary, appellant was represented by her union prior to the date of her...resignation..., the union could have advised her of her appeal rights and of the limited time she had in which to exercise those rights."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some decisions examined the agency's notice that the appellant viewed a personnel action as adverse. There was no notice to the agency if the appellant documented his SF-52 by describing the reason for his resignation as being "due to greater career objectives and opportunities presently available to me." <span class="Italic">Edgar v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 29 MSPR 198, 199 (1985). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Taylor v. USPS</span>, 73 MSPR 67, 71 (1997) (it was sufficient to place the agency on notice when the appellant wrote on his retirement application that his retirement was under duress). The reasoning in <span class="Italic">Edgar</span> was not used in the earlier decisions focusing on when the employee learned of the appeal right. Notice from the agency would start the appeal period running. But it was not the appellant's obligation to protest to his agency to cause the agency to issue a notice of appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a constructive demotion appeal, "with respect to facially unappealable actions, such as a reassignment that involves no reduction in grade or pay, an agency had an obligation to provide notice of Board appeal rights where the employee communicates by word or deed that he considered his reassignment to be an adverse action." Concluding that the appellant provided notice to the employer of his protest of the alleged demotion and received no notice of appeal rights, notice would not be imputed based on the appellant's sophistication, <span class="Italic">Beaudette v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 100 MSPR 353, 360-62 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has implied that with respect to facially unappealable actions, such as a reassignment that involves no reduction in grade or pay, an agency has an obligation to provide notice of Board appeal rights where the employee communicates by word or deed that he considered his reassignment to be an adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Sarter v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 335, 339 (1996) ("With respect to facially nonappealable actions, such as a reassignment which involves no reduction in grade or pay, an agency has no obligation to provide notice of Board appeal rights where, as here, the employee never communicated by word or deed that he considered his reassignment to be an adverse action."); <span class="Italic">Subranni v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 604, 606 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 78 F.3d 603 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the record establishes that the appellant provided the agency with such notice. Specifically, the record contains an audio recording of an April 2, 2003 conversation between the appellant and Acting Director Richard Rodriquez. During this conversation, Mr. Rodriguez informed the appellant that he was to be detailed to an Analyst position, that another employee would be "taking [his] place" and that the agency would "get somebody else to do what [he had] been doing." The appellant replied that he believed the detail to be a "punitive action," that the agency lacked justification for it, that it was being done to humiliate him, and that he believed he was being "throw[n] out of [his] job." In light of these facts, we find that the appellant put the agency on notice that he considered his detail to be an adverse action and thus had the right to receive notice of his appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an employee places the agency on notice that he considers an action to be adverse, and the agency fails to provide the required notice of appeal rights, the failure to do so constitutes good cause for the late filing of a petition for appeal. <span class="Italic">Staats v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 65, 68 (1995). It is undisputed that the agency did not give the appellant specific notice of his right to appeal his April 2003 assignment to another position as a constructive demotion.[4] However, even where an agency has failed to satisfy its obligation to provide notice of Board appeal rights, the employee has an obligation to exercise due diligence in filing an appeal once he has actual knowledge of those rights. <span class="Italic">Harper v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 632, &#x00B6; 15 (2001) (citing <span class="Italic">Bautista v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 47, 50 (1997)); <span class="Italic">Gingrich v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 583, 588 (1995) (an appellant who should have been advised of his appeal rights, but was not, is not required to show that he exercised due diligence in attempting to discover his appeal rights; rather, the question is whether the appellant was diligent in filing an appeal after he learned he could do so).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;We note that the information given to the appellant during his May 2, 2003 equal employment opportunity (EEO) counseling did not constitute an effective notice of appeal rights under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21. Although the documents provided to the appellant as part of his EEO counseling mentioned the Board and the general time limits for filing an appeal with the Board, they did not explain what a constructive demotion is, nor did they provide the address of the appropriate Board office for filing an appeal. <span class="Italic">See Shiflett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 669, 674-75 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (notice from a source other than the agency of a general appeal right to the Board does not excuse an agency's failure to inform an employee of his appeal rights where the notice lacks information on where and how to file such an appeal); <span class="Italic">Nicoletti v. Department of Justice</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 557, 559-60 (1992). We also reject the sentiments of the administrative judge and the agency that the appellant should have known of the rules regarding when, where and how to file a Board appeal because he was a high level and sophisticated employee. Nothing in the record shows that the appellant was knowledgeable about Board appeal rights concerning matters such as this prior to the time he filed his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant states that he discovered "that a Board appeal may be appropriate" "on his own accord and own initiative" and "filed his Board appeal within 30 days after receipt of the agency's deficient final decision." The agency has not rebutted this claim, and nothing in the record suggests that the appellant was aware that he might have a right to file a constructive demotion appeal with the Board until about the time he did so. We therefore find that the appellant has shown good cause for the untimely filing of his appeal.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The Board has also held that an appellant must exercise due diligence in filing a constructive demotion appeal once he becomes aware of the jurisdictional facts underlying such an appeal, even where, as here, the agency did not provide any notice of appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Ellis v. Department of the Navy</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 321, &#x00B6; 7 (1998) (citing <span class="Italic">Guzy v. Department of the Interior</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 470, 472 (1994)); <span class="Italic">Sarter</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. at 338; <span class="Italic">Subranni</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. at 606. However, the present appeal is distinguishable from the above-cited cases in that, here, the record contains evidence that the appellant placed the agency on notice that he believed his detail to be an adverse action, thereby triggering the agency's obligation to provide the employee with notice of Board appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_979"></span>If, however, the employee knew of the appeal rights in an involuntary action case, irrespective of lack of notice from the employer, delay was not excused. <span class="Italic">Blair v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 6 MSPR 375, 377, 6 MSPB 320 (1981) ("Even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that the agency should have known that appellant considered his resignation to be involuntary, it would not excuse the untimely filing in this case because the record indicates that appellant was aware of his appeal rights from a resignation he considered involuntary.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ricci v. VA</span>, 40 MSPR 113, 116-17 (1989), emphasized the Board's interest in measuring the time for appealing a constructive adverse action from the time the agency should have known that a notice of appeal rights was required. Ricci's appeal was untimely because she offered no reasonable excuse for her delays of one and seven years in challenging two changes from full- to part-time employment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[D]espite her difficult choice, and in light of her failure to establish coercion by the agency, the appellant is presumed to have voluntarily chosen her part-time employment, and the agency is not shown to have violated either RIF procedures or the appellant's right to notification of her appeal rights. We note that the situation here is unlike that in <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. USPS</span>, 839 F.2d 669 (Fed. Cir. 1988), in which the agency action required notification of the employee's appeal rights....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span>, the agency had an affirmative duty to inform the appellant of appeal rights as required by law. However, here the appellant has offered no evidence that she put the agency on notice that she might have viewed her change in status during either period as an involuntary action and therefore an adverse action by the agency. Thus, we find that there has been no triggering of a duty on the part of the agency to provide notice of appeal rights to the appellant, and for that reason, we reject the appellant's assertion that her delay in filing should be excused either because of the agency's failure to provide her with notice of her appeal rights or to follow RIF procedures....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant in this case has offered no evidence to show that the agency gave her erroneous advice about her appeal rights or that the appellant's acceptance of part-time status was involuntary and taken in reliance on the agency's advice.

<p class="Body-Text">Did <span class="Italic">Ricci</span> mean that an appellant must place an agency on notice of a claim of involuntariness to trigger the appeal period after the initial time for appeal arguably lapsed?

However, <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span> is arguably inapplicable to this case because a resignation is presumed to be a voluntary action, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 715.201, and is, thus, not within the Board's appellate jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, we find the appellant has at no time, prior to his appeal, even alleged that he informed the agency that he believed his resignation to be involuntary. A review of the affidavit the appellant submitted in an effort to establish Board jurisdiction, for example, shows that, subsequent to his resignation, he applied for jobs with the Navy, made inquiries of the Navy to determine if there were any vacancies, asked his Congressman for help in his effort to be reinstated, applied for OWCP benefits, and requested restoration. These actions, considered either individually or collectively, do not comprise an attempt on the appellant's part to communicate to the agency that he perceived his resignation to be involuntary. Rather, they can only be construed as actions taken by the appellant to inform the agency that he wanted to return to work.</p>

Thus, the agency had no obligation to inform him prior to that time of his right to appeal to the Board....&#8197;We find that the administrative judge considered all of the relevant circumstances relating to the timeliness of the appellant's appeal of his alleged involuntary resignation and properly concluded that the appellant failed to show good cause for the untimely filing of that appeal.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]lthough the agency properly advised the appellant of his right to grieve the reassignment decision, he chose not to pursue the matter through that process....&#8197;[T]he appellant (who held a management or supervisory position for half of the 25 years he was employed by the agency) was required to know about adverse action procedures and employees' appeal rights before the Board, and, so, it is reasonable to conclude that he should have been aware of his own appeal rights. [The judge] therefore correctly concluded that the appellant failed to establish that his appeal was timely filed or that good cause existed for the delay based on this explanation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he administrative judge found that the record before him did not reflect that the appellant put the agency on notice that he considered his reassignment/retirement to be involuntary. Furthermore, the administrative judge noted that the appellant never advised agency officials that he considered his reassignment to be an adverse action, or that he would refuse to report for duty if reassigned to Denver. Thus, the agency had no obligation to inform him of his right to appeal to the Board....&#8197;Therefore, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant's lack of notice did not excuse his late filing with the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gordy v. MSPB</span>, 736 F.2d 1505, 1507-08 (Fed. Cir. 1984), essentially determined that an appellant who knows of an appeal right should not delay filing an appeal until after a protest to an action is lodged with and rejected by an agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Gordy argues that he did not know until the Department's letter of November 16, 1982, that the Department had rejected his contention that the reclassification was a reduction in force, and that since that was the only issue he urged before the Board, his appeal was timely because it was taken within 20 days "of the action being contested," as the Board's regulation requires. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). The Administration's action that Gordy challenged, however, was the reclassification of his position from grade GS-15 to grade GS-13, and that action was final and complete on June 18, 1981. Gordy's present contention that the reclassification really was a reduction in force may alter the basis upon which he challenges the reclassification but not the date of the action he is challenging.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Gordy contends that the Department, to which he appealed, was required, as soon as it learned of his reduction-in-force claim, to inform him of his right to appeal that issue to the Board. Because the Administration had informed him only that he could appeal the reclassification to the Department or the Office of Personnel Management, he contends that the 20-day period did not begin to run and that his appeal was timely filed. He relies upon two decisions of the Court of Claims<span class="Italic">. McCormack v. United States</span>, 204 Ct. Cl. 371 (1974); <span class="Italic">Shubinsky v. United States</span>, 203 Ct. Cl. 199, 488 F.2d 1003 (1973). Neither case aids him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">McCormack</span>, the employee, when threatened with removal, resigned. Thereafter he sought severance pay, alleging that his resignation had been coerced and, therefore, was involuntary and constituted an adverse action. After the agency denied severance pay on the ground that the resignation was voluntary, the employee appealed that ruling to the Civil Service Commission, almost 11 months after his resignation. The Commission held that the appeal was untimely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court reversed. It held that the Commission had "abused its discretion when it determined that the plaintiff had not taken reasonable steps to determine his appeal rights." 204 Ct. Cl. at 377-78. The rationale of the decision was that once the employee had "put the Government on notice that the plaintiff viewed the 'resignation' as an adverse action," the agency was obligated to inform the employee of his appeal rights with respect to that contention. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 378.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Shubinsky</span>, the employee had been the victim of a reduction in force that the agency told him was part of a "liquidation" of his component. More than a year later, the employee definitively was informed that the reduction in force was part of a "reorganization," which meant that he had certain rights he would not have had in a "liquidation." Within 20 days of that notice, the employee appealed his reduction in force to the Civil Service Commission, which rejected his appeal as untimely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court held that "the unusual circumstances which surrounded his RIF obviated his responsibility to pursue a timely administrative appeal prior to seeking judicial relief." 488 F.2d at 1004. It ruled that the government was obligated to inform the employee of his right to appeal to the Commission from the reduction in force that resulted from a reorganization, and that since the employee "acted with adequate promptness to perfect his appeal upon learning that the agency had indeed been reorganized and VPA [Veterans Preference Act] rights might still be available to him," the employee's failure to pursue a timely appeal to the Commission did not bar him from judicial review. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1006.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The critical element in both of those cases, and the one that is missing here, is that the employee acted promptly and within the allowable time limits once he was aware of the basis of his claim. In the present case, in contrast, more than three months before he filed his appeal to the Board on December 7, 1982, Gordy was aware that any appeal based on the theory that the reclassification was a reduction in force would go to the Board. His letter of September 2, 1982, so recognized. He first raised the reduction-in-force claim before the Department in his letter of April 9, 1982, and at oral argument he admitted that even at that time he was aware that any appeal on that issue would have to be taken to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, neither case held that the limitations period was tolled until the agency informed the employee of his appeal rights. Both dealt with the circumstances under which the failure to file a timely appeal will be excused. 204 Ct. Cl. at 380-81; 488 F.2d at 1006.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, under any theory, Gordy's appeal to the Board, filed almost 18 months after the reclassification he sought to challenge and many months after he was aware of the basis of his reduction-in-force claim and that an appeal on that claim would lie to the Board, was untimely. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">McKechnie v. United States</span>, 227 Ct. Cl. 113, 648 F.2d 1300, 1303 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We cannot say that the Board acted arbitrarily or capriciously or committed legal error in refusing to waive the time limitation for appeal....&#8197;The Board has broad discretion to decide whether to waive the time limit. <span class="Italic">Phillips v. USPS</span>, 695 F.2d 1389 (Fed. Cir. 1982). It did not abuse its discretion in here denying a waiver.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gordy</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Staats v. USPS</span>, 68 MSPR 65, 67&#x2013;69 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Gordy v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 736 F.2d 1505, 1508 (Fed. Cir. 1984), the court discussed an additional factor in determining whether to excuse an untimely filing by an appellant who should have received notice of appeal rights from an agency, but did not. That factor, which the court termed "the critical element" in the determination, is whether the appellant promptly filed an appeal upon learning of his right to do so. <span class="Italic">See also Krizman v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 233 (1995). Here, the appellant stated in a sworn response to the agency's interrogatories, which the agency has not rebutted, that he received a certified letter from the Postal Service on November 8, 1994, advising him of his right to appeal his separation. He filed his appeal on November 29, 1994, less than one month later. We find that the appellant thus exercised due diligence in filing his appeal after learning of his rights. <span class="Italic">See Yuni v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 784 F.2d 381, 387&#x2013;88 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Gordy</span>, 736 F.2d at 1508. We therefore find that the appellant has shown good cause for the untimely filing of his appeal.</p>

DOD</span>, 78 MSPR 553, 561 (1998) (applying <span class="Italic">Gordy</span> to the initiation of an appeal from the agency's correction of appellant's pay rate: a critical element for an employee who should have received notice of appeal rights is whether the employee acted promptly and within allowable time limits once he was aware of the basis of a claim).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bosworth v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 36, 40-41 (1991), reiterated, although it did not fully explain, the construct that an appeal should be filed in a constructive action either after the appellant's communication to the agency of his displeasure about an action that results in a notice of appeal rights from the agency to the employee or after the employee receives actual notice of appeal rights through other means:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he administrative judge properly dismissed the appeal of the alleged furlough as untimely filed, after assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appeal was within the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant did not show that he ever placed the agency on notice that he believed he was the subject of an adverse action beginning in May or June 1985....&#8197;The administrative judge also found no evidence that the appellant informed the deciding official that he believed that the proposing official had proposed action against him, either in whole or in part, because of a "furlough" resulting from an arbitrary refusal to grant him light duty in May or June of 1985....&#8197;The administrative judge further found that the appellant did not contend, nor did the documentation show, that he put the agency on notice, at any time following issuance of the arbitral award, that he believed he was the subject of an adverse action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge further found that the appellant did not, under the circumstances, demonstrate ordinary prudence and due diligence that would have constituted good cause for the untimely filing of his appeal. In this regard, the administrative judge noted that the appellant learned of his probable right to appeal at least a portion of the alleged furlough as early as October 1985, when he received the agency's decision letter on his removal, but that he consciously decided not to do so....&#8197;Thus, the administrative judge concluded that the appellant failed to establish that his appeal was timely filed or that good cause existed for the delay....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, as the administrative judge found, the record before him did not reflect, nor did the appellant allege, that he ever considered his "furlough" to be an involuntarily-imposed adverse action or that the agency knew, or had reason to know, that was his belief. Thus, the agency had no obligation to inform him of his right to appeal to the Board....&#8197;We find that the administrative judge considered all of the relevant circumstances relating to the timeliness of the appellant's appeal of the alleged furlough and properly concluded that he failed to establish good cause for the untimely filing of his appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's analysis of the timeliness of an appeal from a constructive adverse action can occasionally become too convoluted for a common lawyer to follow. This occurred in <span class="Italic">Nicoletti v. DOJ</span>, 55 MSPR 557, 561 (1992) (remanding to the region following a Federal Circuit appeal from 53 MSPR 610 (1992)); <span class="Italic">Nicoletti v. DOJ</span>, 60 MSPR 244 (1993) (issuing a decision after remand to the region). In <span class="Italic">Nicoletti</span>, 55 MSPR at 559-61, the Board seemed to say that the AJ should first consider whether the action (a demotion) was "voluntary on its face," that is, ostensibly within the Board's jurisdiction (a determination that may involve credibility findings and, hence, a possible hearing), and, if not, the AJ should move on to whether the agency had notice of the involuntary character of the action and should then have issued a notice of appeal rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence of record does not reveal that the agency provided the appellant with adverse action appeal rights. It does show that the appellant consulted in July 1990 with an attorney who informed him that he was "protected" by the Board but that he needed to obtain more documentation to bolster his case. The appellant confirmed at the hearing that he had talked with an attorney (Mr. Dienst) in July 1990 and had been told that he could appeal his demotion to the Board, but only after obtaining additional documentation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On reconsideration of the record, we find that the evidence and testimony cited above show that the appellant knew only in general terms that he had an appeal right to the Board, but they do not reveal that he knew about the time limit for filing an appeal to the Board or any other information about filing requirements. In fact, Mr. Dienst appears to have counselled delay [in] order to secure more information from the agency that would strengthen his case. Notice from a source other than the agency of a general appeal right to the Board does not excuse the agency's failure to inform an employee of his appeal rights, where the notice does not inform the employee of the time limit for filing an appeal to the Board and lacks other information on where and how to file such an appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. USPS</span>, 839 F.2d 669, 673-74 (Fed. Cir. 1988). The appellant thus did not have sufficient notice of his appeal rights from Mr. Dienst to file a timely appeal with the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the Board found that the agency did not have a duty to notify the appellant of his appeal rights, because: The demotion was not an action that on its face was appealable to the Board; and the appellant did not inform the agency that he considered the demotion involuntary. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nicoletti</span>, 53 MSPR at 616-17. Whether the appellant's demotion was facially voluntary and thus not within the Board's jurisdiction, however, appears to be a credibility issue. The appellant testified at the hearing that on July 10, 1990, he met alone with an agency official (Mr. Esposito), who dictated a memo to him that effected his demotion from his GM-14 position. The appellant stated nonetheless that he did not sign or otherwise endorse the memo, and he asserted that he told Mr. Esposito that he did not want to be demoted. Mr. Esposito testified that the appellant voluntarily submitted the memo on July 10, 1990, and that he told Mr. Esposito that he wanted to step down from the GM-14 position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge appears to have resolved this conflict in testimony in favor of the appellant, concluding based on "the entire record" that the appellant's demotion was involuntary. However, she did not set forth a detailed credibility finding explaining her reasons for this conclusion, as required by the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Dept. of Army</span>, 35 MSPR 453, 458 (1987). Without such a credibility finding in the record before us, we cannot determine whether the appellant's demotion was voluntary on its face and thus not appealable to the Board, leaving the agency with no duty to inform him of adverse action appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schrum v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 42 MSPR 103, 104-07 (1989). Therefore, we remand the appeal to the regional office for a credibility finding on this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recognized that if an employee puts the agency on notice that he views the action as involuntary, it triggers a duty on the part of the agency to provide the employee with appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ricci v. VA</span>, 40 MSPR 113, 116 (1989). The hearing record shows that after his demotion, the appellant informed his new supervisor (Mr. McShane) and his coworkers that he thought the demotion was involuntary. The administrative judge found that this testimony was credible. The appellant also testified that he made it clear to Mr. Esposito on July 10, 1990, that he considered his demotion to be involuntary. Mr. Esposito denied that the appellant made any such statement to him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not resolve this conflict in testimony with a detailed credibility finding, although it appears from her finding on the issue of voluntariness that she credited the appellant's testimony over Mr. Esposito's. This was error....&#8197;The record thus is not sufficiently developed here to determine whether the appellant put the agency on notice that he thought his demotion was involuntary, triggering a duty on the agency's part to inform him of adverse action appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ricci</span>, 40 MSPR at 116. Therefore, we remand the appeal to the regional office for a credibility finding on this issue as well. The administrative judge should also examine whether notice to Mr. McShane constituted notice to the agency that the appellant considered his demotion to be involuntary.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On remand, the AJ determined that the appellant made known to the agency the involuntariness of the demotion. The adverse action was set aside for lack of due process. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nicoletti v. DOJ</span>, 60 MSPR 244, 250 (1993) ("[W]e conclude that the appellant told Mr. Esposito that he did not want to be demoted and that he would not accept such an action voluntarily. The appellant thus triggered a duty on the agency's part to notify him of his Board appeal rights, and its failure to do so constitutes good cause for the untimely filing of his petition for appeal<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Schrum</span>, 42 MSPR at 104-07; <span class="Italic">Ricci</span>, 40 MSPR at 116."). <span class="Italic">Nicoletti</span> was not mentioned, but its approach was followed in <span class="Italic">Parker v. USPS</span>, 59 MSPR 603, 610-11 (1993). The AJ was directed to first decide whether the Board had jurisdiction over a constructive suspension and, if so, then to determine whether delay in the filing of the appeal should be excused by the agency's failure to notify the appellant of Board appeal rights. [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-09-009.html#sec2-10">Jurisdiction or Timeliness as Alternate Bases for Dismissal of Appeal</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's evolving case law amounted to a pronouncement that, actual or constructive notice of appeal rights aside, one must protest an involuntary action to an agency, obtain a notice of appeal rights, appeal to the Board, and presumably then explain exactly when and how the appellant first decided to place the agency on notice of the involuntary nature of the action. The Board's position was not well founded. Neither the statute nor the regulations of the Board require a notice of appeal rights as a precondition of an appeal. All that is required is an appeal within thirty days from an action, with provision for waiver of the time limit for good cause. It is immaterial whether an appellant learns from a newspaper, an attorney, or an agency notification that he can appeal an involuntary action within 30 days. The question is when the appellant first came to that knowledge and whether any delay beyond the regulatory 30 days is excusable. A waiver rule heavily relying on notice to an agency of involuntariness, followed by notice from the agency to the employee of appeal rights, is too complex. The purpose of the notice is to inform the appellant of his appeal right to the Board; if the appellant knows of an action that is appealable, he should be able to perfect his appeal without a trip back to his employer to obtain a formal notice of his rights (while explaining when and how he learned of the appeal right).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board reverted to a more rational analysis of timeliness of an appeal from a constructive action in <span class="Italic">Glugoski v. Federal Maritime Comm'n</span>, 58 MSPR 514, 517-19 (1993), involving an appeal in April 1991 from a resignation or retirement in August 1989. Because the agency was not placed on notice of the appellant's dissatisfaction, the agency had no obligation to issue a notice of Board appeal rights. The Board's analysis then turned to whether the delay in the appeal from 1989 was excused by the appellant's failure through the exercise of reasonable diligence to obtain earlier advice concerning his appeal rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will waive the filing deadline if the appellant establishes good cause for the delay in filing. To establish good cause, a party must show that he exercised due diligence and ordinary prudence under the circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 4 MSPB 262, 4 MSPR 180, 184 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In explanation for the delay in filing his appeal, the appellant claimed that the agency never notified him that he had a right to appeal and that he filed an appeal immediately upon discovering such a right after consulting with an attorney. The appellant also claimed that he made consistent efforts, through contacts in the "legal community" to determine if he had appeal rights, but that such efforts only resulted in his being told that he did not have any appeal rights. Eventually, after he retired, he talked to a friend in the "personnel department" who recommended the attorney whom the appellant consulted on April 17, 1991, and who filed his appeal on April 26, 1991. Even assuming the truth of these allegations, we find that they do not establish good cause for the long delay in filing the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_982"></span>In <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. USPS</span>, 839 F.2d 669, 670-74 (Fed. Cir. 1988), the court held that the failure of an agency to give notice to an appellant of appeal rights constituted good cause for the late filing of her appeal. In <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span>, however, the agency had an affirmative duty under 5 CFR 353.308 to inform the appellant of her appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 49 MSPR 277, 280 (1991) (the agency's failure to notify the appellant of his right to appeal the revocation of his security clearance and the resulting placement on enforced leave was good cause for a 14-month delay in filing an appeal). Here, the agency took no action that would, on its face, have been appealable to the Board and that would have required notification to the appellant of his appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schrum v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 42 MSPR 103, 104-07 (1990) (alleged involuntary reassignment). The appellant's resignation/retirement was presumed to be voluntary, and thus not appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">West v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 551, 561-62 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recognized that if an employee puts the agency on notice that he views a presumably voluntary action as involuntary, it triggers a duty on the part of the agency to provide the employee with appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Michaels v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 205, 207-08 (1990) (the appellant's attempt to withdraw his resignation one day after it was effective was sufficient to alert the agency to the fact that the appellant considered his resignation involuntary and, in the absence of notice of appeal rights, constituted good cause for the delay in filing the appeal); <span class="Italic">Ricci v. VA</span>, 40 MSPR 113, 116 (1989). In order to establish that the appellant here put the agency on notice that he viewed his resignation in lieu of accepting the geographic reassignment as involuntary, he would have to show, as a threshold matter, that he put agency officials on notice that he believed he was being reassigned in order to obtain his retirement and thus deprive him of appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rayfield v. Dept. of Agric.</span>, 26 MSPR 244, 246 (1985) (establishing a specific order of proof in cases where a retirement in lieu of accepting a directed geographic reassignment is alleged to be involuntary).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find nothing in the record establishing that the appellant put the agency on notice that he viewed his resignation as involuntary. The record shows that the appellant's conversations with agency officials pertaining to his reassignment began on March 3, 1989. The appellant questioned whether the agency could effect a geographic reassignment and negotiated over his resignation/retirement date. The appellant discussed his retirement with another coworker from an "economic standpoint" and they generally agreed that the appellant would be able to find other employment in the San Francisco area. The appellant told his coworker that he was not pleased about his retirement and even believed that he was being forced out. There is no showing, however, that the appellant or his coworker communicated his belief to agency management or personnel officials. Although the appellant testified that he did not wish to accept the directed reassignment, and that he checked with "personnel" and was advised that the agency had authority to direct his reassignment, such allegation does not constitute a sufficient showing that the appellant advised personnel officials that he believed the agency was directing the reassignment in order to deprive him of appeal rights. Mr. William Smith, the agency official responsible for initiating the directed reassignment, testified that the appellant's general concern was whether the regulations provided for retirement in circumstances where an individual refuses a directed reassignment and that the appellant never indicated to him that he felt coerced or threatened. He stated that he and the appellant never discussed appeal rights. Thus, the appellant has not established that the agency had a duty to inform him of appeal rights to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chamberlain v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 626, 629 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the record does not establish that the appellant made diligent efforts to pursue his appeal rights during the twenty months preceding his appeal. The evidence of record shows that after he retired, the appellant had doubts that the agency had acted properly. He testified that he believed that his resignation and retirement may have been improper, and that he attempted to find someone to help him determine if he had any rights. He explained that it was not until April 1991 that he found his present attorney who advised him that he had appeal rights. The appellant makes no specific showing, however, as to whom he contacted and what advice he was given. His unsupported allegations of contacts with the agency's "personnel department" or the "legal community" are insufficient to establish such diligence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> at 184. Additionally, the appellant has made no showing that he directly asked agency officials if he had appeal rights. Moreover, the appellant was made aware of the existence and functions of the Board through an agency order given to each employee in May 1988 that included a copy of the Board's regulations. The appellant has offered no explanation of why he did not contact the Board, during his twenty-month delay in filing, to explore any possible appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we find that the appellant has not shown that his actions are those of a reasonably prudent person who believed at the time that he resigned and retired that the agency's action was improper and diligently pursued a possible appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Farrell v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 50 MSPR 504, 509 (1991) (failure to explore possible appeal rights for two years did not constitute excusable neglect); <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> at 184. Accordingly, we find no good cause to waive the deadline for filing the appeal petition.<span class="Italic"></span></p>

USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 305, 308 (1995) (appeal from an allegedly involuntary retirement was untimely when the agency was not placed on notice of the employee's concerns for almost two years following retirement; a delay in notifying the agency that the appellant believed he had an appealable action is factored into the Board's discretionary decision to waive the filing deadline), <span class="Italic">followed in</span>, <span class="Italic">Hendricks v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 69 MSPR 163, 169 (1995); <span class="Italic">Wileman v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 232, 237 (1995) ("there is no indication that, at the time of his retirement, or any time thereafter, the appellant placed the agency on notice, by making a nonfrivolous allegation, that he considered his retirement to be involuntary"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Oates v. MSPB</span>, 82 Fed. Appx. 671, 673 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP) ("In <span class="Italic">Krizman,</span> we stated that '[t]he board is not required to find good cause for an untimely appeal whenever an employee claims that the agency failed to provide him with all the information he regards as pertinent to his decision whether to challenge the agency action.'").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit, in <span class="Italic">Mueller v. USPS</span>, 76 F.3d 1198, 1201-04 (Fed. Cir. 1996), embraced an approach that predicated timely filing on notice to an agency of an employee's protest to what would otherwise be considered a voluntary personnel action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court has acknowledged that an agency's failure to provide notice of an individual's right to appeal from an appealable agency action may constitute good cause for the individual's failure to file a timely appeal. <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. USPS</span>, 839 F.2d 669, 673-74 (Fed. Cir. 1988). The petitioners allege that this factor is present in their cases because the Postal Service failed to provide them with notice of their right to appeal from their retirements. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Resignations and retirements are presumed to be voluntary, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Latham v. USPS</span>, 909 F.2d 500, 502 (Fed. Cir. 1990), and an employee who retires has no right to appeal to the Board unless the retirement is found to be involuntary. <span class="Italic">Covington v. DHHS</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 941 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Because an agency normally has no way of knowing that a resigning or retiring employee considers his separation involuntary, the agency ordinarily has no obligation to notify a resigning or retiring employee of his right to appeal to the Board unless the employee "puts the government on notice that he views his resignation as involuntary." <span class="Italic">Clark v. USPS</span>, 989 F.2d 1164, 1169 (Fed. Cir. 1993). <span class="Italic">See also McCormack v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States</span>, 204 Ct. Cl. 371, 378, 1974 WL 21684 (1974) ("the Government is not clairvoyant and may not be required to read the plaintiff's mind"); <span class="Italic">Malone v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 41 MSPR 594, 596-97 (1989) (in order to establish good cause for an untimely appeal, retired employee must show that his actions "were sufficient to put the agency on notice that he...considered his retirement to be involuntary").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, there was no evidence in the record before the administrative judge that the petitioners notified the Postal Service that they viewed their retirements as involuntary. For that reason, the petitioners have failed to show that the Postal Service violated a duty owed to them by failing to notify them of their right to appeal to the Board; the absence of any notification of appeal rights therefore does not establish good cause for the untimely filing of their appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioners' characterization of the <span class="Italic">Jones</span> decision as setting forth a new legal standard is wrong. The principle that an agency need not advise a retiree of his appeal rights unless he informs the agency that he regards his retirement as involuntary is firmly established in the case law of both the Board and this court, as the Board's opinion in <span class="Italic">Jones</span> makes clear. <span class="Italic">See</span> 65 MSPR at 309-10, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">McCormack v. United States</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and <span class="Italic">Malone v. Dept. of the Air Force, supra;</span> <span class="Italic">Yuni v. MSPB</span>, 784 F.2d 381, 386 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Popham v. USPS</span>, 50 MSPR 193, 199 (1991); <span class="Italic">Peterson v. DHHS</span>, 50 MSPR 237, 242 (1991); <span class="Italic">Ricci v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 40 MSPR 113, 116 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, even the evidence that the petitioners proffered after the record closed fails to establish that they put the Postal Service on notice <span id="Page_983"></span>that they regarded their retirements as involuntary. To be sure, that evidence shows that they were reluctant to retire and expressed that reluctance to representatives of the Postal Service. But while the late-proffered evidence shows that each petitioner expressed unhappiness about having to choose between retirement and an uncertain future with the agency, none of that evidence suggests that any of the petitioners advised the Postal Service that he "view[ed] himself the subject of an adverse action," <span class="Italic">McCormack</span>, 204 Ct. Cl. at 380. That is, the evidence offered by the petitioners fails to show that they put the agency on notice that they regarded their retirements as the products of duress, coercion, deception, or misinformation. <span class="Italic">See Taylor v. United States</span>, 219 Ct. Cl. 86, 591 F.2d 688, 692 (1979) ("the fact that an employee is faced with an unpleasant situation or has to choose between two unpleasant alternatives does not make the resulting action involuntary unless there is deception, coercion, duress, time pressure or intimidation"); <span class="Italic">Christie v. United States</span>, 207 Ct. Cl. 333, 518 F.2d 584, 587-88 (1975); <span class="Italic">Barnett v. USPS</span>, 59 MSPR 125, 127-29 (1993); <span class="Italic">Gaynor v. USPS</span>, 43 MSPR 481, 484 (1990). Under these circumstances, we are satisfied that the administrative judge did not abuse her discretion by refusing to reopen the record on the timeliness issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming the validity or currency of a rule that measures timely filing relative to the date an agency is placed on notice that an employee views a personnel action as adverse, if the agency ought to know that the appellant was constructively suspended (because he reported for work and was told to leave), the agency should have advised him of his appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Romine v. USPS</span>, 64 MSPR 68, 72 (1994). Delayed filing could be excused without extensive analysis of whether the agency knew or should have known that the employee felt he was the victim of an appealable action. In an employment practice case, the appeals were timely if they were filed once the appellants learned, with the assistance of a "somewhat confusing" MSPB response to a congressional inquiry, of the existence of an MSPB appeal route. Chairman Levinson concurred in the result: under <span class="Italic">Malone v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 41 MSPR 594 (1989), the lack of information about appeal rights did not excuse delay; he would have excused the delay because once OPM learned of the appellants' challenge to their employment practices, it became OPM's duty to notify the appellants of their appeal right and the deadline. <span class="Italic">Baxter v. OPM</span>, 44 MSPR 125, 134 (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1994 the Board weighed in with a decision that omitted any mention that the appeal period starts with an agency notice of appeal rights generated after the appellant complains to the agency that an action earlier thought to be voluntary was, in fact, constructively adverse. <span class="Italic">Locke v. USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 283, 287 (1994), simply considered the appellant's actions in filing an appeal once the appellant figured out that his retirement might have been involuntary:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed his petition for appeal on January 6, 1993, alleging that his November 20, 1992 retirement was involuntary. His petition for appeal, which should have been filed no later than December 10, 1992, was thus 27 days late. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.22(b) (a petition for appeal must be filed within 20 days of the effective date of the action at issue). Accordingly, the appellant is required to show good cause for the late filing. <span class="Italic">See Alonzo v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 4 MSPB 262, 4 MSPR 180, 184 (1980) (the Board may waive a filing deadline only upon a showing of good cause).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant avers in his sworn declaration that he did not learn that Provencio's statements were untrue until after he retired, and that he did not become aware that he could file an appeal with the Board claiming that his retirement was involuntary until January 5, 1993, after he had consulted an attorney. The appellant's allegation that he filed his petition for appeal one day after he learned that he could contest his retirement as involuntary is plausible and unrebutted.[3] Accordingly, we find good cause to waive the deadline for filing the petition for appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gordy v. MSPB</span>, 736 F.2d 1505, 1508 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (the "critical element" in determining whether an appellant has demonstrated good cause to waive a Board filing deadline is whether he "acted promptly and within the allowable time limits once he was aware of the basis of his claim").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;There is no indication that the agency advised the appellant at the time of his retirement that he could file a Board appeal challenging his separation, and it may not have been required to do so. <span class="Italic">See Malone v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 41 MSPR 594, 596 (1989) (an agency must advise an employee that he or she may appeal an involuntary retirement or resignation to the Board within 20 days of separation, where the agency knew or had reason to know that the appellant considered the resignation or retirement to be involuntary).</p>
