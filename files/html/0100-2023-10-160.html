<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-161"><span class="space">a.</span> Facilities Available Through Equivalent Status; Facilities Obtained by Collective Bargaining</h5>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Army Air Defense Ctr., Ft. Bliss and NFFE Local 2068</span>, 29 FLRA 362, 365-67 (1987),<span class="Italic"> reconsideration denied</span>, 31 FLRA 904 (1988), concerned the extent that an agency must make facilities available to a union seeking to unseat an incumbent union in an election if the agency grants the incumbent certain facilities, e.g., a building. The grant of available facilities was the result of a collective bargaining agreement that was reached prior to the filing of the rival's election petition and extended by mutual agreement past its expiration date during the pendency of the election campaign. There was no violation when the agency failed to make the same type of facilities available to the rival union:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7116(a)(3) provides that an agency may, upon request, furnish a labor organization with customary and routine services and facilities if the services and facilities are also furnished on an impartial basis to other labor organizations having equivalent status. Thus, under section <span id="page_150"></span>7116(a)(3), if an agency grants a union's request for customary and routine services or facilities in a representation proceeding, the agency must, upon request, provide such services or facilities to another union having equivalent status.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree...that NFFE had equivalent status with NAGE in the representation proceeding. However, NAGE did not request and the Respondent did not grant NAGE the use of a building as a "customary and routine" facility during that proceeding. Rather, the Respondent provided NAGE with the building through the give and take of negotiations with NAGE as the exclusive representative of the unit involved before NFFE filed its representation petition. NAGE's right to use the building as a "Union Hall" was expressly established in NAGE's collective bargaining agreement with the Respondent before NFFE became a union "having equivalent status."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We can find no compelling indication in the plain language or legislative history of section 7116(a)(3) that an agency is required to furnish a labor organization that has achieved equivalent status with an incumbent union in a representation proceeding with the exact same services and facilities that the incumbent obtained through collective bargaining before the proceeding. On the contrary, it is reasonable to expect that an incumbent labor organization will have acquired some advantages in agency services and facilities over a rival union through collective bargaining. The Statute does not require that an agency equalize their positions upon request of the rival.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not believe that a building is the kind of "customary and routine" facility contemplated by Congress in fashioning section 7116(a)(3). But even assuming that a barracks-type building is a customary and routine facility at Fort Bliss, we reemphasize that NAGE did not request and the Respondent did not gratuitously provide NAGE with the building in question during the representation proceeding. NAGE's right to use of the building was established by the previously negotiated agreement....&#8197;Additionally, we note that the Respondent specifically advised NFFE that it was prepared to provide, upon request, NFFE and NAGE with various meeting facilities for use in their election campaigns.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another decision resolved that the equivalent status rule did not require that a competing union (AFGE) be granted contract benefits provided to a rival union (NTEU) or that the agency undertake special efforts to assist the competing union in publicizing its status or election positions. At issue in <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE</span>, 62 FLRA 78, 81-83 (2007), were two challenges to an election based on concerns about the employer's neutrality: first, a contract-based listing of NTEU, but not AFGE, in the agency's directory and user's guide on the agency intranet site; second, refusal of the agency to facilitate a direct mailing by the competing unions. Neither the agency's listing of NTEU nor the agency's refusal to facilitate a direct mailing violated the agency's required election neutrality:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority may grant an application for review only when the application demonstrates that review is warranted because: (1) the decision raises an issue for which there is an absence of precedent; (2) established law or policy warrants reconsideration; or (3) there is a genuine issue over whether the RD has failed to apply established law, committed a prejudicial procedural error, or committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.31(c). AFGE claims that review is warranted because the RD failed to apply established law in concluding that the Agency did not violate its obligation to remain neutral.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The standard for determining whether conduct is of an objectionable nature so as to require that an election be set aside is its potential for interfering with the free choice of the voters.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Defense, Stateside Dependents Schools, Fort Benning Schools, Fort Benning, Ga.,</span> 48 FLRA 471, 474 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Fort Benning</span>). Application of this standard involves an assessment of whether, by its conduct, the employer has violated its statutory obligation to remain neutral. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Agric., Forest Serv., Apache-Sitgreaves Nat'l Forest, Springerville, Ariz.,</span> 47 FLRA 945, 953 (1993) (noting RD's obligation to resolve whether activity's conduct violated its obligation "to maintain its neutrality"); <span class="Italic">see also United States Army Eng'r Activity, Capital Area, Fort Myer, Va.,</span> 34 FLRA 38, 43 (1989) (holding that management actions during an election that violate obligation to maintain neutrality and that have the potential to interfere with the free choice of voters require the election to be set aside). In making this assessment, the Authority has considered, as relevant factors, whether there is evidence that employees were prevented from gaining access to a campaigning union and whether a union received preferential treatment because it was allowed to use facilities that the rival union was not allowed to use. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Station, Ingleside, Tex.,</span> 46 FLRA 1011, 1023 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The Director and User's Guide</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under <span class="Italic">Fort Bliss,</span> an agency is required to provide a union that has "equivalent status" the same "services and facilities" that it provides an incumbent union, consistent with &#x00A7; 7116(a)(3) of the Statute. 29 FLRA at 365. However, when an agency is required by a collective bargaining agreement to provide a union with a particular service or facility, the Statute does not require that agency to "equalize" the unions' positions. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 366. Consistent with this precedent, the RD found, and AFGE does not dispute, that Article 34 of the Agency's agreement with NTEU requires the Agency to list NTEU in its directory, and the Agency's agreement with AFGE does not contain a similar provision. Based on the foregoing, we agree with the RD's application of <span class="Italic">Fort Bliss</span>, and conclude that the Agency was not obligated to list AFGE in its directory and user's guide as it was contractually required to list NTEU.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, we reject AFGE's claim that <span class="Italic">Fort Bliss </span>is inapplicable because: (1) the rival union in that case was a union with "equivalent status" unlike AFGE, which is an incumbent union; and (2) the "directory is arguably neither a service nor a facility[.]" In this connection, <span class="Italic">Fort Bliss </span>held only that, if an agency grants a union's request for customary and routine services and facilities in a representation proceeding, then the agency must, upon request, provide such services and facilities to another union having equivalent status, provided that the services and facilities were not granted pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. Nothing in <span class="Italic">Fort Bliss </span>implies that incumbent unions should be given contract rights for which they have not negotiated. Moreover, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.34(a) requires agencies, during the pendency of a representation proceeding, to adhere to the "terms and conditions of existing collective bargaining agreements[.]" <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Supply Ctr. Columbus, Columbus, Ohio,</span> 53 FLRA 5, 12 (1997) (denying request for a stay and requiring parties to "comply with their obligations under &#x00A7; 2422.34(a)...to adhere, during the pendency of this proceeding, to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement"). That provision requires agencies to adhere to all terms and conditions of existing agreements, not just those relating to an exclusive representative's use of agency services and facilities. Thus, even assuming the directory is not a "service" or "facility" within the meaning of the Statute, as AFGE alleges, that fact would not undermine the RD's conclusion that the Agency was required to list NTEU, but not AFGE, in the directory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, according to AFGE, even if <span class="Italic">Fort Bliss </span>applies, it does not support the RD's conclusion because Article 34 does not address the user's guide. AFGE is correct that Article 34 does not expressly mention the Agency's user's guide. However, the record supports the Agency's claim that the user's guide provides instructions on using the directory and, therefore, is "part and parcel" of the directory. In this regard, the record demonstrates that the user's guide is a set of instructions on using the Agency's directory and, therefore, that it is not independent of the Agency's directory. As such, the fact that the user's guide is not expressly referenced in Article 34 does not demonstrate that it is not included in that provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The Proposed Direct Mailing</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As previously explained, the standard for determining whether conduct is of an objectionable nature so as to require that an election be set aside is its potential for interfering with the free choice of the voters. <span class="Italic">See Fort Benning,</span> 48 FLRA at 474. Applying this standard, the RD found that AFGE did not demonstrate that the Agency's refusal to facilitate the direct mailing affected the voters' free choice or the outcome of the election. In reaching this conclusion, the RD explained that, under <span class="Italic">NGB Charlotte,</span> agencies are not required to bargain "over procedures to govern campaign activities due to the pendency of a QCR."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the following reasons, we find that AFGE has failed to show that the Agency's refusal to facilitate the direct mailing affected the voters' free choice, which affected the outcome of the election. First, AFGE provides no support for its claim that the Agency's actions prevented it from reaching the entire electorate and, as a result, that more employees than the margin of victory were unaware of its views. To the contrary, NTEU asserts, without dispute, that the Agency provided both unions a list of eligible and ineligible employees over a year in advance of the election, which AFGE could have used to directly contact the employees at their offices to request their home addresses. Second, the RD found, and AFGE does not dispute, that the Agency provided several other avenues by which AFGE had access to employees. Specifically, AFGE was allowed to host several "lunch and learn" meetings at various of the Agency's locations across the country; hold meetings on the Agency's premises; leave literature at the Agency's facilities; and use the Agency's email system to announce its meetings. Even though AFGE was not allowed to hold a meeting or post literature in one location, the RD found that there were not more than 100 employees located at that facility, which would not have affected the outcome of the election, given that NTEU's margin of victory was nearly 4,000 votes. AFGE does not contest these findings in its application for review and, thus, provides no basis to conclude that the Agency's actions interfered with employees' free choice, which affected the outcome of the election. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">FDIC,</span> 38 FLRA at 963 (objecting party has the burden to show the potential impact the alleged conduct had on the election).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject AFGE's claim that review is warranted because the RD's <span id="page_151"></span>decision is improperly based on his finding, in reliance on <span class="Italic">NGB Charlotte,</span> that the Agency was not required to bargain over procedures to govern campaign activities due to the pendency of the QCR. In this regard, AFGE claims it was not requesting to bargain--as was the union in <span class="Italic">NGB Charlotte</span>--but was requesting customary and routine services and facilities under &#x00A7; 7116(a)(3) of the Statute. However, whether AFGE was requesting bargaining or customary and routine services and facilities, it must show that the Agency's denial of its request was improper and that it affected the voters' free choice, which affected the outcome of the election. AFGE has not made these showings and, therefore, provides no basis for granting its application for review. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Army,</span> <span class="Italic">Corpus Christi Army Depot, Corpus Christi, Tex.,</span> 48 FLRA 959, 965 (1993) (finding no basis to grant application for review where improper conduct not shown to have improperly influenced election's results).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we conclude that AFGE's reliance on the NLRB's decision in <span class="Italic">Excelsior Underwear, Inc.</span> does not demonstrate that the RD failed to apply established law. In that case, the Board held that RDs must provide employers with "an election eligibility list, containing the names and addresses of all the eligible voters" to ensure fairness in elections. <span class="Italic">Excelsior Underwear, Inc.</span>, 156 NLRB at 1239-40. As an initial matter, we note that NLRB decisions are not controlling in the Federal sector. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of the Navy, Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard Restaurant System, Pearl Harbor,</span> Haw., 28 FLRA 172, 176 n.* (1987). Even if they were, <span class="Italic">Excelsior Underwear, Inc.</span> would not apply here. In this regard, AFGE did not ask for, and would not have been entitled to, employees' home addresses because the United States Supreme Court has held that the Privacy Act precludes Federal agencies from disclosing employees' home addresses to unions. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Defense v. FLRA,</span> 510 U.S. 487, 502 (1994). Rather, at issue in this case was AFGE's proposal that the Agency facilitate a direct mailing on its behalf. Nothing in <span class="Italic">Excelsior Underwear, Inc.</span> requires employers to facilitate direct mailings on behalf of unions.</p>
