<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-32"><span class="space">a.</span> Sealing of Record or Files</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An initial or final decision can be redacted (sanitized) to avoid release of particular information. It may be necessary to make special efforts to protect against disclosure of a broader class of records. A settlement agreement between the agency and the employee could be used by a third party to establish an employee's liability--for example, if an appellant is discharged for assaulting another individual and settles the case through an agreement that his record be cleared and that he be permitted to resign, the settlement agreement might contain admissions by the appellant that, if admissible into evidence, could be used against him in a civil suit. One way to avoid disclosure of the settlement (while still filing it with the Board for purposes of enforcement) is to request that the AJ seal the record. Another case may involve discussion of trade secrets or sensitive information relating to agency security procedures. Another appeal might include information, e.g., details of an assault on a person whose privacy should be protected. Yet another case could include sensitive medical or psychiatric or addiction information. Information in these types of appeals can achieve limited protection from public access through a request that the records be sealed that contain the information.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A request to seal the record may extend to any component of the record or to all of it. The reasons for sealing the record include the necessity for protecting against disclosure as a condition of settlement; a concern about publicity or the protection of personal privacy; or the possibility that a third party could use the settlement to the disadvantage of the appellant or the agency. If the motion is granted, the sealed record (or the entire case file, if sealed) should be placed by Board personnel in a specially marked folder. Records on the Board e-filing receive special treatment to avoid disclosure of sensitive information, if a justified request is made for that treatment. Sealing the record does not absolutely preclude future disclosure; it is only a procedure that may provide protections beyond the Board's ordinary disclosure policies. There is no guarantee that the Board will seal a record, even if both parties agree to the procedure.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board provides administrative guidance concerning records sealing in Chapter 17 of the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">SEALED CASES.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Purpose</span>. To protect the confidentiality of certain documents, an AJ may be requested to seal an appeal file or a portion thereof. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">generally</span> <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Doyle</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 258 (1990) (factors considered in ruling on motion to seal record). The decision to seal an appeal file, in whole or in part, is within the discretion of the AJ. The law favors public access to governmental records unless access is specifically restricted. <span class="Italic">See</span> the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552, and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(a). National security information is handled as described in section 2 below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Form of Request</span>. The request that a file, or a portion of the file, be sealed must come in the form of a motion. The motion must clearly identify the portions of the record sought to be sealed and show good cause for sealing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_28"></span>c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Significance of Sealing</span>. Unlike judicial practice, sealing by the Board is not necessarily a permanent action. Under the FOIA, all documents filed in Board proceedings are records available to the public if they cannot be withheld under any of the nine exemptions of FOIA. A subsequent FOIA request for sealed material requires that the material be reviewed anew and that a determination be made as to any FOIA exemptions that apply. AJs should inform the party requesting sealing that even though the Board may grant the request to seal the file or portions of the file, it may be released if a FOIA request is made. Likewise, the parties should also be made aware that because of the privacy protections available under Board regulations, e.g., a closed hearing, the use of incomplete or fictitious names in the ID, and the sealing of records, where a witness is not called due to privacy concerns, the existing protections mean he is "available" to testify at the hearing, so that the Board will assign his hearsay statement little probative value. <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 178 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Alternatives to Sealing</span>. The AJ may suggest alternatives to the submission of documents requested for sealing, such as the filing of summaries of the documents containing the confidential information or the submission of affidavits and stipulations as to their contents.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">e.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Standard for Sealing</span>. The reasons advanced by courts for sealing judicial records are generally consistent with the nine categories of information exempt from disclosure under FOIA. If a document may be withheld under FOIA, it may be appropriate to seal the document. On the other hand, mere applicability of one of these exemptions should not constrain an AJ to seal. Because sealing interferes with normal case-handling procedures, sealing should be used sparingly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Any Board decision concerning public access to Board records must comport with the substantive requirements of FOIA. The exemptions from disclosure under FOIA are briefly summarized as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exemption 1</span>--matters authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy that are properly classified under the applicable Order (<span class="Italic">See</span> section 2, National Security (Classified) Information, later in this chapter);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exemption 2</span>--matters related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exemption 3</span>--matters specifically exempted from disclosure by a statute that allows no discretion or sets specific withholding criteria;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(4)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exemption 4</span>--trade secrets and commercial or financial information;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(5)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exemption 5</span>--inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(6)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exemption 6</span>--personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(7)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exemption 7</span>--records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that meet certain specified criteria;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(8)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exemption 8</span>--matters contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(9)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exemption 9</span>--geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">The statute provides, however, that where an exemption applies, "any reasonably segregable portion of the record" must nonetheless be provided after deletion of the exempt portion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">The AJ may also decide to seal all or part of a file for good cause other than the FOIA exemptions. In addition, the Privacy Act restricts an agency from disclosing a Privacy Act record to any person other than the subject of the record without the written consent of the subject, except in narrow, specific circumstances as recognized by the Privacy Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b). Among the exceptions are FOIA disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">f.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Procedures for Sealing Files</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;Documents that are the subject of a sealing request should be identified and designated as such at the time of filing or submission. All parties to the appeal should be permitted to object to a motion to seal the record in whole or in part. As noted, however, sealing is not favored, so any reasonable actions that may alleviate the need for it should be taken in advance of developing the record and issuing the ID.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;If the AJ determines that an appeal file should not be sealed, the AJ must issue an order (in writing or on the record during the hearing or a recorded prehearing conference) that denies the motion to seal and includes specific reasons for the denial. The party requesting that material be sealed must be permitted to file objections to the denial of the motion, and any objections must be made a part of the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;If the AJ determines that an appeal file should be sealed, the AJ must issue an order (in writing or on the record as discussed above) that grants the motion to seal. The order must contain sufficient analysis to support its granting of the motion to seal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">As previously discussed, the AJ's order should also advise the moving party of the potential risk of disclosure under a FOIA request. The AJ may advise the moving party that, to protect the material, the moving party may attach a statement to the motion for sealing that sets forth the FOIA exemptions he or she believes may apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">For paper records, the document(s) must be placed in a marked envelope bearing the notation "SEALED BY ORDER OF THE MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION BOARD, (date)." The envelope must be labeled with the appeal caption, appeal file tab number, and a brief description of the document. The sealed envelope must be placed in the appeal file. The cover of the appeal file volume and the index must be marked to signal that the file contains sealed material.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">The volume of the appeal file containing the sealed material must be placed in a red-striped jacket, MSPB Form 13. The label required above is to be placed over the "Immediate Attention" label on the jacket. If the appeal file contains more than one volume, the first volume of the file is also to be placed in a labeled, red-striped jacket.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">If an appeal file containing sealed material is requested by another office of the Board, the requesting office must be notified by electronic mail that the file contains such material. The RO must request the name of the person to whom the file should be mailed, and the file should be directed to that individual's attention. The sealed material should be wrapped, taped securely, and clearly marked "TO BE OPENED BY ADDRESSEE ONLY."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">If an AJ grants a motion to seal in a case where the official record is electronic, in the absence of a finalized Records Manual, the AJ should check with OCB's</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">records expert to determine the appropriate approach to take. Password protection is an obvious step. This applies to the electronic DMS record of a case where the official record is paper, as well.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Regardless of actions taken concerning the documents in the file, a serious question exists as to whether a final decision may be sealed. Promises that the decision will be sealed should be avoided and every effort should be made to write the decision in such a way as to avoid including sensitive information in the document. If there is no apparent way to satisfy the parties' genuine need for sealing, the AJ must check with ORO and ORO will raise the matter with OGC.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Evidence will be sealed, on request, if it is sensitive and might threaten the security of an installation. <span class="Italic">Claxton v. DOJ, Bureau of Prisons</span>, 7 MSPR 1, 1, 6 MSPB 616 (1981). Identity of personnel involved as witnesses in Board litigation may be sensitive, e.g., some law enforcement personnel. Confidential information filed by appellants with the Office of Special Counsel [discussed in <a href="0100-2023-20-001.html#sec13-1">Chapter 13</a>] may be placed under seal, or redacted, at the option of the AJ following appellant's motion, to protect the confidentiality of the material when it is filed with the Board. <span class="Italic">Hoback v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 86 MSPR 425, 432-33 &#x00B6; 12 (2000) (IRA appeal). The Board may seal a document submitted with a PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Garrison v. DOJ</span>, 67 MSPR 154, 160 (1995).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board approves the sealing of records, the protection is limited. Prohibition of public disclosure of information in Board proceedings occurs only when disclosure would create an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy through disclosure of details that are sufficiently sensitive to authorize withholding of the information under FOIA Exemption 6, 5 USC 552(b)(6). <span class="Italic">Acting Special Counsel v. SBA</span>, 5 MSPR 108, 109, 5 MSPB 177 (1981). Denying a joint motion to seal the record of a complaint seeking the removal of an ALJ for performance deficiencies, <span class="Italic">Cleary v. Weil</span>, 5 MSPR 128, 130, 5 MSPB 192 (1981), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Recommended Decision observed that the law protects against a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy through the withholding of information from the public under 5 USC &#x00A7; 552(b)(6) or the deletion of identifying details under 5 USC &#x00A7; 552(a)(2). Respondent argues in his exceptions that "to the extent such protection is available," there is <span id="Page_29"></span>no reason not to seal the records now and avoid the future possibility of an invasion of privacy. Respondent has failed to show, however, why we should withhold any part of the record and therefore his attempt to invoke the protection against invasion of privacy by sealing the record fails.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The records in Board adjudicatory cases may be said generally to be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (5 USC &#x00A7; 552). The Privacy Act specifically excludes from its provisions material required to be disclosed under 5 USC &#x00A7; 552 (5 USC &#x00A7; 552a(b)(2)). To invoke the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act that would permit the Board to withhold any part of the record in this case, it must be shown that the disclosure of the withheld material would result in a "clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy" (5 USC &#x00A7; 552(a)(2) and (b)(6)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here the record discloses nothing of an intimate personal nature about the respondent. The allegations in the complaint charge only that respondent was not efficient in the performance of his professional duties. The Board, therefore, would have no reason not to comply with the requirement of disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, and respondent is not entitled to any protection from disclosure. That being so, his argument that sealing the record would avoid improper disclosure in the future is meritless.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Williams v. GSA</span>, 22 MSPR 476, 479 n.2 (1984), cast some doubt about the Board's ability, or willingness, to seal records. The appeal involved an employee disciplined for off-duty sexual assault on a child. The agency requested the Board to seal the record as to two affidavits. The Board responded that there was no regulatory basis allowing the record to be sealed, but agreed to protect the privacy of the affiants by making no reference to their names in the decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lee v. DOJ</span>, 99 MSPR 256, 261 n.4 (2005) ("We deny the appellants' motions to limit public access to the AJ's orders certifying these interlocutory appeals because public disclosure of the information would not cause such an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy as to authorize the Board to withhold documents under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(b)(6). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Acting Special Counsel v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Nefcy v. EPA</span>, 94 MSPR 435, 437-38 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7 (2003), suggested that the protections of the Privacy Act may make sealing the record unnecessary as to specific information maintained in the Board record (or in a settlement filed with the Board):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant has requested that the Board seal the record in this case. The Board's consideration of such sealed-record requests is circumscribed by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552; <span class="Italic">Coons v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 631 &#x00B6; 23 (2000), <span class="Italic">overruled on other</span> <span class="Italic">grounds, Auker v.

Exemptions to FOIA are to be narrowly construed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant requests that the Board "seal all records and close this case to the public." She claims that the "case records reveal many aspects of [her] medical condition and [her] severe disability, which [she] do[es] not want everyone to know." She therefore requests that the Board "protect [her] privacy of [her] medical records and seal those case records, so as not to be available for public review." In other words, the appellant essentially requests that the Board seal her medical records.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, to the extent that disclosure of the appellant's medical records would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, such records are exempt from disclosure under FOIA, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(b)(6), and, pursuant to the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a, cannot be disclosed by the Board without the appellant's express written consent. Thus, because the appellant's medical records are already afforded protection by the Privacy Act, a Board order sealing such records would not provide the appellant with any additional privacy protection. We therefore DENY the appellant's request to seal her medical records.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Doe v. PBGC</span>, 117
 MSPR 579, 588 n.5, <span class="blue">2012 MSPB 42</span> (2012), echoed reliance on the Privacy Act as a means of protecting privacy in Board appeals:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We deny the appellant's request to seal all or part of the record. The case files from these appeals are not available to the public by e-Appeal Online or the Board's website. However, to the extent that the appellant's medical information could be sought through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, such records are exempt from disclosure under FOIA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(b)(6). Also, pursuant to the Privacy Act, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a, the appellant's medical records cannot be disclosed by the Board without the appellant's express written consent.

Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 435, &#x00B6; 7 (2003).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That sealing of the record (or portions of it) provides at best uncertain protection is underscored by a passage from the Board's <span class="Italic">Records Manual</span>, Chapter 13, Transmittal 1556.6 (March 1, 1993), at 17:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">15.&#x2003;WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF SEALING AN APPEAL FILE?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">a.&#x2003;Sealing an appeal file, whether in whole or in part, is within the discretion of an administrative judge or the Clerk of the Board. (See <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span>, Chapter 13, Paragraph F.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">b.&#x2003;Unlike the practice of the courts, the sealing by the Board of an appeal file is not necessarily a permanent action. A subsequent FOIA request for material under seal requires that the material be reviewed and a determination made as to the applicability of any FOIA exemptions. The extent to which a seal is lifted, whether in whole or in part, will be an <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> judgment based on the nature of the information and the applicability of the FOIA and its exemptions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">c.&#x2003;Administratively, sealing a record serves to signal Board staff, upon receipt of a FOIA request, that sensitive information is contained within the file.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Sealing of the record was directed to protect confidential taxpayer information and information on discipline of employees other than the appellant, <span class="Italic">Coons v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 85 MSPR 631, 642-45 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23-29 (2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has filed a motion asking the Board to seal the record in this appeal. The Board's consideration of this motion is circumscribed by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 USC &#x00A7; 552. <span class="Italic">See Social Security Administration v. Doyle</span>, 45 MSPR 258, 262 (1990). The basic goal of FOIA is to open up federal agencies to public scrutiny. <span class="Italic">See Department of the Air Force v. Rose</span>, 425 U.S. 352, 372, 96 S. Ct. 1592, 48 L. Ed.2d 11 (1976). For this reason, exemptions are to be narrowly construed and the government bears the burden of proving the applicability of an exemption. <span class="Italic">See Department of State v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In his submissions, the appellant has referred to particular taxpayers by name, and the agency asserts that he has introduced agency documents concerning these taxpayers. The agency argues that such information is confidential pursuant to 26 USC &#x00A7; 6103(a) which provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;General rule.--Returns and return information shall be confidential, and except as authorized by this title--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;no officer or employee of the United States,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">shall disclose any return or return information obtained by him in any manner in connection with his service as such an officer or an employee or otherwise or under the provisions of this section....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Section 6103 defines "return information" as:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;a taxpayer's identity, the nature, source, or amount of his income, payments, receipts, deductions, exemptions, credits, assets, liabilities, net worth, tax liability, tax withheld, deficiencies, overassessments, or tax payments, whether the taxpayer's return was, is being, or will be examined or subject to other investigation or processing, or any other data, received by, recorded by, prepared by, furnished to, or collected by the Secretary with respect to a return or with respect to the determination of the existence, or possible existence, of liability (or the amount thereof) of any person <span id="Page_30"></span>under this title for any tax, penalty, interest, fine, forfeiture, or other imposition, or offense, and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;any part of any written determination or any background file document relating to such written determination (as such terms are defined in section 6110(b)) which is not open to public inspection under section 6110, but such term does not include data in a form which cannot be associated with, or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">26 USC &#x00A7; 6103(b)(2). The agency argues that the Board should seal the record because tax returns and return information are exempt from mandatory disclosure under FOIA by operation of exemption 3 as information that is "specifically exempted from disclosure by statute." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5<span class="Italic"></span> USC &#x00A7; 552(b)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also argues that the Board should seal the record because the appellant's submissions have referred to particular personnel matters or allegations involving other agency employees or former employees. According to the agency, the privacy interests of these individuals warrant sealing the record concerning these matters and allegations. The agency also argues that this information is exempt from mandatory disclosure under FOIA by operation of exemption 6 which provides that FOIA does not apply to matters that are "personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 552(b)(6).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the agency concedes that it is within the Board's discretion to seal the record in whole or in part. The agency argues, however, that the Board should seal the record in whole in this case because "attempting to seal the record in part would be impractical as these allegations constitute the bulk of appellant's WPA appeal." The appellant did not file a response to the agency's motion to seal the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the appellant's submissions contain "return information" that can be associated with, or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer, we find that it is appropriate to seal the record with respect to the particular documents in which such information appears. <span class="Italic">See Becker v. Internal Revenue</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 34 F.3d 398, 402 n.13 (7th Cir. 1994) (noting that section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code has been construed to exempt tax return information under FOIA); <span class="Italic">Aronson v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 973 F.2d 962, 964-65 (1st Cir. 1992). We also find it appropriate to seal the record with respect to particular documents in which the appellant identified specific individual employees who had been disciplined by the agency, and those in which the appellant identified the former agency employee who allegedly violated federal conflict of interest laws. <span class="Italic">See United States Department of Justice v.</span> <span class="Italic">Reporters</span> <span class="Italic">Committee for Freedom of Press,</span> 489 U.S. 749, 780, 109 S. Ct. 1468, 103 L.

Ed.2d 11 (1976) (finding that individual cadets had a significant privacy interest in disciplinary records maintained by the Air Force Academy).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, our review of the record indicates that only a few documents currently in the record contain the type of information that the agency identifies as exempt from disclosure under FOIA. Accordingly, we see no need to seal the entire record. On remand, the agency shall identify the particular documents that contain "return information" that can identify a particular taxpayer, or information that identifies the particular employees who were allegedly disciplined by the agency, or information that identifies the former agency employee who allegedly violated the federal conflict of interest laws. The administrative judge shall order the record sealed with respect to documents that contain such information. The appellant should consider redacting the names of individuals or the identities of particular taxpayers in any documents he submits as his appeal proceeds. However, the agency may request that the administrative judge seal any additional documents that the appellant might submit that contains the information discussed above.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We have noted above that the agency has requested that the initial decision and any final decision the full Board may issue in this case be sealed. While this decision is not a final decision, we assume that the agency's request extends to a decision such as this, i.e., a decision issued with the expectation that it will be published.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of its request, the agency argues that sealing the decisions of the administrative judge and the Board is needed in order to avoid an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the women the appellant videotaped. Although it notes that the administrative judge recaptioned the case to eliminate the appellant's name, it argues that this action is insufficient because any Board decision, like the initial decision, would include enough information to reveal the identity of the women in question and "the details of their sexual encounters with the appellant."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not persuaded by these arguments. Statements the agency obtained during its investigation show that information about the appellant's videotaping, including the identities of the FBI employees he videotaped, was well known by other employees; and the agency has acknowledged, in a document submitted with the petition for review, that "[k]nowledge of the appellant's misconduct has spread throughout the" division where the appellant and the women worked. (Coworker's statement that one of the women had "talked to several people in the office about the videotapes," and that "[t]here ha[d] been a lot of rumors around the office"); (statement, by the woman who had found the tapes, that "[t]here had] been a lot of rumors at the office about the videotapes as a result of [her] telling some friends what [she] had found"). Moreover, neither the initial decision nor this decision includes the names of any of the persons who were videotaped, and the specific contents of the tapes are not described in either decision. We see no reasonable likelihood, therefore, that persons not already familiar with the factual circumstances of this case would be able to learn the identities or other personal information about the videotaped women by reading these decisions. Accordingly, we see no need to seal either decision, and we DENY the agency's request.</p>
