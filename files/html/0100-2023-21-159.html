<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-157"><span class="space">4.</span> Qualifying Court Order</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">There has been much litigation over the impact of court orders in divorce cases on distribution of retirement benefits. Although OPM provides regulatory guidance to lawyers on drafting decrees, some lawyers do not pay much or any attention to OPM, since their experience may be almost exclusively with division of annuities sponsored by private sector employers or established under other plans governed by ERISA. Refer to OPM's publication, "A Handbook for Attorneys on Court Orders Affecting Civil Service Retirement Benefits Federal Employees Retirement Benefits Federal Employees Health Benefits and Federal Employees Group Life Insurance Benefits," available on the Internet.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Upon divorce, provision may be made for a division of annuity benefits, and the court order that is submitted to OPM for that purpose will be reviewed and applied by OPM if it meets the standards of what OPM regulations describe as a qualifying court order. The concept of a qualifying court order was described in <span class="Italic">Al-Haik v. OPM</span>, 34 MSPR 421, 423-24 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 831.1704 of title 5, C.F.R., provides that a former spouse is entitled to a portion of an employee's retirement benefits to the extent that the division of those benefits is expressly provided for by a "qualifying" court order. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1704(a). The court order is not "qualifying" unless it "state[s] the former spouse's share as a fixed amount, a percentage or a fraction of the annuity or by a formula that does not contain any variables whose value is not readily ascertainable from the face of the order or normal OPM files." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1704(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4352"></span>As we have noted above, the administrative judge's reversal of OPM's decision was based on his finding that apportionment under the court order would lead to a result that was inconsistent with the court's apparent intent to divide the annuity equally. We note, however, that we can find no basis in section 831.1704--or elsewhere in the subpart of the regulations in which that section appears--for refusing to follow an apportionment order on this basis. Nothing in the regulations indicates that an apportionment order is to be followed only if it provides for payment of an amount that is, in OPM's or the Board's view, fair and otherwise proper.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Speaking of qualifying court orders, there is variation in divorce decrees as to what they are called, probably because divorce lawyers are used to the term "QDRO" or something similar to describe division of private sector pension benefits in a manner that complies with ERISA, a statute that fortunately need not require the attention of the author or readers. OPM regulations now refer to a "court order acceptable for processing," and the derivation of that phrase was described in <span class="Italic">Griffin v. OPM</span>, 71 MSPR 467, 469 n.2 (1996) (following remand and entry of intervenor, 75 MSPR 263 (1997)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that subsequent to the issuance of the court order in this case, OPM modified the terminology it uses to refer to court orders affecting retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). <span class="Italic">See</span> 57 Fed. Reg. 33,570, 33,571 (1992) (codified at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.103). In the explanation of its final rule, OPM expressed concern about use of the term "QDRO" to effect a division of CSRS or FERS benefits because the term "QDRO" is a term created by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to refer to a division of retirement benefits under ERISA plans. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 33,572. To eliminate any confusion between QDROs affecting ERISA benefits and court orders affecting CSRS benefits, OPM replaced the term "qualifying court order," with the term "court order acceptable for processing." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 33,571.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit expects that OPM and MSPB will interpret divorce decrees involving distribution of federal retirement benefits with a degree of common sense and with an interest in effectuating the interests of the parties as expressed through state court divorce judgments, often drafted by counsel for the divorcing parties.<span class="Italic"> Bliznik v. OPM</span>, 58 MSPR 340, 342-44 (1993), provided the basis for an award of a survivor annuity to a former spouse and the Board noted that no "magic words" are needed if the divorce decree clearly expresses the intent of the court:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutory requirements for a court order which serves as a basis for distributing survivor annuity benefits are as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[A] former spouse of a deceased employee...is entitled to a survivor annuity under this subsection, if and to the extent expressly provided for...in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1).

Office of Personnel Management,</span> 46 MSPR 657, 659 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As we stated in <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 46 MSPR 651, 653-54, the term "express" in the statute does not require the use of particular "magic words." The appellant's divorce decree states, in pertinent part, that the parties' intent was to provide the appellant with a "lifetime...benefit." We find this to be an "express" statement in the divorce decree providing the appellant with such "payment as provided by the Civil Service Retirement Fund," as would effect that result. Under the circumstances of Mr. Bliznik's death as a Federal employee, such payment would, perforce, be a survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Noting <span class="Italic">Bliznik,</span> but arriving at a different result, <span class="Italic">Holzman v. OPM,</span> 62 MSPR 254, 257 (1994), recognized no intent to create a survivor annuity through a divorce decree that the appellant received half of her former husband's pension benefits as of the date the benefits are to be paid to civil service employees. <span class="Italic">Holzman</span> summarized cases that considered the intent of several divorce decrees alleged to have conferred survivor annuities on former spouses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Davenport v. OPM</span>, 62 F.3d 1384, 1387-88 (Fed. Cir. 1995), called on OPM to avoid constructions of marital settlements and associated court orders dividing property that frustrate the intent of the parties and supervising state courts. <span class="Italic">Davenport</span> encouraged OPM to construe together the operative terms of court orders and related martial settlements to further, not impede, the parties' intent:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not think the statute and the regulation bar reference for all purposes to the divorce decree, the document on which the QDRO was based. The statute requires that the pertinent court order or property settlement "expressly" provide for a survivor benefit, so as to ensure that OPM will not contrive a disposition that the state court did not contemplate. <span class="Italic">See McDannell v. United States Office of Personnel Management,</span> 716 F.2d 1063, 1065-66 (5th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 46 M.S.P.R. 651, 654 (1991). That statutory purpose, however, is not promoted--and in fact is frustrated--by holding that the divorce decree cannot be consulted in determining the precise meaning of a QDRO that does expressly provide for a survivor benefit to a former spouse. If the purpose of the statute is to ensure that OPM will respect the disposition intended by the state court order, OPM should be free in such a case to consult the divorce decree when the decree clarifies the meaning of the QDRO.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also do not think that reference to the divorce decree is forbidden by the regulation providing that the last issued order will control the disposition of the survivor benefit. That regulation was obviously designed to ensure that OPM would respect changes in the parties' respective rights ordered by state courts. It would be a distortion of that purpose to apply the regulation to a case such as this one, where the purpose of consulting the divorce decree is not to substitute an earlier disposition of rights for a later one, but simply to determine precisely how the later order was intended to work.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We acknowledge that our review of decisions of the Board is greatly limited by statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c) (decision of Board must be affirmed unless (I) "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law," (ii) in the absence of procedures "required by law, rule or regulation," or (iii) "unsupported by substantial evidence"); <span class="Italic">Warren v. Department of Army,</span> 804 F.2d 654, 655-56 (Fed. Cir. 1986). We also recognize that neither we nor the Board is permitted by the terms of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h) to rewrite or equitably reform state court divorce decrees or settlement agreements that do not unambiguously provide for a CSRS annuity; nor does the Board even have jurisdiction over such actions. <span class="Italic">See Thomas,</span> 46 M.S.P.R. at 654 n.3. We and the Board are further without authority to construe an ambiguous statement in a property settlement agreement to bend its plain meaning to award a sympathetic widower or widow survivor benefits where there was no "express provi[sion] " doing so. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Holzman,</span> 62 M.S.P.R. at 258 (multiple meanings of term create ambiguity so as not to expressly provide annuity). But that is not the case here. The Agreement contains an express survivor benefit provision which, read in light of all the circumstances surrounding its execution, clearly refers to a CSRS annuity, not a military one; there is no ambiguity. The contracting parties had the same, clear intention. The objective facts were equally clear. CSRS benefits were all there was.</p>

This is clearly contemplated by resort to a post-retirement survivor annuity.

<p class="Body-Text">Under<span class="Italic"> Hunt v. OPM</span>, 89 MSPR 449, 450-54 &#x00B6; 2-14 (2001), OPM should interpret state court divorce decrees with a measure of rationality, avoiding the need for specialized terminology, while still avoiding the problem of applying ambiguous decrees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant married Postal Service employee Jon Hunt in 1982, and they divorced on November 23, 1992. Pursuant to the divorce proceedings, a "Qualified Domestic Relations Order" (QDRO) (so styled on the face of the order) was entered on December 9, 1992 in Circuit Court for the County of Ionia, Michigan. The QDRO assigned portions of Mr. Hunt's retirement benefits under CSRS to the appellant. On September 18, 1997, Mr. Hunt retired from the Postal Service. In the retirement application signed by Mr. Hunt on September 11, 1997, he chose an annuity payable only in his lifetime, i.e., he elected not to provide for a survivor annuity. Mr. Hunt died on November 30, 1997. The appellant applied to OPM for a survivor annuity as a former spouse in an application signed on January 6, 1998. As part of her application for a survivor annuity, the appellant enclosed a copy of her QDRO as well as a copy of her judgment of divorce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The QDRO provided in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;The retirement benefit plan subject to this order is the Civil Service Retirement System....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5.f. The participant shall elect a benefit form that provides a survivor benefit (surviving spouse option). The survivor benefit shall be at least 30 percent of the benefit as of October 30, 1992, provided to the participant during the participant's life....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By letters dated March 6 and June 29, 1998, OPM informed the appellant that under Part 838, Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, "Court Orders <span id="Page_4353"></span>Affecting Retirement Benefits," it could not honor the QDRO. OPM stated that the court order was labeled as a "qualified domestic relations order," but did not contain a reference to Part 838, Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations as required for such orders under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.302(a)(2). The appellant sought a reconsideration decision, and in a December 9, 1999 final decision, OPM stated that because the QDRO did not contain the required language of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.302, it could not be considered a court order acceptable for processing. Accordingly, OPM denied the appellant's request for a survivor annuity as a former spouse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant timely petitioned for appeal, and did not request a hearing. Based upon the written record, the administrative judge issued an initial decision on March 27, 2000. The administrative judge found that the appellant was properly denied a survivor annuity under the QDRO because it did not meet the requirements as a court order acceptable for processing under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 838.302(a)(1) and (2); that her former husband failed to select a survivor annuity prior to his death; and that the Spouse Equity Act did not apply to award her a survivor annuity because she failed to meet its specific requirements. Therefore, the administrative judge affirmed OPM's reconsideration decision denying the survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have examined the record and applicable law, and we find no reason to disturb the administrative judge's conclusions with regard to the applicability of portions of the Spouse Equity Act[1] or the appellant's ineligibility for a survivor annuity by reason of her former spouse's failure to elect a survivor annuity option prior to his death. We therefore affirm those portions of the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The Spouse Equity Act provides for an automatic entitlement to a survivor annuity upon application by a former spouse only where the annuitant retired "before May, 7, 1985" or "died after becoming eligible to retire and before such date [May 7, 1985]." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341 note at 4(b)(1), and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.683; <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 69 MSPR 690, 693 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The remaining issue before us is whether the regulations relied upon by OPM, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 838.302(a)(1) and (2), bar the award of a survivor annuity based upon the alleged failure of the QDRO to conform to the regulations. We find that they do not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress provided in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h) that "a former spouse of a deceased employee...is entitled to survivor annuity...if and to the extent expressly provided for in...the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree." Before Congress enacted this provision as part of the Spouse Equity Act of 1984, a court could not award a survivor benefit to the former spouse of a federal employee or retiree. One significant purpose of the Act was to require OPM to recognize court orders awarding survivor annuities to such former spouses. <span class="Italic">See Newman v. Love,</span> 962 F.2d 1008, 1009 (Fed. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we must determine whether the QRDO "expressly provided" for a survivor annuity and whether the denial of the annuity is in accord with the statute and OPM's implementing regulations. In making that determination, we are mindful that OPM's role is ministerial in nature, and that it may not look behind the court decree or property settlement order to ascertain the intent of the parties, "even when it knows that [such action] contravenes the intent of the state court" because of an inadvertent error. <span class="Italic">Rosato v. Office Personnel Management,</span> 165 F.3d 1377, 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Equitable considerations do not provide a basis for awarding benefits not otherwise authorized by law. <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond,</span> 496 U.S. 414, 416, 434 (1990). State court attempts to provide a former spouse survivor annuity must be clear, specific, and unambiguous, and disagreements about the validity of a provision must be resolved by the state court. <span class="Italic">Snyder v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 136 F.3d 1474, 1477 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Therefore, the requirement that such a benefit be "expressly provided" is substantive, and not a mere technicality. <span class="Italic">Hokanson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 122 F.3d 1043, 1047 (Fed. Cir. 1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the Spouse Equity Act, Congress empowered OPM to prescribe regulations as are necessary and proper to carry out the intent of the Act. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(a)(1988); <span class="Italic">Love,</span> 962 F.2d at 1013. Pursuant to that authority, OPM promulgated the regulations in issue here at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.302:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;Qualifying Domestic Relations Orders.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;Any court order labeled as a "qualified domestic relations order" or issued on a form for ERISA qualified domestic relations orders is not a court order acceptable for processing unless the court order expressly states that the provisions of the court order concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are governed by this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;When a court order is required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section to state that the provisions of a court order concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are governed by this part the court order must expressly--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(i)&#x2003;Refer to part 838 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(ii)&#x2003;State that the provisions of the court order concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are drafted in accordance with the terminology used in this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These regulations were intended to apply where a court order purporting to award a survivor annuity to a former spouse bore a label identifying the order as a "qualified domestic relations order," as is the case here. OPM's purpose was to avoid the need to interpret such court orders, assuring uniformity of technical terms, avoiding confusion in light of the many jurisdictions issuing them, and to clearly distinguish federal retirement benefits plans from other plans covered under ERISA. OPM intended generally to quickly and easily end disputes over interpretations of state court orders. <span class="Italic">See</span> 57 Fed. Reg. 33570 (1992). To assure that it conformed to the Congressionally mandated ministerial role, OPM sought to detail the requirements for a "court order acceptable for processing." The label "Qualifying Domestic Relations Order" is a term used in orders affecting retirement benefits plans under ERISA, which created the term to denote property divisions under plans governed by ERISA. Some, but not all benefits, are similar under both ERISA plans and CSRS and FERS, and OPM determined to change the terminology to clarify the meaning of "expressly provided" in situations where divisions of CSRS/FERS interests were erroneously based upon assumptions that ERISA plans and CSRS/FERS were the same. However, where an order labeled a "Qualifying Domestic Relations Order" is encountered, OPM applies the regulations quoted above to avoid a trap for the unwary and to assure that the court understood that OPM, not ERISA, terminology applied to the terms of the order. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> 33570-72.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that under the circumstances presented here an inflexible application of the regulations would frustrate the language and intent of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h). As stated by OPM and recounted above, the purpose of the regulations is to require that a court order for the assignment of federal retirement benefits clearly indicate the retirement plan affected, to assure that OPM need not interpret the court order to ascertain the intent of the parties or the court, and to avoid confusion concerning the benefits available under federal plans as opposed to those available under plans covered by ERISA. We find that under the QDRO, the plain language of the order expressly identifies the Civil Service Retirement System as the plan affected by the order, and that the appellant's former spouse was required by that court order to elect a survivor annuity. Although much of the language in the remainder of the QDRO refers to various terms and provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and could be applicable to various kinds of plans, (including an ERISA plan), only the CSRS is mentioned or affected by the terms of the QDRO. Thus, it is clear that no other plan besides the CSRS was intended to be subject to the terms of the order. Where there is no question on the face of the order (or contrary evidence elsewhere in the record) that <span class="Italic">only</span> CSRS benefits were intended to be affected, the regulations' avowed purpose of avoiding confusion as to the identity of the plan or the applicability of OPM regulations disappears. Put another way, there is no rational reason to apply the regulation to deny the survivor annuity where the "expressly provided" requirement of the statute is met, and the CSRS plan is the only plan that could have been intended by the court's order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that no "magic words" are required to gain the benefit of the statute. <span class="Italic">See Fox v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 100 F.3d 141, 143 (Fed. Cir. 1996), <span class="Italic">citing Nicolson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 64 MSPR 340, 343 (1994); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 46 M.S.P.R. 651, 654 (1991). In <span class="Italic">Fox,</span> the court recognized that some ambiguities can be fatal to an attempt to provide survivor benefits. The court found that the property settlement at issue successfully provided the survivor annuity based upon the wording of the agreement, the surrounding circumstances at the time the parties drafted and signed the agreement, and the minor difference between the terms used in the agreement ("Survivors Benefit Plan") and the precise name for the civil service benefit ("survivor annuity"). <span class="Italic">Fox,</span> 100 F.3d at 143-44. As noted above, however, in this appeal there is no ambiguity at all concerning the statute's requirement to provide that the federal retirement plan and the intended benefit be expressly identified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching our conclusion, we are also guided by the opinion in <span class="Italic">Davenport v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 62 F.3d 1384, 1387 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Where a court decree gave rise to some uncertainty as to the percentage of a survivor benefit to be awarded a former spouse, the court held that the statutory purpose of the "expressly provided" requirement would be frustrated if OPM could not "consult" the order to determine the precise meaning of a QDRO that "does expressly" provide for a survivor benefit. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1387. (Emphasis in original.) Because the QDRO here is clear in intent that its provisions for a survivor annuity apply to the CSRS, and the CSRS only, and no other plan under ERISA or otherwise is evident to cloud that intent, we find that to apply the regulation as OPM urges would create an absurd result. Therefore, we find that the failure to follow <span id="Page_4354"></span>precisely the requirements of the regulations does not bar the award of the survivor annuity as ordered in the QDRO.</p>

OPM</span>, 165 F.3d 1377 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">If a court order is labeled as a QDRO, to qualify for OPM processing it must meet OPM's regulations and interpretative guidance, <span class="Italic">Stephens v. OPM</span>, 527 Fed. Appx. 843, 846-47 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Stephens's Court of Common Pleas property distribution agreement is labeled "QUALIFIED DOMESTIC RELATIONS ORDER." In order to be processed by OPM, her QDRO must satisfy the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.803.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Stephen's QDRO does not expressly refer to part 838 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, and does not expressly state that the provisions of the court order concerning CSRS benefits are drafted in accordance with the terminology used in Part 838. The references in the QDRO to CSRS do not satisfy the requirements of &#x00A7; 838.803(a)(2), and nothing remotely resembling OPM's recommended language can be found in Ms. Stephens's QDRO. In short, Ms. Stephens's QDRO does not qualify for processing by OPM. OPM's conclusion that it could process the QDRO violated its own regulations and thus is not in accordance with law. The Board's final decision perpetuated that legal error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's Federal Register notice in support of its final regulations noted that "[t]hese final regulations assure that the dispute-resolution role rests in the hands of the State courts as was originally intended by Congress." 57 Fed. Reg. at 33570. Further, the notice states that "[t]he regulations are very detailed as to what constitutes a court order that is acceptable for processing" and "because the regulations prescribe in detail what is and is not acceptable for processing, OPM can now assume the appropriate role for itself, which is a ministerial role, rather than a mediator in marital property disputes." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 33570-71. Importantly, the notice recognized that "[i]f a court order is so flawed that it is not sufficiently clear to satisfy our requirements, the appropriate action is for the parties to return to the State court to correct the problem." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 33571.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM, the Administrative Judge, and the full Board overlooked the fact that Ms. Stephens's QDRO plainly does not qualify for processing by OPM, and hence overlooked the legal error committed by OPM. The remedy for the error is for OPM to take corrective action to unwind its mistake. The only dispute presented by Ms. Stephens is the reduction of her monthly retirement annuity to fund a survivor annuity for her former spouse. Precisely how OPM and the parties, with further possible participation by the Court of Common Pleas, will unwind its error is not for this court to dictate. The record is clear that there is room for doubt as to what the parties intended by the QDRO beyond the sharing of each other's retirement annuity and that OPM erred by interpreting the QDRO rather than instructing the parties to return to the Court of Common Pleas. By failing to enforce its own strict regulations, OPM fell into the interpretative morass which the regulations are designed to prevent. We presume that the true intent of the parties can be memorialized by mutual agreement in a QDRO that satisfies OPM's own strict requirements for processing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Arnold v. OPM</span>, 94 MSPR 86, 89-95 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-19 (2003), rejected the argument that a court order labeled as a QDRO (an ERISA term) could not be a court order acceptable for processing a division of retirement proceeds under the civil service retirement systems, although the Board required consideration on remand of the meaning of the court order:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts in his petition for review that a Federal agency is required to comply with the regulations it promulgates, and that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.302(a) "clearly and expressly state[s] that the OPM cannot and must not process court orders affecting retirement benefits unless they meet specified requirements. He contends that a court order labeled as a QDRO "must refer to the regulations and expressly state it was drafted in accordance with the regulations," and that in the absence of this language, OPM "cannot assume that the court was aware of the rules of construction set forth in the regulations and it cannot process the court order."<span class="Italic"></span> In support of this argument, the appellant relies on OPM's commentary published in the Federal Register at the time it issued section 838.302(a) as a final order, and notes that the QDRO contained ERISA terminology throughout the document. The appellant contends that OPM had proposed a total ban on processing QDROs, but adopted instead the requirements set forth at section 838.302(a) "to ensure it could process orders if, and only if, it could reasonably assume the state court issuing the order knew the QDRO was completed in accordance with the regulations."<span class="Italic"></span> The appellant asserts that this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Hunt</span> because it involves how retirement benefits should be divided between a spouse and a former spouse, not whether a former spouse is entitled to a survivor annuity, as addressed in <span class="Italic">Hunt.</span> Finally, the appellant asserts that even if the QDRO was acceptable for processing, the initial decision did not correctly apply OPM's regulations in calculating the amount of the award.<span class="Italic"></span> Because, as set forth below, we agree that <span class="Italic">Hunt</span> is distinguishable from this appeal, and find that OPM must explicitly rule on whether the QDRO in this case is acceptable for processing, we need not consider the appellant's argument regarding the amount of the award.</p>

Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.302(a)(1), any court order labeled as a "qualified domestic relations order" or issued on a form for ERISA qualified domestic relations orders "is not a court order acceptable for processing unless the court order<span class="Italic"> expressly</span> states that the provisions of the court order concerning CSRS or FERS [Federal Employees' Retirement System] benefits are governed by this part." (Emphasis added.) Section 838.302(a)(2) provides that, when a court order is required by paragraph (a)(1) to state that the provisions of a court order concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are governed by this part, the court order "<span class="Italic">must expressly--</span>(i) Refer to part 838 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, and (ii) State that the provisions of the court order concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are drafted in accordance with the terminology used in this part." (Emphasis added.) Although any language satisfying the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) would be sufficient to prevent a court order from being unacceptable under paragraph (a)(1), OPM recommends that parties use the language provided in &#x00B6; 001 in appendix A to subpart F of part 838 "to state that the provisions of the court order concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are governed by this part." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.302(a)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM had proposed a rule providing that any court order labeled a "Qualifying Domestic Relations Order" or "QDRO" is not acceptable for processing. 57 Fed. Reg. 120, 135 (1992). OPM reasoned that "[s]uch a court order demonstrates on its face that the court does not understand that CSRS and FERS are not covered by ERISA," and that "[m]ore importantly, the court order itself proves that our necessary presumption that the court is familiar with these regulations and that the court used the terms defined by these regulations intending those terms to have the meaning assigned by these regulations is incorrect." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 124.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on a comment received in response to that proposed rule, however, OPM promulgated the version of section 838.302 set forth in &#x00B6; 10 above as its final rule. In its Federal Register notice, OPM stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">ERISA created the term QDRO to describe a court order that summarizes the division of retirement benefits under ERISA plans. We decided to prohibit use of this label because we have seen from experience that attorneys prepare these orders on the assumption that they can provide any benefits available under ERISA to CSRS and FERS. Since we are exempt from ERISA, some provisions that ERISA plans must honor do not apply to us. The current practice of honoring as much of a QDRO as we can under our law has been difficult and controversial even when we were attempting to comply with the court's intent as well as its words. For our function to be ministerial, we and the court must be speaking the same language. To assure that the court has used our terminology, rather than ERISA's terminology, we proposed to prohibit QDRO's.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_4355"></span>The proposed total ban on QDRO's is more severe than necessary to accomplish its purpose. We have revised sections 838.302 and 838.803 to relax the total ban on QDRO's to accept court orders labelled QDRO's if the court orders expressly state that they are written in conformity with our regulations. We do not want to create an unnecessary trap for the uninformed. Since we can guarantee that the purpose of the ban--that the court understands that we are exempt from ERISA and that the court is using the terminology as provided in the regulations--is satisfied by requiring that any QDRO mention our regulations, we will accept QDRO's that expressly acknowledge that they are written to conform with our regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The requirement that a QDRO expressly state that it conforms with the regulations is necessary because even if the QDRO's terminology is acceptable, the court's intent may have been that the terms have different meanings than those assigned under these regulations. Abandoning the ban on QDRO's without requiring that QDRO's mention our regulations undermines the reasonableness of our assumption that the court is using our terminology, rather than ERISA terminology. That assumption is necessary for our actions to be ministerial, rather than having to interpret each court order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">57 Fed. Reg. 33570, 33572 (1992) (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the QDRO does not expressly state that the provisions of the court order concerning CSRS benefits are governed by part 838, does not expressly refer to part 838, and does not state that the provisions of the court order concerning CSRS benefits are drafted in accordance with the terminology used in part 838. Thus, it appears, based on our reading of the QDRO, that the QDRO is not acceptable for processing under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.302.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Because Congress did not directly address the issue of how to treat QDROs, and the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to that issue, the Board must determine whether OPM's interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 10 (2000), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 18 Fed. Appx. 837 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (NP), <span class="Italic">and aff'd sub nom. Delong v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 264 F.3d 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2001). OPM's interpretation of the statutes it administers is entitled to considerable weight, especially when there are no compelling reasons to conclude that such an interpretation is erroneous or unreasonable. <span class="Italic">Allen v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 77 M.S.P.R. 212, 217-18 (1998). Here, we find that OPM's interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute, and that there are no compelling reasons to conclude that such interpretation is erroneous or unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ relied upon <span class="Italic">Hunt t</span>o find that, because the QDRO expressly identified the CSRS as the only plan affected, there was no rational reason for OPM to reject the QDRO as unacceptable for processing. We agree with the appellant, however, that <span class="Italic">Hunt</span> is distinguishable from this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hunt,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 449, &#x00B6; 2, after the appellant (Sherry Hunt) and Jon Hunt, a Postal Service employee, divorced in 1992, Jon Hunt retired in September 1997, and died in November 1997. Sherry Hunt applied for a survivor annuity based on a QDRO that provided, in relevant part, that "[t]he retirement benefit plan subject to this order is the Civil Service Retirement System," and that "[t]he participant shall elect a benefit form that provides a survivor benefit (surviving spouse option). The survivor benefit shall be at least 30 percent of the benefit as of October 30, 1992, provided to the participant during the participant['] s life." <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 3. Although OPM found that, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.302, the QDRO was not acceptable for processing because it did not include a reference to part 838 and therefore denied the request for a survivor annuity, and, although the Board's AJ affirmed that decision, the Board reversed and ordered OPM to award Sherry Hunt a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 4-5, 15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found in <span class="Italic">Hunt</span> that "under the circumstances presented here an inflexible application of the regulations would frustrate the language and intent of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)," which provides that "a former spouse of a deceased employee is entitled to survivor annuity if and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree."<span class="Italic"> Id.,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 12. The Board found that the purpose of the regulations is to require that a court order for the assignment of Federal retirement benefits clearly indicate the retirement plan affected, to assure that OPM need not interpret the court order to ascertain the intent of the parties or the court, and to avoid confusion concerning the benefits available under Federal plans as opposed to those available under plans covered by ERISA. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 12. The Board found that the plain language of the QDRO in <span class="Italic">Hunt</span> expressly identified the CSRS as the plan affected by the order, and that Jon Hunt was required by that court order to elect a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Board further found that it was clear that the parties intended that no other plan, besides the CSRS, be subject to the terms of the order, and that "[w]here there is no question on the face of the order (or contrary evidence elsewhere in the record) that <span class="Italic">only</span> CSRS benefits were intended to be affected, the regulations' avowed purpose of avoiding confusion as to the identity of the plan or the applicability of OPM regulations disappears." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis in original). The Board concluded that there was no rational reason to apply the regulation to deny the survivor annuity when the "expressly provided" requirement of the statute was met, and the CSRS plan was the only plan that could have been intended by the court's order. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, by contrast, the issue is not simply whether the QDRO expressly provides for a survivor annuity and clearly identifies the CSRS as the only applicable plan. Rather, the issue in this case is how to interpret an ambiguous provision of the QDRO that divides the appellant's retirement annuity. The applicable provision of the QDRO references both a formula and a specific, annual dollar amount. Unlike the situation in<span class="Italic"> Hunt,</span> where there was no dispute as to the meaning of the QDRO, how to interpret the QDRO is in dispute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In fact, the QDRO in this case provides that "[i]t is intended that this Order will qualify as a Qualified Domestic Relations Order under the Retirement Equity Act of 1984,<span class="Italic"> and the provisions hereof shall be administered and interpreted in conformity with such Act.</span> Thus, the QDRO itself not only does not reference 5 C.F.R. part 838, but specifically provides that it is to be interpreted in accordance with the Retirement Equity Act of 1984, an amendment to ERISA,<span class="Italic"> see</span> Pub. L. No. 98-397, Tit. III, 98 Stat. 1451, and not interpreted in accordance with the regulations and terminology set forth at 5 C.F.R. part 838. We therefore find that applying 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.624(a) to resolve this case, when there is no indication that the parties and the court intended that the provisions of the QDRO be governed by this section or any other section of part 838, would frustrate the Congressional purpose that prompted OPM to promulgate 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.302, namely, that OPM's role be purely ministerial, that the Federal government not insert itself into marital property disputes, and that the dispute resolution role rest in the hands of the state courts as originally intended by Congress. <span class="Italic">See</span> 57 Fed. Reg. 33570 (1992). We cannot presume, based on this record, that the parties and the state court judge intended that the formula prevail over the dollar amount, as OPM and the initial decision hold in this case, when there is no indication that they intended that the QDRO be interpreted that way under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.624(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not, however, definitively rule at this time that the QDRO is not acceptable for processing. It is not clear, based on the existing record, whether OPM failed to consider whether the QDRO was acceptable for processing when it issued its initial and reconsideration decisions in this case, or whether OPM considered that issue and implicitly relied on <span class="Italic">Hunt,</span> or on some other basis of which we are unaware, to accept the QDRO for processing. Under these circumstances, we find it appropriate to remand this appeal to OPM for an explicit determination on the issue of whether the QDRO is acceptable for processing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hyde v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 40 M.S.P.R. 204, 207 (1989) (remanding to OPM for a supplemental reconsideration decision when OPM had yet to address the issue of the validity of the decedent's marriage, and thus had yet to issue an appealable reconsideration decision on that issue).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kimble v. OPM</span>, 103 MSPR 175, 2006 MSPB 254 (2006) (QDRO terminology confusion, and some similarities in the facts to <span class="Italic">Hunt</span> and <span class="Italic">Arnold,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>; remanded for further factfinding and interpretation of the divorce decree provisions concerning division of the annuity with the former spouse). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Kincaid v. OPM</span>, 104 MSPR 42, 2006 MSPB 324 (2006) (court order that provides a former spouse survivor annuity in one section and then grants to the husband all rights to pension interest in another provision cannot be construed to grant the former spouse annuity).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hayward v. OPM</span>, 109 MSPR 13, 2008 MSPB 109 (2008), declined to apportion annuity interests, including a former spouse survivor annuity, on the basis of a court decree that was ambiguous--containing what the Board deemed to be unclear references to both military and civilian pension interests and language referencing ERISA. A subsequent, clarifying court decree was rejected as an improper attempt to modify the first decree that addressed the annuity interests. The result reached by the Board was rejected by the Federal Circuit, reversing the Board in <span class="Italic">Hayward v. OPM,</span> 578 F.3d 1337, 1339-1350 (Fed. Cir. 2009), based on the court's interpretation of the provisions of the state court divorce decree concerning annuity interests, as further explained by other issuances of the state court:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Hayward is the former spouse of Jack N. Hayward ("Mr. Hayward"). The Haywards were married in 1963, were separated in 1984, and divorced in 1986. Mr. Hayward served on active duty, with both the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy, and was later a member of the Army Reserves. In addition, in 1966, Mr. Hayward began working in the first of several Civil Service positions with the Army. He retired from his final Civil Service position, Equipment Specialist for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in 1996....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On January 11, 1989, the Haywards signed a consent order in the Court of Common Pleas--Family Division, in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania ("Court of Common Pleas"), dividing their marital property. Pursuant to <span id="Page_4356"></span>that order, on March 26, 1990, the Court of Common Pleas signed two QDROs, one addressing Mr. Hayward's military pension (the "1990 Military QDRO"), and one addressing his civil service pension (the "1990 Civil Service QDRO"). While largely identical, the two orders differ in certain respects. The 1990 Civil Service QDRO recites that Mr. Hayward "was employed by the Department U.S. Army [sic] and is a participant in the Civilian [sic] Service Retirement Plan," whereas the 1990 Military QDRO recites that Mr. Hayward "was employed by the U.S. Army Reserves and is a participant in the Military Retired Pay Plan." Both orders indicate the retirement plans covered. The 1990 Civil Service QDRO states "[t]he Plan to which this Order applies is the Civil Service Retirement System Pension Plan in which Jack Hayward is a participant," while the 1990 Military QDRO specifies "[t]he Plan to which this Order applies is the Military Retired Pay Plan pension plan in which Jack Hayward is a participant." The 1990 Civil Service QDRO requires that the parties notify the "Civilian [sic] Service Retirement Plan Administrator" of address changes; the 1990 Military QDRO requires that the parties notify the "Military Retired Pay Plan Pension Fund Administrator" of such changes. Both QDROs provide that Ms. Hayward be paid a share of Mr. Hayward's retirement benefits. The QDROs also provide that the parties should submit the orders to the administrators of the respective retirement plans.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As far as survivor annuities are concerned, both orders state that "[i]n the event that the Participant is eligible for the Survivor Benefit Plan provided pursuant to Title 10 U.S.C. Section 1447, and 1448 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, the Participant shall select the survivor benefit form which pays the largest monthly benefit to the survivor." Notably, 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1447 governs survivor benefit plans for armed forces members. At the same time, although Mr. Hayward's CSRS benefits are governed by Title 5, neither of the QDROs makes any mention of provisions in that title. Both orders do provide, however, that "[t]he survivor benefit chosen shall be at least 50% of the benefit provided to the Participant during the Participant's life."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Shortly after the entry of the orders, the 1990 Military QDRO was submitted to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service ("DFAS") for processing. <span class="Italic">Hayward v. Hayward,</span> 919 A.2d 980, slip op. at 3 (Pa. Super. Ct. Jan. 18, 2007) (Table, nonprecedential) ("Pa. Court Opinion"). Ms. Hayward also contends that, around that same time, her attorney submitted the 1990 Civil Service QDRO to OPM for processing. However, the record before us only shows that, on March 28, 1990, Ms. Hayward's attorney submitted the 1990 Civil Service QDRO to the Civilian Personnel Office of the Army. DFAS found the 1990 Military QDRO unacceptable for processing. As a result, Ms. Hayward's attorney prepared another military QDRO, which was entered by the Court of Common Pleas on May 31, 1995 (the "1995 Military QDRO"). This QDRO was subsequently accepted by DFAS. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2001, Mr. Hayward filed a motion for special relief, requesting a modification of the 1995 Military QDRO. During the resulting proceedings, a hearing officer for the Court of Common Pleas discovered that Mr. Hayward had retired from his Civil Service position in 1996, and had "surreptitiously placed his civil service pension into pay status" at the time of retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the court ordered Mr. Hayward to begin paying Ms. Hayward 30% of each monthly CSRS benefit, "plus an additional $500 per month" in arrears payments for the period between his 1996 retirement and when it was discovered he had been receiving an annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Hayward's attorney submitted the 1990 Civil Service QDRO to OPM with a cover letter dated July 24, 2001. She also attached the cover letter that was written when she sent the 1990 Civil Service QDRO to the Civilian Personnel Office of the Army on March 28, 1990. Final Decision, 109 M.S.P.R. at 15. Her cover letter to OPM recited that she understood "the inquiries [regarding the 1990 Civil Service QDRO] should now be directed to you [OPM]." In due course, OPM advised Ms. Hayward that the QDRO which her attorney had submitted did not meet the requirements set out in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.302, and thus was unacceptable for processing. Ms. Hayward's attorney "then filed [a] proposed order[&#8197;] to effect distribution of her share of [Mr. Hayward's] civil service...pension[&#8197;] " with the Court of Common Pleas. The proposed order also provided for a CSRS former spouse survivor annuity. On October 26, 2005, the Pennsylvania court accepted Ms. Hayward's proposed new Civil Service QDRO (the "2005 Civil Service QDRO"), which specifically provided for a CSRS former spouse survivor annuity.<span class="Italic"></span> Thereafter, on February 8, 2006, OPM accepted the October 26, 2005 QDRO for the purposes of awarding an apportionment of Mr. Hayward's monthly retirement annuity. However, since the 2005 Civil Service QDRO was a modification of the 1990 Civil Service QDRO and was entered after Mr. Hayward's 1996 retirement, OPM determined that the QDRO was not acceptable for processing under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806(a) for purposes of a former spouse survivor annuity. Further, OPM reiterated that the 1990 Civil Service QDRO also was not acceptable for processing for the same purpose, because it did not comply with the requirements of 5 C.F.R. part 838. On June 15, 2007, OPM issued a reconsideration decision affirming its prior determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As an initial matter, the Board agreed with the AJ that the 2005 Civil Service QDRO was an improper modification of the 1990 Civil Service QDRO, as it was made after Mr. Hayward's retirement. Thus, the Board found that OPM properly rejected the 2005 Civil Service QDRO under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4). The Board then analyzed whether the original 1990 Civil Service QDRO was acceptable for processing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found that the 1990 Civil Service QDRO did not "expressly" provide for a former spouse survivor annuity as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1), and that therefore OPM properly refused to process the order. Final Decision, 109 M.S.P.R. at 18-19. Although the Board acknowledged that no "magic words" were required to award a CSRS former spouse survivor annuity, it stressed that the intent to provide a survivor annuity must "be clear, definite, explicit, plain, direct, and unmistakable, not dubious or ambiguous."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 17. The Board determined that the 1990 Civil Service QDRO was ambiguous because, while it referred to the "Civilian [sic] Service Retirement System," it also cited "solely to statutes that do not apply to CSRS retirement benefits." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 18. Focusing on the fact that Mr. Hayward was entitled to both military and civil service benefits, the Board opined that while the purpose of the 1990 Civil Service QDRO may have been to award a CSRS survivor annuity despite the references to Title 10, the purpose equally could have been to award a military survivor annuity under Title 10, despite the references to the "Civilian [sic] Service Retirement Plan." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Because of this ambiguity, the Board concluded that the QDRO did not expressly provide a CSRS survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board then proceeded to discuss 5 C.F.R. part 838, the regulatory section promulgated to assist OPM in effectuating state court orders affecting retirement benefits. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.803, the 1990 Civil Service QDRO must expressly state that it is governed by 5 C.F.R. part 838. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 19. However, the 1990 Civil Service QDRO not only failed to reference 5 C.F.R. part 838, but, according to the Board, also misreferenced "ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code, and statutes governing military retired pay benefits." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 19-20. In the Board's view, these references supported the conclusion that the QDRO was ambiguous, and indicated as well that it was not completed in compliance with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 803.803(a). Thus, the Board concluded that the 1990 Civil Service QDRO was not acceptable for processing. Ms. Hayward has timely appealed the Board's final decision. We have jurisdiction over final decisions of the Board under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next address whether the Board erred in affirming OPM's reconsideration decision that the 1990 Civil Service QDRO is not acceptable for processing under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1). Section 8341(h)(1) provides, in relevant part (emphasis added), that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a former spouse of a deceased employee, Member, annuitant, or former Member who was separated from the service with title to a deferred annuity under section 8338(b) of this title is entitled to a survivor annuity under this subsection, if and to the extent <span class="Italic">expressly provided for</span> in an election under section 8339(j)(3) of this title, or in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Hayward argues that, in her case, a former spouse survivor annuity is "expressly provided for," because the purpose of the 1990 Civil Service QDRO is clear in that regard. Ms. Hayward urges that both this court and the Board have ruled that no "magic words" are required to grant such an annuity. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Snyder v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 463 F.3d 1338, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2006); <span class="Italic">Fox v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 100 F.3d 141, 145-46 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 46 M.S.P.R. 340, 343 (1994). According to Ms. Hayward, under the law of this court and the Board, the QDRO's multiple references to "survivor benefit," "Survivor Benefit Plan," "Civilian [sic] Service Retirement System," and "Civil Service Retirement System Pension Plan" are clear enough to grant a CSRS former spouse survivor annuity under &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1). She also urges that a QDRO must be significantly more ambiguous than the one in this case in order for OPM to properly deny a former spouse survivor annuity. In that regard, she notes that a CSRS former spouse survivor annuity has been denied when some provisions of the order purported to grant the annuity, while others seemingly waived rights to such an annuity. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Kincaid v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 42, 46 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response, the government points to the 1990 Civil Service QDRO's multiple references to Title 10, the title which governs retirement and survivor benefits arising from service in the armed forces. The government further points out that the term "Survivor Benefit Plan" "is used to define survivor benefits relating to members or former members of the armed forces." Appellee's Br. 10 (citing 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1447). The government stresses that OPM's role is strictly ministerial, and that it cannot be tasked with interpreting the terms of state divorce decrees or orders. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.101(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that "OPM is neither qualified nor obligated to resolve <span id="Page_4357"></span>disputes about the import of state divorce decrees...OPM's task is 'purely ministerial' with respect to court ordered property settlements."<span class="Italic"> Perry v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 243 F.3d 1337, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2001) <span class="Italic">(quoting Snyder,</span> 136 F.3d at 1477); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.101(a)(2). We also recognize that "neither we nor the Board is permitted by the terms of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h) to rewrite or equitably reform state court divorce decrees or settlement agreements that do not unambiguously provide for a CSRS annuity." <span class="Italic">Fox,</span> 100 F.3d at 145. Thus, the intent to award a CSRS survivor annuity must be clear.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We set forth a framework for analyzing orders under &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1) in <span class="Italic">Fox,</span> noting that "no magic words" are required to award a former spouse survivor annuity. 100 F.3d at 145; <span class="Italic">see also Snyder,</span> 463 F.3d at 1342 (analyzing the requirement in the post-1993 regulatory regime). In order "to determine that a court order without any magic words does provide the survivor annuity benefit, the tribunal must first determine whether the order contains a pertinent clause regarding a survivor annuity." <span class="Italic">Snyder,</span> 463 F.3d at 1342; <span class="Italic">see also Fox,</span> 100 F.3d at 146. If the order does contain such a clause, the court "must inquire whether the operative terms in that clause can 'fairly be read as awarding' the annuity." <span class="Italic">Snyder,</span> 463 F.3d at 1342 <span class="Italic">(quoting Fox,</span> 100 F.3d at 146). If these two preliminary requirements are met, the court "must 'examine any evidence introduced concerning the marriage parties' intent and the circumstances surrounding the execution of the document' to interpret the clause."<span class="Italic"> Snyder,</span> 463 F.3d at 1342<span class="Italic"> (quoting Fox,</span> 100 F.3d at 146). "If the evidence only dictates that the 'clause refers to a CSRS survivor annuity--then it is legal error to conclude that the document has not "expressly provided for" the award of a survivor annuity' as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1)." <span class="Italic">Snyder,</span> 463 F.3d at 1342 <span class="Italic">(quoting Fox,</span> 100 F.3d at 146). While we are mindful that "OPM will not look behind a state court divorce decree or property settlement order to ascertain the intent of the parties," <span class="Italic">Rosado v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 165 F.3d 1377, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1999), we may look to extrinsic evidence to discover whether the QDRO is unambiguous as to the intent to award a CSRS former spouse survivor annuity, <span class="Italic">Fox,</span> 100 F.3d at 146 &#x0026; n.3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to Ms. Hayward's case, we must first determine whether the 1990 Civil Service QDRO has a pertinent clause that can fairly be read as awarding a former spouse survivor annuity. In that regard, the QDRO provides that if Mr. Hayward is "eligible for the Survivor Benefit Plan," then he "shall select the survivor benefit form which pays the largest monthly benefit." The QDRO also references survivor benefits in multiple places. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7c, 7e. We have previously held that the term "Survivors Benefit Plan" is explicit enough to award a CSRS annuity, despite the fact it may "mirror" the "military plan" language. <span class="Italic">Fox,</span> 100 F.3d at 144 ("[t]he difference between the term which would have precisely named the civil service benefit--'survivor annuity'--is only slightly different than the term actually used in the Agreement--"Survivors Benefit Plan."). We think that the language discussing the "Survivor Benefit Plan" in the 1990 Civil Service QDRO, when combined with the references to Mr. Hayward's participation in the "Civilian Service Retirement System" and the "Civil Service Retirement System Pension Plan" compels the conclusion that the survivor benefit clause in the QDRO can fairly be read as awarding a CSRS annuity. The government correctly observes that the 1990 Civil Service QDRO is ambiguous to the extent it refers to both Mr. Hayward's military benefits (based on the references to Title 10), and his civil service benefits (based on the references to the Civil Service Retirement System Pension Plan). However, because the pertinent clause in the 1990 Civil Service QDRO can fairly be read as awarding a CSRS survivor annuity, we must look to extrinsic evidence to discover the true intent of the parties. <span class="Italic">See Snyder,</span> 463 F.3d at 1342.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Extrinsic evidence reveals that two QDROs in this case--the 1990 Military QDRO and the 1990 Civil Service QDRO--were entered by the Court of Common Pleas in March of 1990. This indicates that the parties were cognizant of the need to apportion both Mr. Hayward's military and civil service benefit plans. Ms. Hayward's attorney sent Mr. Hayward several letters indicating that multiple QDROs were attached and needed to be signed. Ms. Hayward contends that any ambiguity is removed because there are two orders. According to Ms. Hayward, the clear intent was to award her a survivor annuity under both Mr. Hayward's military and civil service plans. The government counters that the orders are remarkably similar, and that the parties likely copied and cut and pasted the 1990 Military QDRO when preparing the 1990 Civil Service QDRO. The government states that the drafter of the two orders may have intended to delete paragraph 7c, the paragraph dealing with the Survivor Benefit Plan, from the 1990 Civil Service QDRO but keep it in the 1990 Military QDRO. The government argues this is especially likely because paragraph 7c specifically mentions that the plan is pursuant to "Section 1447, and 1448 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>," which govern military benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not persuaded by the government's argument. The presence of two separate QDROs demonstrates that the parties appreciated the need to apportion both Mr. Hayward's civil service and military plans. Although the 1990 Civil Service QDRO refers to statutes governing military benefits, we have no difficulty concluding that these references reflect a lack of care in drafting the QDRO, rather than uncertainty about whether Ms. Hayward is entitled to a former spouse survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additional evidence of record confirms to us that the clear intent of the 1990 Civil Service QDRO was to provide a CSRS former spouse survivor annuity. As we have stated, in enacting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1), Congress expressed concern that OPM might construe state dispositions contrary to their intended effect. <span class="Italic">Davenport v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 62 F.3d 1384, 1387 (Fed. Cir. 1995) ("The statute requires that the [QDRO] 'expressly' provide for a survivor benefit, so as to ensure that OPM will not contrive a disposition that the state court did not contemplate."). As the Board has noted, the "traditional arbiters in divorce proceedings" are state courts, and thus OPM must only effectuate, and not interpret, such orders. <span class="Italic">Kincaid,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. at 45.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, we have clear guidance on how the Pennsylvania courts viewed the 1990 Civil Service QDRO. Both the Court of Common Pleas and the Superior Court of Pennsylvania found that the intent of the 1990 Civil Service QDRO was to award a CSRS former spouse survivor annuity. Specifically, the Court of Common Pleas stated that the later 2005 Civil Service QDRO, which clearly provided for a former spouse survivor annuity, "simply conformed with the Court's previously issued orders." <span class="Italic">Hayward v. Hayward,</span> No. 85-02800-002, slip op. at 4 (Pa. Ct. Com. Pl. May 2, 2006). The Court of Common Pleas also stated that the 1990 Civil Service QDRO "in fact included a directive that the employee spouse elect a survivor benefit plan with Wife [Ms. Hayward] as the beneficiary." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Superior Court affirmed this finding, stating that "the [1990] QDROs provide that Wife [Ms. Hayward] is entitled to...survivor benefits from both the military and civil service pensions." Pa. Court Opinion, slip op. at 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations governing CSRS former spouse survivor annuities specifically provide that "any court order that...explains, clarifies, or interprets the original written order regardless of the effective date" is not an improper modification, and thus can be considered. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806(f)(2); <span class="Italic">see also Warren v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 407 F.3d 1309, 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (noting the regulations). In this case, the court that entered the QDROs stated that the parties' intent with respect to the 1990 Civil Service QDRO was to award a CSRS former spouse survivor annuity. We think it would frustrate the statutory purpose if we unambiguously knew what was contemplated by the parties and the court in drafting the 1990 Civil Service QDRO, and yet did not effectuate that intent. <span class="Italic">Cf. Davenport,</span> 62 F.3d at 1384 ("If the purpose of the statute is to ensure that OPM will respect the disposition intended by the state court order, OPM should be free in such a case to consult the divorce decree when the decree clarifies the meaning of the QDRO."). In sum, "the facts and circumstances...clearly dictate" the conclusion that the 1990 Civil Service QDRO was meant to award a CSRS survivor annuity for a former spouse. <span class="Italic">Fox,</span> 100 F.3d at 146. Accordingly, we find that the 1990 Civil Service QDRO meets the requirements of &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1), and therefore is acceptable for processing by OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we address the government's contention that the 1990 Civil Service QDRO does not meet the requirements set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.803. Section 838.803 provides in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;Qualifying Domestic Relations Orders.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;Any court order labeled as a "qualified domestic relations order" or issued on a form for ERISA qualified domestic relations orders is not a court order acceptable for processing unless the court order expressly states that the provisions of the court order concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are governed by this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;When a court order is required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section to state that the provisions of a court order concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are governed by this part the court order must--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(i)&#x2003;Expressly refer to part 838 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(ii)&#x2003;Expressly state that the provisions of the court order concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are drafted in accordance with the terminology used in this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;Although any language satisfying the requirement of paragraph (a)(2) of this section is sufficient to prevent a court order from being unacceptable under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, OPM recommends the use of the language provided in &#x00B6; 001 in appendix A to subpart F of this part to state that the provisions of the court order concerning CSRS or FERS benefits are governed by this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(4)&#x2003;A court order directed at employee annuity that contains the language described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section must also satisfy all other requirements of this subpart to be a court order acceptable for processing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government correctly notes that the 1990 Civil Service QDRO does <span id="Page_4358"></span>not mention part 838, or state that the provisions concerning CSRS "benefits are drafted in accordance with the terminology used in [part 838.] " Additionally, the government notes Board precedent to the effect that when the meaning of a QDRO is disputed, and there is no express reference to part 838 of C.F.R. Title 5, a court cannot use the provisions of that part to interpret any ambiguities. Appellee's Br. 14 (discussing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.302); <span class="Italic">see Arnold v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 86, 94 (2003) (finding it inappropriate to apply regulations from part 838, "when there is no indication that the parties and the court intended that the provisions of the QDRO be governed by...part 838"). Although in some circumstances the Board has awarded a former spouse survivor annuity without the express language required by section 838.803, the government contends this approach is possible only "where there is no question...that only CSRS benefits were intended to be affected." <span class="Italic">Hunt v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 449, 453 (2001) (discussing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.302). In this case, the government argues, the many references to Title 10 in the 1990 Civil Service QDRO create ambiguity and raise doubt regarding which of Mr. Hayward's two plans was meant to be affected. Thus, the government concludes the 1990 Civil Service QDRO does not meet the requirements set forth in section 838.803. In response, Ms. Hayward reiterates her arguments addressing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1). She states that the parties' and the Pennsylvania courts' intent to award a CSRS former spouse survivor annuity is clear, and that "an inflexible application of the regulations would frustrate the language and intent of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)." <span class="Italic">Hunt,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. at 453.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with Ms. Hayward that the intent of her order supports an award of a CSRS former spouse survivor annuity. The order is "labeled as a qualified domestic relations order." Thus, it must meet the requirements set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.803. This court has had limited opportunity to address the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.803. However, this court and the Board have analyzed the parallel language of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.302. The requirement in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.302 "was designed to aid courts and parties in formulating property division provisions that would be acceptable to OPM and would carry out the court's and the parties' intentions." <span class="Italic">Perry,</span> 243 F.3d at 1344. In promulgating the two parallel regulations, "OPM's purpose was to avoid the need to interpret...court orders, assuring uniformity of technical terms, [and] avoiding confusion in light of the many jurisdictions issuing [orders] .... OPM intended generally to quickly and easily end disputes over interpretations of state court orders." <span class="Italic">Hunt,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. at 453; <span class="Italic">see also</span> Court Orders Affecting Retirement Benefits, 57 Fed. Reg. 33,570 (July 29, 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With this in mind, the Board has cautioned against a rigid application of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.302 (or &#x00A7; 838.803) that "'frustrate[s] the language and intent of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h).'" <span class="Italic">Arnold,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. at 93 <span class="Italic">(quoting Hunt,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. at 453). The purpose of the regulations is to preserve OPM's ministerial function, assuring that OPM will not have to interpret orders to ascertain the parties' intent. We adopt the Board's logic that "there is no rational reason to apply the regulation to deny the survivor annuity where the 'expressly provided' requirement of the statute is met, and the CSRS plan is the only plan that could have been intended by the court's order." <span class="Italic">Hunt,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. at 453-54.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, we find that the CSRS plan is the only plan that could have been intended by the Court of Common Pleas's order, and thus the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.803 are met. As we previously stated, Mr. Hayward was entitled to benefits from both his military service and civil service. The Court of Common Pleas entered two QDROs, one addressing each of the plans. We find the 1990 Civil Service QDRO applied only to Mr. Hayward's civil service benefits based on the references to Mr. Hayward's employment by the Department of the U.S. Army, the "Civilian [sic] Service Retirement System," the "Civil Service Retirement System Pension Plan," and the "Civilian Service Retirement Plan Administrator." By contrast, the 1990 Military QDRO contains no references to civilian service, mentions his employment with the U.S. Army Reserves, and indicates multiple times the plan addressed is the "Military Retired Pay Plan." For these reasons, Mr. Hayward's civil service plan "is the only plan that could have been intended by the court's [1990 Civil Service QDRO]." <span class="Italic">Hunt,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. at 453-54.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, as we have discussed above, the Pennsylvania court system specifically recognized that the 1990 Civil Service QDRO granted a CSRS former spouse survivor annuity. The concerns addressed through the promulgation of the regulations are not issues in this case--the intent of the parties has been interpreted by the state court entering the QDROs. <span class="Italic">See Hunt,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. at 453 ("[t]he purpose of the regulations is...to assure that OPM need not interpret the court order to ascertain the intent of the parties or the court...."). In this case, OPM does not have to interpret an ambiguous order or fear erroneously construing the parties' intent. The Court of Common Pleas has stated the intent was to provide a CSRS former spouse survivor annuity, to be governed under 5 C.F.R. part 838. Therefore, we find that the 1990 Civil Service QDRO is acceptable for processing under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.803.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the language that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 838.302(a) and 803.803(a) require for orders to be "acceptable for processing" was added to the regulations in 1993, after the Court of Common Pleas entered the 1990 Civil Service QDRO. We recognized in <span class="Italic">Perry</span> that applying the technical linguistic requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.302 to orders written before the regulations were promulgated would defeat the purpose of the regulation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Indeed, applying subsection 302(a) retroactively to the [previously written] divorce decree would be inconsistent with the purpose of requiring particular language in divorce decrees. That requirement was designed to aid courts and parties in formulating property division provisions that would be acceptable to OPM and would carry out the court's and the parties' intentions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When the [state court] entered the divorce decree in 1986, it had no reason to anticipate that seven years later OPM would impose a new requirement without which the court's language would be unacceptable, or to try to include language that would satisfy that future requirement. Thus, the purpose of specifying the language to be included in a court order that described a divorce decree as a "Qualified Domestic Relations Order--to enable the court to draft such an order that would be acceptable to OPM--would not be served by making the regulatory requirement retroactive, since the court would have had no reason or basis for meeting the requirement when it entered the decree years before.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Perry,</span> 243 F.3d at 1344. The same is necessarily true of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.803. Although the order here was not received by OPM until after 1993, the order was entered in 1990, before the regulations were drafted. Under these circumstances, applying the technical language of the regulations to the order would not serve the purpose of those regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a final note, we observe that the safest course of action is to follow the suggested language provided by OPM. In 5 C.F.R., part 838, subpart F, Appendix A, &#x00B6; 001, OPM suggests adding the following paragraph to CSRS QDROs to ensure they meet the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 838.302 and 838.803:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The court has considered the requirements and standard terminology provided in part 838 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations. The terminology used in the provisions of this order that concern benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System are governed by the standard conventions established in that part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Use of this language will better ensure that the intent of the parties is clear, and that former spouses are properly awarded survivor annuities when they are entitled to them. Further, it will (hopefully) decrease the amount of litigation required to award these benefits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appellant disagrees with OPM's interpretations and application of the division of the annuity stated in the qualifying court order, appeal may be taken from the OPM decision to the Board and the Board will, assuming clarity in the order, rectify an error in the calculation of how annuity benefits are to be divided. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dargel v. OPM</span>, 20 MSPR 48 (1984). The Board construes the divorce decree provisions pertaining to retirement benefits as a whole under the state law governing the decree. <span class="Italic">Levy v. OPM</span>, 41 MSPR 139, 144 (1989) (harmonizing provisions of divorce decree awarding a share of a disability retirement benefit and another provision of the decree concerning a community interest in the appellant's retirement benefits), <span class="Italic">rev'd,</span> <span class="Italic">Levy v. OPM</span>, 902 F.2d 1550, 1554 &#x0026; n.8 (Fed. Cir. 1990) ("We conclude that the Board's decision is contrary to controlling California law.&#8197;...Here California law applies. No amount of deference can sustain a federal agency's interpretation of state law when, as here, the agency's interpretation is in direct conflict with decisions of the state's highest court concerning that state's marital property laws. Consequently, the deference to which OPM contends it is entitled is misplaced."). <span class="Italic">Levy</span> was distinguished, however, as involving a narrow issue of California community property law in <span class="Italic">Perry v. OPM</span>, 243 F.3d 1337, 1341-42 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The court determined that OPM was not required to analyze more complex issues of state law to arrive at an annuity apportionment different than what its regulations provided in the absence of an exact apportionment in the divorce decree:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...OPM was not required to delve into the details and intricacies of Florida law to determine whether application of its formula in this case was inconsistent with that law. If Perry believed that the divorce decree did not permit OPM's interpretation of it because that interpretation violated Florida law, it was incumbent on him to seek clarification or modification of the decree by the Florida court. Paragraph 32 of the decree provided for such action, since subparagraph d provided: "This court retains jurisdiction to amend this order for the purpose of establishing or maintaining its qualification as a Qualified Domestic Relations Order and to carry out its award of part of the retirement/pension plan to the Wife." As Perry admitted at oral argument, he did not seek such relief.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a court order is in proper form, OPM is bound to honor it as to, for example, payment of a lump sum to a former spouse. That OPM received and honored a conflicting request for the same funds from the employee did not excuse it from making payment to the former spouse in accordance with the court order. OPM's remedy was against the employee, not against his former wife, <span id="Page_4359"></span>who properly received the funds in accordance with that order. <span class="Italic">Hatcher v. OPM</span>, 39 MSPR 340, 344 n.3 (1988), noted as to qualifying court orders:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1704(c)(1)(i), orders that direct or imply that OPM is to make payment of a portion of employee retirement benefits, or are neutral about the source of payment, will be honored unless the retiree can demonstrate that the order is invalid. In addition, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1704(c)(1)(ii), where an order specifically directs the retiree to pay a portion of employee retirement benefits to a former spouse and does not contain language to show that the court intends payment from the Civil Service Retirement System, OPM will nevertheless honor the order unless the retiree timely objects to direct payment by OPM. While these provisions are not directly applicable to the situation before the Board, they do evidence a strong Congressional intent that OPM play a substantial role in the distribution of retirement benefits when a court orders them apportioned.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An ambiguous court decree can lead to the denial of a former spouse survivor annuity, <span class="Italic">Hahn v. OPM</span>, 71 MSPR 154, 155-58 (1996) (dissent by Member Amador):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland, by order dated November 10, 1987, granted a divorce between the appellant and Roberta W. Hahn, and incorporated into the judgment, the provisions of a Separation Agreement, dated September 28, 1980. The former wife's attorney submitted the court order and Separation Agreement to OPM in December 1987, and in a letter dated August 31, 1988, OPM advised the attorney that OPM would not make a determination on the court order until benefits become payable, i.e., when the employee retired.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant retired on January 4, 1994, and apparently designated his second wife to receive a survivor benefit. In an undated letter from OPM notifying the appellant when his first check would arrive, the appellant's second wife was designated to receive the survivor annuity. Approximately five months after the appellant retired, OPM notified the appellant by letter dated June 13, 1994, that it received the court order intending to award a survivor annuity to his former spouse and that it intended to honor it. OPM later issued a reconsideration decision, finding that the court order was a qualifying order which expressly provided a survivor annuity for the appellant's former spouse under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(j)(1) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.1004. OPM also stated that if the appellant's former spouse submitted a notarized statement relinquishing her claim to a survivor annuity, it could not be honored because it was not a court order; and a court confirmation of the appellant and his former spouse's intention could not be honored since it was a modification issued after the effective commencing date of the appellant's annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following a hearing, the administrative judge affirmed OPM's reconsideration decision. She found that the Separation Agreement identified the retirement system to be affected, expressly provided for a survivor annuity for the appellant's former spouse, and was not limited to a period of eight years, as asserted by the appellant. In his petition for review of the initial decision, the appellant repeats his argument made below that any entitlement to a survivor annuity ceased, at the latest, in 1988, and that the agreement did not expressly provide for a survivor annuity for his former wife without limitation. The appellant also contends that there are other reasonable interpretations of the court order than the one arrived at by OPM and the administrative judge. OPM has not submitted a response.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A former spouse of a Federal employee may be entitled to survivor annuity benefits "if and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms" of any court order or court-approved property settlement incident to any court decree of divorce. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(j)(1). The "expressly provided for" provision does not require "magic words," but only that the intent to provide the survivor annuity be clear, definite, explicit, plain, direct, and unmistakable, not dubious or ambiguous. <span class="Italic">See Holzman v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 62 M.S.P.R. 254, 257 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 48 F.3d 1237 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). The Board has interpreted this provision as precluding the Board or OPM from undertaking its own determination of spousal entitlements and awarding survivor benefits based on uncertain or ambiguous state court orders. <span class="Italic">See Nicholson v. Office of Personnel Management</span> 64 M.S.P.R. 340, 342 (1994). The interpretation of what is expressly provided for must, of course, be made on a case by case basis. <span class="Italic">See Turner v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. 55, 63 (1993). We find that the Separation Agreement in this case contains unclear and ambiguous language relating to the duration of the survivor annuity rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Separation Agreement entered into in 1980, provides in paragraph 2.5 that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">He shall maintain his present retirement...for the benefit of Wife <span class="Italic">until the parties are finally divorced.</span> (Emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, paragraph 6.3 also clearly seeks to limit the survivor benefits and other financial obligations of the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">At the end of eight (8) years from the date of this agreement...then Husband's financial obligation to Wife shall be terminated....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> The first sentence of paragraph 7.4, however, seeks to limit insurance coverage to the duration of the husband's financial obligation, while the second sentence, relied upon by OPM and the administrative judge, refers to survivor benefits without adding the temporary duration:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Wife and children shall be named as primary beneficiaries of Husband's insurance policies described in this agreement, so long as necessary to cover the agreed obligations of Husband.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's role in interpreting a court order requiring the termination of an annuity is governed by the terms of the applicable order. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(3). In addition, OPM is limited by its own regulations, which state that the duration of a future former spouse survivor annuity right terminates in accordance with the terms of the court order. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.732. Further, OPM's regulations also clarify and distinguish between OPM's and the court's role in executing court orders: "OPM must honor the clear instructions of the court...OPM will not...interpret ambiguous language....&#8197;OPM performs purely ministerial actions....&#8197;Disagreement...must be resolved by the court."<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.101(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has clearly articulated its view that a former spouse is not "expressly provided for" if ambiguous court order provisions can be interpreted to provide for more than one type of benefit. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Holzman</span> 62 M.S.P.R. at 259 ("pension benefits" could be construed as a portion of the employee annuity, a survivor annuity or a lump-sum payment); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 46 MSPR 651, 654-55 (1991) ("death benefits" could be construed as a survivor annuity or lump-sum payment). Here, the Board has been presented with several reasonable constructions of the court order provisions that specify the date that the former spouse survivor annuity right expired (or will expire). While the Separation Agreement clearly describes the type of benefit (a Civil Service Retirement survivor annuity), the duration of the survivor annuity right is ambiguous.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Temporary awards are permitted under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.931.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the agreement reasonably construed provides for a temporary former spouse survivor annuity. In fact, his statements indicate that the parties contemplated as many as three different expiration dates for the temporary survivor annuity award: (1) when the divorce was finalized (November 10, 1987); (2) when the youngest child completes college or attains age 22, whichever occurs first (younger child attained 22 years of age in 1992); and (3) eight years after the separation agreement was signed (September 28, 1988). However, all three constructions of the agreement have in common the provision of a temporary survivor annuity right that expired <span class="Italic">before</span> the appellant retired in 1994. In contrast, OPM construed the agreement to provide a permanent survivor annuity right based only on one provision of the agreement, i.e. paragraph 7.4, and the administrative judge adopted OPM's conclusion relying on the same provision. The duration provisions, however, cannot be read out of the agreement; at a minimum, they render the language of the agreement ambiguous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Congress intended to provide state courts with the ability to award survivor annuities...we should not contravene that goal by allowing OPM, or the Board, to interpret ambiguous court orders. Since the court order in this case could be reasonably construed to provide either a temporary or a permanent survivor annuity right, it does not satisfy the statutory requirement that it expressly provide for an annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(j)(1) Accordingly, we reverse the initial decision affirming OPM's reconsideration decision awarding survivor annuity benefits to the appellant's former wife.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In some appeals the Board examines the operation of a divorce decree, comparing the descriptions of retirement benefits provided for the annuitant and former spouse and, without the decree stating as much, arrives at the conclusion that the intent of the decree was to provide a former spouse survivor annuity. Then the Board declares that the decree is clear and unambiguous. <span class="Italic">See Walker v. OPM</span>, 81 MSPR 377, 379-80 (1999) (dissent by Vice Chair Slavet: "There is absolutely no indication within the decree that the state court intended the appellant's rights to further benefits to include a former spouse survivor annuity."). <span class="Italic">Petrimoulx v. OPM</span>, 101 MSPR 1, 1-4 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 5-9 (2005), provides an example of a divorce decree that was construed to include a survivor annuity for a former spouse who, when a current spouse, was designated to receive a survivor annuity by her husband:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant and Donald Petrimoulx were married on August 2, 1990. On May 3, 1996, Mr. Petrimoulx applied for retirement under CSRS and elected a reduced annuity to provide a survivor annuity for the appellant. The appellant and Mr. Petrimoulx were divorced on September 26, 2003. Following the divorce, Mr. Petrimoulx did not file a new election for a former spouse survivor annuity, and OPM did not adjust his annuity to the unreduced amount.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4360"></span>The Spouse Equity Act provides that "a former spouse of a deceased employee is entitled to a survivor annuity...if and to the extent expressly provided for...in the terms of any decree of divorce...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1). The September 26, 2003 divorce decree between the appellant and Mr. Petrimoulx provides, in relevant part, that "any right or contingent right in and to unvested pensions, annuity, survivor annuity or retirement benefits shall hereafter be the sole property of the party in whose name or for whose benefit the said rights, contingent rights and contributions are held....We find that this language expressly provides for the appellant to receive a survivor annuity as the former spouse of Mr. Petrimoulx.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has promulgated regulations that define when a divorce decree or other court order expressly awards a former spouse survivor annuity. Title 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.804(b) provides that such a court order must:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Identify the retirement system using terms that are sufficient to identify the retirement system as explained in &#x00A7; 838.911; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;(i) Expressly state that the former spouse is entitled to a former spouse annuity using terms that are sufficient to identify the survivor annuity as explained in &#x00A7; 838.912; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;Expressly direct the retiree to elect to provide a former spouse survivor annuity using terms that are sufficient to identify the survivor annuity as explained in &#x00A7; 838.912.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the findings of OPM and the administrative judge, the divorce decree at issue here satisfies these conditions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ordinarily, to meet the requirements of &#x00A7; 838.804(b)(1), a court order must include language identifying the retirement system, using such terms as "CSRS," "OPM," or "Federal Government" survivor benefits. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.911(a). No such language appears in the divorce decree. However, OPM's regulations further provide, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A court order that requires an employee or retiree to maintain survivor benefits covering the former spouse satisfies the requirements of &#x00A7; 838.804(b)(1), if the former spouse was covered by a CSRS...survivor annuity...at the time of the divorce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.911(d). The record reflects that, prior to the divorce, Mr. Petrimoulx had elected a reduced annuity in order to provide the appellant with survivor benefits under CSRS. Thus, the divorce decree satisfies the requirement of &#x00A7; 838.804(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the second condition, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.912 provides, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;To satisfy the requirements of &#x00A7; 838.804(b)(2), a court order must specify that it is awarding a former spouse survivor annuity. The court order must contain language such as "survivor annuity," "death benefits," "former spouse survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8341(h)(1)," etc.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)(1)&#x2003;A court order that provides that the former spouse is to "continue as" or "be named as" the beneficiary of CSRS survivor benefits or similar language satisfies the requirements of &#x00A7; 838.804(b)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;A court order that requires an employee or retiree to maintain survivor benefits covering the former spouse satisfies the requirements of &#x00A7; 838.804(b)(2), if the former spouse was covered by a CSRS...survivor annuity...at the time of the divorce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The divorce decree uses the term "survivor annuity," thereby meeting the specificity requirement of &#x00A7; 838.912(a). Moreover, the decree provides that the appellant--for whose benefit and in whose name Mr. Petrimoulx had provided a CSRS survivor annuity--will retain sole possession of her "right or contingent right" to that benefit. The administrative judge reasoned that the appellant had no such right or contingent right, as her entitlement to a survivor annuity terminated with the divorce. We find, however, that the divorce decree provided for the appellant to retain her right to a survivor annuity. The clear meaning of the relevant provision is that the appellant was to continue as the beneficiary of Mr. Petrimoulx's survivor annuity under CSRS, or equivalently, that Mr. Petrimoulx would maintain a survivor annuity for the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore conclude that the divorce decree did expressly provide for the appellant to receive a survivor annuity as the former spouse of Mr. Petrimoulx. <span class="Italic">See Fox v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 100 F.3d 141, 143 (1996) ("magic words" are not necessary to entitle a former spouse to a survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Snyder v. OPM</span>, 136 F.3d 1474, 1475-79 (Fed. Cir. 1998), addressing the problem of conflicting court orders, affirmed the MSPB's application of OPM regulations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner, Warren D. Snyder, a former civil servant, appeals the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board, DE-0831-94-0401-I-2, dated February 28, 1997, affirming the Office of Personnel Management's ("OPM") final decision to provide his former spouse a <span class="Italic">pro-rata</span> share of his retirement annuity and a survivor annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System ("CSRS"). On appeal, Mr. Snyder argues that the Board applied the wrong law to this case and that OPM's decision is contrary to the United States Constitution. We hold that the Board applied the correct law and reached the proper conclusion consistent with existing law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Warren D. Snyder married Susan M. Rice-Snyder on June 15, 1989, in Florida. According to Mr. Snyder, they separated not long after, with Ms. Rice-Snyder living in Texas and Mr. Snyder in California. On or about January 28, 1994, Mr. Snyder separated from civil service. At the time of this separation, Mr. Snyder held the position of Air Commander with the Air Force Reserves at March Air Force Base in California. Although he remained married at the time of his separation from civil service, Mr. Snyder indicated on his CSRS retirement application that he desired a reduced annuity payable only during his lifetime (plus an up-front lump sum payment), thereby eschewing a survivor benefit for his then-wife, Ms. Rice-Snyder. The application itself, however, noted that "[i]f you are married at retirement, you cannot choose this type of annuity without your spouse's consent." Accordingly, Mr. Snyder submitted a "Spouse's Consent to Survivor Election" form, but without Ms. Rice-Snyder's signature. Apparently realizing this deficiency, Mr. Snyder wrote in the block for his wife's signature--"Not available-Unable to locate."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By letter dated April 26, 1994, OPM denied Mr. Snyder's request for a reduced annuity with a lump-sum payment under CSRS because he failed to provide a signed waiver from his spouse of record. To preserve Ms. Rice-Snyder's rights, and consistent with its practice, OPM instead reduced Mr. Snyder's retirement annuity to provide her with a maximum survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 19, 1994, Ms. Rice-Snyder received a Decree of Divorce from the District Court of Travis County in Texas, where she was then living, even though Mr. Snyder had apparently never lived there with her. Despite the fact that Mr. Snyder had not been served and had not entered an appearance in the case, the district court nonetheless exercised personal jurisdiction over him in accordance with the Uniformed Services Former Spouses Protection Act, 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1408 (1994). The Texas divorce decree specifically awarded Ms. Rice-Snyder a <span class="Italic">pro-rata</span> share of Mr. Snyder's CSRS retirement annuity and 100 percent of the maximum possible survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 23, 1994, Mr. Snyder submitted a second request to OPM for his self-only retirement annuity with lump-sum payment claiming that, because Ms. Rice-Snyder could not be located, her waiver was unobtainable. OPM responded by letter dated May 27, 1994, informing Mr. Snyder that Ms. Rice-Snyder's whereabouts were known and reasserted that her consent was required to grant his request. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.614 (requiring spousal consent in order to receive self-only annuity) <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.618 (permitting spousal consent to be waived if "whereabouts cannot be determined"). Accordingly, on June 24, 1994, OPM issued a reconsideration decision affirming its prior decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Three days later, Mr. Snyder was granted a Judgment of Dissolution by the Superior Court of California, County of San Bernardino, effective November 19, 1994. Ms. Rice-Snyder did not enter an appearance, and the decree was entered by default. The decree purported to confirm Mr. Snyder's separate property interest in his military and CSRS benefits, "including survivor benefits." With this decree in hand, Mr. Snyder appealed OPM's reconsideration decision to the Board. Before the Board could decide the case, however, OPM rescinded its decision in order to consider the effect of the California divorce decree, thereby divesting the Board of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Rice-Snyder informed OPM, by letter dated July 14, 1994, that she refused to give her consent to Mr. Snyder's request for the self-only annuity with lump-sum payment. She also entered a special appearance before the California Superior Court for the purpose of setting aside the California divorce decree based on the prior Texas decree. Her motion to that effect was granted by the California court on December 21, 1994, thereby setting aside both the default judgment and the dissolution. The California court also found, without providing any basis, that the Texas court lacked personal jurisdiction over Mr. Snyder and for that reason ruled that "any monies that are owed on the Texas judgment are not enforceable in California."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM then determined that it would enforce the Texas divorce decree and grant Ms. Rice-Snyder a survivor annuity along with a <span class="Italic">pro-rata</span> share of Mr. Snyder's monthly annuity. Mr. Snyder again requested OPM to reconsider its decision in light of the California court's finding that the Texas court lacked personal jurisdiction over him. OPM declined. Mr. Snyder sought review from the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board, before reaching the merits, concluded that there was a conflict between two potentially applicable regulations--5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 838.134 and 838.224--dealing with the validity of court orders pertaining to retirement annuities. The Board concluded that in this case &#x00A7; 838.224 controls because it is the more specific and the more recent of the two. Under that regulation, the Board affirmed OPM's decision on the ground that the Texas decree was "a court order acceptable for processing that...has not been amended, superseded, or set aside" by the California order. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.224(b). Mr. Snyder now appeals that decision. We have <span id="Page_4361"></span>jurisdiction over the final decision of the Board pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9) (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an employee is married at the time of his retirement, the employee's annuity will be reduced to provide a survivor annuity for the spouse, and the alternative form of annuity with lump-sum payment will be disallowed unless the spouse consents. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(1) (1994); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2203(c). It is undisputed that Mr. Snyder was married at the time of his retirement; he so indicated on his retirement application. There is an exception in cases in which the spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2203(c); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.618. However, it is also undisputed that Ms. Rice-Snyder's whereabouts were known. Therefore, this exception does not apply. Because she has refused to consent, OPM's decision to refuse to grant Mr. Snyder's request is in accordance with this law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8339 of Title 5, United States Code, is not the only "law" implicated in this case. Part 838 of Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations requires OPM to "comply with court orders, decrees, or court-approved property settlement agreements in connection with divorces...that award a portion of the former employee's...retirement benefits or a survivor annuity to a former spouse." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.101(a)(1). The regulations are quite specific, "OPM must honor the clear instructions of the court." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at &#x00A7; 838.101(a)(2). The court instructions, however, "must be specific and unambiguous." <span class="Italic">Id.; see also Turner v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. 55, 62 (1993). OPM is neither qualified nor obligated to resolve disputes about the import of state divorce decrees. <span class="Italic">See Turner,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. at 62 ("We find it would be administratively burdensome to require OPM to go behind the express language of each state court order."). If there is a "[d]isagreement between the parties concerning the validity or the provisions of any court order [that disagreement] must be resolved by the court." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.101(a)(2). OPM's task is "purely ministerial" with respect to court ordered property settlements. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, if a court order specifically and unambiguously divested Ms. Rice-Snyder of any rights in Mr. Snyder's annuity, OPM would be required to comply. Mr. Snyder claims that the California order does just that.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not rely on these general principles to resolve this dispute. OPM has promulgated regulations that specifically deal with cases involving challenges to court orders. The threshold question is which one applies. The Board concluded that &#x00A7; 838.224 applies, while Mr. Snyder argues that &#x00A7; 838.134 governs this case. The competing provisions are set forth below:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x00A7; 838.224 Contesting the validity of court orders.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;[A]...retiree who alleges that a court order is invalid must prove the invalidity of the court order by submitting a court order that--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;Declares the court order submitted by the former spouse is invalid; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;Sets aside the court order submitted by the former spouse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;OPM must honor a court order acceptable for processing that appears to be valid and that the former spouse has certified is currently in force and has not been amended, superseded, or set aside, until OPM receives a court order described in paragraph (a) of this section or a court order amending or superseding the court order submitted by the former spouse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x00A7; 838.134 Receipt of multiple court orders.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, for court orders affecting employee annuities or awarding former spouse survivor annuities, in the event that OPM receives two or more court orders acceptable for processing--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">* * * * * *</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;When two or more court orders relate to the same former spouse, separated spouse, or child abuse creditor the one issued last will be honored.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">* * * * * *</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c)&#x2003;With respect to issues relating to the validity of a court order or to the amount of payment--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;If the employee, separated employee, retiree, or other person adversely affected by the court order and former spouse submit conflicting court orders from the same jurisdiction, OPM will consider only the latest court order; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;If the employee, separated employee, retiree, or other person adversely affected by the court order and former spouse submit conflicting court orders from different jurisdictions--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(i)&#x2003;If one of the court orders is from the jurisdiction shown as the employee's, separated employee's, or retiree's address in OPM's records, OPM will consider only the court order issued by that jurisdiction; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(ii)&#x2003;If none of the court orders is from the jurisdiction shown as the employee's, separated employee's, or retiree's address in OPM's records, OPM will consider only the latest court order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On its face &#x00A7; 838.134, subsection (c)(2) would appear to control: it provides that when conflicting court orders from different jurisdictions are submitted, the one from the home jurisdiction of the employee/retiree will be the only order OPM considers. This would give determinative authority to the California decree. The difficulty with that decree, however, is apparent--it does not purport to be a court order addressing the question of entitlement to annuity payments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM regulations make this point clear. The touchstone for application of &#x00A7; 838.134 is that OPM must receive "two or more <span class="Italic">court orders acceptable for processing." Id.</span> (emphasis added). In order for a court order to be "acceptable for processing," it must "meet[&#8197;] the requirements of subpart C of this part." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.103. Subpart C, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 838.301-838.306, in turn, requires that a court order is not a court order acceptable for processing unless it, <span class="Italic">inter alia,</span> "expressly divides the employee annuity," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at &#x00A7; 838.303, and "direct[s] OPM to pay the former spouse directly," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at &#x00A7; 838.304. The California order did neither. As such it does not qualify as a "court order[&#8197;] acceptable for processing." Accordingly, section 838.134 is not applicable to this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude, as did the Board, that &#x00A7; 838.224 governs this case, rather than &#x00A7; 838.134. Mr. Snyder is unquestionably a "retiree who alleges that a court order is invalid," namely the Texas order, on the ground that the Texas court lacked personal jurisdiction over him. Section 838.224 is thus triggered. In order to prove invalidity then, Mr. Snyder must "submit[&#8197;] a court order that--(1) Declares the court order submitted by the former spouse is invalid; or (2) Sets aside the court order submitted by the former spouse." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.224(a). The California order does neither. In fact, it does just the opposite--it sets aside the prior <span class="Italic">California</span> dissolution. The order specifically refused to modify the Texas judgment because the court found it lacked jurisdiction. The only effect it had on the Texas decree was that it prohibited Ms. Rice-Snyder from enforcing the judgment in California because of the court's due process concerns. The California order did not "amend[&#8197;] or supersed[e]" the Texas order. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at &#x00A7; 838.224(b); <span class="Italic">cf. Newman v. Love</span>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11936505351727704528&q=136+F.3d+1474&hl=en&as_sdt=2,47">962 F.2d 1008</a>, 1011 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (court order dividing marital property did not "modif[y]" a previously entered divorce decree, which simply dissolved the marriage). Accordingly, OPM was required to honor the Texas order, which it did.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Snyder also argues that this court must consider the question of whether the Texas decree violates the United States Constitution. He does not argue that the regulations themselves are inconsistent with the Constitution or even with the governing statute. Instead, Mr. Snyder asks us to decide whether "the Texas Judgment, as applied to property, [is] Constitutional under the Fourth [sic] Amendment, United States Constitution...." Neither the Board nor this court is required or even equipped to answer that question. That claim must be brought in the first instance in a trial court. This court is ill-equipped to develop in the first instance the necessary facts to determine whether Mr. Snyder had sufficient contact with Texas to satisfy due process. While the Board is equipped to make this type of fact-finding, the regulations put that burden squarely in the state courts. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.124 ("Employees and retirees are responsible for--(a) Raising any objections to the validity of a court order <span class="Italic">in the appropriate State court;</span> and (b) Submitting all disputes with former spouses <span class="Italic">to the appropriate State court</span> for resolution." (emphasis added)). Accordingly, we decline Mr. Snyder's invitation to decide that issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board properly concluded that &#x00A7; 838.224 governed Mr. Snyder's challenge to the validity of the Texas decree. Because the California order did not satisfy the requirements of that section, however, the OPM was correct in its decision to abide by the prior Texas decree, which explicitly gave Ms. Rice-Snyder a <span class="Italic">pro-rata</span> share of his annuity and a survivorship benefit....</p>
