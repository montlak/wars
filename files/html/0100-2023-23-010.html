<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-12"><span class="space">c.</span> Oral Advice of Settlement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The parties may arrive at a settlement that they intend to reduce to writing, but the hearing is soon upon them, or in progress, and the parties, pleased with the fruits of their labors, inform the AJ that the case "settled." The AJ, anxious to conclude the case and avoid a hearing, latches onto the word "settled" and dismisses the appeal as settled before a settlement agreement makes its way into the record. Matters break down when the parties, in fact, did not reach a true written (or any) agreement, or when an unfiled agreement leads to an enforcement petition.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Caution dictates that the parties always advise a AJ that no matter what the progress of their negotiations, the appeal is not settled until the AJ receives into the record a written, signed settlement agreement. The AJ has a choice: the AJ may insist that the parties continue the litigation until the written settlement is tendered, urging the parties to move matters along. Or the AJ may postpone the hearing (or suspend the appeal or dismiss the appeal without prejudice to its refiling) pending conclusion of the settlement process.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board takes some measures to prevent its AJs from dismissing appeals simply on the basis of the representations of the parties that an appeal has settled. Perhaps recognizing that the rush to settlement by AJs anxious to meet case processing deadlines creates problems as it solves them, the Board attempted to inject a bit more rationality into the settlement process, starting with its decision in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 37 MSPR 132, 135-36 (1988). On the day before the hearing, the representatives notified the AJ by telephone that the appeal was settled. Later the same day, the appellant's representative phoned to say that the appellant had second thoughts about settling, that the appellant declined to sign a written agreement of settlement prepared by the agency, and that the appellant wanted the hearing postponed so that witnesses for the hearing previously scheduled, who were released, could again be corralled. Instead of rescheduling the hearing or adjudicating the appeal on the record, the AJ dismissed the appeal, relying on <span class="Italic">Young v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 32 MSPR 315, 319 (1987). The Board reversed, remanded, declared in <span class="Italic">Smith</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the circumstances in <span class="Italic">Young</span> are distinguishable from those in this case. In <span class="Italic">Young</span>, the appellant had been read the specific terms of the settlement agreement but refused to sign the agreement when it was reduced to writing. In the instant case, the appellant had not been informed of the specific terms of the settlement agreement before the parties advised the administrative judge that a settlement had been reached, nor had he withdrawn his appeal. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Clark v. Department of Treasury</span>, 9 MSPR 48, 49-50 (1981) (despite the appellant's arguments that the settlement was tentative and had not been reached, the withdrawal of the appeal removed it from the Board's jurisdiction). Also significant in this case is the fact that the general agreement, the appellant's refusal to accept the agency's specific terms, and the parties' attempt to obtain adjudication on the merits of the appeal were communicated to the administrative judge on the same day. Thus, neither the parties nor the administrative judge had sufficient time to rely, to any substantial degree, on the putative settlement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that, absent a formal withdrawal of an appeal, until the parties have agreed to the specific terms of the settlement agreement, the act of finality (upon which our decision in <span class="Italic">Young</span> depended), a settlement had not occurred. Accordingly, we find that the administrative judge's refusal to grant the appellant's motion for a hearing and her subsequent dismissal of the appeal were error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mahoney v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 146, 149 (1988), involved another appeal hastily dismissed after the AJ received inconclusive information about settlement. The Board said that a AJ should affirmatively ensure that the parties agree that there is a settlement, that they understand its terms, and that they concur that the agreement is to be enforceable by the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he administrative judge dismissed the appeal before ascertaining the terms of the agreement and before both parties indicated whether the settlement agreement would be subject to Board enforcement. In fact, neither the record nor the initial decision discloses the manner in which the parties notified the administrative judge that they had resolved their differences.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that it was error for the administrative judge to dismiss this appeal without documenting for the record whether the parties had reached a settlement agreement, understood the agreement's terms, and agreed whether or not the settlement agreement was to be enforceable by the Board....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The settlement agreement itself does not express the intent of the parties on the issue of enforceability, and the record is devoid of any evidence indicating that the appellant intended that the settlement agreement would be excluded from the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Due to the lack of record evidence concerning the parties' intentions with regard to whether the settlement agreement was to be included in the record, we are unable to determine whether the Board has jurisdiction to enforce the agreement. It is therefore necessary to remand this appeal to the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The point was clarified in <span class="Italic">Rosado v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 46 MSPR 539, 540-41 (1991), that the AJ may not dismiss an appeal involving a settlement unless it is clear on the record how the settlement is to be treated by the Board. Dismissal is not to be a result of the parties' inaction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant for unacceptable performance. He appealed his removal to the Board's Dallas Regional Office. Prior to the scheduled hearing, the parties advised the administrative judge that the appeal had been resolved by settlement.... The administrative judge then advised the parties that they were required to enter the settlement into the record if they wished the Board to retain enforcement authority. Because the settlement had not yet been reduced to writing, <span id="Page_4752"></span>the administrative judge provided the parties with ten additional days to submit a copy of the agreement for inclusion in the record. The settlement was not submitted for inclusion in the record, however, and neither party filed any objection to the agreement. The administrative judge consequently dismissed the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant requests the Board to invalidate the settlement agreement, claiming that he was unaware of the nature of the agreement at the time that it was made, and alleging that the agreement was the result of bad faith, fraud, and mutual mistake.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record before us does not contain evidence showing whether the parties in fact reached a valid settlement agreement, whether they understood its terms, and whether they agreed that it would not be enforceable by the Board. The administrative judge consequently erred in dismissing the appeal under these circumstances<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Brooks v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 40 MSPR 404, 406 (1989); <span class="Italic">Mahoney v. United States Postal Service</span>, 37 MSPR 146, 149 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the Board REMANDS this appeal to the Dallas Regional Office for a determination of whether the parties entered into a valid settlement agreement and, if so, whether the parties intended that the agreement not be enforceable by the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another example of oral advice of a settlement whose agreed upon terms were never received and accepted by the AJ before the appeal was improvidently dismissed as settled is <span class="Italic">Gill v. VA</span>, 85 MSPR 541, 542-44 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-6 (2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appealed the agency's action removing him from his GS-11 position of Social Worker. The administrative judge (AJ) issued an Order stating that he had held a teleconference with the parties' representatives on July 28, 1999, and that he had confirmed that the case was settled in accordance with an agreement prepared by the agency's representative. The AJ noted that the appellant's attorney stated that the appellant was not available to sign the agreement but that he had agreed to its terms. The AJ advised the parties that he would accept the agreement into the record based upon the representatives' assurances, and that the appellant's attorney had agreed to immediately submit a copy of the agreement to him by facsimile. The AJ stated that it was agreed that another, fully executed copy of the agreement, including the appellant's signature, could be added to the record at a later date, but that the case was indeed settled and would be dismissed on that basis. Subsequently, the AJ issued an initial decision on July 28, 1999, stating that the parties had entered into a settlement agreement and that it had been entered into the record. The AJ found that the settlement agreement was lawful on its face, was understood by the parties, was freely and voluntarily entered into by the parties, and thus, was enforceable by the Board. Accordingly, the AJ dismissed the appeal as settled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has now filed a petition for review (PFR) in which he concedes that he and the agency's attorney had reached a general agreement in the case, but he argues that the specific wording for the settlement agreement had never been agreed upon. The appellant asserts that he sent a corrected copy of the agreement to the agency, but was informed that the record was closed. The appellant has included a copy of the amended agreement. In addition, the agency has submitted the same copy of the amended agreement along with a letter dated July 30, 1999, from the appellant's attorney. The July 30 letter stated that the appellant's attorney had enclosed the executed agreement and noted that she had made a minor revision in the language at Paragraph 3 of the agreement. The agency also submitted a letter dated August 2, 1999, in which it advised the appellant's attorney that the modified agreement was being returned to her because it was not a part of the record at the time the AJ issued an initial decision dismissing the appeal. The appellant requests that the appeal file be reopened to accept the amended agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that it has authority to enforce the terms of a settlement agreement when it has been entered into the record. <span class="Italic">Robertson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 37 MSPR 512, 514 (1988). In this case, however, even though the AJ found that the parties had reached an agreement and entered an agreement into the record, there is no evidence of a settlement agreement that was agreed upon by the parties. First, there is no evidence of an oral settlement agreement. The Board has held that oral settlement agreements are enforceable, as long as the terms are memorialized into the record<span class="Italic">. Gonzalez v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 75 MSPR 179, 183 (1997). For example, where the parties reach an agreement at a prehearing conference or hearing, the terms of the agreement should be recited by the parties and tape recorded for the record. <span class="Italic">Robertson</span>, 37 MSPR at 515. Where tape recording is not available, the AJ may prepare, or have prepared, a verbatim transcript of the terms of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The terms should then be read to the parties to confirm their accuracy. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Second, there is no written settlement agreement. There is a document in the record purported to be the parties' settlement agreement. However, only the agency's representative signed this document. Further, submitted with the agreement is a letter from the agency's attorney to the appellant's attorney, requesting that the agreement be signed by the appellant and his attorney, and returned to the agency by facsimile, so that it could then be sent to the AJ by facsimile. There is no evidence, however, that the appellant or his representative, prior to the dismissal of the appeal, signed this document.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the amended agreement submitted by the appellant's attorney included a material change with regard to the appellant's agreement to waive all future claims. Specifically, as set forth in the following paragraph, the amended agreement included an exception to the agreement to waive all claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The appellant agrees to waive any and all claims, including attorney's fees and cost, appeals, grievances, complaints, inquiries or other actions against the United States, it officers and employees, with the exception of claims arising from fraud or improper practices, which are related to the facts of this MSPB appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whereas, the agreement signed by the agency stated that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The appellant agrees to withdraw the pending MSPB appeal and further agrees to waive any and all claims, including attorney's fees and costs, appeals, grievances, complaints, inquiries or other actions whatsoever against the United States, it officers and employees, which are related to the facts of this MSPB appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, because the appellant did not sign the agency's written copy of the settlement agreement, and there is otherwise no evidence in the record that the appellant agreed to the specific language of the agreement, but instead submitted an amended copy that had material changes, the evidence shows that there was no meeting of the minds.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, in the absence of record evidence as to the specific terms that the parties purportedly agreed to, and because it appears that there was no meeting of the minds, we conclude that the AJ erred in entering the "agreement" into the record and dismissing the appeal as settled. Accordingly, a remand is necessary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">ORDER</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the AJ shall reopen the record to admit evidence as to whether the parties entered into a settlement agreement at the time of the settlement conferences, and if so, the terms of that agreement. If the parties entered into an agreement and agree that the Board should retain jurisdiction to enforce it, the agreement shall then be entered into the record. If the parties have not entered into a settlement agreement, the AJ shall take evidence and adjudicate the merits of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Parks v. USPS</span>, 113 MSPR 60, 65-66 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13, 2010 MSPB 6 (2010), reviewing the process of settlement of an enforcement petition, pointed out that when the AJ is presented with what is asserted to be an oral settlement, the AJ should ensure that the oral settlement is properly documented and that the parties' intentions are made clear if one party disputes the validity of the oral settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the administrative judge erred by dismissing the appeal based upon an oral settlement without first documenting whether the parties intended it to be entered into the record for enforcement purposes. Oral settlements are enforceable, and administrative judges should ensure that the terms of enforceable oral agreements are memorialized in the record. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of the Navy</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 461, 462-63 (1994). Further, the Board has repeatedly held that it is error for an administrative judge to dismiss an appeal based on a settlement agreement without documenting for the record whether the parties reached a settlement agreement, whether they understood the agreement's terms, and whether they agreed that the settlement agreement is to be enforceable by the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gerdts v. Department of Labor,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 412, &#x00B6; 14 (2009); <span class="Italic">Hester v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. 149, 151 (1996); <span class="Italic">Jimenez v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 70 M.S.P.R. 24, 26 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge determined that the parties reached a valid oral settlement and that the unsigned written agreement set forth the settlement's terms. The unsigned agreement clearly indicated that the parties intended for the agreement to be included in the Board's record for enforcement purposes. Despite this language, however, the administrative judge stated that, if the parties wanted to reduce their oral agreement into writing and have the agreement enforced by the Board, they may "seek to vacate this initial decision in order to do so" before the initial decision becomes final. Absent such action, the administrative judge stated that the oral settlement has not been entered into the record and cannot be enforced by the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By placing the onus on the parties to clarify their intentions regarding enforcement before the initial decision becomes final, the administrative judge improperly dismissed the appeal as settled without first documenting whether the parties agreed that the settlement would be enforceable by the Board, as required. <span class="Italic">See Gerdts,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 412, &#x00B6; 14. Because the parties do not dispute that the unsigned written agreement reflects the terms of the oral settlement (the appellant has only asserted that he lacked the mental capacity to enter into the agreement), and that settlement specifically provides that the parties intended that the <span id="Page_4753"></span>agreement be entered into the record for enforcement purposes, we now enter that agreement into the record and dismiss the appeal as settled. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-18.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jimenez v. DHHS</span>, 70 MSPR 24, 25-27 (1996), disapproved the practice of some AJs who, on hearing that a case is settled, allow the parties a given time to submit the written settlement and, when the agreement is not received, dismiss the case as settled. If the AJ does not receive the agreement, the AJ has an affirmative responsibility to determine the parties' intent:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a timely petition for appeal of the agency's decision to suspend him for 30 days for misusing a government vehicle. In an October 11, 1995 order, the administrative judge stated that the parties had informed her that they had reached a settlement, and that they would submit a written settlement agreement for inclusion in the record. The administrative judge stated that the parties must submit the agreement to her by October 20, 1995. She further stated that, if she had not received the agreement by then and the parties had not contacted her, she would dismiss the appeal as settled, and the agreement would not be enforceable by the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her October 30, 1995 initial decision, the administrative judge stated that she had not received a settlement agreement and the parties had not contacted her. Thus, she dismissed the appeal as settled without entering the agreement into the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e find that the administrative judge had an insufficient basis upon which to dismiss the appeal as settled. The Board has repeatedly held that it is error for an administrative judge to dismiss an appeal without documenting for the record that the parties reached a settlement agreement, understood its terms, and agreed whether or not it was to be enforceable by the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Boucher v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 68 MSPR 40, 44 (1995); <span class="Italic">Parks v. Department of Defense</span>, 56 MSPR 74, 76 (1992). Here, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal pursuant to a settlement agreement, and stated that the agreement was not enforceable because it was not submitted for inclusion in the record. Other than the statement in her order that the parties had reached a settlement of their dispute, however, there is no record evidence documenting that the parties actually reached an oral or written agreement, understood its terms, and clearly agreed whether it was to be enforceable by the Board. While prudence dictates that the parties should have contacted the administrative judge in response to her order, the fact remains that the administrative judge had an affirmative responsibility to determine the parties' intentions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Boucher</span>, 68 MSPR at 43-44; <span class="Italic">Parks</span>, 56 MSPR at 76. Thus, the administrative judge had an insufficient basis upon which to dismiss the appeal as settled<span class="Italic">. Mahoney v. US Postal Service</span>, 37 MSPR 146, 149 (1988). Accordingly, remand is necessary. <span class="Italic">Panther v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 52 MSPR 419, 423 (1992).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the parties do not want their settlement agreements made part of the record, the Board cautioned in <span class="Italic">Danzie v. USPS</span>, 40 MSPR 8, 10 (1989), the record should at least reflect that the parties actually reached an oral or written agreement, understood its terms, and clearly desired not to have the agreement entered into the record. If the parties tell the AJ they have settled and do not wish the agreement placed into the record, whether they ultimately reduce their oral agreement to a signed written agreement is irrelevant to the existence of an effective agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marrero-Maldonado v. VA</span>, 43 MSPR 566, 569 (1990); <span class="Italic">cf. Bullock v. United States</span>, 10 F.4th 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (considering jurisdiction of Claims Court over suits based on oral settlements in EEOC proceedings). [<span class="Italic">Bullock</span> is discussed in Chapter 17, "EEO Settlement."].</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellate record should be properly documented if the AJ dismisses an appeal based on advice of an oral settlement, <span class="Italic">Lee v. OPM</span>, 83 MSPR 236, 238-39 &#x00B6; 4 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]his <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant's petition for review is based on his claim that he did not agree to settle his appeal. He states that the administrative judge told him that he would lose if he proceeded with the appeal, and that he would be wise to accept the agency's offer of compromise, but that he "never agreed[ ] to anything either verbal or written" in connection with the proposal. Review of the record shows only that the administrative judge prepared a two-sentence Memo for the Record of an April 15, 1999 telephone call which stated that the parties settled the appeal "based upon modification &#x0026; reduction of debarment period by 1 year." The memorandum was signed by the administrative judge but not by either party, and there is no tape recording of the conference and no indication that the memorandum was sent to the parties to ensure that the appeal was, in fact, settled or that this provision accurately reflected their understanding. Nor is there any other more specific or formal statement of the terms or the parties' alleged agreement to accept them. The appeal was dismissed four days later, still with no additional evidence of the parties' intent. In the absence of any such documentation, we are left with the appellant's unequivocal and unchallenged statement that he did not settle his appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The initial decision of the AJ dismissing an appeal as settled should state whether there was, in fact, a settlement agreement, whether the parties understood its terms, and whether they agreed that it was enforceable by the Board. <span class="Italic">Brooks v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 40 MSPR 404, 406 (1989); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Kowalczyk v. Dept. of Army</span>, 44 MSPR 616, 623-34 (1990) (following <span class="Italic">Mahoney, supra</span>); <span class="Italic">Wilson v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 678, 680 (1989) (explaining <span class="Italic">Mahoney</span>). To avoid confusion, parties should not rely on the AJ's interpretation of case law governing the settlement process. The parties should affirmatively represent to the AJ that the case is not settled, despite the progress of negotiations, until the AJ receives and accepts a written and signed agreement that becomes effective upon the AJ's acceptance of the agreement into the record for purposes of enforcement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Confusing circumstances surrounding settlement can result in remand. <span class="Italic">Panther v. USDA</span>, 52 MSPR 419, 423 (1992), reopened an appeal after the appellant complained that his appeal was dismissed as settled when there was no settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal pursuant to a settlement agreement, and stated that the agreement was not filed for the record. Other than the administrative judge's incorrect statement in his order that the parties had reached a settlement of the appeal,[4] there is no record evidence documenting that the parties actually reached an oral or written agreement, understood its terms, and clearly agreed whether the agreement was to be enforceable by the Board. To the contrary, the appellant, his former representative, and the agency's representative all deny that they ever reached a final settlement of the appeal....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;It appears that the agency's representative...told the administrative judge...that the parties had reached a "tentative" settlement.... Neither of the "draft" agreements that the agency subsequently prepared was ultimately satisfactory to the appellant, however.... While prudence dictates that the parties should have contacted the administrative judge immediately upon their receipt of his July 27, 1990 order, to inform him of the true state of affairs, the fact remains that the administrative judge had an insufficient basis upon which to dismiss this appeal as settled. <span class="Italic">See Mahoney</span>, 37 MSPR at 149.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But a presumption was applied when the parties did not attempt to rebut the AJ's belief, known to the parties, that a settlement was reached, <span class="Italic">Reay v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 49 MSPR 342, 343-45 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the issue before the Board is whether the appeal was properly dismissed by the administrative judge. To decide this, we must first determine whether there was an agreement between the parties to settle the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 17, 1989, the administrative judge issued an order which stated that the parties reached a settlement during a prehearing discussion and that the hearing was cancelled.... In this order, the administrative judge also informed the parties that if she did not receive a copy of the settlement by May 26, 1989, the appeal would be dismissed and the Board would not retain authority to enforce the agreement. The record reflects that neither party disputed the administrative judge's statement that there was an agreement. On May 30, 1989, the administrative judge issued an initial decision dismissing the appeal, noting that the parties had reached a settlement agreement and that even though they had the opportunity to file a copy of the agreement with the Board, they had not done so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the record does not reflect that the administrative judge had any knowledge of the terms of the agreement or whether both parties understood and agreed with the terms, as required by <span class="Italic">Mahoney v. United States Postal Service</span>, 37 MSPR 146 (1988), it is presumed under <span class="Italic">Robertson v. United States Postal Service</span>, 37 MSPR 512 (1988) [discussed in next section], that the administrative judge acted properly. The Board held in <span class="Italic">Robertson</span> that "where the record does not reveal whether the administrative judge read the terms of the agreement to the parties and obtained their consent, the Board will apply a rebuttable presumption that the administrative judge acted properly and did so."... The appellant has failed to rebut this presumption. The administrative judge warned the parties that the appeal would be dismissed as settled and the Board would not retain authority to enforce the agreement if a copy was not submitted by a specified date.... Rather than disputing that there was an agreement or submitting a copy of it for enforcement, the parties did not respond. Under <span class="Italic">Sitas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 41 MSPR 214 (1989), if both parties did not agree that the settlement was to be entered into the record for enforcement purposes, the settlement agreement remains but it is not enforceable by the Board. Thus, the administrative judge properly dismissed the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Earlier decisions sustained dismissals of appeals as settled based on incomplete representations concerning settlements. In <span class="Italic">Young v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 32 MSPR 315 (1987), an appeal was dismissed after the AJ was notified of a settlement. The appellant then refused to sign the settlement agreement, her attorney withdrew from the case, and the appellant attempted to reopen her appeal. The Board declined to allow the appeal to be reopened. <span class="Italic">Young</span> rejected an <span id="Page_4754"></span>argument that settlement had not been accomplished as a result of a mutual mistake of fact. <span class="Italic">Young</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Fairchilde v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 36 MSPR 586, 584 (1988). These decisions are distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Thurmond v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 227, 229-30 (1989), involving notice to the AJ of verbal discussions constituting a tentative agreement that was to be reduced to writing and signed, events that did not occur.</p>
