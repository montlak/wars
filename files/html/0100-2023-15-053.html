<h3 class="h3" id="sec8-54"><span class="space">B.</span> REFUSAL TO ACCEPT REASSIGNMENT</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Closely related to leave abusers are employees discharged for refusal to accept a geographic or other reassignment. Under 5 USC 7106(a)(2), management has the right, in accordance with applicable laws, to assign and direct employees in the agency and to assign work. Employees who refuse reassignments are not at their designated work stations. The government has broad discretion to reassign employees to different locations and to discharge them for refusal to accept a new assignment. <span class="Italic">Gava v. United States</span>, 699 F.2d 1367, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Leefer v. NASA</span>, 543 F.2d 209, 212-13 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (interpreting regulations of the Civil Service Commission); <span class="Italic">Urbina v. United States</span>, 530 F.2d 1387, 1390 (Ct. Cl. 1976) ("Agencies have wide discretion in effecting reassignments of their personnel"; "[I]t is obvious that if all employees of the Government could decide when and how long they could have sick leave without any advance approval by proper officials of the hundreds of agencies and departments by whom they are employed, we would have chaos in our Government."); <span class="Italic">Burton v. United States</span>, 404 F.2d 365, 369 (Ct. Cl. 1968) ("agencies have power to effect geographical reassignment of employees, except as self-limited"; noting regulations of CSC and FPM, but noting that "some Federal agencies do not so reassign employees except with their consent, as a matter of internal policy"); <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. GSA</span>, 3 MSPR 117, 120, 3 MSPB 230 (1980) ("[I]t is well established that an agency has both the right and responsibility to reassign personnel for the good of the service."). Failure to abide by a directed detail to another position may furnish reason for adverse action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fisher v. DHHS,</span> DE-0752-12-0268-I-2 (NP 6/25/2015) (citing 5 USC 3341(a), permitting renewable120-day details: "The head of an Executive department or military department may detail employees among the bureaus and offices of his department, except employees who are required by law to be exclusively engaged on some specific work.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The basis for the charge against an employee who refuses to accept a reassignment can be absence without leave; the absence is admitted--in contention is the validity of the reassignment. The agency may remove the employee for refusal to accept the reassignment without awaiting an AWOL charge if it is clear that the employee will not comply with the reassignment directive. An agency may interpret an employee's silence in response to an agency inquiry concerning his intention to accept reassignment as a refusal to accept the reassignment. <span class="Italic">Hayden v. Dept. of Interior</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-707); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Murray v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 22 MSPR 429, 431 (1984) (since the appellant was not at his new duty station and not working, the agency could consider him AWOL). <span class="Italic">Burrell v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 204, 209-10 (1997), declared:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A directed reassignment is by its nature involuntary; it is nonetheless a proper personnel action if the agency's decision to reassign is a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> determination based on legitimate management interests....&#8197;In such circumstances, an agency may bring a removal action for AWOL if the employee fails to report to duty at the new location....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an AWOL charge is based on an employee's failure to accept a directed assignment, the agency must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that its decision to assign the employee to another position was <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> and based upon legitimate management reasons. Evidence showing that its reasons for ordering the assignment were legitimate, together with evidence showing <span id="Page_2497"></span>that the appellant was given adequate notice of the assignment decision and refused to accept the assignment, will be sufficient to establish the agency's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. The burden then shifts to the employee to present rebuttal evidence. "If the employee can demonstrate that the reassignment had no solid or substantial basis in personnel practice or principle, the Board <span class="Italic">may</span> conclude that it was not a valid discretionary management determination, but was instead...an arbitrary and capricious adverse action." <span class="Italic">Cooke v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 401, 405-08 (1995). In <span class="Italic">Cooke</span>, the issue arose whether the agency could remove an employee for AWOL after he refused to accept a reassignment that he contended was the product of a constructive reduction in force. Removal was sustained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case illustrates the apparent tension between appeals which involve an employee's refusal to accept a directed assignment, an employee's refusal to follow a direct order, and the impact of the reversal of an agency's action upon a subsequent action. As discussed above, if an employee challenges an adverse action based upon his failure to accept a directed assignment or his unauthorized absence from that assignment, the agency must show by a preponderance of the evidence that such an assignment was based upon legitimate management reasons:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the employee can demonstrate that the reassignment had no solid or substantial basis in personnel practice or principle, the Board <span class="Italic">may</span> conclude that it was not a valid discretionary management determination, but was instead either an improper effort to pressure the appellant to retire, or was at least an arbitrary and capricious adverse action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Umshler,</span> 44 MSPR at 630 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Use of the word "may" means that it is within the Board's discretion to find that the assignment was not valid, not that such a finding is mandated. Review of Board precedent leads us to conclude that, under the circumstances present here, despite the improper manner in which the agency effected the assignment at issue, the assignment itself meets the test of legitimacy under this standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To avoid the potential abuses that can occur if an agency should use directed reassignments to procure an employee's separation through retirement, resignation, or removal, the Board held in <span class="Italic">Ketterer v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 2 MSPB 459, 2 MSPR 294 (1980), that the agency must show that its decision to reassign an employee was a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> determination based on legitimate management considerations in the interests of the service. There, it warned that "agency discretion to reassign may no more properly be invoked as a veil to effect an employee's separation than may a reduction in force." <span class="Italic">Ketterer,</span> 2 MSPR at 299 n.8. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Else v. Department of Justice,</span> 3 MSPB 475, 3 MSPR 397, 399 (1980), the Board examined a reassignment, finding that although such an action could not be taken to obtain a removal and thereby deprive the appellant of appropriate appeal rights, the assignment at issue was proper because it was not so motivated. Again in <span class="Italic">O'Connor v. Department of the Interior</span>, 21 MSPR 687, 690 (1984), the Board upheld a removal based on failure to accept a reassignment because the assignment action was otherwise proper and was not motivated by a desire to harm the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Significantly, in <span class="Italic">Wear v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 22 MSPR 597 (1984), the Board explicitly recognized the complexity of situations where agencies could effect action either by RIF or by directed reassignments. In a holding that has important implications for the instant case, the Board stated that the reasons that would justify a RIF would also justify a directed reassignment. <span class="Italic">See also Rabourn v. Department of Justice,</span> 38 MSPR 103, 105 (1988), finding that an agency's obligation is to provide evidence that supports the "genuineness" of the reasons for its reassignment; <span class="Italic">Renville v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 26 MSPR 566, 568 (1985), rejecting a challenge to a directed assignment because the appellant did not "show pretext or an abuse of discretion in the management reasons which focused on the best way to utilize employee[s]...."[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See also Holtgrewe v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 57 MSPR 307 (1993) and 62 MSPR 14 (1994), first finding unpersuasive the agency's reasons for reassigning the appellant following the Board's mitigation of his removal to a demotion and later, for that reason, reversing his subsequent removal based on his failure to report to the reassigned worksite.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These cases show that the Board's review of a directed assignment action is to assure that this otherwise legitimate management tool is not used for illegitimate reasons, and that in so doing, it focuses on the actual reasons for the reassignment rather than the means by which it was effected. That is, the Board's review centers on the legitimacy of the reasons for the reassignment, not on whether the action was reversed on technical, procedural, or other grounds.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying these considerations here, we conclude that the agency had a legitimate management reason for effecting the appellant's assignment: its nationwide restructuring. There is no evidence that the agency took the action as a subterfuge to effect the appellant's separation; rather, it was based on the record evidence that the appellant's former worksite had a reduced need for instructors. That the Board ultimately determined that the agency used the wrong method to effect its otherwise proper reduction in the number of instructors does not affect our conclusion because it does not impinge on the legitimacy of the reasons for the assignment, just the method by which it was effected. Further, the necessity of effecting the restructuring actions by RIF rather than unreviewable assignment actions was strongly contested, and as the Board has previously found, no evidence has been presented to it to show that the agency was aware at the time that its restructuring could only have been effected as a RIF or that it acted in bad faith in proceeding as if it was not<span class="Italic">. See Jones v. US Postal Service</span>, 65 MSPR 306, 311-12 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we have found that the agency's action was motivated by legitimate reasons, because we had earlier found that it was not properly effected, we address the agency's next argument, that, even if the assignment was improper, the appellant's recourse was to obey by performing the duties of his new position and then appeal the propriety of the assignment. Citing <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 40 MSPR 106, 112, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 891 F.2d 299 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 494 U.S. 1090, 110 S. Ct. 1832, 108 L. Ed.2d 961 (1990), the agency submits that his failure to do so and the resulting unauthorized absence from his position provide sufficient support for the removal action. In <span class="Italic">Taylor,</span> the Board stated that "[i]f the appellant believed that her reassignment was improper, her recourse was to report for duty and grieve while working." <span class="Italic">Taylor</span>, 40 MSPR at 112, citing <span class="Italic">Gragg v. U.S. Air Force,</span> 13 MSPR 296, 299 (1982) (an employee does not have the unfettered right to disregard an order merely because there is substantial reason to believe that the order is not proper; he must first comply with the order and then register his complaint or grievance, except in certain limited circumstances where obedience would place the employee in a clearly dangerous situation), <span class="Italic">dismissed</span>, 717 F.2d 1343 (Fed. Cir. 1983). Again, we agree with the agency's position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board recently modified <span class="Italic">Gragg</span> "to the extent that [it] can be interpreted as indicating that an employee can be disciplined for a refusal to obey an order that the agency is not entitled to have obeyed." <span class="Italic">Fleckenstein v. Department of the Army</span>, 63 MSPR 470, 474 n.3 (1994). That holding, we find, does not allow the appellant to disobey the instant assignment order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Fleckenstein</span>, in the course of preparing a reply to the agency's proposal to suspend him, the appellant was ordered to turn over to his supervisor certain documents that constituted his attorney's work product. Based on that refusal, the agency proposed and effected a more severe disciplinary action. On appeal from the latter action, the Board held that the appellant was entitled not to obey. The attorney work product privilege protects such documents from disclosure by Rule 26(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. And, importantly, their disclosure while a proposed disciplinary action was pending against the appellant would have caused him irreparable harm, such as if they contained information related to his culpability in matters other than those already charged. Such harm would not readily be cured during the course of the appeal of any effected disciplinary action because it could have been very broad and deep, and beyond the scope of the pending disciplinary action. To the extent that our decision in <span class="Italic">Fleckenstein</span> did not reflect the significance of the avoidance of irreparable harm as an underpinning for our holding, we hereby clarify it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find here that, unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">Fleckenstein,</span> the appellant was not at liberty to disobey the assignment order because of his disagreement with it, despite the Board's ultimate agreement that it had not been effected properly. The appellant's conduct was not protected by either privilege or a legitimate concern that it would cause him irreparable harm. His only proper recourse, therefore, was to obey the order and, as he did, challenge its validity on appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, we find that the agency has proven that the appellant's assignment was based upon legitimate management reasons, and, therefore, his placement in AWOL status for his failure to report for duty in that position was proper.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The burdens of proof as to charged failure to accept a geographical reassignment were summarized, <span class="Italic">Krawchuk v. VA</span>, 94 MSPR 641, 645 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an adverse action is based upon an employee's failure to accept a directed reassignment, the agency bears the initial burden of proving by preponderant evidence that its decision to reassign the employee was <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>, and based upon legitimate management reasons. [<span class="Italic">Shenwick v. Department of State</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 289 (2002)]. at &#x00B6; 9. To meet that burden, the agency must show that (1) the reassignment was based upon a legitimate management reason, (2) the employee was given adequate notice of the reassignment, and (3) the employee refused to accept the reassignment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">O'Connor v. Department of the Interior,</span> 21 M.S.P.R. 687, 688 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Once the agency has established that it met these criteria, the burden shifts to the employee to demonstrate that the reassignment had no solid or substantial basis in personnel practice or principle<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 89 MSPR 484, 490-91 &#x00B6; 18 (2001) (sustaining removal for an appellant's unjustified refusal to accept a contested reassignment resulting from a settlement agreement).

<p class="Body-Text">Although there are less risky ways--EEO complaints, grievances--to test the legitimacy of a reassignment or detail, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Bowen v. DOJ</span>, 38 MSPR 332, 334 (1988) ("The Board does not have jurisdiction to review an agency's decision to detail an employee to another position where there is no reduction in pay....Further, the appellant cannot refuse to come to work if he feels that his detail to another position is improper. If the appellant wanted to challenge the propriety of his detail, he should have filed a grievance with the agency."), and <span class="Italic">Taylor v. DHHS</span>, 40 MSPR 106, 112 (1989) ("If the appellant believed that her reassignment was improper, her recourse was to report for duty and grieve while working"), some employees challenge their agencies by refusing their reassignments, being fired, and appealing to the Board in the hope that the agency's motives for the reassignment will be found unacceptable. Concerning those motives, the usual rules of deference to agency discretion apply. The employee may have a difficult time proving an abuse of discretion, unlawful discrimination, or a prohibited personnel practice. The courts are reluctant to set aside dismissal for failure to accept reassignment. Commenting on the penalty of removal for an employee who refuses to accept a geographic reassignment, a court noted: "[w]e fail to see what option the agency has, consistent with not awarding the palm of victory to the insubordinate employee." <span class="Italic">Bell v. EEOC</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 83-1332). Although it may be at least a temporary disruption, the employee safeguards his employment if the reassignment is accepted and then challenged through EEO, grievance, or prohibited personnel practice procedures. If substantial constitutional interests are at stake, a restraining order could be sought from a district court or a stay could be sought from the Office of Special Counsel. This is an expensive challenge, to be sure, but no more expensive than the defense of dismissal.

<p class="Body-Text">On a jurisdictional point, if an employee's appeal rights depend on whether tenure is measured in the position held by reassignment or before reassignment, the Board seems inclined to permit tenure to be determined by the position held prior to the reassignment if the employee shows that the agency lacked a legitimate basis for the reassignment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Burrell v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 204, 210 (1997) ("[I]f an agency had no legitimate management reasons for a directed reassignment, an adverse action could reasonably be said to have been directed at the employee in his or her former position.").
