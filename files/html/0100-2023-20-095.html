<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-92"><span class="space">8.</span> Limited Jurisdiction Over Merits Determination, Collateral Prohibited Personnel Practice, Constitutional, Discrimination, and Harmful Error Claims in Otherwise Appealable Action Initiated Through OSC as IRA</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">We expand on discussion in the earlier section, "<a href="0100-2023-20-087.html#sec13-89">IRA Appeal, Direct Appeal of Otherwise Appealable Action Distinguished; Issue Preclusion</a>."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 2012 the Board revised, and in 2013 again revised, its regulations and those revisions included a significant change in Board practice concerning otherwise appealable actions that are first presented to OSC. If, instead of taking an otherwise appealable action to the Board on a direct appeal (to include affirmative defenses, e.g., whistleblower reprisal), the appellant first seeks from OSC corrective action as to the otherwise appealable personnel action, appeal to the Board following closeout from OSC limits the subsequent Board appeal to a whistleblower case. The whistleblower case is then dependent solely on a showing of a protected disclosure, resultant reprisal, and the inability of the agency to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action in the absence of whistleblowing reprisal. Resort to OSC and later appeal to the Board truncates or eliminates other defenses typically lodged in a direct appeal, e.g., mitigation, nexus, discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The regulation now provides, 5 CFR 1209.2 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Jurisdiction</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Generally</span>. Under 5 U.S.C. 1221(a), an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment may appeal to the Board from agency personnel actions alleged to have been threatened, proposed, taken, or not taken because of the appellant's whistleblowing or other protected activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Appeals authorized</span>. The Board exercises jurisdiction over:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Individual right of action (IRA) appeals</span>. These are authorized by 5 U.S.C. 1221(a) with respect to personnel actions listed in 1209.4(a) of this part that are allegedly threatened, proposed, taken, or not taken because of the appellant's whistleblowing or other protected activity. If the action is not otherwise directly appealable to the Board, the appellant must seek corrective action from the Special Counsel before appealing to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example 1</span>: An agency gives Employee X a performance evaluation under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 that rates him as "minimally satisfactory." Employee X believes that the agency has rated him "minimally satisfactory" because he reported that his supervisor embezzled public funds in violation of Federal law and regulation. Because a performance evaluation is not an otherwise appealable action, Employee X must seek corrective action from the Special Counsel before appealing to the Board or before seeking a stay of the evaluation. If Employee X appeals the evaluation to the Board after the Special Counsel proceeding is terminated or exhausted, his appeal is an IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example 2</span>: As above, an agency gives Employee X a performance evaluation under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 that rates him as "minimally satisfactory." Employee X believes that the agency has rated him "minimally satisfactory" because he previously filed a Board appeal of the agency's action suspending him without pay for 15 days. Whether the Board would have jurisdiction to review Employee X's performance rating as an IRA appeal depends on whether his previous Board appeal involved a claim of retaliation for whistleblowing. If it did, the Board could review the performance evaluation in an IRA appeal because the employee has alleged a violation of 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(9)(A)(i). If the previous appeal did not involve a claim of retaliation for whistleblowing, there might be a prohibited personnel practice under subsection (b)(9)(A)(ii), but Employee X could not establish jurisdiction over an IRA appeal. Similarly, if Employee X believed that the current performance appraisal was retaliation for his previous protected equal employment opportunity (EEO) activity, there might be a prohibited personnel practice under subsection (b)(9)(A)(ii), but Employee X could not establish jurisdiction over an IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example 3</span>: As above, an agency gives Employee X a performance evaluation under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 that rates him as "minimally satisfactory." Employee X believes that the agency has rated him "minimally satisfactory" because he testified on behalf of a co-worker in an EEO proceeding. The Board would have jurisdiction over the performance evaluation in an IRA appeal because the appellant has alleged a violation of 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(9)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example 4</span>: Citing alleged misconduct, an agency proposes Employee Y's removal. While that removal action is pending, Employee Y files a complaint with OSC alleging that the proposed removal was initiated in retaliation for her having disclosed that an agency official embezzled public funds in violation of Federal law and regulation. OSC subsequently issues a letter notifying Employee Y that it has terminated its investigation of the alleged retaliation with respect to the proposed removal. Employee Y may file an IRA appeal with respect to the proposed removal.</p>

These are appeals to the Board under laws, rules, or regulations other than 5 U.S.C. 1221(a) that include an allegation that the action was based on the appellant's whistleblowing or other protected activity. Otherwise appealable actions are listed in 5 CFR 1201.3(a). An individual who has been subjected to an otherwise appealable action must make an election of remedies as described in 5 U.S.C. 7121(g) and paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example 5</span>: Same as Example 4 above. While the OSC complaint with respect to the proposed removal is pending, the agency effects the removal action. OSC subsequently issues a letter notifying Employee Y that it has terminated its investigation of the alleged retaliation with respect to the proposed removal. With respect to the effected removal, Employee Y can elect to appeal that action directly to the Board or to proceed with a complaint to OSC. If she chooses the latter option, she may file an IRA appeal when OSC has terminated its investigation, but the only issue that will be adjudicated in that appeal is whether she proves that her protected <span id="Page_3819"></span>disclosure was a contributing factor in the removal action and, if so, whether the agency can prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have removed Employee Y in the absence of the protected disclosure. If she instead files a direct appeal, the agency must prove its misconduct charges, nexus, and the reasonableness of the penalty, and Employee Y can raise any affirmative defenses she might have.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Issues before the Board in IRA appeals</span>. In an individual right of action appeal, the only merits issues before the Board are those listed in 5 U.S.C. 1221(e), i.e., whether the appellant has demonstrated that whistleblowing or other protected activity was a contributing factor in one or more covered personnel actions and, if so, whether the agency has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action(s) in the absence of the whistleblowing or other protected activity. The appellant may not raise affirmative defenses, such as claims of discrimination or harmful procedural error. In an IRA appeal that concerns an adverse action under 5 U.S.C. 7512, the agency need not prove its charges, nexus, or the reasonableness of the penalty, as a requirement under 5 U.S.C. 7513(a), i.e., that its action is taken "only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." However, the Board may consider the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its adverse action in determining whether the agency has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the whistleblowing or other protected activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Elections under 5 U.S.C. 7121(g)</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Under 5 U.S.C. 7121(g)(3), an employee who believes he or she was subjected to a covered personnel action in retaliation for whistleblowing or other protected activity "may elect not more than one" of 3 remedies: An appeal to the Board under 5 U.S.C. 7701; a negotiated grievance under 5 U.S.C. 7121(d); or corrective action under subchapters II and III of 5 U.S.C. chapter 12, i.e., a complaint filed with the Special Counsel (5 U.S.C. 1214), which can be followed by an IRA appeal filed with the Board (5 U.S.C. 1221). Under 5 U.S.C. 7121(g)(4), an election is deemed to have been made based on which of the 3 actions the individual files first.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;In the case of an otherwise appealable action as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an employee who files a complaint with OSC prior to filing an appeal with the Board has elected corrective action under subchapters II and III of 5 U.S.C. chapter 12, i.e., a complaint filed with OSC, which can be followed by an IRA appeal with the Board. As described in paragraph (c) of this section, the IRA appeal in such a case is limited to resolving the claim(s) of reprisal for whistleblowing or other protected activity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The effect of 2012 and 2013 regulatory revisions is to overrule preexisting decisions permitting an individual to take an otherwise appealable action to OSC and then to the Board and to preserve all issues and defenses in the Board appeal that could have been raised had the case been directly appealed to the Board. Significantly, the 2012 revisions overruled <span class="Italic">Massimino v. VA</span>, 58 MSPR 318, 322-24 (1993), a decision that determined, before the preclusive regulatory revisions, that for an appeal that is within the Board's original jurisdiction but that was first presented to OSC as an IRA complaint, the Board may, on subsequent assumption of appellate jurisdiction, adjudicate all claims and defenses that could be asserted under both the WPA and the CSRA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations at 5 CFR part 1209 set forth the practices and procedures for appeals and stay requests of personnel actions based on whistleblowing. These regulations delineate two kinds of whistleblower cases over which the Board has jurisdiction: IRA appeals where the Board's jurisdiction is conditioned on the appellant's first seeking corrective action from the OSC; and "otherwise appealable action" (OAA) appeals where the Board's jurisdiction is granted by law, rule, or regulation of the Office of Personnel Management, other than 5 USC 1221(a) and 2302(a)(2)(A), that include an allegation of reprisal for whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1209.2(b). With regard to OAA appeals, the regulations provide that an appellant may "choose either to seek corrective action from the [OSC] before appealing to the Board or to appeal directly to the Board." 5 CFR 1209.2(b)(2). The regulations further provide that, if the appellant first seeks corrective action from the OSC, the time limit for appealing is the same as for an IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1209.5(a) and (b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the scope of the Board's review in most appeals includes both the merits of the action appealed and any affirmative defenses asserted, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC 7701(c), it extends only to the whistleblower issue in IRA appeals. In this appeal, because the demotion and reassignment action at issue constitutes an OAA, the administrative judge determined that the appellant may receive an adjudication of all of his claims raised in his appeal. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Marren v. Department of Justice</span>, 51 MSPR 632, 636 n.3 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 980 F.2d 745 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table), we did not decide the Board's scope of review applicable to a matter that may properly be brought as an IRA appeal that is also directly appealable to the Board because that case was not an OAA appeal. We must decide the issue in this OAA appeal, however.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (WPA) at 5 USC 1222 states that "[e]xcept as provided in section 1221(i), nothing in...chapter[12] or chapter 23 shall be construed to limit any right or remedy available under a provision of statute that is outside of [either chapter]." Thus, section 1222 strongly suggests that any rights under 5 USC chapter 75, such as the right to raise affirmative defenses in matters appealable under those chapters, are not restricted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This interpretation of section 1222 is supported by the legislative history of the WPA. In their joint explanatory statement regarding the WPA, House and Senate Members made the following explicit statement regarding the "availability of other remedies":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The [WPA] contains a new section 1222 of title 5, United States Code, which provides that the network of rights and remedies created under chapter 12 and chapter 23 of title 5 is not meant to limit any right or remedy which might be available under any other statute.... Section 1222 is not intended to create a cause of action where none now exists or to reverse any court decision. Rather, section 1222 says it is not the intent of Congress that the procedures under these chapters of title 5, United States Code, are meant to be exclusive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">135 Cong. Rec. H750 (daily ed. Mar. 21, 1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, in enacting the WPA, Congress was attempting to expand and enhance the protections and appeal rights afforded to whistleblowers. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gergick v. General Services Administration</span>, 43 MSPR 651, 659-60 (1990). To limit an employee's appeal rights and remedies <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> an OAA, which is directly appealable to the Board by definition, when the employee first chooses to seek corrective action from the OSC, would be contrary to the letter and the purpose of the WPA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 1222; <span class="Italic">Gergick</span>, 43 MSPR at 659-60.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">IRA appeals are not subject to the provisions of 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701 or 7702; thus, the Board lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of a personnel action at issue in an IRA appeal that is not directly appealable to the Board and lacks the authority to decide, in conjunction with an IRA appeal, the merits of an appellant's allegation of prohibited discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Marren v. Department of Justice,</span> 51 MSPR 632, 635-40 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 980 F.2d 745 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table).</p>

In an appeal of an otherwise appealable action, however, the Board generally reviews the merits and procedural aspects of the actions appealed, as well as any whistleblower-reprisal or other affirmative defenses asserted[,]" even if the appellant sought corrective action from OSC before filing the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Coons v.

Department of Defense,</span> 62 M.S.P.R. 666, 674 (1994) (the Board found that it lacked jurisdiction to decide a harmful error claim in the context of an IRA appeal). The administrative judge therefore properly determined that the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider these claims.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Oram v. MSPB</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP), reiterated the theme:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Importantly, in an IRA appeal to the Board, the Board's review is limited to the merits of allegations of violations of the Whistleblower Protection Act. Discrimination claims may not be raised in that context." <span class="Italic">Young v. MSPB</span>, 961 F.3d 1323, 1327-38 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.2(c)). While <span class="Italic">Young</span> refers to discrimination as an affirmative defense, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.2(c) clearly states that in an IRA appeal, "the only merits issues before the Board are...whether the appellant has demonstrated that whistleblowing or other protected activity was a contributing factor" in the agency's action and, if so, whether the agency would have taken the same action regardless. We discern no error in forwarding Mr. Oram's USERRA claim to the Board's Washington Regional Office or in requiring that he exhaust all administrative remedies at the Office of Special Counsel for his IRA claims, so we affirm.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But <span class="Italic">Agoranos v. DOJ</span>, 602 Fed. Appx. 795, 801 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP), while affirming the Board in an IRA appeal, stated of a due process challenge to a deciding official's consideration of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When assessing a WPA challenge to a removal decision, the Board must also consider any due process or procedural challenges an employee asserts as affirmative defenses....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It will remain to be seen whether Board follows <span class="Italic">Agoranos</span> or dismisses the statement as <span class="Italic">dictum</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The merits of the agency action challenged in an IRA case are only indirectly examined, <span class="Italic">Greve v. DHHS</span>, DE-1221-15-0540-W-1 (NP 5/4/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...However, this is an IRA appeal, not a removal appeal. Therefore, the agency is not required to prove its charges by preponderant evidence; rather, the only merits issues before the Board are whether the appellant has demonstrated that whistleblowing or other protected activity was a contributing factor in one or more personnel actions and, if so, whether the agency has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action(s) in the absence of the whistleblowing or other protected activity. <span class="Italic">Agoranos v. Department of Justice</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 498, &#x00B6; 18 n.7 (2013); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.2(c). It is true that the agency's charges, specifically, the strength of the evidence in support of them, are a consideration for the agency under its burden to show that it would have taken the action even in the absence of the appellant's whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">Carr v. Social Security Administration</span>, 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999)....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant has identified a large number of alleged irregularities in the grievance process. These include that the Chief was not a proper deciding official for the grievance; the grievance examiner was not properly qualified; the appellant was not timely informed of the grievance examiner's appointment; the agency failed to create a grievance file and an examiner's final report; the informal grievance did not notify the appellant of her right to file a formal grievance; and the Assistant Chief tried to dissuade the appellant from filing a formal grievance. These allegations are not properly before the Board because the appellant has not alleged that they were in reprisal for any disclosure. An IRA appeal is not the appropriate forum to collaterally attack the agency's internal process for resolving discipline; the Board's jurisdiction is limited to adjudicating claims of whistleblower reprisal. <span class="Italic">See McCarthy v. International Boundary &#x0026; Water Commission</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 594, &#x00B6; 27 (2011) (declining to consider the appellant's arguments of constitutional and statutory violations in connection with his termination in the context of an IRA appeal), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 497 Fed.
