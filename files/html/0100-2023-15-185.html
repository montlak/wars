<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-184"><span class="space">e.</span> Statement to Therapist; EAP Counselor; Accommodation Specialist</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Powell v. DOJ</span>, 73 MSPR 29, 35-36 (1997), considered whether statements that the appellant wanted to kill several agency employees, made in confidence to an Employee Assistance Program counselor, supported discipline if those statements conveyed threats to others in the agency. The statements did not constitute a threat:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to assessing the attendant circumstances of the counseling, we are also particularly troubled by the agency's use of the appellant's conversation with an EAP counselor as the basis for his removal. The agency advertised its EAP as "[e]xtending confidential [a]ssistance for [p]ersonal and/or family problems." It encouraged employees to take advantage of the resources available through the program, stating that with professional assistance, personal and family difficulties can often be resolved at an early stage. Under the heading, "Confidentiality," it specifically provided that the program was "authorized by laws which protect the privacy of the individual and confidentiality of records," and that "[a]n employee's job security shall not be affected" by requests for counseling or referral assistance. We note that the agency itself recognized that it was unclear whether Ms. Kocher was permitted to describe her conversation with the appellant and accordingly, obtained a waiver from the appellant to allow the deciding official to talk to Ms. Kocher. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">United States v. Wimberly</span>, 60 F.3d 281, 285 (7th Cir. 1995), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, __ U.S. __, 116 S. Ct. 744, 133 L. Ed.2d 693 (1996).[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The U.S. Supreme Court has recently recognized a federal licensed psychotherapist-patient privilege. <span class="Italic">Jaffee v. Redmond</span>, __ U.S. __, __, 116 S. Ct. 1923, 1931, 135 L. Ed.2d 337 (1996). in any event, given our analysis under <span class="Italic">Metz</span>, we find it unnecessary to determine whether the Court's holding in <span class="Italic">Jaffee</span> should apply here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether a threat was made under the legal standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Metz</span>, we must consider all of the attendant circumstances surrounding the appellant's statements, including the advertisement of confidentiality. Here, the appellant testified that he called Ms. Kocher for help in resolving his problems. The appellant testified that he assumed his conversation would be kept private because Ms. Kocher was a counselor. The appellant was not made aware prior to his conversation with her that some of his statements might not be considered confidential or even that he needed to carefully phrase his concerns and words before speaking to her. Thus, the lack of notice to the appellant regarding the limits to the agency's EAP confidentiality policy could reasonably be viewed by the appellant as an invitation to speak freely with the understanding that utterances made in anger or out of frustration would be treated confidentially. Moreover, Ms. Kocher testified that she understood that the appellant was requesting counseling when he called. She also admitted that she did not inform the appellant until after he made the statements that she was going to notify the five employees. Accordingly, the appellant's understanding that the agency's counseling program was confidential was material to a <span class="Italic">Metz</span> analysis of the appellant's intent to make a threat.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In these circumstances, it would be contrary to the policy and purpose of the EAP to find that the appellant made a threat and to take action against him. An EAP furthers a valuable public policy by encouraging personal problem-solving by employees within a confidential context. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Doe v. Department of Justice</span>, 753 F.2d 1092, 1099 (D.C. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Bandy v. Department of the Navy</span>, 4 MSPB 295, 4 MSPR 218, 220 (1980); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 USC 7904. Here, the appellant was attempting to use the EAP for assistance with his personal and employment-related problems. Ms. Kocher's testimony demonstrates that the agency's EAP was successful in this regard because the appellant had calmed down by the end of their conversation and she did not believe that he would harm himself or others. <span class="Italic">Cf. Coleman v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Air Force</span>, 66 MSPR 498, 504 (1995) (the employee's supervisor testified that she believed that the employee was capable of carrying out his threat and that her life and the lives of other agency employees were in jeopardy), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 79 F.3d 1165 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table). Moreover, the record indicates that the appellant did not engage in any further behavior that could be characterized as threatening after his conversation with Ms. Kocher. <span class="Italic">Cf. Kilgour v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 67 MSPR 544, 549 (1995) (the employee engaged in threatening misconduct when he went to the Medical Center Director's home unannounced late in the evening in a highly emotional state and subsequently stated that he would "like to" or "was going to" knock the Director's lights out). Further, the record shows that the appellant submitted written apologies to Mr. Cureton and Mr. Price.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Nothing in this analysis should be construed to necessarily preclude the finding of a threat even if within an EAP counseling session, dependent on the specific circumstances and how those circumstances comport with the <span class="Italic">Metz</span> criteria. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Jaffee,</span> __U.S. at__ n.19, 116 S. Ct. at 1932 n.19 (noting the possibility of situations in which the federal licensed psychotherapist-patient privilege must give way, "for example, if a serious threat of harm to the patient or to others can be averted only by means of a disclosure by the therapist."); <span class="Italic">United States v.</span> <span class="Italic">Snelenberger</span>, 24 F.3d 799, 802 (6th Cir.) (describing, under Michigan state law, a "partial exception" to the psychotherapist-patient privilege for threats), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 513 U.S. 967, 115 S. Ct. 433, 130 L. Ed.2d 346 (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Powell</span> considered the reaction of those to whom the threat was reported, the conditional nature of the threat, its spontaneous nature, and the appellant's efforts to minimize its effect upon others. The EAP counselor did not call the police and she did not make vigorous efforts to contact the individuals threatened by the appellant. Although two persons threatened took some protective measures and experienced anxiety, their actions were discounted, 73 MSPR at 38-40:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Mr. Guglielmo provided a written statement that he carefully looked around as he walked to the parking lot and took precautions coming to and leaving work. Mr. Price provided a written statement that he took time to observe his surroundings when he got out of his motor vehicle. However, Mr. Guglielmo's statement should be somewhat discounted because Ms. Kocher described his reaction to news of the threat as "irrational," and "hysterical." Moreover, although Mr. Price testified that he was upset, concerned, and angry, and that he discussed the situation with his wife, Mr. Price did not remember whether Mr. Guglielmo told him exactly what the appellant had said, stating only that Mr. Guglielmo told him his life had been threatened by the appellant. Mr. Price further testified that he did not remember asking Ms. Kocher what the appellant had said when he discussed the situation with her the day after his conversation with Mr. Guglielmo. He indicated that he had already concluded from his discussion with Mr. Guglielmo that he had been threatened. Further, although he testified that he was concerned because he knew of the appellant's past disciplinary record, he also indicated that this knowledge was not firsthand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his written statement, Mr. Cureton stated that the situation was stressful for him and his wife, they experienced loss of sleep and early waking, were watchful and suspicious, and thought about getting a guard. He also testified that he was upset and afraid for his life. However, he did not testify as to any particular actions he took in response to the appellant's statements. Moreover, although he testified that he was concerned because the appellant had exhibited anger in the past, citing an incident in which the appellant shoved another employee, he admitted that he did not observe the incident.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In assessing the objective evidence, the precautionary actions taken by Mr. Guglielmo and Mr. Price should be compared with those of employees in other cases where the Board has found that a threat was made. For example, in <span class="Italic">Battle v. Department of Transp.</span>, 63 MSPR 403, 406-07 (1994), one of the individuals who was threatened took protective action by altering his driving route to work and wearing a bulletproof vest. Other agency officials took the employee's threatening language seriously, too. The Chief of Administrative Services secured the building by closing the doors and changing the locks. He hired a security service to provide a guard at the entrance who knew the employee's identity and was to stop him if he tried to enter the building. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 407. In <span class="Italic">Murphy v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 34 MSPR 534 (1987), the reaction of the threatened individual (who heard through the report of a co-worker that the employee had threatened to burn her house down) included being upset because her building did not have a fire escape, reporting the statement to the police, and requesting that she be moved from the employee's module. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 537. Given that here only two of the five objects of the threat, Mr. Guglielmo and Mr. Price, noted any direct responses that they had in reaction to the appellant's statements and that their reactions did not rise to the kind of active responses the employees took in <span class="Italic">Battle</span> and <span class="Italic">Murphy</span>, those reactions should not be given determinative weight as objective evidence of responses supporting that the appellant made a threat.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2690"></span>Ms. Kocher noted that, by the end of a single telephone conversation, she did not consider the appellant to be an immediate threat to those concerned. The administrative judge found this irrelevant, citing <span class="Italic">Murphy</span>, 34 MSPR at 538, apparently for the principle that a subsequent loss of intent does not mean that the appellant did not have the requisite intent to make a threat. However, in <span class="Italic">Murphy</span>, the employee made the threatening statement two days after she had received notice of a proposed disciplinary action and thus the statement could not "be excused as a spontaneous thoughtless reaction to the notice." <span class="Italic">Murphy</span>, 34 MSPR at 538. Here, the "intent," to the extent there was any to begin with, had, according to the agency's chief witness, Ms. Kocher, dissipated by the end of the single telephone conversation. Moreover, the report of the appellant's conversation with the union representative, Ms. Mathis, wherein the appellant stated that he had said something "stupid" to Ms. Kocher, indicates the appellant's lack of intent to make a genuine threat. <span class="Italic">See Metz</span>, 780 F.2d at 1002.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not specifically comment on this factor. Regardless of whether the appellant stated "I feel like killing," or "I want to kill," neither version constitutes a conditional statement. However, we find that both statements are naturally interpreted to convey more a generalized feeling and sense of anger and frustration, that is, "I would like to kill them if I could." Thus, neither could properly be characterized as a particularized and directed threat. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Metz</span>, 780 F.2d at 1003; <span class="Italic">cf. Murphy</span>, 34 MSPR at 538 (the employee made a specific reference to burning her supervisor's home).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Larry v. DOJ</span>, 76 MSPR 348, 355-58 (1997), also involving statements made by an employee to an EAP counselor or psychotherapist, reviewed most of the <span class="Italic">Metz</span> factors, and mitigated a removal penalty imposed for several charges, including threats:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency specified as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">On March 17, 1994 in a discussion with Mary Miklevasis, a psychotherapist [of the agency's Employee Assistance Program (E.A.P.)], [the appellant] stated that [he was] going to kill Captain [Glen] Trammel [his second-level supervisor].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant argues that he does not recall the specific threatening statements he made but that, assuming he made them, the Board should consider that they were made in expressing his "frustration, stress and anger" in the course of psychotherapy to treat "a mental illness." These arguments are addressed below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an actionable threat has been made, the Board must use the connotation that "a reasonable person would give to the words." <span class="Italic">Metz v. Department of Treasury</span>, 780 F.2d 1001, 1002 (Fed. Cir. 1986). In applying this "reasonable person" standard, the Board must consider (1) the listener's reactions, (2) the listener's apprehension of harm, (3) the speaker's intent, (4) any conditional nature of the statements, and (5) the attendant circumstances. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board "must give objective evidence heavy weight," although credible subjective evidence should also be considered. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1003 (citing <span class="Italic">Watts v. United States</span>, 394 U.S. 705, 708, 89 S. Ct. 1399, 1401-02, 22 L. Ed.2d 664 (1969)); <span class="Italic">Hutson v. Department of the Interior</span>, 67 MSPR 432, 436 (1995). Before considering whether an actionable threat has been made, however, the Board must determine the actual words used by the appellant to convey the alleged threat. <span class="Italic">See Hutson v. Department of the Interior</span>, 64 MSPR 107, 110 (1994); <span class="Italic">Sims v. Department of Defense</span>, 58 MSPR 131, 135 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Miklevasis orally notified Trammel and other agency officials of the alleged threat, as further discussed below. However, upon consultation with her supervisor at the EAP, she refused to put the appellant's alleged threatening statements "in writing or be a part of any court proceedings." In a one-sentence memorandum to Associate Warden Susan Gerlinski dated March 17, 1994, Trammel stated that he "received a call" that day from Miklevasis and that she told him that the appellant "threatened to kill" him. In a March 31, 1994 memorandum to the file, Gerlinski stated that she had spoken with Miklevasis about the appellant's "expressing his desire to kill Captain Glenn Trammel." The appellant did concede under oath that he "did make a statement that [he] wanted to hurt the Captain, maybe [he] did say something about killing someone," although he did not recall precisely what he said. He did not provide further clarification during the hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no record evidence specifying the actual words the appellant used to convey the alleged threat, although there is evidence showing the general import of his statements. However, assuming the evidence is sufficient to establish the agency's allegation that the appellant stated he was "going to kill" Trammel, we conclude that the agency failed to establish an actionable threat. In reaching this conclusion, we have considered <span class="Italic">de novo</span> the individual <span class="Italic">Metz</span> factors because the initial decision does not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Miklevasis' reaction was to notify Trammel of the alleged threats. This suggests that she believed the appellant's threatening statements were serious. According to a memorandum to the file dated March 31, 1994, by Gerlinski, Miklevasis "stated that she was concerned that the Captain did not take the threat to kill him as serious as she felt he should have." The record also shows that Miklevasis contacted Emily Garad, the agency's staff psychologist who referred the appellant to Miklevasis, and notified her of the appellant's alleged threat to Trammel. The objective evidence consisting of Miklevasis' notifying Trammel is consistent with the hearsay, subjective evidence that she considered the threats as being serious. On the other hand, the record does not show that Miklevasis notified the police, although Knutson testified that a psychotherapist has a duty to also call the police when she hears serious threatening statements. <span class="Italic">Id.; Powell v. Department of Justice</span>, 73 MSPR 29, 37 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Trammel testified during the hearing that he was "concerned" when he was notified of the statements by Miklevasis but that he "didn't get overly excited" and waited to hear further details. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Battle v. Department of Transp.</span>, 63 MSPR 403, 406 (1994) (although the allegedly threatened individual did not hear the threat directly from the speaker, his reaction after indirectly hearing of the threat is a consideration under <span class="Italic">Metz</span>). Although Trammel testified that he took the threat "seriously," there is no record evidence on what actions, if any, he took in response to the threat. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Battle</span>, 63 MSPR at 406-07 (the threatened individual took protective action by altering his driving route to work and wearing a bulletproof vest, and agency officials took security precautions). The record does show that the appellant was placed on home-duty status the following day. We find that the evidence is equivocal as to these <span class="Italic">Metz</span> factors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant was under severe emotional distress due to personal and work-related problems before he sought EAP counseling on March 17, 1994. On March 17, 1994, the appellant informed Trammel that he was going to obtain EAP counseling. He went to the agency's Psychological Services Department and spoke to Garad, the Staff Psychologist, who referred him to the EAP. As the agency alleged, the appellant made the alleged threatening statements during the counseling session with Miklevasis, the EAP psychotherapist.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Powell</span>, 73 MSPR at 34, the Board found that the appellant's having voluntarily obtained EAP counseling "suggest[ed] an individual who want[ed] to talk out his frustration rather than one who intend[ed] to make a threat....&#8197;Similarly, the appellant here made the alleged threatening statements during the course of psychotherapy. The context in which the statements were made shows that they were not made with the intent to threaten Trammel but, instead, were made with the intent to obtain professional treatment for such violent feelings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that there are no other attendant circumstances to be considered. The record evidence does not show, for instance, that the appellant previously threatened Trammel or anyone else at the agency. <span class="Italic">Cf. Coleman v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 66 MSPR 498, 504 (1995) (the appellant's prior threatening statements were attendant circumstances tending to support an actionable threat), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 79 F.3d 1165 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table); <span class="Italic">Sims</span>, 58 MSPR at 136 (same); <span class="Italic">cf. also</span> <span class="Italic">Powell</span>, 73 MSPR at 35 (the appellant's seeking EAP counseling was a departure from his past contentious conduct). The Board has stated that the speaker's mental condition may be considered as attendant circumstances. <span class="Italic">Battle</span>, 63 MSPR at 407. As discussed above, however, there is no record evidence showing that the appellant was mentally incompetent or mentally ill. <span class="Italic">Cf. id.</span> (the appellant was "diagnosed with bipolar disorder, i.e., manic depression," but his threatening statements were not shown to be merely an outgrowth of his mental illness); <span class="Italic">cf. McMillan v. US Postal Service</span>, 48 MSPR 590, 592-93 (1991) (even if the medical evidence established that the appellant was mentally ill when he assaulted his supervisors, it does not establish that the misconduct was caused by his mental illness, and, in any event, mental illness does not negate the misconduct which does not involve wrongful intent).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, DC-0752-16-0064-I-1 (NP 4/14/2023) "To the extent that the appellant is seeking to assert a psychotherapist-patient privilege, we decline to find that any such privilege was violated. The appellant was specifically cautioned by the counselor that his statements might trigger a duty to warn, yet he continued to make them. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gray</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 184, &#x00B6; 10 (explaining that whether an appellant is aware his statements might not be kept confidential is a factor in determining whether they are covered by a psychotherapist-patient privilege).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Vilca v. TSA</span>, DE-0752-20-0272-I-1, n.3 (NP 2/17/2023), found unprotected statements made in a conversation with a reasonable accommodation specialist:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant's statements occurred in the context of a conversation with a reasonable accommodation specialist about the agency's decision to deny her requested accommodation, among other things, we have considered the Board's prior holding that certain intemperate employee comments, which would otherwise support disciplinary action, will not support disciplinary action if made in certain emotional, confrontation contexts, such as the grievance process or the EEO counseling process. <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 673, &#x00B6; 11 (2011) (citing <span class="Italic">Daigle v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 625, 628 (1999), and <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Nielson</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 161, <span id="Page_2691"></span>175-76 (1996)). However, this holding is inapplicable to this case because the appellant was not merely venting about her supervisor or his decision to deny her accommodation request; rather, the appellant's statements were appropriately construed by the reasonable accommodation specialist and other agency officials as a threat. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Berkner v. Department of Commerce</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 277, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-17 (2011) (describing Ms. Berkner's statements to the union Chief Steward during a meeting about a then-pending discrimination complaint threatening suicide and broadly indicating a willingness to harm multiple agency employees if the agency removed her, distinguishing Ms. Berkner's statements from Mr. Daigle's conditional statements and other statements to an EEO counselor about his supervisor, and affirming Ms. Berkner's removal based on a single charge of making inappropriate statements); <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 673, &#x00B6; 11 (stating that an employee generally cannot be discharged for rude or impertinent conduct in the course of presenting grievances absent gross insubordination or threats of physical harm).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The limited protection for statements to therapists suggesting threats against others in the workplace diminishes when the threats are repeated by the appellant to others, <span class="Italic">Gray v. GPO</span>, 111 MSPR 184, 187-90 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-15, 2009 MSPB 68 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has previously expressed skepticism regarding charges brought against employees based on statements they made in the course of psychotherapy. <span class="Italic">See Larry v. Department of Justice</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 348 (1997); <span class="Italic">Powell v. Department of Justice</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 29 (1997). In <span class="Italic">Larry</span>, the agency charged the appellant with, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, threatening a supervisor based on statements that the appellant made to a psychotherapist of the agency's Employee Assistance Program (EAP). <span class="Italic">Larry</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 355. The Board found that the agency failed to prove that the appellant made a threat under <span class="Italic">Metz</span> because the evidence showed that the appellant made the statements in the course of psychotherapy with the intent to obtain professional treatment for his violent feelings, and not with the intent to threaten anyone. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 358.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Powell</span>, the agency charged the appellant with threatening to kill five agency employees based on statements he made in a telephone conversation with an EAP counselor. <span class="Italic">Powell</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 31-32. In considering whether the agency proved its charge under <span class="Italic">Metz</span>, the Board stated, "we are also particularly troubled by the agency's use of the appellant's conversation with an EAP counselor as the basis for his removal," reasoning that the agency advertised its EAP as a confidential program where employees could obtain assistance. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 35. The Board noted that the United States Supreme Court has recognized, in some circumstances, a Federal licensed psychotherapist-patient privilege, but found it unnecessary to determine whether such a privilege applied in <span class="Italic">Powell</span>. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 35 n.2 (citing <span class="Italic">Jaffee v. Redmond</span>, 518 U.S. 1, 15-16 (1996)). The Board found that the appellant in <span class="Italic">Powell</span> was requesting counseling and was not made aware that his statements might not be kept confidential and, thus, "it would be contrary to the policy and purpose of the EAP to find that the appellant made a threat and to take action against him." <span class="Italic">Powell</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 35-36.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Larry</span> and <span class="Italic">Powell</span> can be distinguished from this case in several important respects. First, <span class="Italic">Larry</span> and <span class="Italic">Powell</span> both involved threat charges and required analysis under <span class="Italic">Metz</span>. Here, although the appellant asserts that the agency was required to prove that the appellant made a threat in accordance with <span class="Italic">Metz</span>, (appellant's closing argument), his argument is without merit because the agency charged him with "Improper Personal Conduct, Disruption in the Workplace, Making Statements that [C]aused Anxiety in the Workplace" and "Using Racially Inappropriate Language." As the administrative judge correctly found, it is well established that an agency does not have to meet the elements of proof established in <span class="Italic">Metz</span> when it brings a charge such as "making statements that caused anxiety and disruption in the workplace." <span class="Italic">See McCarty v. Department of the Navy</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 177, 182-83 (1995). Second, <span class="Italic">Larry</span> and <span class="Italic">Powell</span> both involved statements made to EAP counselors. Here, the appellant made his statements in the agency's medical unit and in a conference room--not the EAP office--to Registered Nurses and to Safety Manager Qureshi and Occupation Safety and Health Specialist Walker--not to licensed psychotherapists or counselors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, the policy concerns that we expressed in <span class="Italic">Powell</span> are relevant here. We have serious concerns as to whether it is appropriate for an agency to take action against an employee on the basis of statements made to medical professionals during the course of obtaining medical treatment when those statements are protected by a legally-recognized privilege. It is not clear whether, in this case, the appellant's initial statements in the agency's medical unit were privileged. The administrative judge found that they were not, but she did not explain her reasoning. Whether the appellant went to the medical unit for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment, and whether he attempted to speak with a doctor is in dispute and cannot be resolved on this record absent explained credibility determinations which the administrative judge here expressly declined to make. It is also not clear whether statements made to nurses are privileged.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As in <span class="Italic">Powell</span>, however, we need not determine whether the appellant's statements were covered by a privilege that precludes their use in the removal action taken against him. <span class="Italic">See Powell</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 35 n.2. Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant's initial statements in the agency's medical unit to Nurse Zephirin and Nurse Wurie were privileged, we agree that his repetition of similar statements in the presence of Qureshi and Walker defeats any privilege. <span class="Italic">See In re Pebsworth</span>, 705 F.2d 261, 263-64 (7th Cir. 1983) ("In connection with the attorney-client, husband-wife, and usual doctor-patient privilege, for example, virtually <span class="Italic">any</span> disclosure of the privileged communications to third parties vitiates the privilege.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant on review reiterates his argument below that the privilege was not broken when he repeated his statements in the presence of Qureshi and Walker because he was compelled to do so. Even considering only those facts which are not disputed, the record does not support his assertion. Walker testified that, when he and Qureshi arrived at the medical unit, the appellant was at the reception desk in an area "frequented by [agency] employees," and Walker believed that "it was best that we not have a scene and get an employee upset," so he "recommended" that they go to a conference room for privacy, where they simply talked and he tried to calm the appellant down. Nothing in his testimony created any impression that he compelled the appellant to accompany him to the conference room or that he interrogated the appellant or otherwise even asked him any questions. The appellant's attorney did not ask Walker any questions at the hearing that would have elicited any testimony that Walker or anyone else compelled the appellant to repeat his statements. In fact, the appellant's attorney merely asked Walker whether "it was [he] who <span class="Italic">suggested</span> [the appellant] come back to the conference room to sit down and talk about it." Walker also testified, "Then I asked [the appellant], 'Let's go in the back.' So all four of us went in the back," where the appellant "explained to everyone what was going on." Walker's version of events was corroborated by Nurse Zephirin, who testified, "Mr. Walker said he knows the [appellant] very well, that he can try to calm him down."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even the appellant testified, "Mr. Walker came upstairs and we talked, and he had mentioned, you know, I know you're mad, you know. Take your time, you know, go down and don't cause any problem. We talked for a few minutes." The appellant offered no testimony even suggesting that he thought he had no choice but to accompany Qureshi and Walker to the conference room and repeat the statements he had made to the nurses. In fact, his own attorney did not ask him any questions at the hearing designed to determine whether the appellant's statements to Qureshi and Walker were involuntarily made. Instead, all evidence, including the appellant's own testimony, suggests that the appellant's statements to Qureshi and Walker were entirely voluntary and that the appellant's counsel only argued for the first time in his closing argument that the statements might have been compulsory. Because the uncontradicted evidence of record shows that the appellant willingly repeated his statements to Qureshi and Walker, any privilege that might have existed when he made substantially similar statements in the presence of the nurses alone was vitiated. Therefore, the administrative judge's failure to resolve the issue of compulsion or make credibility findings on this matter did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights and provides no basis for reversal of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984).</p>
