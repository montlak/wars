<h4 class="h4" id="sec4-54"><span class="space">3.</span> Evidence in Disability Annuity Appeal; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Chavez</span></span>; Post-Separation Evidence</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Relevant evidence submitted to the Board in a retirement appeal is entitled to the same consideration as the evidence assembled with the retirement application. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bradsher v. OPM</span>, 21 MSPR 694, 699 (1984). [Refer to Chapter 14, "<a href="0100-2023-21-055.html#sec14-55">Evidence of Disability</a>," for extensive discussion of disability retirement appeals and the type of evidence required to establish particular disabilities.] The Board conducts a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> analysis of evidence in disability retirement appeals, <span class="Italic">Ancheta v. OPM</span>, 95 MSPR 343, 353-55 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-17 (2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]n a recent case, the Federal Circuit has interpreted the relevant statutory and regulatory requirements to conclude that the Board "is not confined to either upholding OPM's decision on the ground invoked by OPM or remanding to OPM for further proceedings." <span class="Italic">See Licausi v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 350 F.3d 1359, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2003)<span class="Italic">. In Licausi,</span> OPM notified a disability retirement annuitant that she was no longer entitled to continue receiving disability benefits because she had earned more than 80 percent of the current rate of pay of the position from which she had retired and was considered restored to earning capacity. <span class="Italic">Licausi</span>, 350 F.3d at 1360-61. The following year, Licausi sought reinstatement of her disability annuity on the basis that she no longer met the 80 percent earnings threshold and continued to be disabled because of phlebitis, the condition that served as the basis for the original award of disability retirement benefits. OPM denied Licausi's request on the ground that the medical condition for which she was retired had not recurred. She appealed OPM's decision to the Board, and the administrative judge upheld OPM's decision, but on different grounds. The administrative judge found that the medical evidence indicated that Licausi continued to suffer from phlebitis, but the administrative judge found that Licausi was not entitled to reinstatement of her disability retirement annuity because she had failed to prove that she continued to be disabled from the position from which she was retired. <span class="Italic">Licausi,</span> 350 F.3d at 1361.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1476"></span>Licausi then appealed the administrative judge's decision to the Federal Circuit arguing that, because the administrative judge had upheld OPM's decision on a different ground from the one on which OPM based its ruling, the administrative judge's decision violated the <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> rule and was, therefore, improper. <span class="Italic">Licausi</span>, 350 F.3d at 1363-64. The court explained that two Supreme Court decisions, <span class="Italic">Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp.,</span> 318 U.S. 80, 63 S. Ct. 45, 87 L. Ed. 626 (1943) and <span class="Italic">Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp.,</span> 332 U.S. 194, 67 S. Ct. 1575, 91 L. Ed. 1995 (1947), "stand for the proposition that 'a reviewing court, in dealing with a determination or judgment which an administrative agency alone is authorized to make, must judge the propriety of such action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency."' <span class="Italic">Licausi</span>, 350 F.3d at 1363 (quoting <span class="Italic">Chenery Corp.,</span> 332 U.S. at 196, 67 S. Ct. 1575).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court, however, rejected Licausi's argument, ruling that the <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> rule does not apply to Board review of OPM disability retirement determinations. In support of this ruling, the court explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Merit Systems Protection Board has the statutory authority to review OPM decisions in CSRS [(Civil Service Retirement System)] disability cases under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d)(1),[6] which provides (with an exception inapplicable here) that OPM disability decisions may be appealed to the Board "under procedures prescribed by the Board."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">[6]&#x2003;We note that the statutory provision that confers jurisdiction on the Board to consider OPM decisions in FERS disability cases, such as the decision involved in the instant case, contains language that is substantially identical to the language contained in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d)(1). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Licausi,</span> 350 F.3d at 1364. The court then noted that the Board regulation prescribing its procedures in retirement appeals provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In appeals from reconsideration decisions of the Office of Personnel Management involving retirement benefits, if the appellant has filed the application, the appellant has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, entitlement to the benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)]. The court stated that this regulation makes clear that the appeal proceeding before the Board constitutes a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> proceeding that is quite different from the kind of limited review prescribed by the Administrative Procedure Act for judicial review of administrative action. Given the nature of the Board proceeding in a disability retirement appeal, the court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he question for the Board is not whether OPM's decision is supported by substantial evidence or otherwise should be upheld or rejected based on the record made before OPM. Instead, the parties are free to introduce new evidence, including live testimony, bearing on the question whether the retiree is entitled to benefits, and the Board is required to decide the case on the basis of all the evidence before it....&#8197;Because the Board engages in <span class="Italic">de novo</span> consideration of the eligibility issue, it is not confined to either upholding OPM's decision on the ground invoked by OPM or remanding to OPM for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Licausi,</span> 350 F.3d at 1364. Because the Board has an obligation to make an independent determination as to eligibility and its decisions do not involve review of a determination that OPM alone is authorized to make, the court stated that Board decisions in disability retirement cases "fall outside of the <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> doctrine for reasons given in <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> itself." <span class="Italic">Licausi</span>, 350 F.3d at 1364. Thus, the court concluded that the Board "was free to sustain OPM's decision on a different ground because Ms. Licausi was required to show, in <span class="Italic">de novo</span> proceedings before the Board, that she was eligible for disability retirement benefits." <span class="Italic">Licausi</span>, 350 F.3d at 1365.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Burckley v. OPM</span>, 80 MSPR 617, 620-21 &#x00B6; 6 (1999), provides a summary of evidentiary considerations applicable to disability retirement appeals:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A determination regarding entitlement to disability retirement benefits must consider the following evidence: (1) Objective clinical findings; (2) diagnoses and medical opinions; (3) subjective evidence of pain and disability; (4) evidence relating to the effect of the applicant's condition on his ability to perform in the grade or class of position last occupied; and (5) evidence that the applicant was not qualified for reassignment to a vacant position at the same grade or level as the position he last occupied. <span class="Italic">See Dunn v.

<p class="Body-Text">In a disability retirement appeal, to determine whether an employee is capable of performing useful and efficient service, it is appropriate to consider whether the appellant is a danger to himself or others. <span class="Italic">Thorne v.

Removal for misconduct does not preclude an individual's receipt of disability retirement benefits if he can show he was disabled from performing useful and efficient service in his position prior to the effective date of his removal, although an appellant's application for disability retirement in the face of an impending removal for misconduct may cast doubt on the veracity of the application. <span class="Italic">Henderson v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board's leading decision on evidence in disability retirement appeals is <span class="Italic">Chavez v. OPM</span>, 6 MSPR 404, 408-09, 413, 421-23, 6 MSPB 343 (1981). The appellant, whose work required supervision of fire crews, developed an intolerance to dust and smoke with consequential respiratory problems considered disabling by his physician. The Board reaffirmed, following discussion of legislative history, the right of an appellant in a disability case to a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> hearing rather than a review of the existing OPM disability records. The appeal and hearing allow the appellant to establish his disability by a preponderance of the evidence. At the hearing, the appellant may present all the relevant evidence in his possession, including medical evidence of the claimed disability not previously submitted to OPM. Concerning the nature and quality of the proof used to evaluate disability appeals, the Board examines objective medical evidence, expert opinion evidence, and subjective evidence from the appellant of pain and inability to work. If objective medical evidence and expert diagnostic opinion are not adequate to determine whether the appellant's impairment has a disabling effect, subjective evidence may be entitled to great weight if uncontradicted and consistent with the objective clinical findings. The Board considered the evidentiary requirements for Social Security disability cases and analogized the evidentiary requirements in those cases to the proof required in civil service disability annuity cases:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">0PM contends that the "finality clause" of 5 U.S.C. 8347(c) limits the Board's scope of review to that employed by the appellate courts, and precludes the Board from considering evidence which had not previously been presented to 0PM. While both of those contentions have already been essentially resolved adversely to OPM's position, <span class="Italic">see Hein</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and <span class="Italic">Toppi v. OPM</span>, 2 MSPB 360 (1980), we will address them in an effort to clarify the applicable legal principles once and for all.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude for these reasons that in adjudicating an appeal to the Board under 5 U.S.C. 8347(d) from an 0PM disability retirement determination, the Board is not limited to a review of the record before 0PM. We are mandated by 5 U.S.C. 7701(a) and (b) to conduct a hearing if requested by the appellant, and to consider <span class="Italic">de novo</span> all the relevant evidence presented by both parties, whether offered at a hearing or transmitted as part of the administrative record. Nothing in the law or in our regulations restricts 0PM to reliance upon its documentary administrative record, or withholds from 0PM a full and fair opportunity to cross-examine or otherwise rebut appellant's evidence presented at the Board's hearing. We therefore find no merit to OPM's contention that the presiding official erred in admitting and considering additional medical evidence during the adjudication of the appeal below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The courts have identified the elements of proof to be considered, together and in combination with each other, in assessing a claim for social security disability benefits. These include (1) the objective medical facts or clinical evidence of the treating or examining physicians, (2) the diagnoses and medical opinions of the treating and examining physicians based on such objective findings, and (3) the subjective evidence of pain and disability testified to by the claimant, co-workers, relatives, neighbors and others who have observed him or her. Although objective medical evidence establishing disability is not always necessary, the courts agree that medical opinion evidence of impairment must support the claim for benefits. This is not to say, however, that the courts consider the absence of objective medical evidence in a claim for social security benefits as insignificant, especially where the alleged impairment or disease is readily susceptible of medical verification.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The interrelationship of the elements of proof, and the difference between subsidiary issues of medical fact and the ultimate issue of qualification <span id="Page_1477"></span>for disability benefits, have been well described by the Fourth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Underwood v. Ribicoff,</span> 298 F.2d 850, 851-52 (1962). Observing that "a recitation of objective, clinical findings will seldom show, without more, the over-all effect of [any clinically determinable] impairments on a particular individual," the court pointed out that the "expert medical opinion of treating or examining physicians on these subsidiary questions of fact will in most cases be essential in determining with respect to a particular individual the severity of an objectively determinable physical impairment." Cautioning, however, that the ultimate fact in issue is not to be resolved solely on the basis of medical opinion evidence, the Court emphasized that such expert diagnostic opinion and evidence alone "may not enable a fact finder properly to determine whether or not such limitation of capacity amounts to disability within the terms of the Act." It then "becomes necessary to consider subjective testimony to determine accurately the effect of these impairments upon the Claimant." Such subjective evidence</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">may be entitled to great weight on the matter of disability, especially where such evidence is uncontradicted in the record. Even where medical opinion is very strong in favor of disability, this subjective evidence will always be a significant source of corroboration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Objective medical evidence, then, is but one of the elements of proof to be considered, along with expert opinion evidence and subjective evidence of pain and inability to work, in determining the ultimate fact of disability <span class="Italic">vel non</span>. Testimony by the applicant of subjective pain and inability to work, particularly where it is supported by competent medical evidence, must be considered seriously. When objective medical evidence and expert diagnostic opinion are not adequate to determine whether the applicant's impairment has a disabling effect, such subjective evidence may be entitled to great weight if uncontradicted in the record and consistent with the objective clinical findings. <span class="Italic">Underwood v. Ribicoff, supra.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The probative value of such evidence will of course depend in part upon the credibility attached to it by the fact finder, just as the probative value of medical opinions may depend in part upon such factors as whether the opinion was based on a medical examination, whether the opinion provides a reasoned explanation for its findings as distinct from mere conclusory assertions, the qualifications of the expert rendering the opinion, and the extent and duration of the expert's familiarity with or treatment of the applicant's condition. The ultimate determination must be based upon the probative value of all the evidence taking into account each of the elements of proof--objective clinical findings, diagnoses and expert medical opinions, and subjective evidence of pain and disability, together with all evidence relating to the effect of the applicant's condition upon his or her ability to perform in the grade or class of position last occupied. Section 8331(6) imposes no requirement that a disability determination must be based on any single one of these elements of proof. Therefore, our presiding official erred in assuming that appellant's claim for disability retirement benefits could not be granted if it was not proven by objective medical evidence.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, 49-years old, is a 25-year employee of the U.S. Postal Service who applied for disability retirement from her position as a PS-6 Sales and Service Associate. She based her application on her ongoing intolerance to heat, explaining that she is unable to diffuse internal heat due to nerve damage throughout her body, and so can stand temperatures only in the low-to-mid 60s. She stated that, when she becomes overheated, she becomes nauseated and dizzy and cannot think, that she experiences an extremely rapid heart rate at temperatures over 70 degrees, and that she will "pass out" if the external heat cannot be regulated, but that, since it is Postal policy to keep the temperature at 78 degrees, for her, there is no relief anywhere. She added that she must keep her house at "60 degrees to vacuum and [that] sitting around temperature is about 62-63 [degrees]."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With her application, the appellant submitted extensive medical documentation, including an entire file of reports and test results from Robert C. Blackwood, M.D., her personal care physician. Dr. Blackwood noted at the outset of his period of care that, according to the appellant, she "has been having heat intolerance" since 1991, that it "consists of air on 67 all day long, even in winter," and that "over 70 wants to throw up." Dr. Blackwood also noted the appellant's other symptoms including chest pain, dizziness, exhaustion, and headaches, and he ordered a stress test, echocardiogram, and full blood workup. He subsequently ordered further testing, including a liver ultrasound and a neuroendocrine workup. He also referred the appellant to Dr. Aaron I. Vinik, Director of Research at the Eastern Virginia Medical School Strelitz Diabetes Center and Center for Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders, who first saw the appellant on November 26, 2008. Dr. Vinik ordered a comprehensive metabolic profile and at least a dozen other tests. The appellant continued to complain of heat intolerance and various other symptoms, prompting Dr. Vinik to do a "lupus workup...with immunoelectrophoresis and protein electrophoresis to rule out any Raynaud's phenomenon." During subsequent visits, Dr. Vinik consistently acknowledged the appellant's continued heat intolerance, which did not <span class="Italic">seem</span> to respond to any prescribed regimen. He ultimately diagnosed her as suffering from, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, autonomic nerve dysfunction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM initially denied the appellant's application, finding that her claimed heat intolerance was totally subjective and unsubstantiated and that "no answer to this symptom has been found." OPM found the appellant's several diagnoses, including autonomic nerve dysfunction, to be unproven.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With her April 16, 2010 request for reconsideration, the appellant submitted additional medical documentation in support of her claim. She submitted an October 2, 2008 report from Dr. Paul Mansheim, Riverpoint Psychiatric Associates, who reported that she consulted him for her symptom of feeling hot all of the time, noting that, according to her, she had had numerous medical evaluations with no results. The appellant also submitted a report from Dr. Donald Holzer, Center for Pain Management, whom she saw for evaluation of her heat intolerance. Dr. Holzer noted Dr. Vinik's diagnosis of autonomic neuropathy and suggested that the appellant be evaluated for that condition and hypohidrosis (inability to sweat normally, also known as anhidrosis).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with its earlier denial, OPM denied the appellant's request for reconsideration, finding that her medical records did not support a finding that her conditions had worsened or precluded her from attending the workplace or performing useful and efficient service in her position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After filing her appeal, the appellant submitted additional reports. She also explained her abnormal sweating response whereby she does not perspire on her head or face, but does so unevenly on other parts of her torso, with the result that her body is unable to properly cool itself. Dr. Blackwood noted the appellant's continued heat intolerance, but indicated that "[w]e have to this day, not been able to come up with a diagnosis other than some autonomic dysfunction." The appellant also submitted a report from Dr. Kamal Chemali, Cleveland Clinic Neurological Institute, who diagnosed her as suffering from a small fiber neuropathy which "probably can explain her lack of sweating," although he indicated that the exact cause of the neuropathy could not be determined. And, the appellant submitted statements from three of her friends who described how her condition has adversely affected her quality of life.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1478"></span>Following the hearing, the appellant submitted an additional report from Dr. Chemali who certified the appellant's diagnosis as an autonomic small fiber neuropathy of unknown cause, resulting in impairment of her sweating abilities and intolerance to normal room temperatures. Dr. Chemali stated that there is no known treatment for this condition, except avoiding environments where the temperature is greater than 65 degrees "(number noticed by the patient herself)."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After weighing the documentary and testimonial evidence, the administrative judge concluded that the appellant had failed to meet her burden of establishing her entitlement to disability retirement under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS).[7] The administrative judge acknowledged the appellant's subjective evidence of pain and suffering, but found that she had not presented competent medical evidence in support. The administrative judge referred to specific medical reports from the appellant's various doctors, but found that none indicated how her impairments prevented her from doing her job. He also found that she failed to explain how her psychological condition precluded her from performing her duties or why her problems were not capable of being controlled with medication and therapy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;We note that certain evidence the agency submitted suggests that the appellant retired under the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). However, the agency stipulated that the appellant met the statutory condition for length of service for retirement under the CSRS, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a), and has not challenged the administrative judge's finding in accord. Under the circumstances, we cannot determine definitively which retirement system applies in this case. However, our inability to make such a finding does not affect the appellant's entitlement to a retirement annuity inasmuch as the applicable statutory and regulatory standards governing disability retirement under the CSRS and FERS are essentially identical. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1203(a)(2), <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8451(a)(1)(B) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.103(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues that the administrative judge improperly required that a specific label be attached to her condition since she clearly demonstrated that she cannot perform useful and efficient service due to her need for 60 degree temperatures at all times. The appellant further argues that the administrative judge improperly required her to establish that her condition precludes her from performing specific requirements of her position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The only rules governing entitlement to disability retirement are the ones set out in statute and regulation.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has frequently stated that a medical provider's conclusion that an employee is disabled is persuasive only if the provider explains how the medical condition affects the employee's specific work requirements. <span class="Italic">E.g., Tan-Gatue v.

Reversing that finding, the Board observed that "[t]his is not a case, however, where the appellant's entitlement to disability retirement turned on finely tuned correlations between particular medical impairments and specific job requirements." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 627.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;During adjudication of Ms. Mullins-Howard's appeal, following OPM's denial of her application for disability retirement, OPM reversed its earlier finding and concluded that she was entitled to benefits, whereupon the administrative judge dismissed the appeal as moot. <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 624.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Bynum v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 14 (2001), the Board stated that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[t]he Mullins-Howard approach creates an exception to the rule that <span class="Italic">medical evidence itself must show that the medical condition affects specific job duties and requirements</span>. Where the Board is presented with the position description and with <span class="Italic">medical evidence that unambiguously and without contradiction</span> indicates that the appellant cannot perform the duties or meet the requirements of the position, the Board may link the medical evidence to the job duties and requirements and find that the appellant is entitled to disability retirement. In such circumstances, the Board may make this finding in the absence of reference in the medical evidence to specific job duties or requirements. Considering medical evidence in this way is part of the Board's role as the ultimate decision maker with the authority to independently evaluate the probative value of medical evidence in the absence of contradictory medical evidence from another source.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding this point, a number of cases decided subsequent to <span class="Italic">Bynum</span> have relied upon it for the proposition that, in proving a claim of entitlement to disability retirement, the "general" rule requires the appellant to show a nexus between her medical condition and her specific job duties, and the "exception" to that rule, sometimes called the <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> exception, allows the Board to link the medical evidence to the job duties where such evidence unambiguously and without contradiction indicates that the appellant cannot perform the duties or meet the requirements of her position.[11] <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lydon v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 152, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 16 (2007); <span class="Italic">Musser v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;Other cases have stated that a correlation between the medical condition and specific job duties is not required when the medical evidence is unambiguous, although they have not additionally stated that it must be without contradiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Surma v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 98, &#x00B6; 8 (2001) (citing <span class="Italic">Bynum</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 14 and <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 627); <span class="Italic">Davis v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is our view that <span class="Italic">Bynum</span> and its progeny reflect a way of analyzing an appellant's entitlement to disability retirement benefits that is contrary to both statute and regulation. We take this opportunity to explain why, and to now clarify the proper way to analyze such a claim. In so doing, we follow and adopt the reasoning of then-Member Slavet's separate opinion in <span class="Italic">Craig v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 449, 459-64 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a), an applicant for disability retirement under CSRS must be "unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the employee's position."[12] OPM's implementing regulation explains the statutory requirement as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The individual must, while employed in a position subject to the [CSRS], have become disabled because of a medical condition, resulting in a service deficiency in performance, conduct, or attendance, or if there is no actual service deficiency, the disabling medical condition must be incompatible with either useful or efficient service or retention in the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1203(a)(2). The regulation thus sets out two ways to meet the statutory requirement: (1) by showing that the medical condition caused a deficiency in performance, attendance, or conduct; or (2) by showing that the medical condition is incompatible with useful and efficient service or retention in the position. <span class="Italic">See Gometz v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 115, 121 (1995) (finding that, although the appellant's disability did not result in a documented service deficiency, it was incompatible with either useful or efficient service or retention in her position). Under the first method, an appellant can establish entitlement by showing that the medical condition affects her ability to perform specific work requirements, or prevented her from being regular in attendance or caused her to act inappropriately. Under the second method, an appellant can establish entitlement by showing that the medical condition is inconsistent with working in general, working in a particular line of work, or working in a particular type of setting. But regardless of the particular method of establishing an inability to render useful and efficient service, the burden of proof in every case is by a preponderance of the evidence, i.e., more likely true than not. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a), (c)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b) and 1201.4(q)]. To require medical evidence that is unambiguous and without contradiction is to impose a much higher burden of proof, one that is not authorized by law or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;The statute additionally provides that an employee is not eligible for disability retirement if she is qualified for reassignment, under procedures prescribed by OPM, to a vacant position in the agency which is at the same grade or level and in which the employee would be able to render useful and efficient service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a). In this instance, the agency certified that reassignment was not possible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1479"></span>As then-Member Slavet posited, it appears that the source of confusion in this matter may have begun as an observation about the probative value of expert opinion evidence, which was later viewed as a substantive rule governing entitlement to disability retirement. The <span class="Italic">Tanious/Tan-Gatue</span> line of decisions focuses on the persuasiveness of a medical provider's opinion as to a patient's disability. <span class="Italic">See Tan-Gatue</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 116, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Tanious</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. at 111. But in <span class="Italic">Bynum</span>, the focus shifted to the content of the medical evidence itself. <span class="Italic">See Bynum</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 14 ("medical evidence itself must show that the medical condition affects specific job duties and requirements"). The basic idea behind the <span class="Italic">Tanious/Tan-Gatue</span> line of decisions is simply that a medical opinion unsupported by medical evidence, e.g., a diagnosis, clinical findings, etc., is not very persuasive. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gonzales v. Office of Personnel</span> <span class="Italic">Management</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 46, &#x00B6; 5 (where a psychologist opined that the appellant was mentally incompetent but provided no facts or explanation to support his opinion, the Board found that the psychologist's opinion on the issue of the appellant's mental incompetence was not persuasive), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 48 Fed. Appx. 747 (Fed. Cir. 2002). But to go from that proposition to the proposition that an appellant is not entitled to disability retirement unless her medical provider explains specifically how her medical condition affects specific work requirements is unwarranted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore overrule <span class="Italic">Bynum</span> and its progeny to the extent that they state that the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> reflects an "exception" to a "general rule" that medical evidence must unambiguously and without contradiction show how the medical condition affects specific job duties or indicate that the appellant cannot meet the requirements of her position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has always stated that it will consider all pertinent evidence in determining an appellant's entitlement to disability retirement: objective clinical findings, diagnoses and medical opinions, subjective evidence of pain and disability, and evidence relating to the effect of the applicant's condition on her ability to perform the duties of her position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dunn v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 426, 432 (1994), <span class="Italic">dismissed</span>, 91 F.3d 169 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table). However, nothing in the law mandates that a single provider tie all of this evidence together. For example, if the medical provider provides clinical findings, a diagnosis, and a description of how the medical condition affects the appellant's activities in general terms, the Board could consider that evidence, together with the appellant's subjective account of how the condition has affected her ability to do her job and her daily life, testimony or statements from supervisors, co-workers, family members, and friends, and the appellant's position description. From that, the Board could conclude that the medical condition caused deficiencies in the employee's performance, conduct, or attendance, <span class="Italic">or</span> that the medical condition is incompatible with useful and efficient service in her position, either because the appellant is unable to perform critical elements of her position, <span class="Italic">or</span> because she cannot work at any job, in a particular line of work, or in a particular type of work setting.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ultimate question, based on all relevant evidence, is: Do the employee's medical impairments preclude her from rendering useful and efficient service in her position? And this question must be answered in the affirmative if the totality of the evidence makes that conclusion more likely to be true than not true.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant has established that her medical condition is incompatible with useful and efficient service or retention in her position.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, the appellant has exhaustively sought treatment from a variety of medical professionals for her numerous medical conditions and symptoms, but with little or no success. She has been largely compliant, except when certain medications are problematic for her. There has been no suggestion that she is a malingerer. Her account of her debilitating heat intolerance is well corroborated, and her evidence of such is unchallenged by any contradictory evidence. <span class="Italic">See Vanieken-Ryals v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 508 F.3d 1034, 1040-44 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (an appellant is not required to submit objective medical evidence to establish entitlement to disability retirement but may rely on subjective evidence, including the appellant's own description of her own symptoms as reported to a medical professional). Her most recent medical report from Dr. Chemali has provided a diagnosis for her heat intolerance, autonomic small fiber neuropathy, but according to him, there is no known treatment for the condition, except avoiding environments where the temperature is greater than 65 degrees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The undisputed record evidence shows that the appellant's condition has deteriorated such that she is significantly limited in her ability to leave her home because it is only there that she can control the temperature. All these individuals supported the appellant's claim as to how her body reacts to temperatures above 65 degrees (her skin gets red and "mottled"; she becomes nauseated and disoriented; she gets headaches; recovery takes 2-3 days). Notably, the administrative judge found the appellant's witnesses to be honest and forthright in their testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant herself testified to her lengthy medical history, including the many and varied diagnoses she has received over the years she has struggled with her health. She explained that her heat intolerance and other conditions, with their accompanying symptoms, leave her exhausted and depressed. The administrative judge found the appellant to be credible. It is well established that subjective evidence, i.e., testimony or written statements regarding symptoms that is submitted by the applicant, "may be entitled to great weight on the matter of disability, especially where such evidence is uncontradicted by the record." <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 404, 422 (1981); <span class="Italic">see also Biscaha v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 304, 309 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record includes a job description for the appellant's position as Sales and Service Associate. It requires her to perform distribution and a variety of sales and customer support services for products, maintain pleasant and effective public relations with customers and others, and have a general familiarity with postal laws, regulations, and procedures commonly used. The appellant's duties are performed in a postal "store" at a retail window. Her numerous medical conditions, as attested to by the many physicians she has consulted, are inconsistent with carrying out such responsibilities, notably her documented inability to withstand temperatures over 65 degrees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Evidence from the appellant's supervisor corroborates her claim that she cannot perform her duties in that work environment. Her supervisor certified that she has been absent from work since August 2009. Although absences from work do not conclusively establish that an employee is incapable of rendering useful and efficient service, they are nonetheless a factor worthy of consideration in judging disability. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Moran v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 138, 142-43 (1996). In addition, the appellant's supervisor certified that the agency was unable to accommodate the appellant "due to operational paremeters [sic] concerning temperature."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant failed to show how her psychological condition precluded her from performing her duties or why her problems were not capable of being controlled with medication or therapy, suggesting that "[i]t would appear from the record that [the appellant] would benefit from such treatment." The administrative judge relied upon an October 2, 2008 clinical evaluation during which it was noted that the appellant "was at first not very happy with the idea of psychiatric referral." Dr. Mansheim, the psychiatrist to whom the appellant was referred, diagnosed her as suffering from dysthymic disorder, but recommended only that she change from Wellbutrin, two tablets per day, for depression, to the "once a day Wellbutrin," and stated that she was amenable to that change. Dr. Mansheim made no further recommendations. None of the many other physicians the appellant consulted has recommended that she undergo therapy. Thus, we <span class="Italic">see</span> no basis upon which to find that her failure to do so precludes her from receiving disability retirement. <span class="Italic">See Treziok</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 361, &#x00B6; 23.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we conclude that the appellant has shown that she cannot render useful and efficient service in her particular work environment, and that she has therefore met her burden of establishing an entitlement to disability retirement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alston v. OPM</span>, DE-844E-12-0276-I-1 (NP 6/14/2013) ("Thus, this not a case where the appellant's subjective evidence regarding his symptoms is entitled to great weight on the matter of disability because in this case the administrative judge found that the appellant was not credible. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Henderson v.

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Vanieken-Ryals v. OPM</span>, 508 F.3d 1034, 1036, 1038, 1040-44 (Fed. Cir. 2007), the Board's reviewing court provided a ringing rejection of MSPB and OPM analysis that essentially considered only objective evidence of disability:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Vanieken-Ryals claims complete disability due to several alleged psychological disorders, including major depression and anxiety disorder. The evidence she submitted to OPM to support her claim consisted of her own statements in addition to several letters, medical reports, and related documentation from her treating psychologist, Dr. Nichols, and treating psychiatrist, Dr. Rummler. Before the MSPB, Vanieken-Ryals additionally submitted testimony from herself and her husband, as well as testimony from Dr. Nichols. OPM offered no medical evidence countering Dr. Nichols' and Dr. Rummler's documents or testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both OPM and the MSPB gave no weight at all to Vanieken-Ryals' medical evidence and then found that she had failed to prove her disability. The MSPB also held that she had not "definitively exhausted" the possibility that the agency could accommodate her alleged disability. This holding was largely based on the MSPB's rejection of her medical evidence and its view that she had failed to prove any disability beyond an inability to work with her particular supervisor....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is telling that no authority whatsoever is cited by the MSPB or OPM, <span id="Page_1480"></span>in any of the three written decisions in this case, for the proposition that objective medical evidence is required to prove disability. No statute or applicable regulation of which we are aware imposes such a requirement. In fact, applicable law suggests the opposite rule. OPM's regulations define the type of "medical documentation" required to establish disability. Such evidence must come from "a licensed physician or other appropriate practitioner," it must "be justified according to established diagnostic criteria," and it must "not be inconsistent with generally accepted professional standards." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.104; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1202 (requiring medical evidence submitted to support an application for disability retirement to conform to the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.104). There is no hint of any objective/subjective distinction, and the regulation clearly indicates that any evidence--"subjective" or otherwise--utilizing "established diagnostic criteria" and consistent with "generally accepted professional standards" is eligible for consideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the MSPB has even precedentially ruled squarely against an objective evidence requirement. <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 404, 418-23 (1981) ("[The AJ] erred in assuming that appellant's claim for disability retirement benefits could not be granted if it was not proven by objective medical evidence."). While we are not bound by the MSPB's precedent, we agree with and accept the <span class="Italic">Chavez</span> holding on this issue. OPM must consider all of an applicant's competent medical evidence, and an applicant may prevail based on medical evidence that, as here, consists of a medical professional's conclusive diagnosis, even if based primarily on his/her analysis of the applicant's own descriptions of symptoms and other indicia of disability. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 423 ("Objective medical evidence, then, is but one of the elements of proof to be considered, along with expert opinion evidence and subjective evidence of pain and inability to work....").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, in <span class="Italic">Craig v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 449, 454-55 (2002), the MSPB held that the applicant satisfied her burden of proving her disability solely with medical evidence from a psychiatric social worker along with her own testimony. The social worker, a licensed mental health specialist, diagnosed her patient with multiple mental disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder and panic disorder. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 452. Much like in the instant case, the social worker's reports were solely based on information she heard or observed during therapy sessions after the applicant had already left the job that had precipitated her conditions. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Also like Dr. Nichols, the social worker in <span class="Italic">Craig</span> based her diagnosis on the guidelines in DSM-IV. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 455. There is no mention of any "objective" tests in <span class="Italic">Craig</span>; rather, the medical evidence there deemed highly probative was very similar to the medical evidence petitioner submitted here. The MSPB's total disregard of this evidence due to a lack of "objective" tests thus ignores its own precedents.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, subjective evidence--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, testimony or written statements--regarding symptoms that is submitted by the applicant "may be entitled to great weight on the matter of disability, especially where such evidence is uncontradicted in the record." <span class="Italic">Chavez</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. at 418-422; <span class="Italic">see also Biscaha v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 304, 309 (1991) ("An appellant's subjective evidence of pain must be considered seriously, where it is supported by competent medical evidence."). It stands to reason that qualified medical opinions based on the same types of information must therefore also be afforded at least comparable, if not greater, probative weight. While the ultimate determination of whether the evidence has satisfied the applicant's burden of proof rests first with OPM and then with the MSPB, we hold that it is legal error for either agency to reject submitted medical evidence as entitled to no probative weight at all solely because it lacks so-called "objective" measures such as laboratory tests.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The problem with a requirement of "objective" tests is particularly pronounced when, as here, the alleged disability arises from purely psychological, as opposed to physical, disorders. No laboratory tests or physical examinations exist, or are even known to be possible, to diagnose some psychological disorders. <span class="Italic">See Chavez</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. at 418. And the practice of psychologists often consists entirely of professional assessment of patient-reported symptoms and experiences. Thus, requiring objective medical evidence would often discriminate against those civil servants who suffer from legitimate, disabling psychological disorders.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Dr. Nichols submitted several reports in which she diagnosed Vanieken-Ryals with severe psychiatric conditions, recounting the symptoms and experiences reported by Vanieken-Ryals that formed the basis of her diagnosis. Inherent in these reports is her professional opinion that Vanieken-Ryals' account of these symptoms is credible, and that the symptoms reported are serious. And her professional opinion was supplemented and supported by the opinion of a second medical professional, psychiatrist Dr. Rummler, who concurred with Dr. Nichols' diagnosis and went further to prescribe medications, evidence of which was submitted to OPM. In cases involving psychological disability, such evidence is typically probative (though not necessarily dispositive). <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Craig</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. at 454-55 (crediting similar medical opinion testimony from a psychiatric social worker).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While OPM and the MSPB may give only limited weight to <span class="Italic">seem</span>ingly strong medical evidence such as this, it typically does so only in the face of factors such as doubts about professional competence, contrary medical evidence, failure of the professional to consider relevant factors, lack of particularity in relating diagnosis to nature and extent of disability, etc.[7] <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 686, 689-90 (1992) (comparing and weighing conflicting medical opinions on the basis of qualifications and competence); <span class="Italic">Bridges v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. 716, 719 (1984) (holding that the lack of contrary medical evidence lends weight to applicant's evidence); <span class="Italic">see also Chavez</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. at 423 (noting that "the qualifications of the expert" and "the extent and duration of the expert's familiarity with or treatment of the applicant's condition," among others, are important factors).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Our decision in <span class="Italic">Trevan v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 69 F.3d 520, 526-27 (Fed. Cir. 1995), is inapposite because in that case, we held that the MSPB and OPM did not err by relying on a lack of objective medical evidence supporting a claim of disability when "OPM has produced [objective] medical evidence [such as X-rays] that is inconsistent with subjective claims of disability." There, the MSPB essentially held that the applicant's lack of supporting objective medical evidence rendered his subjective evidence less probative than the contrary objective evidence submitted by OPM. Such a comparison, when subjective evidence is deemed to be less probative than contrary objective evidence, is certainly factual in nature, but that is not the situation here where the <span class="Italic">only</span> medical evidence is the so-called "subjective" evidence submitted by Vanieken-Ryals. And in <span class="Italic">Trevan</span>, we acknowledged that "objective medical evidence is not the only factor to be assessed in determining disability." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Chavez</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. at 419, 422).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But here, OPM did not express any doubt as to the credentials or veracity of Dr. Nichols or Dr. Rummler, and the <span class="Italic">only</span> medical evidence as to whether Vanieken-Ryals suffered from disabling psychological disorders were their reports and documentation.[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Vanieken-Ryals also submitted written statements in which she described her own symptoms and experiences such as, for example, her inability to maintain basic hygiene and panic attacks preventing her leaving her home. She also ultimately testified before the AJ on appeal to the MSPB, as did her husband who gave supporting testimony. Neither OPM nor the MSPB gave any indication that she or her husband was not a credible witness, and certainly no <span class="Italic">Hillen</span> analysis was conducted. <span class="Italic">See Hillen v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 453, 458 (1987). Nevertheless, OPM and the MSPB dismissed Vanieken-Ryals' symptoms and psychological reactions to her job as "situational," thus not serious or enduring enough to be disabling. While we have grave doubts about this characterization of her experiences given that her testimony was <span class="Italic">seem</span>ingly considered credible, we need not and do not address here whether OPM committed an error of law "going to the heart of the administrative determination" in its consideration of Vanieken-Ryals' own statements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM also did not make any findings that Dr. Nichols' or Dr. Rummler's reports did not utilize "established diagnostic criteria" or were "inconsistent with generally accepted professional standards." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.104. Nor were any such concerns raised by the MSPB in its review. And when, as here, the medical evidence indicates physical or mental incapacity so severe as to clearly establish an inability to perform the tasks of any job--such as inability to leave home, drive, or accomplish even basic life tasks--the medical evidence need not enumerate what specific job tasks are rendered unfeasible by the disability. <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 619, 627 (1996) (holding that a psychiatrist's assessment that his patient "was unable to leave her home, <span class="Italic">see</span> visitors, drive, and had great difficulty managing ordinary household tasks such as cooking and doing laundry" was sufficient to establish an incapacity to perform the duties of her job regardless of the specific tasks required). When weighing the probative value of medical evidence involves such a comprehensive and fact-intensive process, flatly refusing to consider such medical evidence simply for being "purely subjective" is a critical legal error and, at least in a case like this, clearly prejudicial.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is clear that both OPM and the MSPB committed this legal error. As already discussed, the decisions of both agencies included numerous statements evidencing a belief that Vanieken-Ryals' medical evidence should be afforded no probative weight at all due to the lack of "objective" evidence such as "formal cognitive testing." In addition, neither the MSPB nor OPM discussed the content of Dr. Nichols' or Dr. Rummler's evidence in any meaningful way, which further demonstrates that it was not properly considered. OPM, for example, resorted to a laundry list of "objective" tests and documents that the medical evidence did <span class="Italic">not</span> contain rather than examining the evidence and evaluating what it <span class="Italic">did</span> contain. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> This is precisely the type of "error going to the heart of the administrative determination," if not a "substantial departure from <span id="Page_1481"></span>important procedural rights," that the Supreme Court charged this court to guard against. <span class="Italic">See Lindahl</span>, 470 U.S. at 791.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we hold that OPM's and the MSPB's adherence to such a rule, unsupported in the law, was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law; thus this case must be remanded for proper consideration of Vanieken-Ryals' medical and other evidence. Further, since the MSPB's finding that reassignment possibilities had not been "definitively exhausted" was based in large part on its rejection of this evidence, that issue must also be revisited on remand.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that in its reconsideration of Mr. Crawley's claim, OPM gave "no weight" to the December 27, 2006 letter and the March 6, 2006 note because it concluded that Mr. Crawley "failed to provide sufficient objective medical evidence."

Office of Personnel Management</span>, 508 F.3d 1034, 1041 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Royster v. OPM</span>, 68 MSPR 655, 661 (1995), "subjective evidence of pain must establish the degree to which the pain can or cannot be controlled, and that the employee's condition negatively affects her ability to perform in her position." Decisions of other adjudicators, e.g., OWCP, may be entitled to probative weight. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Outlaw v.

<p class="Body-Text">To state that expert or other testimonial evidence carries weight in disability retirement cases does not exclude circumstantial evidence from Board consideration. Although "absences from work do not conclusively establish that an employee is incapable of rendering useful and efficient service, they are nonetheless a factor worthy of consideration in judging disability." <span class="Italic">Hupp v.

<p class="Body-Text">That OPM does not counter an appellant's evidence does not establish the appellant's right to a disability annuity; however, the lack of contravention may be considered by the AJ, <span class="Italic">Bridges v. OPM</span>, 21 MSPR 716, 719 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the evidence submitted by appellant, OPM did not conduct any medical or psychiatric examination. There is no evidence in the record to disprove or even counter the validity of appellant's evidence concerning his physical symptomatology or its effect on his ability to perform his duties. While not automatically establishing that appellant has met his burden under <span class="Italic">Chavez, supra</span>, the failure of OPM to present evidence to counter that of appellant is a factor for consideration. <span class="Italic">See Sullivan v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Reilly v. OPM</span>, 571 F.3d 1372, 1380-83 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (dismissed following remand based on OPM's grant of retirement application, <span class="Italic">Reilly v. OPM</span>, 113 MSPR 187, 2010 MSPB 22 (2010)), rejected the Board's rejection of post-retirement medical evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Reilly urges that the Board erred in categorically holding that post-resignation evidence of the applicant's condition should not be considered. The government conceded at oral argument that, if the Board had adopted such a categorical legal rule, it would be unlawful and within our jurisdiction to reverse. However, the government urges that the Board did not adopt such a rule. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be sure, we do not read the Board as suggesting that all medical opinions rendered post-retirement are inadmissible; indeed, the Board relied on the opinion of OPM's own expert medical doctor rendered post-retirement. What we understand the Board to be holding is that medical opinions rendered post-retirement are admissible only if they are based on pre-retirement tests, observations, interviews, and medical examinations, and address the employee's pre-retirement condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board clearly adopted a rule that post-resignation medical evidence is categorically irrelevant, and that it was legal error for the AJ to rely on such evidence. After very briefly reciting the post-resignation medical evidence, the Board stated that "[B]ecause all of this evidence post-dates the appellant's resignation, and does not address her condition at the time of her resignation, to the extent that the AJ relied on it to determine that the appellant was disabled, this was error." <span class="Italic">Reilly,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. at 364. The Board repeated this categorical exclusion in addressing the letter of August 2006 by the pulmonary specialist. The Board stated that "this letter post-dates the appellant's...resignation, and does not address her condition at the time of her resignation. We therefore
 do not find it persuasive on the issue of whether the appellant was disabled when she resigned." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 364-65.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board made no mention of how much (or how little) time had elapsed after resignation, nor addressed why, on these particular facts, evidence of the appellant's medical condition a few months after resignation was of no value in establishing the appellant's medical condition at the time of resignation. Instead, the Board categorically held that it is legal error to consider any evidence that is noncontemporaneous and does not explicitly refer back to the condition at the time of resignation. A subsequent decision of the Board supports this interpretation. In <span class="Italic">Luzi v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 79, 84 (2008), the Board cited Reilly as support for declining to consider any evidence that "post-dates the appellant's...separation, and does not address his condition [before separation]."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated previously, the government does not defend this rule. We cannot <span class="Italic">see</span> any basis for such a rule which contradicts the general rule that "OPM [and the Board] must consider all of an applicant's competent medical evidence." <span class="Italic">Vanieken-Ryals,</span> 508 F.3d at 1041.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no question that such evidence may be considered under general evidentiary principles. "Although the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply to Board hearings, they are a helpful guide to proper hearing practices." <span class="Italic">Yanopoulos v. Dep't of Navy,</span> 796 F.2d 468, 471 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (citation omitted). The rule is that "[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by [the Rules or other law]." Fed. R. Evid. 402; Unif. R. Evid. 402. Under the Uniform Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Evidence, "'Relevant evidence' means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence." Fed. R. Evid. 401; Unif. R. Evid. 401. "The provisions that all relevant evidence is admissible...are 'a presupposition involved in the very conception of a rational system of evidence.'" Advisory Committee Notes to Fed. R. Evid. 402 (quoting Thayer, <span class="Italic">Preliminary Treatise on Evidence</span> 264 (1898)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, it is established that "the tests of relevancy...are of the same general nature for retrospectant evidentiary facts." <span class="Italic">Wigmore on Evidence,</span> &#x00A7; 148 (4th ed. 1983). "[P]assage of time alone is insufficient to support an objection of remoteness." 31A C.J.S. <span class="Italic">Evidence</span> &#x00A7; 295 (2008). Remoteness is only established where the passage of time "undermin[es otherwise] reasonable inferences due to the likelihood of supervening factors." 1 <span class="Italic">McCormick on Evidence</span> &#x00A7; 185 (6th ed. 2006). The field of forensic medicine abounds with examples of subsequent medical examinations relevant to a prior condition. As a classic example, inferences about prior intoxication can be drawn from blood alcohol tests conducted at a later time. <span class="Italic">See</span> 1 <span class="Italic">McCormick on Evidence</span> &#x00A7; 205 (6th ed. 2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, although the regulatory scheme and standard on review are different in Social Security cases, the reasoning of these cases also provides support for the general principle that later medical evidence can be relevant. As the Fifth Circuit stated in <span class="Italic">Ivy v. Sullivan,</span> "noncontemporaneous medical records are relevant to the determination of whether onset occurred on the date alleged by the claimant.... Subsequent medical evidence is relevant because it may bear upon the severity of the claimant's condition before the expiration of his or her insured status." 898 F.2d 1045, 1049 (5th Cir. 1990) (citations and quotation marks omitted); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Basinger v. Heckler,</span> 725 F.2d 1166, 1169 (8th Cir. 1984). As stated by the Second Circuit:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We have observed, repeatedly, that evidence bearing upon an applicant's condition subsequent to the date upon which the earning requirement was last met is pertinent evidence in that it may disclose the severity and continuity of impairments existing before the earning requirement date or may identify additional impairments which could reasonably be presumed to have been present.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Pollard v. Halter,</span> 377 F.3d 183, 193-94 (2d Cir. 2004) (alterations omitted). Medical examinations identifying a disability are always retrospectant in some sense; as the Ninth Circuit observed, "[i]t is obvious that medical reports are inevitably rendered retrospectively and should not be disregarded solely on that basis." <span class="Italic">Smith v. Bowen,</span> 849 F.2d 1222, 1225 (9th Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1482"></span>Similarly, in military retirement cases this court's predecessor has held that subsequent medical evidence can be highly relevant to determining the prior medical condition. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Jordan v. United States,</span> 205 Ct. Cl. 65 (1974) (stressing "the importance...of considering the applicant's medical condition <span class="Italic">subsequent</span> to his discharge, and the professional evaluation and treatment thereof, in its determination of fitness for duty as of the date of discharge");<span class="Italic"> Beckham v. United States,</span> 392 F.2d 619, 625-26 (Ct. Cl. 1968) ("[w]e must look to manifestations of the disease or ailment appearing both before and after the point in time of separation" to determine fitness at the time of separation); <span class="Italic">see also Farrar v. United States,</span> 358 F.2d 965 (Ct. Cl. 1965).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nothing in the OPM regulations contradicts these general principles or specifies that the medical examination or documentation must have occurred prior to retirement. In fact, the regulations permit filing an application within one year after separation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1204, and explicitly countenance taking additional medical examinations during the pendency of the application to assist OPM in making a decision, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1206(c). OPM's standard form for doctor statements is also written in the present tense, and includes no question specifically asking what the applicant's medical condition was at the time of her separation from service. OPM Standard Form 2824C.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the Board erred in adopting a categorical rule barring consideration of post-retirement evidence. Where proximity in time, lay testimony, or some other evidence provides the requisite link to the relevant period the subsequent medical evidence can be very probative of a prior disability. This is not to say that a later medical condition will always be relevant or entitled to substantial weight. There are circumstances where such evidence is irrelevant or entitled to little weight as a factual matter, such as where the later medical condition is attributable to some incident that occurred after the period in question, or where there is a substantial lapse of time and a lack of evidence connecting the prior condition to the more recent medical evidence. However, it is equally clear that evidence of a later medical condition will not always be irrelevant. Here, for example, the specialist's examinations occurred within a few months of Reilly's retirement, and there was no suggestion of any event that would have caused Reilly's condition to deteriorate at an unusual rate. Also, lay testimony might establish the same symptoms and severity before retirement as was observed after retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board erred in categorically excluding post-resignation evidence. As in <span class="Italic">Vanieken-Ryals,</span> this legal error is a substantial departure from important procedural rights and goes to the heart of the administrative determination. 508 F.3d at 1043-44.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, this case must be remanded to the Board for further consideration based on the appropriate legal standard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Taylor v. OPM</span>, DA-844E-21-0056-I-1 (NP 6/15/2022) ("medical evidence that postdates a disability retirement applicant's separation may nevertheless be probative of prior disability where there is a proximity in time or other evidence that establishes a link to the relevant time period, as is the case here. <span class="Italic">Reilly v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 571 F.3d 1372, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2009).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cabanayan v. OPM</span>, 375 Fed. Appx. 6, 9 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP), remanded an appeal for proper evaluation of post-retirement medical evidence under the <span class="Italic">Reilly</span> analysis. The court noted that "[w]hile we recognize that, as the Government contends, there may be valid and permissible reasons for discounting Dr. Cheung's opinion, the administrative judge did not articulate any other reason for his failure to credit Dr. Cheung's testimony," and added:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Board applied an erroneous legal standard in assessing Cabanayan's medical evidence, we vacate the Board's decision and remand for reconsideration under the correct legal standard. <span class="Italic">See Vanieken-Ryals,</span> 508 F.3d at 1036. On remand, the Board should apply the standard detailed in our recent decision in <span class="Italic">Reilly II</span>. Specifically, the Board must consider all competent medical evidence, including post-retirement medical evidence, and may not reject such evidence solely because it is based on post-retirement examinations or observations. <span class="Italic">Reilly II,</span> 571 F.3d at 1381-82. Of course, as we recognized in <span class="Italic">Reilly II,</span> such post-retirement medical evidence may be irrelevant or entitled to little weight based on the factual circumstances, "such as where the later medical condition is attributable to some incident that occurred after the period in question, or where there is a substantial lapse of time and a lack of evidence connecting the prior condition to the more recent medical evidence." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1382. Based on this standard, the Board must, in the first instance, consider the relevance and probative value of the proffered medical evidence.</p>
