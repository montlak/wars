<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-54"><span class="space">1.</span> Articulation of the Need for Information; Countervailing Interests</h4>
<p class="noindent">Describing what constitutes information that is "necessary" within the meaning of 5 USC 7114(b)(4), FLRA addressed a union's request for disclosure of a performance appraisal in <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU Chap. 66</span>, 50 FLRA 661, 661-62, 666-73 (1995) (<span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span>). Not at issue in <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span> were the Privacy Act implications of the information request. FLRA provided its analysis and analytical test for "necessity," and, as it did so, it explained that the "particularized need" test would be applied whether or not the information requested by the union involved intramanagement guidance; that is, the test would be applied to all information requests: a union requesting information establishes a particularized need for the information by specifically articulating why it needs the requested information, including the uses for the information and the connection between those uses and the union's representational responsibilities. The need is not satisfied only by showing that requested information is or would be relevant or useful to a union. Instead, a union must establish that requested information is required in order for the union to adequately represent its members. The union must explain its interests in disclosure of the information. Satisfying that burden requires more than a conclusory or bare assertion. A request for information must be sufficient to permit an agency to make a reasoned judgment as to whether information must be disclosed under the Statute, although the request need not be so specific as to require a union to reveal its strategies or compromise the identity of potential grievants who wish anonymity. The degree of specificity required of a union must take into account the fact that, in many cases, a union will not be aware of the contents of a requested document:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complaint alleges that the Respondents violated section 7116(a)(1), (5), and (8) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute) by refusing to provide the Charging Parties with certain information requested under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. For the following reasons, we conclude that the Respondents violated the Statute, as alleged in the complaint. In so doing, we set forth the approach to determine whether the requested information is necessary, within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In this regard, in <span class="Italic">National Park Service</span> [48 FLRA 1151 (1993)], the Authority held that, in determining whether a union has demonstrated that information involving guidance, advice, counsel, or training for management officials ("intramanagement guidance") is necessary, within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute, the Authority will follow the approach set forth in <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 523 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>). The case now before the Authority presents the first opportunity since <span class="Italic">National Park Service</span> to consider its application to other types of information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span> and its progeny, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit established the analysis it will apply to determine whether the release of information requested by a union under section 7114(b)(4) is "necessary for full and proper discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining." [9] Under the D.C. Circuit's approach, a union requesting information under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute is required "to demonstrate a 'particularized need' for information it seeks[.]" <span class="Italic">Allenwood Prison Camp v. FLRA</span>, 988 F.2d at 1270. In determining whether information must be disclosed under that section, "the Authority must consider 1) the union's particularized need for the requested information sought..., and 2) the countervailing anti-disclosure interests of the agency[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court held that the Authority is required to "weigh the particularized need...for the information against the agency's interest in withholding it...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1271.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;It is well-established that the statutory reference to the "discussion, understanding and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining" encompasses more than the process of negotiating a collective bargaining agreement<span class="Italic">. E.g., NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d at 526 ("It is undisputed that the agency's duty to furnish information under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) extends to contract administration as well as contract negotiations."); <span class="Italic">Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, <span class="Italic">San Francisco, California</span>, 40 FLRA 1116, 1121 (1991) ("[T]he duty to provide information 'must be evaluated in the context of the <span class="Italic">full range</span> of union responsibilities in both the negotiation and the administration of a labor agreement.'") (emphasis in original; citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although initially set forth by the D.C. Circuit in a case involving intramanagement guidance, <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, that court has applied this approach to other types of documents as well. <span class="Italic">E.g., VA v. FLRA</span>, 1 F.3d at 23 (request for minutes of certain meetings); <span class="Italic">Allenwood Prison Camp v. FLRA</span> (request for crediting plans). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has stated its agreement with the D.C. Circuit. <span class="Italic">Department of Justice v. FLRA</span>, 991 F.2d 285, 291 n.3 (5th Cir. 1993) (<span class="Italic">dictum</span>) (<span class="Italic">Justice v. FLRA</span>) (in reviewing an Authority decision requiring the disclosure of, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, documents comprising the work products of certain employees, the court stated both that the Authority had erred by requiring disclosure of information that was merely relevant to a union and that it agreed with the D.C. Circuit that, under section 7114(b)(4), "the necessity standard 'implicitly recognizes countervailing interests....'"). In addition, antidisclosure interests are also considered relevant in interpreting the duty to provide information imposed on an employer by section 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 158(a)(5)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In asserting that the Authority should not extend the <span class="Italic">National Park Service</span> approach to information other than intramanagement guidance, the General Counsel and a number of <span class="Italic">amici</span> express concern that doing so may result in undue limitations on the disclosure of information. It is clear, in this regard, that the purpose of section 7114(b)(4) is to provide unions with access to information that is necessary for them to provide effective representation to employees in their bargaining units. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1345 v. FLRA</span>, 793 F.2d 1360, 1364 (D.C. Cir. 1986) ("The Union cannot fulfill its obligation to fully represent all employees in the unit if it lacks information necessary to assess its representational responsibilities."). Moreover, we are mindful that Congress specifically found that labor organizations and collective bargaining in the Federal service are in the public interest and that the statutory protection of employees' rights to organize, bargain collectively, and participate through labor organizations in decisions that affect them: (1) safeguards the public interest; (2) contributes to the effective conduct of public business; and (3) facilitates and encourages the amicable settlement of disputes between employees and their employers involving conditions of employment. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101. <span class="Italic">See also FAA</span>, 50 FLRA at 344 ("The ability to exchange information is central to the labor-management relationship.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we are not persuaded that Congress' intent regarding the exchange of information necessary for effective representation would be best served by establishing differing approaches under section 7114(b)(4)(B) based upon the type of information requested. Moreover, we find no basis in the text of section 7114(b)(4), its legislative history, or other authority for applying different analytic approaches to determine the necessity of different types of documents. Further, the courts have applied a "unitary" approach without regard to the type of documents requested. <span class="Italic">Allenwood Prison</span> <span class="Italic">Camp v. FLRA</span>, 988 F.2d at 1270. To do otherwise would cause confusion and thereby inevitably delay the exchange of information necessary to effective labor-management relations. In contrast, we believe that establishing a consistent approach that clarifies the burdens placed on both parties in requesting and responding to requests for information under section 7114(b)(4) will serve to reduce confusion and expedite the exchange of information. <span id="Page_299"></span>Accordingly, to effectuate the purposes of the Statute, we will apply the same approach whether or not the information request involves intramanagement guidance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We hold that, in determining whether and how requested information must be disclosed under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute, we will consider both parties' interests consistent with the aforementioned judicial decisions construing section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute and private sector labor law. Specifically, a union requesting information under that section must establish a particularized need for the information by articulating, with specificity, why it needs the requested information, including the uses to which the union will put the information and the connection between those uses and the union's representational responsibilities under the Statute.[11] The requirement that a union establish such need will not be satisfied merely by showing that requested information is or would be relevant or useful to a union. Instead, a union must establish that requested information is "required in order for the union adequately to represent its members." <span class="Italic">Justice v. FLRA</span>, 991 F.2d at 290.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;To avoid further confusion, <span class="Italic">see</span> note 8, we use the term "particularized need" here, consistent with its use in <span class="Italic">VA v. FLRA</span> and <span class="Italic">Allenwood Prison Camp v. FLRA</span>, to describe the union's showing rather than a heightened level of need required for certain documents.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union is responsible for articulating and explaining its interests in disclosure of the information.&#x2003;Satisfying this burden requires more than a conclusory or bare assertion. Among other things, a request for information must be sufficient to permit an agency to make a reasoned judgment as to whether information must be disclosed under the Statute.[13]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;However, a request need not be so specific as, for example, to require a union to reveal its strategies or compromise the identity of potential grievants who wish anonymity. <span class="Italic">See, for example, NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d at 530 ("Necessarily, the bargainers are not obliged to reveal their strategies[.]"); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. FLRA</span>, 811 F.2d 769, 774 (2d Cir. 1987) (court acknowledged that protecting the identity of potential grievants is a justifiable union consideration). Moreover, the degree of specificity required of a union must take into account the fact that, in many cases, including the one now before us, a union will not be aware of the contents of a requested document.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">National Park Service</span>, the Authority accepted the D.C. Circuit's view, <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d at 532, that an agency has presumptive anti-disclosure interests in intramanagement guidance documents. <span class="Italic">National Park Service</span>, 48 FLRA at 1160. We agree with the General Counsel that this presumption should not extend to other types of documents because we find no statutory basis for doing so. An agency denying a request for information under section 7114(b)(4) must assert and establish any countervailing anti-disclosure interests. Like a union, an agency may not satisfy its burden by making conclusory or bare assertions; its burden extends beyond simply saying "no."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that applying a standard which requires parties to articulate and exchange their respective interests in disclosing information serves several important purposes.&#x2003;It "facilitates and encourages the amicable settlements of disputes..." and, thereby, effectuates the purposes and policies of the Statute. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(a)(1)(C). It also facilitates the exchange of information, with the result that both parties' abilities to effectively and timely discharge their collective bargaining responsibilities under the Statute are enhanced. In addition, it permits the parties to consider and, as appropriate, accommodate their respective interests and attempt to reach agreement on the extent to which requested information is disclosed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where parties are unable to agree on whether or to what extent requested information must be provided, an unfair labor practice will be found if a union has established a particularized need, as defined herein, for the requested information and either: (1) the agency has not established a countervailing interest; or (2) the agency has established such an interest but it does not outweigh the union's demonstration of particularized need. We expect the parties to consider, as we will in determining whether and/or how disclosure is required, alternative forms or means of disclosure that may satisfy both a union's information needs and an agency's interests in information. <span class="Italic">Cf. Detroit Edison</span>, 440 U.S. at 301 (Court concluded that employer's "willingness to disclose" requested information in manner other than that requested by the union "satisfied its statutory obligations."). Moreover, we emphasize that considering the agency's countervailing interests in this way is not intended to impose an insurmountable burden on a party requesting information.[14]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[14]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, the court held that documents "that are strictly 'intramanagement' normally will not be discoverable" under section 7114(b)(4). 952 F.2d at 533 n.6. However, the court set forth two examples of instances where a union could establish that even management guidance, advice, counsel, or training was necessary, within the meaning of the Statute. In particular, the court held that a union may establish such necessity "where the union has a grievable complaint covering the information[&#8197;]" and/or where "the disputed document creates a grievable action<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 532, 533 (emphasis omitted). The court noted that documents encompassed by the examples would not be "strictly 'intramanagement'...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 533 n.7. In <span class="Italic">National Park Service</span>, 48 FLRA at 1165 n.13, the Authority found it unnecessary to address what bases other than the two examples offered by the court might support a finding that intramanagement guidance documents are necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Application of Analytic Approach</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Union requested Long's appraisal to assist in processing a grievance alleging that Stevens' appraisal was issued in reprisal for her Union activity. In particular, the Union alleged that Stevens "had been treated inequitably in the evaluation of her performance." The Union argued that a "comparison" of Stevens' and Long's appraisals was necessary for the Union to determine whether and how to pursue the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Long and Stevens occupy the same position, and their work as Incentive Pay Coordinators is appraised based on the same elements and performance standards. Further, Long and Stevens are the only employees at the Kansas City Service Center who occupy the position of Incentive Pay Coordinator. Moreover, although Stevens was at all relevant times a unit employee who engaged in protected Union activity, Long was a nonunit employee prior to her appointment as Incentive Pay Coordinator and, following her appointment, was designated as the management representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, it is clear that, in connection with the processing of a grievance contesting Stevens' performance appraisal on the basis of, among other things, Stevens' Union activity, the Union has strong pro-disclosure interests in Long's appraisal. Indeed, disclosure of Long's appraisal appears vital to the Union's ability to make an informed judgment as to the merits of Stevens' grievance. In this regard, the Union already "has evidence of the actual tasks performance and output produced by the two Incentive Pay Coordinators[.]" However, without the ability to compare their performance ratings and the written reasons therefor, the Union will be unable to effectively evaluate whether the Respondent applied Stevens' and Long's performance standards and elements without regard to unit status.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, here the Respondents assert no specific anti-disclosure interests. Instead, the Respondents challenge whether the document will provide a "meaningful basis of comparison" to Stevens' ratings. Having examined [<span class="Italic">in camera</span>] Long's appraisal, we are unable to conclude that the appraisal is so meaningless that it cannot be found "necessary," within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4). The clear references in the appraisal to Long's performance as an Incentive Pay Coordinator persuade us to reject the Respondents' assertion that it could not "be used by any party to effectively fulfill representational duties." [16] Moreover, even assuming there is merit in the Respondents' assertion that the appraisal will not establish that Stevens was improperly appraised, it would not be determinative of whether the appraisal is necessary under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Cf. National Labor Relations Board v. Acme Industrial Co.</span>, 385 U.S. 432, 438 (1967) (in upholding NLRB order that employer provide information for union to evaluate grievances, Court stated that when the employer "furnishes the requested information, it may appear...that the grievances filed are without merit.").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[16]&#x2003;In reaching our conclusion, it is unnecessary to determine and accordingly we do not reach the issue whether the appraisal, if admitted into evidence at an arbitration hearing, would prove the allegations in Stevens' grievance. Indeed, it could be found necessary even if, on review, the Charging Parties decided that Stevens' grievance lacked merit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In summary, after considering the Respondents' arguments challenging the Charging Parties' asserted pro-disclosure interests, we conclude that a particularized need has been established for the requested appraisal. The Respondents have not asserted any anti-disclosure interests in the document. Accordingly, we find that the appraisal is necessary, within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Summarizing <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span>, FLRA concluded that the union did not demonstrate the necessity for documents requested of the employer in <span class="Italic">EEOC and Nat'l Council of EEOC Locals No. 216</span>, 51 FLRA 248, 256-58 (1995):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Recently, the Authority issued <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. and Internal Revenue Service, Kansas City Service Center, Kansas City, Missouri</span>, 50 FLRA 661 (1995) (Member Talkin concurring) (<span class="Italic">IRS Kansas City</span>), which set forth the analysis for determining whether information is "necessary" under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. We held that a union making a request under that section must establish a particularized need for the requested information by articulating, with specificity, why it needs that information, including the uses to which the information will be put, and the connection between those uses and the union's <span id="Page_300"></span>representational responsibilities under the Statute. We also stated that a union's need will not be satisfied merely by showing that requested information is or would be relevant or useful, but that the union must demonstrate that the information is "'required in order for the union adequately to represent its members.'" 50 FLRA at 670 (quoting <span class="Italic">Department of Justice v. FLRA</span>, 991 F.2d 285, 290 (5th Cir. 1993)). The union's responsibility for articulating and explaining its interests extends to more than a conclusory or bare assertion; among other things, the request for information must be sufficient to permit an agency to make a reasoned judgment as to whether the information must be disclosed under the Statute. As for the agency's responsibilities, we stated that when it denies an information request, the agency must assert and establish any countervailing anti-disclosure interests. The agency will not satisfy its burden by making conclusory or bare assertions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the parties are unable to agree on whether, or to what extent, requested information must be provided, we will find an unfair labor practice if a union has established a particularized need for the information and either: (1) the agency has not established a countervailing interest; or (2) the agency has established such an interest but it does not outweigh the union's demonstration of particularized need.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the analytic framework of <span class="Italic">IRS Kansas City</span>, we find that the Union has not satisfied its burden of demonstrating that the information requested in categories 2, 3, 4 and 6 is required for it to adequately represent its members. At the time of its information requests, the Union stated that it needed the information to prepare for a potential grievance and/or third party proceedings. The record demonstrates that at the time of the Union's requests, or shortly thereafter, grievances were filed. The Respondent provided the requested information with respect to the named grievants and, in addition, provided "comparators." The Respondent asked the Union to clarify why it needed the remaining information but the Union did not offer any clarification. Under these circumstances, we find that it was incumbent on the Union to explain why it needed such information, the uses to which the information would be put, and the connection between those uses and the Union's responsibilities. This it failed to do. The Judge's statement that the information was "clearly relevant" to the Union's evaluation of the challenged ratings...does not persuade us that the Union has satisfied its burdens, particularly in view of the fact that a showing of relevance is insufficient to establish a particularized need.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More specifically, with regard to information described in category 2--"case management and assignment system sheets"--the Union advanced no reasons at all to explain why it needed that particular information and how it would assist the Union's representational responsibilities concerning the grievants. The same is true with regard to the information in categories 3 and 4--"charges assigned" and "charges closed." Although at the hearing the General Counsel asserted that the complexity of each type of case should be taken into account in appraising employee performance, this reason was not communicated to the Respondent at a time when it reasonably could have assessed the necessity for the information. As to the remaining information sought in category 6--"all criteria used to evaluate employees"--the Union did not even explain what it sought, despite the Respondent's attempts to obtain some further amplification from the Union. It is simply impossible to ascertain the Union's needs, given these facts. In sum, we conclude that the Union has not satisfied its burden of articulating and establishing, with specificity, why it needed the information, the uses to which the information would be put, and the connection between those uses and the Union's representational responsibilities under the Statute. As such, we conclude that the information requested in categories 2, 3, 4 and 6 is not necessary within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to articulation of countervailing interests, under <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Ray Brook and AFGE Local 3882</span>, 68 FLRA 492, 496-97 (2015), the agency's duty of particularization parallels the union's:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that the Judge erred in concluding that it had not established a countervailing anti-disclosure interest. Specifically, the Agency claims that it informed the Union on September 9, in response to the first information request, that it could not disclose the information until it completed an administrative investigation, and that it referenced that response on October 6 and again on October 12. The Agency notes that it denied the Union's request to review the SIS report because the Agency was planning to prosecute the inmate, and then repeated that same explanation for its refusal to provide the security footage in its October 6 and October 12 denials.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency denying a request for information under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) must assert and establish any countervailing anti-disclosure interests.[50] "Like a union, an agency may not satisfy its burden by making conclusory or bare assertions; its burden extends beyond simply saying 'no.'"[51] An agency must raise its anti-disclosure interests "at or near the time it denies the union's request."[52]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[50] <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 50 FLRA at 670.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[51] <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[52] <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. DOJ, Fed. BOP, Fed. Corr. Inst., Fort Dix, N.J</span>., 64 FLRA 106, 109 (2009) (<span class="Italic">Ft. Dix</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">Houston</span>, 60 FLRA at 93).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Judge determined that the Agency's purported anti-disclosure interest--its plan to prosecute the inmate--was "conclusory" and applied only to the Union's requests for the security footage. Even assuming that the Agency's explanation--that it was planning to prosecute the inmate--extends to all of the information covered by the Union's request, we find that this explanation is insufficient to establish a countervailing anti-disclosure interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency did not explain how releasing the information would interfere with its plans to prosecute the inmate or identify what information would jeopardize those plans; nor did the Agency suggest when, if ever, it would be able to provide the requested information. Thus, the Agency's explanation did not aid the Union in identifying "alternative forms or means of disclosure that may satisfy both [the U]nion's information needs and [the A]gency's interests."[54] Even assuming that the claimed countervailing interest was raised in response to the Union's request, it is not sufficient to outweigh the Union's demonstration of a particularized need for the information.[55]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[54] <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 50 FLRA at 671.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[55] <span class="Italic">See Houston</span>, 60 FLRA at 94.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency argues that FOIA Exemption 7(e) permitted it to withhold the information. However, the Authority has consistently held that an agency must raise any anti-disclosure interests "at or near the time it denies the union's request." The mere fact that an anti-disclosure interest is also reflected as an exemption from mandatory disclosure under FOIA does not relieve an agency of this burden. Here, the Judge found, and the record reflects, that the Agency did not raise the security interests protected by Exemption 7(e) when it denied the Union's information request.</p>
