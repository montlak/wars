<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-127"><span class="space">a.</span> Procedural Arbitrability; Missteps in Grievance and Arbitration Process</h5>
<p class="noindent">The 2018 decision <span class="Italic">SBA and AFGE Local 3841</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v70/70-107.html">70 FLRA 525</a>, 526-29 (2018) (Member DuBester concurring in part and dissenting in part) (recon. den.<span class="Italic"> SBA and AFGE Local 3841</span>, 70 FLRA 988 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting)), reflecting a change in FLRA membership, reversed doctrine and announced that the "essence" exception may challenge an award that resolves a procedural arbitrability issue--in <span class="Italic">SBA</span>, the timeliness of a request for an FMCS panel of arbitrators:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the Arbitrator's procedural-arbitrability determinations--that the grievance was procedurally arbitrable[7] and that the Agency waived the right to contest the timeliness of the Union's submission[8]--fail to draw their essence from the parties' agreement. We believe that this case presents an appropriate opportunity to reexamine the Authority's approach to reviewing such contentions.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1242, Council of Prison Locals 33</span>, 62 FLRA 477, 479 (2008) (an arbitrator's determination regarding the timeliness of a grievance constitutes a determination regarding the procedural arbitrability of that grievance (citation omitted)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See U.S. DHS, U.S. CBP, Border Patrol, San Diego Sector, San Diego, Cal.</span>, 68 FLRA 128, 131 (2014) (DHS) (an arbitrator's finding that a party has waived its challenge to a procedural-arbitrability determination is itself a procedural-arbitrability determination (citation omitted)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Procedural arbitrability involves "procedural questions, such as whether the preliminary steps of the grievance procedure have been exhausted or excused."[10] The Authority has found that essence challenges to procedural-arbitrability determinations provide no basis for finding an award deficient.[11] However, that is inconsistent with the practice of federal courts. Specifically, federal courts have applied the essence standard to review essence challenges to procedural-arbitrability determinations.[12] To the extent that the Authority's existing precedent is based on an interpretation of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">John Wiley &#x0026; Sons, Inc. v. Livingston</span>,[13] that interpretation is incorrect. In <span class="Italic">Wiley</span>, the Court addressed only who--arbitrators or courts--<span class="Italic">initially</span> decides questions of procedural arbitrability,[14] not whether courts can review essence challenges to procedural-arbitrability determinations once the arbitrator has made them.</p>

Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc</span>., 537 U.S. 79, 84 (2002) (noting that procedural-arbitrability issues include "allegation[s] of waiver, delay, or a like defense to arbitrability") (citation omitted)).</p>

Consequently, we will no longer follow Authority decisions holding otherwise.[16]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency contends that the award fails to draw its essence from the plain wording of Sections 1 and 2, and other provisions of the parties' agreement. In particular, the Agency argues that the Arbitrator erred by finding that the grievance was procedurally arbitrable and that the Agency waived its right to contest the timeliness of the Union's submission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority will find that an arbitration award is deficient as failing to draw its essence from a collective-bargaining agreement when the excepting party establishes that the award: (1) cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; (2) is so unfounded in reason and fact and so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the agreement as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator; (3) does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement; or (4) evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement.[19] The Authority has found that an award fails to draw its essence from a collective-bargaining agreement where the award conflicts with the agreement's plain wording.[20]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Section 1 clearly and unambiguously requires the party that invokes arbitration to "strictly observe[&#8197;]" Section 2's fourteen-day time limit for submitting the FMCS form to the opposing party. And, as the Agency points out, Article 39, Section 6.a.1. of the parties' agreement provides that a failure "to adhere to the time limitations...<span class="Italic">at any step</span> of the [grievance] procedure <span class="Italic">shall result in cancellation of the grievance</span>." The Arbitrator--despite repeatedly recognizing that the Union submission was untimely under Section 2--did not find that the Union's failure to comply with the contractual time limit resulted in the cancellation of the grievance. Thus, his determination that the grievance was procedurally arbitrable conflicts with the plain wording of the parties' agreement.[25]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[25]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Tinker</span>, 48 FLRA at 348 (finding that an award evidenced a manifest disregard of an agreement where the arbitrator's interpretation was "not compatible with" the "plain wording" of that agreement).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, nothing in the agreement provides for "waive[r]" in the event that the Agency fails to give the Union advance notice of an argument that it plans to raise at arbitration. Yet the Arbitrator found that the Agency waived the right to contest the timeliness of the Union's submission by failing to provide such notice. While the Agency did fail to forward a copy of the altered FMCS form to the Union as Section 2 requires, the Union should have known that its submission--which was more than six months late--was untimely. Because the Arbitrator's waiver determination has no basis in the parties' agreement, it does not represent a plausible interpretation of that agreement.[32]</p>

Section 7703(c) sets forth the standard of review that the Federal Circuit applies to Merit Systems Protection Board decisions. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c).

But here, the Arbitrator did not find, and nothing in the record indicates, that the Union was prejudiced by the timing of the Agency's objection to the Union's untimely submission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Arbitrator's procedural-arbitrability determinations evidence a manifest disregard of, and do not represent a plausible interpretation of, the parties' agreement.[33] Accordingly, we find that the award fails to draw its essence from the agreement.</p>

<p class="noindent">The 2018 <span class="Italic">SBA</span> decision, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, also determined that "plain and unambiguous" contract language governing procedural requirements cannot be overcome by past practice, 70 FLRA 528-29:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the Arbitrator found, in the alternative, that "[e]ven if" the Agency had objected to the timeliness of the Union's submission before the hearing, the grievance was procedurally arbitrable because the parties had a practice that allowed the Union not to "strict[ly] compl[y] with the time limit[s]" contained in Section 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator erred by relying on the parties' past practice instead of the "clearly define[d]" provisions of their agreement. The Authority has held that it is appropriate for arbitrators to find that a past practice has modified the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement.[38] However, the Authority has also acknowledged that judicial decisions "are mixed" on that issue.[39] And, on reexamination, we find that certain concerns specific to the federal sector support reversing our existing precedent and holding that arbitrators may not modify the plain and unambiguous provisions of an agreement based on parties' past practices.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">First, we believe that such a rule best serves the statutory policy of providing parties "with stability and repose with respect to [the] matters [that they have] reduced to writing."[40] That stability is undermined when arbitrators are able to modify the clear terms of a bargained-for agreement. By contrast, precluding arbitrators from engaging in such modification enables parties to rely on the negotiated terms of their agreements.[41]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Second, &#x00A7; 7114(c) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute)[42] provides for the submission of collective-bargaining agreements to the agency head for review.[43] But past practices are not subject to that review process.[44] Therefore, finding that an arbitrator may rely on a past practice to effectively create a new contract provision is in tension with &#x00A7; 7114(c) of the Statute.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">With these considerations in mind, we now reconsider Authority precedent and find that arbitrators may not look beyond a collective-bargaining agreement--to extraneous considerations such as past practice--to modify an agreement's clear and unambiguous terms.[45] And we will no longer follow Authority precedent holding otherwise.[46]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, the award is inconsistent with the plain terms of the parties' agreement. And, for the reasons set forth above, we find that the Arbitrator's alternative rationale--that the parties modified the clear and unambiguous terms of their agreement by past practice--cannot provide a basis for the award. Therefore, the award is deficient,[48] and we set it aside. Consequently, we find it unnecessary to resolve the Agency's remaining exceptions.</p>

<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 70 FLRA 806, 806-11 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting) failure to timely request arbitration established a jurisdictional defect. <span class="Italic">IRS</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">DODEA and FEA</span>, 70 FLRA 937, 938 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting), involving an untimely grievance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we explained in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, when parties agree to a filing deadline--with no mention of any applicable exception--the parties intend to be bound by that deadline.[13] Here, applying Article 12, Section 5.C. of the agreement, the Union had forty-five days to file a grievance challenging the Agency's August 2013 memo. But, the Union did not file its grievance until September 2015--two years after the parties' filing deadline.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;70 FLRA 806, 808 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator cited no authority or contractual language allowing him to disregard the parties' explicit forty-five-day limitation. As the Agency points out, Article 12 contains no deadline for raising challenges to the timeliness of a grievance. Moreover, the Arbitrator's summary explanation that the Agency's conduct "constitutes an abuse of the grievance/arbitration process" is also without support or merit. The Arbitrator does not explain how the Agency's decision to raise its timeliness issue at arbitration prejudiced the Union, is contrary to the parties' negotiated grievance procedure, or is otherwise barred.[17]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[17]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See SBA</span>, 70 FLRA at 527-28 (rejecting an arbitrator's unsupported waiver determination that had no basis in the parties' agreement).</p>

<p class="noindent">An award setting aside a disciplinary suspension was in turn set aside because the union failed to provide a contractually-required notice of intent to invoke arbitration when it requested and obtained an FMCS panel of arbitrators, <span class="Italic">DHUD and AFGE Local 3972</span>, 72 FLRA 450, 451-52 (2021) (Chairman DuBester dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Article 52 states that the party invoking arbitration "shall notify the other party of its submission of a matter to arbitration by giving written notice." Article 52 requires that this "notice shall identify the specific grievance, suspension of [fourteen] days or less, adverse action or unacceptable performance action involved and the designated representative(s) who shall handle the case." It further states that the "party[ ] invoking arbitration shall submit the request for arbitrators to FMCS or another mutually agreed upon source of arbitrators with the Notice of Invocation of Arbitration."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union requested a panel of arbitrators by submitting a form to FMCS, and an Agency representative acknowledged that she received the FMCS form. However, as the Union admits, it did not include "document[ation] independent of the [FMCS] form to serve as 'Notice of Invocation of Arbitration.'" Although one of the Agency representatives "reference[d]...[the] receipt" of the FMCS form as the requisite notice, that Agency representative was denying a different Union grievance when he characterized the FMCS form in that manner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, it is undisputed that the Union did not submit a separate "Notice of Invocation of Arbitration" "with" the FMCS form, as required by Article 52. As Article 52 does not contain any language excusing the Union's noncompliance,[27] we find that the award conflicts with the plain wording of Article 52.[28]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[27]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Army, 93rd Signal Brigade, Fort Eustis, Va.</span>, 70 FLRA 733, 734 (2018) (<span class="Italic">Fort Eustis</span>) (then-Member DuBester dissenting) (setting aside the arbitrator's procedural-arbitrability determination because nothing "excuse[d] the [u]nion's non-compliance with the negotiated grievance procedure").

The dissent notes that the parties' agreement does not contain language that would "result in cancellation of a grievance" if the Union failed to abide by the agreed-upon procedures. Dissent at 8. However, the Authority has never required the parties' agreement to have a cancellation provision in order to find a grievance procedurally inarbitrable. <span class="Italic">See Talladega</span>, 71 FLRA at 1147 n.15; <span class="Italic">e.g., Fort Eustis</span>, 70 FLRA at 734. </p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further conclude that the Arbitrator erred by relying on an alleged past practice. The Authority has found that arbitrators may not look beyond a collective-bargaining agreement--to extraneous considerations such as past practice--to modify an agreement's clear and unambiguous terms.[30] Although the Arbitrator determined that Article 52 was ambiguous, he created this so-called ambiguity by finding that Article 52's reference to a "Notice of Invocation [of] Arbitration" could only be interpreted as requiring the creation of a form. But Article 52 makes no reference to a form. It simply states that the party invoking arbitration must give "written notice," and it specifies the requirements necessary for that notice. Therefore, the Arbitrator erred in relying on past practice to modify Article 52's clear and unambiguous terms.[35]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">Such procedural defects, unless clearly harmful to resolution of the merits, should be resolved against forfeiture of the right to process a grievance. Strict construction of procedural requirements in arbitration, in this case making them even more rigid than in board proceedings, could only chill the selection of arbitration over the selection of administrative review. That result would be inconsistent with the statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e), which is designed to give eligible employees the free choice between appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board and what should be the more informal arbitration procedure.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Further, a premature request for arbitration being effective appears to be consistent with the parties' past practices. The agency had not objected in at least three other arbitrations where the union invoked arbitration prematurely, and, as noted earlier, had waited over three years to object to the union doing so here. Nonetheless, since this issue has not been addressed by the arbitrator, we think that the arbitrator should address it in the first instance. On remand, the arbitrator is not, of course, bound to follow FLRA decisions that have held such premature requests for arbitration ineffective. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Def.

<p class="noindent">Submission of an arbitration request to the wrong management representative resulted in an award being set aside under the "essence" exception in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft.

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we determine that an Arbitrator may not assume jurisdiction over the merits of a grievance when the party invoking arbitration fails to comply with procedural requirements specifically enumerated in the parties' negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In particular, the parties' agreement specifies that any invocation of arbitration must be sent to the Brigade Commander within ten days after receiving the Agency's final decision on the grievance. Despite this clear provision, the Union delivered its invocation of arbitration to the Civilian Personnel Advisory Council (CPAC) rather than the Brigade Commander.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator determined that the Union did not comply with that provision and thus violated the parties' agreement. Nonetheless, the Arbitrator proceeded to review and make a determination on the merits of the grievance. We set aside the award because it does not draw its essence from the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background and Arbitrator's Award</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">An intern successfully completed an Agency intern program and was placed in a general schedule position.&#x2003;The Union filed a grievance challenging the Agency's noncompetitive placement of the intern. The parties were unable to resolve the grievance. On September 23, 2016, the Union invoked arbitration and delivered its invocation to the CPAC. The invocation did not reach the Brigade Commander until October 27, 2016.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before the Arbitrator, the Agency argued that the grievance was not arbitrable because the Union failed to deliver its "request" to the Brigade Commander within ten working days, as required by Article 45 of the parties' agreement. As pertinent here, Article 45 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The request to invoke arbitration must be in writing and <span class="Italic">must be received by the Brigade Commander</span>...within ten (10) work days of the date of receipt of the final grievance decision or conclusion of the grievance mediation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator issued her award on May 17, 2017. The Arbitrator found that it was undisputed that the Union delivered its "request" to the CPAC, instead of the Brigade Commander, on September 23, 2016. The Arbitrator noted that Article 45 required such requests to be received by the Brigade Commander within ten working days. Thus, the Arbitrator concluded that "delivery to CPAC was non[-]compliant." However, the Arbitrator also noted that the Union argued that it was the normal course of business to not deliver these requests directly to the Brigade Commander, and that no evidence was supplied to contradict the Union. Therefore, the Arbitrator proceeded to address the merits of the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the merits, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated the parties' agreement by noncompetitively placing the intern into a position that was not yet vacant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency filed exceptions on June 19, 2017, and the Union filed an opposition on June 29, 2017.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusion: The procedural-arbitrability determination fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the Arbitrator's procedural-arbitrability determination fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement. Specifically, the Agency argues that Article 45 of the agreement establishes that the Brigade Commander is the sole designee to receive these requests, and the Union failed to deliver its request to the Brigade Commander within the required ten working days.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 45 clearly and unambiguously requires that arbitration requests "<span class="Italic">must be received by the Brigade Commander</span>...within ten (10) work days of the date of receipt of the final grievance or conclusion of the grievance mediation." Article 45 does not contain any language that either allows the CPAC to receive arbitration requests, or excuses the Union's noncompliance with the negotiated grievance procedure. Rather, Article 45 establishes that the Brigade Commander is the exclusive Agency representative to receive arbitration requests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's determination that the grievance was arbitrable is incompatible with the plain wording of Article 45. Further, as the Authority recently held, "arbitrators may not look beyond a collective-bargaining agreement--to extraneous considerations such as past practice--to modify an agreement's clear and unambiguous terms."[10] Thus, the Arbitrator could not rely on the parties' alleged' "normal course of business" to modify Article 45's plain wording. For these reasons, the Arbitrator's procedural-arbitrability determination fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement.[12] Accordingly, we set aside the award, and find it unnecessary to address[13] the Agency's remaining exceptions.</p>

Here, it is undisputed that the Union filed its grievance with the human&#8209;resources department. Additionally, it is undisputed that the chief executive officer of the institution is the Warden, and the Warden disciplines the employee who schedules employees' duty&#8209;free lunch. In the context of these undisputed circumstances, the parties' agreement is clear and unambiguous--the grievance must be filed with the Warden.[13]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Even though the Arbitrator found that the Union should have filed the grievance with the Warden, he determined the grievance was arbitrable because the Union's "technical violation" was "substantively harmless." However, the parties' agreement does not excuse the Union's noncompliance with Article 31,[15] nor does it allow for the Arbitrator to excuse the Union's violation based on whether it "impair[ed] the Agency's ability to present its case" or was otherwise "substantively harmless."[16] And the Arbitrator did not cite contractual language allowing him to disregard the procedural requirements in Article 31 because "the Agency eventually knew the substance of the grievance."[17] By finding the grievance arbitrable,[18] the Arbitrator impermissibly modified the parties' agreement by creating a "substantively harmless" exception to the arbitrability requirements of the parties' negotiated grievance procedure.[19] Thus, the Arbitrator relied on extraneous considerations and ignored the plain wording of Article 31.[20]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;CBA at 147 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's determination that the grievance was arbitrable is incompatible with the plain wording of Article 28.[8] The Arbitrator noted that in the past the parties cooperated in scheduling hearings, so the Union did not bear the sole responsibility of scheduling the hearing. However, the Authority has recently held that, "arbitrators may not look beyond a collective-bargaining agreement--to extraneous considerations such as past practice--to modify an agreement's clear and unambiguous terms."[10] Thus, the Arbitrator erred when he relied on purported past practice to modify Article 28's plain wording.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See IRS</span>, 70 FLRA at 808 (ignoring the plain wording of a deadline for invoking arbitration evidenced a manifest disregard of the agreement); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, 93rd Signal Brigade, Fort Eustis, Va</span>., 70 FLRA 733, 734 (2018) (Member DuBester, dissenting); <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 70 FLRA 227, 229 (2017) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Okla. City Air Logistics Command, Tinker Air Force Base, Okla</span>., 48 FLRA 342, 348 (1993) (finding award deficient because the arbitrator's interpretation of the parties' agreement was incompatible with its plain wording)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">SBA</span>, 70 FLRA at 528. We note the Arbitrator found instructive a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, <span class="Italic">Muller v. GPO</span>, 809 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (finding noncompliance with an agreement's four-month deadline to hold arbitration hearing did not require dismissal of grievance because parties' past practice had modified terms of their agreement). However, that decision--involving the arbitration of an adverse action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 and the interpretation of a different collective-bargaining agreement--is not controlling here. Moreover, the Arbitrator even acknowledged that <span class="Italic">Muller</span> is "distinguishable" because, unlike here, the provision at issue in <span class="Italic">Muller</span> did not state the consequences for failing to meet the hearing-scheduling deadline. Award at 26; <span class="Italic">see Muller</span>, 809 F.3d at 1380 (relying in part on the contractual provision's failure to "stipulate[&#8197;] any consequences for the union or the agency in the event of noncompliance with these deadlines").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, because the Arbitrator failed to enforce the plain wording of the parties' agreed-to filing timeframe, the award manifests a disregard of the parties' agreement. Therefore, we grant the Agency's essence exception and vacate the award.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, OCC and NTEU</span>, 71 FLRA 387, 388-89 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting in part), followed the same reasoning as to an arbitration not conducted within the contractual time limit:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 28 states that "any requested arbitration that has not been scheduled for hearing within six months will be deemed to be moot and will be considered withdrawn." It does not provide for any type of excuse. Even the Arbitrator found that this language is clear and unambiguous and that if she adhered to it, she would find the matter to be moot and withdrawn. The undisputed facts reflect that no hearing was scheduled within six months. Therefore, the Arbitrator's conclusions that the 2014 grievance was not moot and that the Agency waived its right to challenge arbitrability by waiting seven months to raise the issue--even though the CBA imposes no timeframe for such a challenge[16]--are not plausible interpretations of the agreement.[17] Further, the Arbitrator's reliance on the Agency's history of not challenging arbitrability in similar cases runs counter to our precedent wherein we have held that past practices may not modify an agreement's clear and unambiguous wording.[19]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[16]&#x2003;We note that the dissent glosses over this key point, and ignores the plain language of Article 28, to conclude that the Arbitrator's procedural-arbitrability determination is a plausible interpretation of Article 28. While an arbitrator's determination on procedural-arbitrability is generally entitled to some level of deference, an arbitrator is not free to simply conjure up a new requirement that the parties never negotiated into their agreement. Here, the parties specifically agreed that an arbitration must be scheduled within six months. The parties also agreed, in the same article, that the arbitrator could determine arbitrability. However, the parties did not negotiate any requirement concerning when either party must raise an issue (as many other parties include in their agreements). If the parties had wanted to impose such a requirement, it must be presumed that they would have done so. Therefore, when the arbitrator determined that the six-month language was "clear and unambiguous" and that if she adhered to it, she would find the matter to be "moot," she was interpreting the contract. Award at 16. However, when she concluded that the Agency "waived its right" to challenge arbitrability, she was adding a new requirement to the agreement that the parties never negotiated. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 17.

See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a)(2). Under this standard, the Authority will find that an arbitration award is deficient as failing to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement when the appealing party establishes that the award: (1) cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; (2) is so unfounded in reason and fact and so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the collective bargaining agreement as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator; (3) does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement; or (4) evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement<span class="Italic">.
