<p class="Body-Text">The administrative exhaustion requirements for VEOA claims are directed by 5 USC 3330a:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Preference eligibles; administrative redress</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)(1)(A)&#x2003; A preference eligible who alleges that an agency has violated such individual's rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; A veteran described in section 3304(f)(1) who alleges that an agency has violated such section with respect to such veteran may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)(A)&#x2003; A complaint under this subsection must be filed within 60 days after the date of the alleged violation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; Such complaint shall be in writing, be in such form as the Secretary may prescribe, specify the agency against which the complaint is filed, and contain a summary of the allegations that form the basis for the complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)(1)&#x2003; The Secretary of Labor shall investigate each complaint under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)(1)(A)&#x2003; If the Secretary of Labor determines as a result of an investigation under subsection (b) that the action alleged in a complaint under subsection (a) occurred, the Secretary shall attempt to resolve the complaint by making reasonable efforts to ensure that the agency specified in the complaint complies with applicable provisions of statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;If the efforts of the Secretary under subsection (b) with respect to a complaint under subsection (a) do not result in the resolution of the complaint, the Secretary shall notify the person who submitted the complaint, in writing, of the results of the Secretary's investigation under subsection (b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)(1)&#x2003; If the Secretary of Labor is unable to resolve a complaint under subsection (a) within 60 days after the date on which it is filed, the complainant may elect to appeal the alleged violation to the Merit Systems Protection Board in accordance with such procedures as the Merit Systems Protection Board shall prescribe, except that in no event may any such appeal be brought--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; before the 61st day after the date on which the complaint is filed; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; later than 15 days after the date on which the complainant receives written notification from the Secretary under subsection (c)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;An appeal under this subsection may not be brought unless--</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Timely filing with the Department of Labor is a statutory requirement for a VEOA Board appeal, <span class="Italic">Dean v. MSPB</span>, 566 Fed. Appx. 944, 946 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But in order to establish Board jurisdiction over a VEOA appeal, the appellant must, among other things, show that he exhausted his remedy with the DOL. <span class="Italic">E.g., Lazaro v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 666 F.3d 1316, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2012); <span class="Italic">Waddell v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 411, 414 (2003) ("The statute plainly includes a requirement that, before filing a Board appeal, an appellant must exhaust his DoL remedy. The need to show exhaustion of that remedy is therefore a jurisdictional element of a VEOA appeal."). The appellant must make that showing by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Forest v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 47 F.3d 409, 410 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Finally, "[w]hether the board had jurisdiction to adjudicate a case is a question of law, which we review <span class="Italic">de novo</span>." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The time limit for initiation of the VEOA complaint process ordinarily runs from the date of the violation rather than from its discovery, <span class="Italic">Oram v. MSPB</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the discovery rule, the Board correctly focused on the language of the statute, which expressly keys the sixty-day time rule to the date of the alleged violation, not the date upon which the alleged violation was discovered by a complainant. In <span class="Italic">Rotkiske v. Klemm</span>, the Supreme Court explained that the discovery rule comes in two iterations. __ U.S. __, 140 S. Ct. 355, 360 (2019).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, as a matter of statutory interpretation, a court looks to the relevant statute to determine whether, for the specified filing time, Congress has triggered the start of the filing time from the date of an alleged violation of law, or from the date of discovery of the alleged violation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If Congress has unambiguously identified the trigger date as the date of the alleged violation of law, there is no room for the discovery rule to operate. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 360-61. The VEOA unambiguously triggers the running of the sixty-day filing time from the date of the alleged violation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(A) ("A complaint under this subsection must be filed within 60 days <span class="Italic">after the date of the alleged violation</span>." (emphasis added)). Mr. Oram gains no benefit from this iteration of the discovery rule.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, when a complainant has been fraudulently induced to miss a required time deadline, a separate and distinct equitable, fraud-specific discovery rule may excuse failure to meet a required time deadline. <span class="Italic">Rotkiske</span>, __ U.S. at __, 140 S. Ct. at 361. This iteration of the discovery rule traces from <span class="Italic">Bailey v.

Ct. at 361. Because Mr. Oram did not argue at the Board, or in his brief here, for relief under the fraud-specific discovery rule, the issue is not before us, and he cannot rely on this doctrine to excuse his otherwise untimely filing. And even if the issue were before us, Mr. Oram cites to no evidence in the record that would support a claim that the Agency fraudulently induced Mr. Oram to miss his filing deadline at the Department of Labor.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McAfee v. SSA</span>, 88 MSPR 4, 7-8 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-11 (2001), outlined exhaustion of administrative remedies and the timing of VEOA appeals:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual who believes that his veterans' preference rights in federal employment have been violated may appeal to the Board, provided that he first files a complaint with DoL and exhausts his remedy there. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a), (d)(1). An appeal to the Board may not be brought any earlier than 61 days from the date the complaint is filed with DoL, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1)(A), or any "later than 15 days after the date on which the complainant receives written notification from [DoL] " of the results of DoL's investigation, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the appellant that the AJ erred in finding that he does not have veterans' preference. The AJ appears to have based her finding on the fact that the appellant served in the military for only 2 years and 11 days. Section 2 of VEOA provides that "[p]reference eligibles or veterans who have been separated from the armed services under honorable conditions after "3 years or more of active service" may not be denied a chance to "compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its workforce under merit promotion procedures." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). Contrary to the AJ's apparent interpretation of this provision, section 2 of VEOA did not restrict preference-eligibility to those with at least 3 years of military service; rather, the plain language of section 2 of VEDA conferred a right to compete for certain vacancies on preference eligible veterans and certain non-preference-eligible veterans, without modifying the longstanding definition of "preference eligible" at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The unrebutted evidence of record shows that the appellant meets this longstanding definition. He served on active duty in the armed forces, was honorably discharged, and has a service-connected disability for which he receives compensation under a public statute administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. He is thus a "disabled veteran," <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(2), bringing him within the coverage of the definition of "preference eligible" at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3)(C).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, the appellant has not shown error in the AJ's determination that he filed this appeal beyond the 15-day deadline at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1)(B), and we AFFIRM her dismissal of the VEOA matter on that basis....</p>

Cir. 2011 NP)), involving either notice to the appellant from DOL of the results of its investigation, or evidence that the appellant notified the Labor Secretary of his intent to appeal to the Board if DOL did not resolve the complaint within 60 days:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's authority to adjudicate a VEOA appeal derives from 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d). Congress conditioned the Board's jurisdiction to adjudicate a VEOA appeal under that section upon the appellant having first exhausted his administrative remedy with DOL. The exhaustion requirement is satisfied where the appellant filed a complaint with DOL and either (1) DOL sent the appellant written notification of the results of its investigation of the complaint, or (2) DOL did not resolve the complaint within 60 days and the appellant notified the Secretary of Labor of his intention to appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">Becker v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 327, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 11 (2007); <span class="Italic">Styslinger v.

Where the Secretary of Labor has not resolved the complaint within 60 days, an appeal to the Board under VEOA "may not be brought unless...the complainant first provides written notification to the Secretary of such complainant's intention to bring such appeal" and provides the Board with evidence of compliance with this statutory requirement. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(2); <span class="Italic">Becker</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 327, &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.23(a)(5)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant exhausted his administrative remedy with DOL merely on the basis that he filed a complaint with DOL. As explained above, the appellant must also establish either that DOL notified him in writing of the results of its investigation, or that 60 days elapsed since the filing of the complaint and he notified the Secretary of Labor in writing of his intention to file the Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See Becker</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 327, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 11. The record below did not contain evidence that DOL provided the appellant written notification of the results of its investigation, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.23(a)(5)(i), and although it appears that more than 60 days had elapsed between the time the appellant filed his DOL complaint and the time he filed his Board appeal, the record did not contain evidence that the appellant notified the Secretary of Labor in writing of his intention to file the instant appeal, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.23(a)(5)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, after the appellant filed his petition for review, the Clerk of the Board issued a show cause order notifying the appellant that the jurisdictional issue remained unresolved, informing him of the additional steps that he must take to prove that he exhausted his administrative remedy with DOL, and directing him to file evidence and argument on the issue. The appellant responded, again asserting that he filed a complaint with DOL, and that he appealed to the Board only after DOL did not resolve the complaint within 60 days. However, as explained above, and as explained to the appellant in the show cause order, more is required to establish that he exhausted his administrative remedy. Because the appellant has not established that DOL sent him written notification of the results of its investigation or that he notified the Secretary of Labor of his intention to appeal to the Board, the appellant has not shown that he exhausted his administrative remedy with DOL.</p>

Dr. Midyett has failed to produce any evidence tending to show that he submitted a statement to the DOL of an intent to appeal to the Board or that the DOL provided written notice of the results of its investigation.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The email from the DOL to Mr. Asatov bore none of the earmarks of a formal resolution of a complaint. It did not assign a case number, did not inform Mr. Asatov of appeal options, and did not address either the timeliness of Mr. Asatov's claims or his argument for equitable tolling. By contrast, the formal letter that VETS sent to Mr. Asatov one month later associated his claim with a case number, was sent by certified mail on VETS letterhead, and informed him of his right to file a Board appeal if he was dissatisfied with DOL's response. The letter also expressly declined to waive the untimeliness of Mr. Asatov's complaint....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Proper evidence of DOL exhaustion is required. The statement of appellant's counsel concerning DOL review is insufficient under <span class="Italic">Dambra v. DHHS</span>, DA-3330-21-0393-I-1 (NP 8/1/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As applicable here, to establish Board jurisdiction over a VEOA appeal, an appellant must (1) prove by preponderant evidence that he exhausted his remedy with DOL, and (2) make nonfrivolous allegations that: (i) he is a preference eligible within the meaning of VEOA, (ii) the action at issue took place on or after the date that VEOA was enacted, and (iii) the agency violated his rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a), (d); <span class="Italic">Lazaro v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to prove that he exhausted his administrative remedy. We agree. The first step of the exhaustion process is to file a complaint with DOL containing a summary of the allegations that form the basis of the complaint. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(B); <span class="Italic">Wible v. Department of the Army</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 333, &#x00B6; 10 (2013). After filing that complaint, an appellant may fulfill his exhaustion obligation by one of two means. The first occurs when DOL's investigation into the complaint does not result in the resolution of the complaint, and DOL notifies the complainant, in writing, of the results of its investigation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(c)(2); <span class="Italic">Styslinger v. Department of the Army</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 223, &#x00B6; 15 (2007). The second occurs when DOL is unable to resolve a complaint within 60 days after the date on which it was filed. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1); <span class="Italic">Styslinger</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 223, &#x00B6; 15. After 60 days have passed without a resolution of the complaint, the complainant may elect to appeal the alleged violation to the Board, but he must first notify DOL of his intention to file a Board appeal. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d); <span class="Italic">Styslinger</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 223, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-19; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.21(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to satisfy the exhaustion requirement because fewer than 61 days had passed since he filed his complaint, and he provided no evidence that DOL had closed his complaint. On petition for review, the appellant argues, through his attorney, that the exhaustion process is now complete and the appeal is ripe for adjudication because DOL has provided him written notice that it was unable to resolve his complaint and has closed its investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will adjudicate a VEOA appeal that was not ripe when filed but becomes ripe during the pendency of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Bent v. Department of State</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 304, &#x00B6; 6 (2016); <span class="Italic">Wooten v. Department of Veterans <span id="Page_615"></span>Affairs</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6; 9 (2004). However, the record in this case still lacks evidence upon which the Board could base a finding that the process before DOL has been exhausted. The appellant has filed neither a copy of the alleged DOL notification nor a sworn statement that he received such notification. The statements of a party's representative in a pleading do not constitute evidence. <span class="Italic">Pupis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 5 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Acknowledging that the record does not contain a copy of a DOL closeout notification, the appellant argues variously that the Board should take official notice of the notification, the administrative judge should have obtained a copy of the notification from DOL, and the agency should have obtained a copy of the notification from DOL. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.64, the Board may take official notice of matters of common knowledge or matters that can be verified. However, DOL's investigation of the appellant's complaint is not a matter of common knowledge, and the Board does not have ready access to DOL's investigatory records such that it can verify the disposition of the appellant's complaint. Furthermore, the burden of proof on jurisdiction belongs to the appellant. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.57(b)-(c). It is not the responsibility of the administrative judge or the respondent agency to provide evidence of jurisdiction on the appellant's behalf, particularly in cases like this one in which the appellant is in a better position than the agency to provide the relevant evidence. <span class="Italic">Cf. Ellis v. Department of the Navy</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 102, 107 (1994) (considering the fact that pertinent evidence regarding the jurisdictional issue was likely to be in possession and control of the agency as favoring a finding of Board jurisdiction). For these reasons, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant has not submitted any evidence to show that the exhaustion process is complete under the first method described in <span class="Italic">Styslinger</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 223, &#x00B6; 15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor has the appellant submitted any evidence to show that he exhausted his administrative remedy with respect to the second method described in <span class="Italic">Styslinger</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 223, &#x00B6; 15. Although more than 60 days have now passed since the appellant filed his complaint with DOL, he has not provided evidence or even alleged that he notified DOL of his intention to file a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See Becker v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 29, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge further found that, even if the appellant had completed the exhaustion process, he still failed to establish jurisdiction because he submitted no evidence to show that he completed it with respect to the specific nonselections at issue in this appeal. The appellant does not contest this finding on review, and we agree with the administrative judge's assessment. Proof of exhaustion requires, at a minimum, a showing that the DOL complaint concerns the same agency action or decision at issue in the Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See White v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 574, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the exhaustion requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d) is a prudential rule that does not limit the Board's subject matter jurisdiction. The Board, however, has already addressed this issue in adopting its current regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.57, and we decline to revisit it in the context of the instant appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> Practices &#x0026; Procedures, 80 Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's arguments in his petition pertain solely to the AJ's finding that the Board lacks jurisdiction to review his claim under the VEOA. Under the terms of the statute, however, a complainant may only bring a Board appeal either after 60 days have passed since a complaint was filed with the Secretary of Labor, or within 15 days of the date the complainant receives written notification from DOL that it has been unable to resolve his complaint. 38 USC &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1). The statute contains no provision for waiver of these requirements. Since the appellant admits that he did not file a complaint with the DOL, we agree with the AJ that the Board has no jurisdiction over this appeal under the VEOA, and we DENY the petition for review.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In light of this disposition, we need not address the appellant's assertion that he is covered by the statute because he is entitled to veterans' preference. We also note that the nonselection that is the subject of this appeal occurred on August 13, 1998, while the VEOA went into effect on October 31, 1998. <span class="Italic">See</span> Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-339, 112 Stat. 3182. Again, however, because we have found that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's VEOA appeal, we need not reach the question of whether the administrative redress provisions in the statute were intended to be retroactive.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fahrenbacher v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 85 MSPR 500, 509-10 &#x00B6; 17 (2000), again emphasized the importance of the statutory exhaustion scheme:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants argued that the agency had an obligation under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 302.101(c) to apply the principles of veterans preference in filling excepted service positions. We make no finding as to the agency's compliance with this regulation or any statutory veterans preference provision. At the time that the agency filled the position, the Board lacked jurisdiction over such matters. Subsequently, Congress granted such jurisdiction to the Board by enacting the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998, 5 USC &#x00A7; 3330a, effective October 31, 1998. The statute provides that preference-eligible individuals seeking redress must first file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor within 60 days of the violation. If the Secretary is unable to resolve the complaint within 60 days, the individual may then appeal to the Board. The record does not indicate that the appellants brought complaints to the Secretary of Labor under this statutory provision, although appellant Sheehan filed a complaint under USERRA. Thus, they have not shown that the Board has jurisdiction to address this issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The VEOA complaint to the Secretary of Labor must be in writing, <span class="Italic">Sears v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 86 MSPR 76, 78-79 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-7 (2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant claims that the administrative judge erred in denying him a hearing on the merits because he had filed a claim with the Department of Labor as required by the VEOA. He claims that by contacting an employee with the Department of Labor's Veterans' Employment and Training Services, he had filed a complaint with the Department of Labor as required by 5 USC &#x00A7; 3330a(a). Section 3330a states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)(1)A preference eligible who alleges that an agency has violated such individual's rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The record does not contain any evidence of a written complaint filed with the Department of Labor concerning the appellant's termination, nor does the appellant assert that he filed a written complaint with the Department of Labor about his termination. Thus, the appellant has not filed a complaint with the Secretary of Labor as required by the VEOA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A preference eligible cannot appeal to the Board until the 61st day after he has filed his complaint with the Department of Labor or within 15 days of receiving notification from the Department of Labor that it cannot resolve the complaint. 5 USC &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the department within DOL which handles VEOA complaints is the Veterans' Employment and Training Service (DOL VETS). Because this information is publicly available on DOL's official website, <a href="https://www.dol.gov/elaws/vetspref.htm">www.dol.gov/elaws/vetspref.htm</a> [now at <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/vets">https://www.dol.gov/agencies/vets</a>], we take official notice that DOL VETS handles VEOA complaints. <span class="Italic">Perkins v.

We note that DOL's response did not come from a DOL VETS office, but rather it is addressed from the "Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, we conclude that, even though the appellant wrote a letter to DOL to express her concerns with the hiring process, she has not established that she filed a VEOA complaint with DOL. Accordingly, we find that the appellant has failed to meet VEOA's requirement that she exhausted the DOL complaint procedure.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In a case in which the Secretary of Labor has notified a complainant, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(c)(2), that the Secretary's efforts have not resulted in the resolution of the complaint, the fact that the complainant did not notify the Secretary of his intent to file a Board appeal does not deprive the Board of jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the administrative judge dismissed the appellant's appeal for lack of jurisdiction on other grounds, he did not address the agency's argument that the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal because the appellant failed to notify the Secretary of Labor of his intent to file an appeal with the Board as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(2). However, as discussed below, we reject the administrative judge's reasoning for dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction on the basis that the appellant is not preference eligible. Therefore, we will also address the agency's argument that the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal due to the appellant's failure to notify the Secretary of Labor of his intent to file this appeal with the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the VEOA, there are two means by which an appellant may exhaust the administrative process before the Secretary of Labor for the purposes of filing an appeal with the Board. The first occurs when the Secretary's investigation into the complaint does not result in the resolution of the complaint, and the Secretary notifies the complainant, in writing, of the results of the Secretary's investigation.[7] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(c)(2). The second occurs when the Secretary is unable to resolve a complaint within 60 days after the date on which it was filed. After 60 days have passed without a resolution of the complaint, the complainant may elect to appeal the alleged violation to the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1). The statute provides, however, "that in no event may any such appeal be brought--(A) before the 61st day after the date on which the complaint is filed; or (B) later than 15 days after the date on which the complainant receives written notification from the Secretary under subsection (c)(2)." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Subsection (d)(2) then provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An appeal under this subsection may not be brought unless--(A) the complainant first provides written notification to the Secretary of such complainant's intention to bring such appeal; and (B) appropriate evidence of compliance with subparagraph (A) is included (in such form and manner as the Merit Systems Protection Board may prescribe) with the notice of appeal under this subsection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Subsection (c)(1) provides that, if the Secretary determines as the result of her investigation into a complaint that preponderant evidence establishes that "the action alleged in a complaint under subsection (a) occurred, the Secretary shall attempt to resolve the complaint by making reasonable efforts to ensure that the agency specified in the complaint complies with applicable provisions of statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(c)(1)(A). Thus, the VEOA requires the Secretary to investigate complaints and, upon conclusion of her investigation, to attempt to resolve complaints that the Secretary determines are meritorious.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(2). The basis for providing the Secretary of Labor with notice of the complainant's intent to file an appeal with the Board is explained by the presence of subsection (d)(3), which provides, "Upon receiving notification under subparagraph (2)(A), the Secretary shall not continue to investigate or further attempt to resolve the complaint to which the notification relates." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(3). Thus, the complainant's notification of his intent to file an appeal with the Board serves as a means of notifying the Secretary of Labor that she should cease any effort to investigate or resolve the appellant's complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board regulations prescribing the form and manner of the evidence necessary to establish that the complainant has complied with this notification requirement provide that VEOA appeals must include evidence that the Secretary has notified the appellant pursuant to subsection (c)(2) that the Secretary's efforts have not resolved the complaint <span class="Italic">or</span> evidence that the appellant has provided the Secretary with written notification as required by subsection (d)(2). 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.23(a)(5) (emphasis added). Thus, the Board's regulations do not require an appellant to provide evidence that he has notified the Secretary of his intention to file a Board appeal where the Secretary provided notice to the appellant under subsection (c)(2) that her investigation had been unable to resolve the complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When read in isolation, subsection (d)(2) appears to support the agency's argument that the Board may not exercise jurisdiction over any appeal where an appellant has not notified the Secretary of Labor of his intention to file such appeal because the language of subsection (d)(2) does not distinguish between appeals filed when the Secretary has been unable to resolve the complaint within 60 days and appeals filed after the Secretary has informed the complainant that her investigation has not resolved the appellant's complaint. However, in construing statutes, their provisions should not be read in isolation; rather, "each section of a statute should be construed in connection with every other section so as to produce a harmonious whole." <span class="Italic">King v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 22, 29 (1996) (citing 1A Norman J. Singer, <span class="Italic">Sutherland Statutory Construction</span> &#x00A7; 46.05 (5th ed. 1993)). Furthermore, it is well settled that the provisions of a unified statutory scheme should be read in harmony, leaving no provision inoperative or superfluous. <span class="Italic">See Holley v. United States</span>, 124 F.3d 1462, 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Finally, we note that, like the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (codified at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4301-4333) (USERRA) and the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA), the VEOA is a remedial statute, and as such, it should be broadly construed in favor of those whom it was intended to protect. <span class="Italic">See Young v. Federal Mediation &#x0026; Conciliation Service</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 99, &#x00B6; 6 (2002) (citing the legislative history of the VEOA for the proposition that it was intended to be a "user-friendly, yet effective" redress mechanism for the violation of veterans' preference rights), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 66 Fed. Appx. 858 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Rusin v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 298, &#x00B6; 17 (2002) (because the WPA is a remedial statute intended to improve protections for federal employees, it should be broadly construed in favor of those whom it was intended to protect).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VEOA provides that the Secretary of Labor will provide notice to a complainant under subsection (c)(2) "[i]f the efforts of the Secretary...do not result in the resolution of the complaint." However, the Secretary is not in a position to know whether her efforts will result in resolution of the complaint until she completes her investigation under subsection (b) and determines one of the following: (1) that the complaint has no merit, in which case the Secretary has no obligation to attempt to ensure that the agency complies with the applicable provisions of the statute or regulation at issue in the complaint, or (2) that the complaint has merit, but her efforts to ensure that the agency specified in the complaint complies with the applicable statute or regulation have been unsuccessful. Thus, there is no basis for the Secretary to issue the complainant a notice under subsection (c)(2) until the Secretary has completed her investigation under subsection (b) and exhausted any attempt to ensure agency compliance under subsection (c)(1). Accordingly, in a case in which a complainant receives notification from the Secretary under subsection (c)(2), the Secretary will have already completed both her investigation and her efforts to resolve the complaint. Thus, in such a case, notice of the complainant's intent to file an appeal required by subsection (d)(2) would be superfluous for the purpose of notifying the Secretary that she should cease these activities with respect to the complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that interpreting the statute to require a complainant who has received a notification under subsection (c)(2) to notify the Secretary of his intention to file a Board appeal as required by subsection (d)(2) would be inconsistent with a harmonious reading of the statute as a whole and with the remedial nature of the VEOA. Therefore, we reject the agency's argument that the statute precludes the Board from exercising jurisdiction over a VEOA appeal in which an appellant who has received a notice from the Secretary under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(c)(2) fails to submit evidence that he notified the Secretary of his intention to file a VEOA appeal with the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">VEOA does not contemplate Board jurisdiction over an appeal claiming that DOL or OSC's investigation of a VEOA complaint was inadequate. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Searcy v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues that he filed a complaint with DOL and did not receive a response, and thus he exhausted his remedy with DOL.[2] However, while 60 days have now elapsed since the appellant's July 12, 2017 submission to DOL, the appellant has not alleged that he provided written notification to the Secretary of Labor of his intent to file a Board appeal nor does he submit evidence of such notification.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The cases that contemplate such a scenario are distinguishable from the instant facts because here there is no allegation that DOL affirmatively took action to advise the appellant that DOL did not have jurisdiction over his complaint, directed him to file his appeal directly with the Board, or refused to address his complaint due to a separate pending Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See Morris v. Department of the Army</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 304, &#x00B6; 10 (2010) (finding the appellant exhausted the DOL complaint process when DOL refused to address his VEOA complaint and advised him that the complaint did not fall within its jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Thompson v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gingery v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 403 Fed. Appx. 498, 502-03 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP), implied that the DOL exhaustion requirement applies to each position sought and each claimed VEOA violation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Gingery also argues that the Board erred in dismissing his claim that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights by using the FCIP to fill the September 2008 vacancy in Pontiac, Michigan. In particular, Mr. Gingery asserts that the Board improperly interpreted the law to require him to exhaust his administrative remedies as to each individual vacancy announcement. He further argues that the 2008 FCIP hire, even if made under a separate vacancy announcement, nevertheless filled the same position (Internal Revenue Agent) at the same location (Pontiac, Michigan) specified by Mr. Gingery in his DOL complaint concerning the 5T11 announcement. Thus, he contends, he has sufficiently exhausted his administrative remedies as to his FCIP claim. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VEOA requires an individual to exhaust his administrative remedies with the DOL before filing an appeal with the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d); <span class="Italic">see Waddell v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 411, 414 (2003). In cases of nonselection under the VEOA, the Board typically determines whether an appellant has exhausted his remedies with the DOL based on whether the appellant submitted a complaint to the DOL "asserting that the agency violated his rights in connection with a specific position or vacancy announcement." <span class="Italic">Wheeler v. Dep't of Def.</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 376, 380 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even when a complaint refers to a specific position or vacancy announcement, it may nevertheless be insufficient to constitute exhaustion as to particular claims if the complaint does not adequately set forth the basis for those claims, so that the DOL can undertake an appropriate investigation. As this court has held in the analogous context of whistleblowing claims, exhaustion requires that an appellant "inform the [reviewing agency] of the precise ground of his charge" and provide it with "sufficient basis to pursue an investigation which might have led to corrective action." <span class="Italic">Briley v. Nat'l Archives &#x0026; Records Admin.</span>, 236 F.3d 1373, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2001), <span class="Italic">quoting</span> <span class="Italic">Ward v. Merit Sys. Prot.

Cir. 1996) (no Board jurisdiction over four of eight alleged acts of whistleblower reprisal, because the appellant failed to raise those four alleged agency actions in her complaint before the Office of Special Counsel). While "allegations of a VEOA violation should be liberally construed," <span class="Italic">see Wheeler</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. at 380, the VEOA requires that complaints to the DOL "contain a summary of the allegations that form the basis for the complaint." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(B). Thus, when an appellant's complaint entirely fails to inform the DOL of a particular alleged violation or ground for relief, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Mr. Gingery contends that his DOL complaint asserted a violation of his rights in connection with the specific position that was filled through the FCIP program in September 2008. However, the violation he asserted relates only to the agency's application of veterans' preference to his category rating, not to its use of the FCIP to fill the September 2008 vacancy. The complaint contains no reference to the FCIP. Because Mr. Gingery's DOL complaint did not refer to his FCIP-related allegations or in any way inform the DOL of the need to investigate that claim, Mr. Gingery failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to that issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Graves v. VA</span>, 117 MSPR 491, 497 &#x00B6; 13, 2012 MSPB 29 (2012), determined that a VEOA appeal would not be considered because the appellant's resort to DOL was premature:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Here, the question is not whether the appellant presented evidence showing that DOL's notification letter was issued after the appellant had filed a Board appeal. Rather, we find that the appellant did not exhaust his DOL remedy because he filed his DOL complaint before any nonselection or other alleged violation had occurred, and DOL did not therefore have an opportunity to conduct an investigation that might have led to corrective action before involving the Board in the case.</p>

For example, a late complaint typically does not become timely if filed again at a later date. A premature complaint, on the other hand, may be amenable to timely refiling after the passage of time or the occurrence of requisite events. Indeed, the DOL's response letter clearly contemplated that under certain circumstances petitioner could timely seek relief at the DOL in the future. But such differences between premature and late complaints do not help Mr. Dean. Indeed, the fact that he might properly exhaust those remedies in the future indicates that he has not yet done so. Thus, Mr. Dean's argument that his premature complaint should not be considered untimely for exhaustion purposes fails.").</p>

The more recent analysis is that if the DOL complaint appears to be untimely, the request for corrective action to the Board is within the Board's jurisdiction since the time limit is subject to equitable tolling, but the Board then dismissed the case for failure to meet the VEOA time limit if equitable tolling has not been justified. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stoglin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, SF-3330-13-1464-I-1 (NP 9/23/2014) ("The Board has explicitly overruled cases which hold that, where an appellant fails to timely file a complaint with DOL, he has failed to exhaust his administrative remedy. <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 371, &#x00B6; 8 (2009). The 60-day time limit for filing a complaint with the Secretary of Labor under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(A) is a statutory, not jurisdictional, requirement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9, 12-13.") (vacated for lack of jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Stoglin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 123 MSPR 163, 2015 MSPB 43 (2015)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If exhaustion requirements are met, the Board's review of the VEOA case is <span class="Italic">de novo</span>, without deference to determinations by the Department of Labor or the merits of the appellant's allegation, <span class="Italic">Shaver v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 106 MSPR 601, 606-07 n.4, 2007 MSPB 229 (2007):</p>
<p class="Body-Text-1">We agree with the appellant's argument that the record does not support the administrative judge's finding that Mercer's letter contained a typographical error. In a VEOA appeal, however, the matter that is appealable to the Board is the alleged violation of the individual's rights under a statute or regulation related to veterans' preference, not DOL's decision concerning the alleged violation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1). In other words, the appeal before the Board is a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> proceeding in which the Board is not required to defer to DOL's findings regarding the merits of the individual's complaint. Accordingly, whether DOL considered the appellant's claims meritorious has no bearing on the Board's adjudication of the matter. Thus, even if the administrative judge erred in finding that Mercer intended to indicate that his office found that the appellant's claims had no merit, this error would not provide a basis to reverse the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984) (an adjudicatory error that is not prejudicial to a party's <span id="Page_618"></span>substantive rights provides no basis for reversal of an initial decision).</p>

VA</span>, 2022 MSPB 23, n.1 (2022) ("Even if DOL had found that the agency's reannouncement of the vacancy was a sufficient remedy under VEOA, which it did not, the Board has held that Congress did not intend for DOL to have the final word as to what constitutes an appropriate remedy for a violation of veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">See Gingery v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 83, &#x00B6; 17 (2008).").</p>
