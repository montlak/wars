<h3 class="h3" id="sec1-320"><span class="space">F.</span> VETERANS EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES ACT</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">On October 31, 1998, the President signed the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998, Pub. L. 105-339 (VEOA), providing remedies for individuals whose veterans preference rights are infringed through federal employment actions or inactions. The Act amends the Reform Act to make it a prohibited personnel practice knowingly to violate a statutory or regulatory veterans preference requirement. The appellant must be a preference eligible to have standing to bring an appeal under VEOA, 5 USC 3330a(a), (d). <span class="Italic">Olson v. VA</span>, 92 MSPR 169, 172 &#x00B6; 7 (2002). The legislation also provides excepted service appointing authority, implemented at 5 CFR 213.3202(n), for preference eligibles or veterans with at least three years of active service to apply for positions announced under merit promotion procedures when the agency is recruiting from outside its own workforce. [Information concerning VEOA can be obtained from OPM's "Veterans Employment Information" (VetsInfo Guide), <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/veterans-services/vet-guide-for-hr-professionals/">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/veterans-services/vet-guide-for-hr-professionals/</a> and the Board's "Information Sheet No. 9: Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA)" at <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/appeals/infosheets/VEOA.pdf">https://www.mspb.gov/appeals/infosheets/VEOA.pdf</a>.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"Ordinarily, VEOA provides a means for qualified veterans to seek redress from the Board for violations of veterans' preference rights and denials of the right to compete for certain vacancy announcements. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A)-(B)." <span class="Italic">Medley v. VA</span>, SF-3330-14-0325-I-1 (NP 10/16/2014). VEOA jurisdiction was briefly summarized, <span class="Italic">Searcy v. USDA</span>, 115 MSPR 260, 265-66 &#x00B6; 13, 2010 MSPB 231 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish Board jurisdiction over an appeal brought under VEOA, an appellant must: (1) show that he exhausted his remedy with the Department of Labor; and (2) make nonfrivolous allegations that (i) he is a preference eligible within the meaning of the VEOA, (ii) the action(s) at issue took place on or after October 30, 1998, and (iii) the agency violated his rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">Hillman</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 162, &#x00B6; 9. Therefore, on remand, the administrative judge must provide the appellant with appropriate jurisdictional notice regarding his VEOA claim and the opportunity to submit evidence and argument to establish the Board's jurisdiction under VEOA. <span class="Italic">Nahoney</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 93, &#x00B6; 18; <span class="Italic">Easter v. Department of the Army</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 288, &#x00B6; 6 (2005).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The statute contains miscellaneous provisions expanding veterans preference employment rights. Of special interest, the law expands MSPB appellate jurisdiction after Labor Department administrative remedies are followed. VEOA creates a right of redress for actions taken after October 30, 1998, that are alleged to violate an individual's veterans preference rights. <span class="Italic">Leno v. VA</span>, 90 MSPR 614, 617 &#x00B6; 6 (2002) (citing <span class="Italic">Smyth v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 MSPR 549, 550-51&#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 6 (2000)). VEOA is not retroactive as to claims that arose before October 31, 1998. <span class="Italic">Lapuh v. MSPB</span>, 284 F.3d 1277, 1281-82 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (considering provisions of USERRA making the statute retroactive, and the lack of comparable provisions in VEOA); <span class="Italic">see Walker-Scurry v. MSPB,</span> 157 Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The VEOA provides that preference eligibles and other veterans "may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement [of a vacancy] will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). The term "preference eligible" is defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3) to include certain veterans, and it is undisputed that Mr. Oram qualifies as a preference eligible. The VEOA does not guarantee that a preference eligible will win the competition for a vacant position. Instead, it guarantees that a preference eligible has the right to compete for the vacancy, free from any agency action that violates a preference eligible's rights under "any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A). A preference eligible who believes an agency has violated the person's rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference may file a complaint with the Department of Labor; if the Department of Labor does not resolve the complaint, the aggrieved person may appeal the alleged violation to the Board; and if the Board finds a violation, it must order the agency to comply with the relevant veterans' preference law provisions and award compensation for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by the individual whose veterans' preference rights were violated. See 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A), 3330c(a). But in order for an aggrieved preference eligible to pursue these rights, the complaint to the Secretary of Labor must be timely filed "within 60 days after the date of the alleged violation," unless an untimely filing can be excused by application of equitable tolling. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(A); <span class="Italic">Kirkendall v.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">VEOA:</span> &#x2003;The VEOA redress mechanism applies to preference eligibles. The requirements a veteran (and, in certain instances, a mother or spouse of a veteran) must satisfy for preference eligible status are set forth at 5 USC 2108.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">VEOA:</span> &#x2003;VEOA establishes statutory filing time limits for each stage of the redress procedure. Unless the Secretary of Labor has notified the appellant that the Department of Labor has been unable to resolve the appellant's VEOA complaint, a VEOA appeal may not be filed with the Board before the 61st day after the complaint was filed with the Secretary. If the Secretary notifies the appellant that the Department of Labor has been unable to resolve the complaint, any VEOA appeal to the Board must be filed within 15 days of the date of receipt of the Secretary's notice.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">VEOA</span>: &#x2003;VEOA does not include a judicial review provision comparable to that in USERRA. It does, however, implicitly acknowledge that a final Board decision on a VEOA appeal is subject to judicial review by referring to the Board's issuance of a "judicially reviewable decision." In the absence of an explicit judicial review provision, the Board relies on precedent construing the applicability of 5 USC 7703 to final Board decisions in cases other than those decided under chapter 77 of title 5, United States Code (<span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Frazier, et a]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">., v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The purpose of this information sheet is to provide general guidance and background information. It does not represent an official statement approved by the Board itself, and is not intended to provide legal counsel or to be cited as legal authority.

In all instances, however, the Board's regulations and current case law control with respect to matters discussed here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">What is the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 or VEOA is a federal law that provides certain federal employees and applicants with a means of redress in the event that a federal executive agency violates an employee's or applicant's veterans' preference rights. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3330a-3330b.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_573"></span><span class="Italic">Which employees and applicants can file a VEOA appeal with the Board?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because VEOA primarily concerns the rights afforded to preference eligibles, i.e., individuals entitled to veterans' preference, generally, only preference eligible employees and applicants are entitled to file VEOA appeals. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a (a)(1)(A). However, a non-preference eligible individual who has been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service may file a VEOA appeal if the individual alleges that an agency has denied the individual the opportunity to compete for a vacant position for which the agency is accepting applications from outside its own workforce. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Who qualifies as a "preference eligible?'</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the purpose of employment in the federal government, the term "preference eligible" is defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108 (3). The term includes veterans who have been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions and who served on active duty in the armed forces during a war or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized or during particular defined periods. The Office of Personnel Management's VetGuide provides a comprehensive list of campaigns and expeditions which qualify for veterans' preference. The VetGuide is available at the following internet address: <a href="https://www.opm.gov/veterans/html/vgmedal2.asp">https://www.opm.gov/veterans/html/vgmedal2.asp</a> [now at <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/veterans-services/vet-guide-for-hr-professionals/">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/veterans-services/vet-guide-for-hr-professionals/</a>] . The term "preference eligible" also includes disabled veterans. In addition, the mother, spouse, or unmarried widow or widower of certain veterans may qualify as a "preference eligible" under particular circumstances. A retired member of the armed forces is generally excluded from the definition of "preference eligible" unless the individual qualifies as a disabled veteran or retired below the rank of major or its equivalent. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">What veterans' preference rights can the Board address under VEOA?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">VEOA provides a means of redress for any violation of an "individual's rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a (a)(1)(A). In some cases, it is obvious that a particular right derives from a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference because the statute or regulation explicitly refers to preference eligibles. However, even if it does not explicitly refer to veterans' preference or preference eligibles, a statute or regulation relates to veterans' preference so long as it stands in some relation to, has a bearing on, concerns, or has a connection with veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">See Dean v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 17 (2005), <span class="Italic">aff'd on reconsideration</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 1 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">How do I file a VEOA appeal with the Board?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before individuals can file VEOA appeals with the Board, they must first file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor. The Department of Labor's website explains how to file a veterans' preference complaint with that agency: <a href="http://www.dol.gov/vets/programs/vetspref/veterans_preference_fs.htm">http://www.dol.gov/vets/programs/vetspref/veterans_preference_fs.htm</a> [now at <a href="https://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/vets/vetpref/benefit.htm">https://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/vets/vetpref/benefit.htm</a>] . After filing a complaint with the Secretary of Labor, an individual may file a VEOA appeal with the Board if the Secretary of Labor is unable to resolve the complaint within 60 days after the date on which the complaint is filed. However, an appeal may not be filed before the 61 st day after the date on which the complaint was filed or, except under very limited circumstances known as "equitable tolling," later than 15 days after the date on which the complainant receives written notification that the Secretary has been unable to resolve the complaint. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a (d)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Am I entitled to a hearing if I file a VEOA appeal?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has the authority to decide a VEOA claim on the merits, without a hearing, when there is no genuine dispute of material fact and one party must prevail as a matter of law. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of Defense</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 604, &#x00B6; 12 (2007). In other words, while an individual who files a VEOA appeal does not have a right to a hearing, the Board may conduct a hearing if necessary to resolve a factual dispute between the parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">What do I have to do to win my appeal?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be entitled to relief under VEOA, the individual who filed the appeal must prove by preponderant evidence that the agency's action violated one or more of the individual's statutory or regulatory veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">Dale v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 646, &#x00B6; 10 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">If I win my appeal, what relief will the Board provide?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the Board determines that an agency has violated an individual's rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference, VEOA provides that the Board shall order the agency to comply with the statute or regulation it violated and award the individual compensation for any loss of wages or benefits the individual suffered due to the violation. The individual is also entitled to be awarded reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses. Furthermore, if the Board determines that the agency knew or showed reckless disregard as to whether its conduct was prohibited by statute or regulation related to veterans' preference, VEOA provides that the Board shall award the individual an additional amount equal to back pay. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Graves v. VA</span>, SF-3330-09-0570-P-1 (NP 5/3/2013), indirectly summed up the elements of a VEOA claim and relief:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge correctly found, the appellant is not entitled to back pay or benefits at this time. The appellant is entitled to an award of lost wages or benefits if (1) the agency violated the appellant's veterans' preference rights, and (2) the appellant lost wages or benefits as a result of the violation. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 245, &#x00B6; 13 (2011). An individual can suffer losses of wages or benefits if he would have been hired by the agency in the absence of a violation of his veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">Dean v.

Contrary to the appellant's assertions, however, it is unclear at this time whether the appellant would have been selected for the position had the agency not violated his veterans' preference rights.3 Thus, he is not entitled to an award of compensation. <span class="Italic">See Dean</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 45.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant is not entitled to back pay or benefits at this time, he is likewise not entitled to liquidated damages. <span class="Italic">See Williams</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 245, &#x00B6; 12. Further, an award of liquidated damages requires a finding that the agency's violation was willful, i.e., the agency either knew or showed reckless disregard for whether its conduct was prohibited. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a); <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 245, &#x00B6; 19. As the administrative judge correctly found, the agency's violation of the appellant's veterans' preference rights in making the initial selection to the MRT position was not willful. <span class="Italic">See Graves</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 245, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 20. Thus, the appellant is not entitled to liquidated damages.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Indirectly defining VEOA remedies, <span class="Italic">Graves v. VA</span>, SF-3330-09-0725-P-1 (NP 5/3/2013), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is not entitled to an award of compensation because the agency was not obligated to consider his late application, and, therefore, he did not suffer a loss of wages or benefits as a result of the agency's violation of his veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">See Dean v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 43-46 (2005) ("An individual can suffer [losses of wages or benefits] only if he would have been hired by the agency in the absence of a violation of his rights."), <span class="Italic">aff'd on recons</span>., 104 M.S.P.R. 1 (2006). Further, because the appellant is not entitled to back pay or benefits, he is likewise not entitled to liquidated damages. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 245, &#x00B6; 12 (2011). As the administrative judge properly found, the agency's violation was not willful because the agency was not aware that it was required to apply veterans' preference rights to Veterans Health Administration hybrid positions. <span class="Italic">See Graves v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 209, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9, 15 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant's citations to <span class="Italic">Marshall v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 587 F.3d 1310 (Fed. Cir. 2009), <span class="Italic">Kirkendall v. Department of the Army</span>, 573 F.3d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2009), and <span class="Italic">Gingery v. Department of Defense</span>, 550 F.3d 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2008), are inapposite. The facts at issue in each of those decisions are distinguishable from the facts here. In <span class="Italic">Marshall</span>, our reviewing court found that reconstruction of the selection process was inappropriate because the agency admitted that it would have selected the appellant for the position had it complied with the statutory provisions concerning the appellant's veterans' preference rights; thus, the appropriate remedy was for the appellant to be placed in the job for which he applied and awarded compensation for any loss of wages or benefits. 587 F.3d at 1317-18. In <span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span>, our reviewing court found that an offer of prospective relief, such as priority consideration for a future job opening, was insufficient to remedy the VEOA violation because the agency erred in processing the appellant's application by improperly failing to consider the appellant's military experience. 573 F.3d at 1324-25. In contrast, here, the Board found that the agency was not obligated to consider the appellant's application for the position at issue and that the agency's violation concerned its failure to accept and retain his application for future vacancies. Thus, an award of prospective relief is appropriate, and we deny the appellant's petition for lost wages, benefits, and damages.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is VEOA, not the 1944 Veterans Preference Act, that provides the Board jurisdiction to hear a claimed violation of statutes or regulations relating to veterans preference, <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Dept. of Army,</span> AT-3330-10-0892-I-1 (NP 3/25/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the VPA is the controlling statute in this case and that subsequent statutes, regulations, and executive orders have improperly abrogated his rights under the VPA. The appellant is correct that the VPA itself remains unaltered since its inception nearly 70 years <span id="Page_574"></span>ago. However, Congress may pass new laws that supersede the old ones. For instance, both VEOA and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) are laws that were enacted subsequent to the VPA and affected veterans' preference rights. Thus, an examination of the text of the VPA itself will not reveal the changes in veterans' preference law enacted under VEOA and the CSRA. VEOA, not the VPA, is the source of the Board's jurisdiction over veterans' preference matters in general.<span class="Italic"> Metzenbaum</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 104, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the Board has jurisdiction to consider his veterans' preference claims pursuant to section 14 of the VPA without regard to the jurisdictional requirements of VEOA. Section 14 of the VPA (which is codified as amended by the CSRA and other statutes at 5 U.S.C. chapter 75) pertains only to adverse actions. The term "adverse action" has a technical legal meaning and does not include all agency decisions that may be "adverse" to an individual in the ordinary sense of the word. Adverse actions include various actions that an agency might take against a current employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(1)-(5). They do not include adverse hiring decisions such as the one at issue here. Even under the original terms of the VPA, adverse actions were limited to particular matters that did not include adverse hiring decisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant cites <span class="Italic">Arnett v. Kennedy</span>, 416 U.S. 134 (1974), for the proposition that "the review rights prescribed by the [VPA] and Executive Order 10987 [are] central to the constitutionality of the civil service system." However, both <span class="Italic">Kennedy</span> and Executive Order No. 10987 (1962) pertain to agency-level adverse action procedures. As explained above, the instant appeal does not involve an adverse action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also challenges the propriety of unspecified executive orders and Office of Personnel Management regulations as contrary to the VPA. Because the appellant has not identified the particular regulations and executive orders that he is challenging and he has not explained with specificity why he believes them to be invalid, his arguments in this regard are unavailing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A VEOA appeal does not independently support a claimed prohibited personnel practice for whistleblowing reprisal; those allegations must first be pursued through the Office of Special Counsel before they are brought to the Board through an IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">See Wooten v. VA</span>, 96 MSPR 671, 675 &#x00B6; 8 n.* (2004). [Refer to <a href="0100-2023-20-001.html#sec13-1">Chapter 13</a> for prohibited personnel practices.]</p>
