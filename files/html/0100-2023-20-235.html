<h3 class="h3" id="sec13-227"><span class="space">B.</span> STAY THROUGH OSC PROCEEDING</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">The most effective weapon in OSC's arsenal is its authority under 5 USC 1214(b) to apply to the Board for a stay of a threatened, pending, or accomplished personnel action against an employee. The law requires that an OSC initial stay application be granted, and they are granted, absent unusual circumstances. The stay is granted by a Board member through a stay application filed directly with the Board. An appellant whose case is pending before an AJ asks for a stay from the AJ; there is no requirement that the initial stay application be granted, and most are denied. When OSC acts, its stay application secures interim balm for whistleblowing reprisal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OSC's <span class="Italic">Policy Statement on Stays of Personnel Actions</span> (Sept. 2018) states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) may seek stays of personnel <span id="Page_4051"></span>actions in complaints alleging prohibited personnel practices or other prohibited activities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Stay Criteria</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, OSC may consider requesting a stay of a personnel action against an employee from an agency or from the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) when: (1) OSC has reasonable grounds to believe that a personnel action that was taken or will be taken constitutes a prohibited personnel practice; and (2) absent a stay, the employee will be subjected to immediate and substantial harm, such as removal, suspension for more than 14 days, or geographic reassignment. "Reasonable grounds" means sufficient evidence for a reasonable person, with the same information and knowledge of the applicable law, to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has been or will be committed. Because a stay is designed to provide OSC with time to conduct an investigation, a stay may be granted on the basis of preliminary information. In addition, the Special Counsel, in his or her sole discretion, may petition the MSPB to stay a personnel action if it would be appropriate and consistent with OSC's statutory mission. An agency also may, in its own discretion, decide to stay a personnel action pending an OSC investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Stay Procedure</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At any time, a complainant may request a stay of a personnel action, or the investigation itself may uncover facts that suggest a stay is warranted. In such circumstances, OSC will promptly review the file based on the above criteria. After reviewing the relevant information, OSC will decide whether to seek a stay in the case. OSC will inform the complainant of the decision as soon as practicable. If OSC decides to seek a stay and the agency agrees, OSC will proceed with the investigation. If, however, the agency declines to hold the personnel action at issue in abeyance for the requested time period, then OSC may petition the MSPB for a stay, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Stay Extensions</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an agency agrees to stay a personnel action, but the agreed-upon stay period ends before OSC completes its investigation, OSC may request an extension of the stay, assuming that the criteria for seeking a stay continue to exist. If the agency declines a request for an extension, OSC may petition the MSPB for a stay, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Note: This policy statement supercedes all prior statements on stays of personnel actions. The statement is not intended to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against OSC or any other individual or entity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The main purpose of the statutory stay provision is to preclude adverse action against the employee as OSC investigates the allegations of a prohibited personnel practice, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">In re Tariela</span>, 1 MSPR 141, 144, 1 MSPB 139, 141 (1979), and, more generally, to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> pending that investigation. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 26 MSPR 280, 282 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Jane Doe v. VA,</span> CB-1208-13-0001-U-1 (NP 10/4/2012) (stay to prevent reprisal for a violation of 5 USC 2302(b)(9) in the form of an allegation of sexual harassment: "The statute thus sets up a presumption that OSC's request for an initial stay will be granted, and it makes OSC the lead actor in securing provisional relief when, in OSC's judgment, an agency may have committed a prohibited personnel practice."); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. SSA</span>, 76 MSPR 392, 394 (1997) (maintaining a temporary appointee beyond the expiration date of the appointment); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v.

SSA</span>, 76 MSPR 211, 215 n.2 (1997) (when the allegation was that the agency sought to terminate improperly a temporary appointment prior to its expiration date, a stay would not be issued to extend employment past the expiration date without an allegation that the agency committed a prohibited personnel practice by failing to take a different personnel action, e.g., the conversion of a temporary appointment to a permanent one).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The initial stay request should be for a personnel action taken or threatened, not an action whose future occurrence is speculative, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Exzabe v. Dept. of Army</span>, CB-1208-22-0013-U-1 (NP 5/23/2022) (involving what was alleged by OSC to be a removal process that lacked due process):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its May 18, 2022 stay request, OSC alleges that it has reasonable grounds to believe that the Department of the Army has violated Mr. Exzabe's due process rights in connection with its proposal to remove him from his Environmental Protection Specialist position at the U.S. Army Garrison Hawaii. OSC alleges that, on or about August 18, 2021, the Army proposed Mr. Exzabe's removal based on a charge of inability to perform his assigned duties due to his lack of access to the installation.[2] OSC further alleges that Mr. Exzabe's lack of access to the installation is a result of a February 23, 2021 indefinite standard debarment order that bars Mr. Exzabe's entry to any Garrison installation for any reason. Regarding the basis for the standard debarment order, OSC asserts that the Garrison Commander "said his order was for 'sexual offenses' but provided no additional facts."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The notice of proposed removal informed Mr. Exzabe of his right to reply orally and/or in writing, that any reply would be fully considered, and that he would receive a written decision on the proposed action. OSC does not allege that any such decision has been issued.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to OSC, the proposed removal violates Mr. Exzabe's due process rights because it does not notify Mr. Exzabe of the specific reasons for the debarment on which the proposal is based or provide a meaningful opportunity for him to respond to those reasons. In particular, OSC states that, "it would be a prohibited personnel practice to remove [Mr. Exzabe] for not reporting to work without giving him notice of, or a meaningful opportunity to respond to, the specific reasons for his removal, i.e., the alleged off-duty misconduct that led to the debarment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Due process is a flexible concept that calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gajdos v. Department of the Army</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 361, &#x00B6; 18 (2014); <span class="Italic">Buelna v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 16 (2014). At its core, due process requires that "an individual be given an opportunity for a hearing <span class="Italic">before</span> he is deprived of any significant property interest." <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 542 (1985) (emphasis in original). This requires notice and a "meaningful opportunity to invoke the discretion of the decisionmaker" before the personnel action is effected. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 542-43; <span class="Italic">see Hodges v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 591, &#x00B6; 6 (2012). Thus, the Board has held that an employee has a due process right to notice of the grounds in support of the adverse action and a meaningful opportunity to invoke the discretion of a deciding official with the authority to select an alternative outcome, to the extent an alternative penalty may have been feasible. <span class="Italic">See Grimes v. Department of Justice</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 36, &#x00B6; 7 (2014); <span class="Italic">Flores v. Department of Defense</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 10 (2014).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, because the removal process has been ongoing since August 18, 2021, it is purely speculative whether a due process violation will occur. To so speculate, would, in essence, amount to an improper advisory opinion regarding whether the Department of the Army could properly remove Mr. Exzabe under the circumstances presented or whether to do so would violate his due process rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(h) (prohibiting the Board from issuing advisory opinions); <span class="Italic">Winston v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 594, &#x00B6; 8 (2010) (noting that the Board does not have the authority to advise an agency concerning the removal of an employee, but only to review an agency's decision to take such action).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OSC stay requests to MSPB are infrequently employed in MSPB litigation; more frequently OSC obtains a stay informally through a request to the agency-employer. When OSC seeks a stay and the Board rules on the request, the Board's decision is published. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 26 MSPR 415, 419-20 (1985) (an individual who was not a named party but whose name appeared in the Board opinion did not have a Privacy Act right to prevent publication of the opinion). 5 USC 1214(a)(4), requiring OSC to obtain the complainant's permission for any efforts it takes to obtain corrective action, does not appear to include OSC stay requests. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. VA</span>, 75 MSPR 219, 224 (1997).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OSC's authority to seek a stay of a pending adverse action derives from 5 USC 1214(b)(1)(A)(i), providing for an initial 45-day stay "if the Special Counsel determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the personnel action was taken, or is to be taken, as a result of a prohibited personnel practice." The stay must be issued by any member of the Board unless that member determines, under the facts and circumstances involved, that a stay would not be appropriate. The initial stay, to be decided within three working days, does not contemplate an agency response or comment. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 59 MSPR 556, 558 (1993). The stay may encompass any personnel action, e.g., the issuance of a performance appraisal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Acting Special Counsel v. EEOC</span>, 5 MSPR 19, 21, 5 MSPB 101 (1981). Although the stay is most often sought by OSC in whistleblowing reprisal cases, stays may be secured for other types of prohibited personnel practices. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Jane Doe v. VA,</span> CB-1208-13-0001-U-1 (NP 10/4/2012) (stay sought to protect an employee when an anonymous report through the EEO office suggested that the employee was the victim of sexual harassment); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel.

Because I am granting the stay based on an alleged prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1)(A) in connection with Ms. Spalding's proposed removal, I need not consider whether to grant the stay based on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)."). <span id="Page_4052"></span>[Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-20-048.html#sec13-47">EEO Complaint, Allegations</a>" and <span class="Italic">Edwards v.

StephensonPino v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 96 MSPR 311, 315 &#x00B6; 17 (2004) (noting OSC's plan for conducting an overseas investigation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When it reviews a stay request from OSC, the Board's focus is on whether the OSC determination to seek relief falls within the "range of rationality," and this determination is made, when an initial stay request is being considered, in the "light most favorable to a finding of reasonable grounds to believe." <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 83 MSPR 169, 173 &#x00B6; 11 (1999) (restating rule); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v.

DOJ</span>, 62 MSPR 193, 194 (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The standards for issuance of the preliminary 45-day stay are the same whether OSC is complaining of reprisal for whistleblowing or some other prohibited practice, e.g., reprisal for the exercise of a grievance right. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Fish &#x0026; Wildlife Serv.</span>, 62 MSPR 388, 392 (1994). The OSC theory of the violation, if in doubt, will be credited during stay proceedings if OSC's theory falls "within the range of rationality." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. VA</span>, 75 MSPR 219, 222 (1997). The Board considers whatever evidence is provided to it. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 26 MSPR 415, 419 (1985) (Board considers the political affiliation of an agency official accused of political affiliation discrimination).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The preliminary stay may be retroactive, although "the lapse of time since the effective date of a personnel action is a factor to be considered in determining whether to grant a stay," <span class="Italic">OSC v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 90 MSPR 154, 157 &#x00B6; 7 (2001) (granting a stay one month after the employee's termination), and <span class="Italic">OSC ex rel. Missal v. Dept. of Interior</span>, CB-1208-17-0025-U-1 (NP 8/2/2017):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the deference that generally should be afforded to OSC in the context of an initial stay request, and the assertions made in its stay request, there are reasonable grounds here to believe that the agency removed Mr. Missal based on his protected disclosures in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) and/or for cooperating with or disclosing information to the IG in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C). Although the effective date of Mr. Missal's removal already has passed, the Board has authority to stay an action after its effective date. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1)(A)(i); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Department of Transportation</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 520, 522 (1996). However, the lapse in time since the effective date of a personnel action is a factor to be considered in determining whether to grant a stay. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel v. Department of Transportation</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 552, 555 (1993). Here, OSC did not request a stay of Mr. Missal's removal until a year and a half after it was effective. Nonetheless, OSC explains that its investigation is complete, and on March 7, 2017, it sought corrective action from the agency, but the agency informed OSC that it disagreed that corrective action was warranted. Subsequently, OSC provided the agency additional analysis of the case, and the parties engaged in settlement discussions in May 2017.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC now seeks a stay order to provide Mr. Missal temporary <span class="Italic">status quo</span> relief and forestall his economic hardship while it pursues corrective action by settlement or, if needed, prepares a prohibited personnel practices report. Because OSC has completed its investigation and is attempting to resolve this matter, it is appropriate to grant the stay. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel ex rel. Feilke v. Department of Defense Dependent Schools</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 621, 624-25 (1997) (granting an initial stay over 3 years after the effective date of the termination action when OSC had completed its investigation and initiated contact with the agency to attempt to resolve the matter); <span class="Italic">see also Special Counsel ex rel. Andersen v. Department of Justice</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 675, &#x00B6; 4 (1998) (stating that the purpose of a stay is to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> and minimize the consequences of an alleged prohibited personnel practice while OSC and the agency involved resolve the disputed matter).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ORDER</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, granting OSC's stay request would be appropriate. Accordingly, a 45-day stay of Mr. Missal's removal is GRANTED. The stay shall be in effect from August 2, 2017, through and including September 15, 2017.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Section 1214(b)(1)(B) allows the Board to extend the stay "for any period which the Board considers appropriate," provided that the respondent agency has the opportunity to comment to the Board on any proposed extension of a stay. On rare occasion, at least under pre-WPA law, a stay was denied if the action of the agency sought to be stayed appeared to be plainly reasonable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 5 MSPR 24, 25 (1981) (concerning a charge based on the "bare allegation of a constitutional defect" in the agency's removal actions; allowing OSC to reapply with a better foundation). On rarer occasion OPM had directed a stay of a personnel action; if this occurs, the Board will not likely accept an OSC request for a stay "because the relief sought by the Special Counsel has already been secured, [the] matter is not ripe for adjudication." <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 14 MSPR 297, 298-99 (1983) (disregarding an argument by OSC that the Board cannot enforce an OPM-directed stay and that OPM could dissolve its stay at will).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the statute as it stood before 1989, three types of stays were available to OSC, each requiring a greater demonstration of cause. Stays were appropriate even if there were jurisdictional questions, under <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Peace Corps</span>, 31 MSPR 225, 228-29 (1986), at least pending briefing by the parties. <span class="Italic">Peace Corps</span> noted as to jurisdictional issues attendant to stay requests:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[G]reat deference shown the Special Counsel at the initial stages of the stay process in establishing the factual foundation for a prohibited personnel practice is consistent with this framework and the legislative history concerning the stay provisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is at least arguable that, when, as in this case, the controversy involves a threshold legal question of the Board's jurisdiction to grant a stay, the usual deference given to the Special Counsel in establishing the factual foundation for a prohibited personnel practice should not be applicable. Like any other party seeking relief from the Board, the Special Counsel has the burden of establishing Board jurisdiction; <span class="Italic">e.g., Acting Special Counsel v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Treasury,</span> 6 MSPB 127, 6 MSPR 140 (1981); <span class="Italic">Acting Special Counsel v. Department of Treasury,</span> 5 MSPB 105, 5 MSPR 24 (1981). While the argument that the Special Counsel should bear a greater burden in stays involving legal questions is attractive in principle, the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> nature of the initial phases of the stay process and the short time frames for submissions by the parties may--as the development of this controversy demonstrates--render the question of jurisdiction as problematical as factual issues. Therefore, as in this case, a stay of some duration may be appropriate to preserve the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> while the issue of jurisdiction is briefed by the parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">None of this, however, relieves the Special Counsel of the ultimate burden of demonstrating jurisdiction....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under earlier law, it was immaterial that a stay lapsed before a successor stay was sought, although the lapse could be so great that request of a stay would abuse prosecutorial discretion. <span class="Italic">In re Munoz</span>, 4 MSPR 9, 11, 4 MSPB 103 (1980). The Board allowed retroactive stays, that is, OSC could obtain a stay of an adverse personnel action after the action had taken effect. <span class="Italic">In re Munoz</span>, 3 MSPR 406, 3 MSPB 483 (1980), <span class="Italic">reaff'd on reconsideration</span>, 4 MSPR 214, 215 (1980) ("The stay relieves the pressure which might otherwise be exerted on the Special Counsel to conduct an abbreviated investigation and make a hasty <span id="Page_4053"></span>prosecutorial decision in order to alleviate any hardship to the employee.
