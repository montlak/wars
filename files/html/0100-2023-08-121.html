<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-120"><span class="space">1.</span> Movement Between Positions in Same Agency; Lack of Notice of Requirement of Probation</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The terms "reassignment" and "transfer" appear in the decisions that follow. OPM provides definition, 5 CFR 210.102(b) (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(12)&#x2003;Reassignment means a change of an employee, while serving continuously within the same agency, from one position to another without promotion or demotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(18)&#x2003;Transfer means a change of an employee, without a break in service of 1 full workday, from a position in one agency to a position in another agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although movement from one agency to another that does not qualify as a transfer may defeat appeal rights that would otherwise follow the transferee, the situation may be brighter for the individual who makes a position change within her own agency. In <span class="Italic">Exum v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/EXUM_CHARLOTTE_BN_0752_94_0015_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_246173.pdf">62 MSPR 344</a> (1994), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, <span class="Italic">Exum v. VA</span>, 66 MSPR 416, 420 (1995) (reversing a conversion to part-time status and separation from federal service; the appellant was restored to the original full-time position) (<span class="Italic">Exum</span> "disapproved" in <span class="Italic">Williams v. MSPB</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20180611110">892 F.3d 1156</a> (Fed. Cir. 2018), <span class="Italic">post</span>), the Board made agencies responsible for informing their employees of the effect on appeal or tenure rights of changes in position through conversions. If the employee was not informed of the impact of the conversion, and if the employee could not be charged with that knowledge through other means, the AJ must assess whether the employee would have accepted the conversion if she been properly informed of its effect on appeal rights. If the AJ concludes that the employee would not have accepted the conversion, the action against the employee will be adjudicated under the appellate rights associated with the preconversion position, 62 MSPR at 347-51:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues further that the agency handled her change to part-time status improperly in that it never informed her, at the time she requested part-time work, that the change would result in her exclusion from coverage under chapter 75 of title 5, U.S. Code. For the reasons stated below, we agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we note that there is no indication in the record that the agency misinformed, misled, or deceived the appellant about the effects of the 1989 change at any time material to this appeal. Furthermore, as we have indicated above, the appellant initiated the change by requesting part-time status. We do not agree with the agency, however, that the appellant's "voluntary action...in requesting part time employment relieve[d] the Agency of any duty it may have had to advise" the appellant regarding the effects of granting the request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both the Board and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have held that, under some circumstances, an agency's failure to provide adequate information to an employee may cause an action of a kind that ordinarily is voluntary and therefore binding to be nonbinding. In <span class="Italic">Covington v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 943 (Fed. Cir. 1984), for example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit pointed out that a "decision made 'with blinders on,' based on misinformation or a lack of information, [could not] be binding as a matter of fundamental fairness and due process." There, the court found that the employee's retirement could not deprive the employee of his right to appeal a reduction-in-force (RIF) action because the employee had not been informed that the action constituted a RIF action, and because the agency's "additional failure to inform him that a retirement election would preclude a later appeal denied him the right to consider this fact in making his decision" regarding retirement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Relying on this and other authority, the Board subsequently held that an agency was required "to <span id="Page_182"></span>provide information that [was] not only correct in nature but adequate in scope to allow an employee to make an informed decision." <span class="Italic">Kolstad v.

Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 58 MSPR 579, 583-84 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present appeal, the appellant does not appear to have expressly informed the agency, when requesting a change to part-time work, that she believed she would continue to occupy a position covered by 5 USC chapter 75. Her request indicates, however, that she expected--and, in fact, was requesting--only a limited change in her employment, i.e., a change in the number of hours she would be working. The agency has not challenged the appellant's uncontradicted assertion that she did not anticipate that her request would have the effect of excluding her from coverage under chapter 75. In addition, there is no indication in the record that the exclusion of part-time employment from coverage under 38 USC 7401(3) and, accordingly, from coverage under 5 USC chapter 75 is a matter of general knowledge among licensed practical nurses in the agency. In fact, this exclusion is not apparent even from the language of 38 USC 7401(3) itself. Finally, the appellant's request that the change be made "until further notice," indicates that the appellant expected that even the limited change she had requested would have only a temporary effect on her employment status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances described above, we find that the agency should have known that the appellant was acting under the erroneous impression that the only effects of her requested change would be to limit her working hours temporarily. For this reason, and because of the obviously important effect this erroneous impression could have on the appellant's employment and therefore on her decision to change to part-time employment, we find that the agency had an obligation to inform the appellant of the effects the change would have. <span class="Italic">See Williams</span>, 44 MSPR at 454 (while the agency's advice may have presented "technically accurate" information regarding the employee's retirement options, its failure to inform the employee of an additional option of which he was unaware constituted a failure to provide "information adequate in scope to make an informed decision, and [the agency] failed to correct the erroneous information it had reason to know [the employee] was relying on"). We find further that this information should have included information regarding the inapplicability of chapter 75 to positions in the Veterans Health Administration that are not filled under 38 USC 7401(3). The agency does not claim, and the record does not indicate, that it provided the appellant with this information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By itself, however, the agency's evident failure to provide appropriate information to the appellant does not establish that the appellant would not have consented to the conversion of her appointment if she had been adequately informed. For this reason, and because neither the parties nor the administrative judge have addressed this matter specifically, we must remand this appeal to the regional office for further consideration. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 455 (because the parties had not litigated the adequacy of the agency's retirement advice, and because the administrative judge therefore had not determined whether the appellant would have pursued the same course of action with a full understanding of his rights, the Board remanded the appeal to the regional office for further consideration). On remand, the administrative judge shall provide the parties with an opportunity to address the matter described above. If appropriate, he also shall hold a hearing on this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e find that 38 USC 7405 did not authorize the agency to appoint the appellant to any part-time position other than one that was not to exceed 1 year. We note further that there appears to be no other authority on which the agency could have effected the appellant's part-time appointment, and that granting the appellant's request for part-time work therefore would seem to have required converting the appellant's appointment to a temporary one not to exceed a year. Accordingly, in determining on remand whether the appellant would have consented to the conversion of her appointment if she had been adequately informed, the administrative judge shall take into account the agency's apparent inability to offer the appellant a nontemporary part-time appointment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Exum</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Shaw v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 533, 534-38 (1996), involving a challenge to a removal following a voluntary reduction in grade. Because the appellant was not informed of his loss of appeal rights following the reduction in grade, appeal rights applied when the agency removed the appellant prior to the one-year waiting period otherwise required to secure appeal rights in that position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...During the 1992-93 nationwide Postal Service restructuring, in February 1993, the appellant was demoted to the position of EAS-23, Manager, Processing and Distribution Center, from his PCES-1 position, and was relocated from Merrifield, Virginia to Sioux Falls, South Dakota. It appears that he did not contest that action. In December 1994, the appellant requested a reduction in grade to the position of EAS-21, Operations Support Specialist, Midwest Area Office, St. Louis, Missouri, and such reduction in grade was effective on January 21, 1995.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 17, 1995, the agency proposed the appellant's removal from his Operations Support Specialist position on a charge of making false statements to obtain Postal funds in connection with his relocation to Sioux Falls. The appellant was removed on May 17, 1995, and timely appealed this removal to the St. Louis Field Office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge, citing 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(B) and 39 USC 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii), found that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the appeal because, in the year prior to his removal, the appellant had not completed one year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions. He found that the appellant had "neither claimed nor presented evidence" that the positions in which he served during his last year of service were the same or similar.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We find that if the appellant's demotion is involuntary, jurisdiction over the removal would derive from the resulting imputed finding that he served for more than one continuous year in the EAS-23, Manager, Processing and Distribution Center position prior to his demotion, and he is, therefore, covered by section 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, as detailed below, that, contrary to the administrative judge's conclusions, the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Exum</span> is persuasive guidance as to the result in this case. In <span class="Italic">Exum</span>, the appellant was originally hired as a full-time Licensed Practical Nurse and in September 1989, she requested part-time hours "until further notice" so that she could attend school. <span class="Italic">See Exum</span>, 62 MSPR at 349. On September 24, 1989, the agency granted her request. In the course of granting such request, the agency appointed the appellant to a position under a different appointing authority that provided no appeal rights under 5 USC chapter 75, although her original appointment was covered under that chapter and would have provided appeal rights. After her involuntary separation on October 11, 1993, the appellant filed an appeal which the administrative judge dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The Board, however, vacated that decision, finding that the agency's failure to inform the appellant of the consequences of changing her status to part-time vitiated the voluntariness of her request for part-time hours. The Board then remanded the appeal for a determination of whether the appellant would have accepted part-time work if the agency had adequately informed her of the consequences of her acceptance, and if she would not have consented, for an adjudication of the appeal of her separation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly here, we must determine as a jurisdictional fact in the removal appeal whether the appellant's December 1994 reduction-in-grade request was voluntary under the circumstances. If it was involuntary, it cannot serve as a bar to finding that he possessed the requisite one year of current and continuous service in the Manager, Processing and Distribution Center position that he would have had absent such an involuntary demotion. That in turn would establish Board jurisdiction over his removal. While the administrative judge correctly noted that ordinarily an alleged involuntary reduction in grade would represent a separate appealable matter from the current removal, this fact is not sufficient to render <span class="Italic">Exum</span> inapplicable. In <span class="Italic">Exum</span>, as previously stated, the appellant had no appeal right to the Board from her change from full-time to part-time status; yet, the Board inquired into the voluntariness of her acceptance of the part-time position because it directly related to her current appeal rights. To give greater rights of appeal to those who would have had no appeal rights as in <span class="Italic">Exum</span>, but to deny appeal rights to Mr. Shaw would defy reason. The concern in <span class="Italic">Exum</span> was with the direct connection and relationship between the voluntariness of the action that caused the deprivation of current appeal rights and not with whether such action was itself appealable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge attempted to distinguish <span class="Italic">Exum</span> from the instant case on the following grounds: (1) It was not the reduction in grade that "stripped" the appellant of his appeal rights but, rather, the fact that he did not have one year of current continuous service in his new position, so that once the appellant had served for one year he would have appeal rights to the Board; in contrast the appellant in <span class="Italic">Exum</span> would have been deprived of appeal rights on a permanent basis; and (2) in <span class="Italic">Exum</span>, the Board found that the agency should have known that the appellant was acting under the erroneous impression that the only effect of her change to a part-time position would be to limit her working hours temporarily; in contrast, here it would be "speculative" to conclude that either the appellant or the agency "remotely thought" about the loss of the appellant's appeal rights at the time he accepted the reduction in grade, and there is no basis to conclude that the agency should have known that the appellant agreed to the reduction in grade because he was under the impression that it would have no effect upon his appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_183"></span>We are not persuaded that these distinctions are supportable. First, whether the deprivation of appeal rights is temporary or permanent, if an individual is precluded from appealing at the time of an adverse action, the duration of the preclusion makes no difference--the result is the same, lack of Board jurisdiction. Further, while the Board found that the appellant in <span class="Italic">Exum</span> had an expectation only that she would be placed in a part-time status, so too the appellant here had only an expectation that he would be reduced in grade, not that he would lose appeal rights for a period of time. In fact, the appellant here asserts in an affidavit, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that sometime in 1994 the Postal Inspection Service began an investigation of allegations of sexual harassment at the Sioux Falls facility, that two of his subordinates were disciplined and ultimately appealed to the Board, that also in 1994 an investigation was begun of the matters leading to the current discipline against him, that he had been detailed out of his Sioux Falls office, that two agency officials told him that he would not be allowed to return to the plant because of the sexual harassment allegations, and that he was told by a third agency official that if he did not accept the EAS-21 position, charges would be brought against him. In the face of such impending charges, the appellant states: "If I had known that I would be giving up my only right to appeal to an objective finder of fact, I would never have relinquished my Manager, Processing and Distribution Center position." Thus, the evidence here is greater than and even more compelling than that in <span class="Italic">Exum</span>; that the appellant believed the only effect of his reduction in grade would be a reduction, not that there would be the additional, and potentially more serious, consequence of future loss of appeal rights, especially as certain investigations were proceeding against him. The record at this point also strongly suggests that the appellant was led to believe that if he took the demotion, he would not be subjected to a disciplinary action for a matter focused upon in these investigations. Moreover, as in <span class="Italic">Exum</span>, there is no showing that at the time he elected his reduction in grade, the appellant knew of the requirement that he serve for one year in the same or similar positions for Board jurisdiction to attach.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances, we find that the agency should have known that the appellant was acting under the erroneous impression that the only effect of his request for a reduction in grade would be such reduction, that the agency had an obligation to inform the appellant of the effects the change would have, and that the agency's information should have included a statement regarding the possible preclusion of Board appeal rights for a one-year period in his new position. <span class="Italic">See Exum</span>, 62 MSPR at 349.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the appeal is REMANDED for further consideration of the voluntariness of the appellant's reduction in grade and for the issuance of a new initial decision consistent with this Opinion. If the administrative judge finds that the appellant would not have accepted the reduction in grade if the agency had adequately informed him that he would temporarily relinquish his appeal rights, he must adjudicate the merits of the May 17, 1995 removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Exum</span> provided guidance in <span class="Italic">Kaiser v. Dept. of Army</span>, 75 MSPR 440, 443-45 (1997), concerning the treatment as a probationer of an employee who accepted reassignment to a job at a different location within an agency but who was not advised that he was being appointed from a register and with a new probationary period:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Briggs v. National Council on Disability</span>, 60 MSPR 331, 334, 336 (1994), we remanded a removal appeal for a jurisdictional hearing on whether, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the agency gave the appellant notice, prior to her appointment to an excepted service Executive Director position, that she was accepting a position that was of a confidential and policymaking character, in which she would have no Chapter 75 adverse action appeal rights. We noted that the agency claimed, but that the appellant denied, that she had been apprised of this significant change in her employment status. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 335-36. In <span class="Italic">Exum v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/EXUM_CHARLOTTE_BN_0752_94_0015_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_246173.pdf">62 MSPR 344</a>, 347-48 (1994), where jurisdiction was at issue in a removal appeal, we found that the agency had failed to apprise the appellant, upon her requested conversion from a full-time to part-time licensed practical nurse position that her conversion was under an appointing provision that was excluded from coverage under 5 USC Chapter 75. We stated there that the agency "had an obligation to inform the appellant of the effects that the agency change would have," and noted that neither the agency nor the record indicated that the agency had given the appellant prior notice of her loss of Chapter 75 adverse action rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 349-50.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant appeal, the appellant asserted in his submissions below that he was not apprised at any time prior to his acceptance of the GS-13 Industrial Hygienist position that he would be required to complete a new probationary period, and that had he been so informed, he would not have left his prior job as GM-13 Industrial Hygienist. The agency, in response to the administrative judge's jurisdictional show-cause order, argued, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the appellant was on notice as to the new probationary period. The agency claimed, in part, that such notice was derived from the recruitment bulletin for the position, which stated that delegated examining authority was being used.[1] Our review of the recruitment bulletin, reveals that the words "DELEGATED EXAMINING" were typed across the top of the vacancy announcement for the position. By no stretch of the imagination can this wording suffice as adequate notice to the appellant that he would be relinquishing his career status and forfeiting adverse action appeal rights if he were appointed to the GS-13 position. Indeed, one of the agency's own submissions, an Office of Personnel Management Interagency Advisory Group memorandum dated February 18, 1992 warns agencies that they have a duty to inform an employee that he is serving as a probationer because he has been appointed from a register, and notes that to fail to do so "simply is not a good way to do business."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The agency also argued that the appellant's original and revised SF-50s, which were approved on December 22, 1995, and January 4, 1996, respectively, were further notice of that probationary period. This argument, however, fails to address the question of whether the appellant had notice <span class="Italic">prior</span> to his appointment to the GS-13 position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given these facts, the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that he was not on notice that his appointment to the GS-13 position entailed a probationary period and a loss of adverse action appeal rights from his downgrade. <span class="Italic">See Exum</span>, 62 MSPR at 349-50; <span class="Italic">Briggs</span>, 60 MSPR at 336. As we stated in <span class="Italic">Exum</span> and as the appellant certainly claims here, the "obviously important effect" of the agency's failure to apprise him of his loss of adverse action appeal rights and therefore his decision to accept the GS-13 position, obligated the agency to give the appellant prior notice of the effect of his acceptance of the GS-13 position. <span class="Italic">Exum</span>, 62 MSPR at 349. For this reason, and because there is conflicting evidence on this matter of notice, which the administrative judge did not address, we must remand this appeal to the regional office for further consideration of this matter. Finally, we note that had the agency clearly notified this appellant PRIOR to offering him the new position that he probably would have to serve another probationary period, we would not have the situation now before us on appeal.</p>

USPS</span>, 111 MSPR 212, 215-17 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-12, 2009 MSPB 70 (2009), remanded for consideration of whether the appellant lost appeal rights through an agreement entered when he accepted reassignment from a prior, different position held long enough to confer appeal rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An employee must receive notice from his employing agency regarding the effect of a change in position before he can relinquish an agency appointment with adverse action appeal rights to accept another appointment within the agency that lacks such appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Clarke v. Department of Defense</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 559, &#x00B6; 11 (2006); <span class="Italic">Exum v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 344, 349-50 (1994). An employee who has not knowingly consented to the loss of appeal rights in accepting another appointment with the agency thus is deemed not to have "accepted" the new appointment and to have retained the rights incident to the former appointment; the Board may therefore exercise jurisdiction over an appeal of an adverse action against that employee. <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Department of Justice</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 404, &#x00B6; 6 (2000); <span class="Italic">Park v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no indication in the record that, prior to the appellant's reassignment to the PPO position, the agency notified him that he would lose his Board appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75. Although the memorandum of understanding that the appellant signed informed him that he would serve a 180-day probationary period and temporarily lose his right to grieve his separation from service through a negotiated grievance procedure under a collective bargaining agreement, it did not mention that he would temporarily lose his chapter 75 appeal rights as well, <span class="Italic">see Clarke</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 559, &#x00B6; 11 (before an employee accepts a new appointment within his current employing agency that results in a loss of chapter 75 appeal rights, the agency must so notify him); <span class="Italic">see also Chavies v. Department of the Navy</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 81, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (2006) (the agency's notification to the appellant that he would be required to serve a new probationary period was insufficient to put him on notice that he would be losing his chapter 75 appeal rights); <span class="Italic">Stoute v. Department of the Navy</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 409, &#x00B6; 13 (2005) (the employee's written acknowledgment that he would be required to serve a new probationary period was not inconsistent with his coverage under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511 and did not serve as an effective waiver of his rights under chapter 75).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue of Board jurisdiction is always before the Board and may be raised by either party or <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> by the Board at any time during a Board proceeding. <span class="Italic">Covington v. Department of the Army</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 9 (2000).

Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the acknowledgment order provided the appellant with notice concerning the Board's jurisdiction over Postal Service employee appeals generally, it did not provide him with notice concerning the Board's jurisdiction under the standard set forth above in cases such as <span class="Italic">Exum</span>, <span id="Page_184"></span>62 M.S.P.R. at 349-50, and <span class="Italic">Clarke</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 559, &#x00B6; 11. Furthermore, neither the agency's filings nor the initial decision notified the appellant about what is required to establish jurisdiction under that standard. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Department of Defense</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 493, &#x00B6; 16 (2008). Although the appellant did not cite <span class="Italic">Exum</span> or similar cases, he alleged below that he was a preference-eligible veteran with 8 years of service with the agency, implicitly arguing that the Board should take jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to the appeal rights that he enjoyed in his former position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the record on jurisdiction has not been adequately developed with regard to several important factual issues, we remand this appeal to afford the appellant proper jurisdictional notice and an adequate opportunity to establish jurisdiction over his appeal. <span class="Italic">See Burgess,</span> 758 F.2d at 643-44. The appellant shall have the opportunity to make a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction by alleging that he had chapter 75 appeal rights in his former Laborer/Custodian position, the agency failed to inform him that his appointment to the PPO position would result in a loss of chapter 75 appeal rights, and that he would have declined to accept the appointment if he had been so informed. <span class="Italic">See Exum</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. at 349-51. If appropriate, the administrative judge shall hold a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See Manning v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 742 F.2d 1424, 1428 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Exum</span> was applied to movement from one "agency" or major organizational component, the Bureau of Prisons, to another, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, within the Department of Justice in <span class="Italic">Edwards v. DOJ</span>, 86 MSPR 404, 406-08 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-11 (2000). When Mr. Edwards was not given advance notice of what turned out to be a probationary appointment at INS following his service as a tenured employee with the Bureau of Prisons, the Board reversed his removal from INS and ordered his reinstatement at INS. Logic might suggest that Mr. Edwards should have returned to the Bureau if his INS probationary appointment was obtained without his informed consent. Additionally, it is difficult to discern how Mr. Edwards' situation differed, as a practical matter, from that of an employee who moves from one agency to another and whose tenure does not survive the move because, under <span class="Italic">Park</span>, <span class="Italic">post</span>, "a new employing agency may not possess and cannot be expected to have specific knowledge of the terms of the potential employee's previous employment." Whatever the unstated doctrinal underpinnings of the Board's distinctions between intra-agency and inter-agency career moves, under <span class="Italic">Edwards</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee must receive notice from his employing agency regarding the effect of a change in tenure before he can relinquish an agency appointment with career tenure and adverse actions appeal rights to accept another appointment within the agency that lacks such tenure and appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Exum v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/EXUM_CHARLOTTE_BN_0752_94_0015_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_246173.pdf">62 MSPR 344</a>, 349-50 (1994). That rule depends, in part, on the principle that an employee has the rights incident to the position to which he is officially appointed. <span class="Italic">Anderson v. General Services Administration</span>, 56 MSPR 316, 320, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 12 F.3d 1069 (Fed. Cir. 1993), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 114 S. Ct. 2673 (1994). An employee who has not knowingly consented to the loss of career tenure and appeal rights in accepting another appointment with the agency thus is deemed not to have "accepted" the new appointment and to have retained the rights incident to the former appointment; the Board therefore may exercise jurisdiction over an appeal of an adverse action against that employee. <span class="Italic">See Park v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 78 MSPR 527, 534 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant asserted below, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that he was not apprised at any time prior to his acceptance of the District Adjudications Officer position with INS that he would be required to complete a new probationary or trial period, and that had he been so informed, he would not have left his prior permanent job as a Correctional Officer with BOP. He claimed that four or five days after he started working at INS, he was asked to sign documents relating to his appointment that he had never seen before. These documents for the first time informed him that his position with INS was a term appointment subject to a one-year trial period. He refused to sign them initially because he believed he had a verbal agreement with the agency that the INS position would be a permanent position not subject to a probationary or trial period, and he had just completed his probationary period in his prior BOP position. He eventually signed the documents on May 21, 1999, because he was told that if he did not, he would be terminated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response, the agency argued that the appellant was on notice as to the change in his tenure. The agency based this argument entirely on a Statement of Understanding For Term Appointment signed by the appellant on May 21, 1999, and by the agency on May 24, 1999, and referred to in the SF-50 converting the appellant to a Term appointment with INS. This statement says in pertinent part that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">3. I will serve a one-year trial period. During this time I will be entitled to the same limited protection accorded probationers. Procedures and rights to appeal termination for cause are described in Subchapter 8 of FPM Chapter 315, "Probation."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">4. I understand that I have the protection of adverse action of FPM Chapter 752 except (a) while serving a trial period (one year) and (b) upon expiration of my appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on this Statement of Understanding For Term Appointment, the AJ found that the appellant knowingly consented to the loss of his career tenure and appeal rights when he accepted the District Adjudications Officer position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency and the AJ incorrectly rely on the Statement of Understanding For Term Appointment. That statement cannot constitute notice of the appellant's change of tenure for purposes of consenting to the loss of his career tenure and appeal rights because it is undisputed that it was not read or signed by the appellant prior to his relinquishment of his BOP Correctional Officer position and acceptance of the INS District Adjudications Officer position on May 9, 1999. <span class="Italic">See Park,</span> 78 MSPR at 534 (an employee must receive notice from his employing agency regarding the effect of a change in tenure before he can relinquish an agency appointment with career tenure and adverse action appeal rights to accept another appointment within the agency that lacks such tenure).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the agency's failure to notify the appellant before he accepted his position with INS that he would be subject to a trial period and a loss of adverse action appeal rights, we find that the appellant did not knowingly consent to the loss of his career tenure and appeal rights in accepting the INS position and he, thus, is deemed to have retained the rights incident to his BOP Correctional Officer position. The Board therefore has jurisdiction over his removal appeal. We further find that, since the agency did not provide him with advance notice of the charges or the opportunity to respond to such notice before he was terminated, its action cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">See Tyler v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 62 MSPR 509, 513 (1994). Furthermore, because the Board has jurisdiction over the appellant's removal, he must be afforded an opportunity to develop and prove his allegations of discrimination based on race, gender, and disability, and reprisal for protected activity. <span class="Italic">See McLain v.

<p class="Body-Text">The aftermath of <span class="Italic">Edwards</span> was that following remand of the case for the AJ to consider Edwards' EEO allegations, the Board again considered the case through an enforcement petition seeking back pay and job restoration to the INS adjudications officer position. The Board noted that Edwards' appointment with INS was a one-year (term) position that commenced on May 9, 1999.

But <span class="Italic">Clarke</span> was distinguished in <span class="Italic">Rice v. MSPB</span>, 522 F.3d 1311, 1316-20 (Fed. Cir. 2008), determining that a statutory bar to appeal rights of individuals in certain intelligence agencies could not be overcome by a grandfathering of potential appeal rights from a prior position that was not held long enough to secure tenure before the reassignment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Rice also contends that she was not given sufficient notice at the time she accepted the appointment to the Naval Intelligence Command that she would no longer have the right to appeal to the Board from any adverse action. She argues that the notice that she was moving from a competitive service position to an excepted service position and the form that she signed acknowledging that she was voluntarily separating from the competitive service were not sufficient to advise her of the change in her Board appeal rights because the notice she was given was <span id="Page_185"></span>not sufficient to give rise to a "knowing and voluntary" waiver of those rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Rice first contends that in light of <span class="Italic">McCall v. United States Postal Service,</span> 839 F.2d 664 (Fed. Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">Reise v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 37 M.S.P.R. 364 (1998), and <span class="Italic">Ferby v. United States Postal Service,</span> 26 M.S.P.R. 451 (1985), she cannot be deemed to have waived her Board appeal rights unless she signed a written statement indicating that she knowingly waived those rights. We reject that argument. The cases on which Ms. Rice relies all deal with waivers signed in the context of "last chance" agreements. "Last chance" agreements are used to settle conflicts between employees and agencies; the employee typically agrees to waive Board appeal rights in exchange for favorable settlement terms allowing the employee a "last chance" to perform according to the agency's expectations. A "last chance" appeal waiver is very different from a change in appeal rights that accompanies the voluntary acceptance of an excepted service position. The former is a waiver of a right that attaches to the employee's ongoing position; the latter simply reflects a difference in the rights associated with one position occupied by the employee and another to which the employee has chosen to transfer. We decline to apply the same standard to the waiver of an existing statutory right to appeal to the Board (as in a last chance agreement) and to the waiver of Board appeal rights when an employee voluntarily accepts appointment to a position that carries different statutory appeal rights (as in the case of a transfer to a Defense Department intelligence agency).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on a line of Board decisions that includes <span class="Italic">Clarke v. Department of Defense,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 559 (2006); <span class="Italic">Park v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 527 (1998), and <span class="Italic">Exum v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 62 M.S.P.R. 344 (1994), Ms. Rice next argues that she could not lawfully be deprived of her right to appeal to the Board unless she was explicitly notified that she was losing her Board appeal rights when she accepted a position with the Naval Intelligence Command. She contends that because there is no evidence that she was notified of the loss of appeal rights, she retained her Board appeal rights from that time until her removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the administrative judge, Ms. Rice did not deny that she was informed of the change in her Board appeal rights; she simply stated that she did not recall having been so advised. Unsurprisingly, the agency was unable to introduce any evidence regarding any oral statement that may have been made at the time of Ms. Rice's appointment to the excepted service in 1985 regarding her appeal rights; the agency's evidence was limited in this regard to the written statement that Ms. Rice signed acknowledging that she was entering the excepted service and was being "taken out of the Competitive Service," and "volunteer[ed] to be separated from the Competitive Service." Based on that evidence, the administrative judge distinguished the cases on which Ms. Rice relied on the ground that she "did receive notice that she was relinquishing her rights as a competitive service employee to accept an excepted service position." Under those circumstances, the administrative judge held that she did not retain a right to appeal from her removal during the 20 years after her transfer to the excepted service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Rice responds that the administrative judge's opinion is contrary to the Board's decisions in cases such as <span class="Italic">Clarke,</span> <span class="Italic">Park,</span> and <span class="Italic">Exum.</span> Ms. Rice is correct that the Board cases on which she relies set forth a broad rule that, if applied in this case, would appear to accord Board appeal rights to a person in Ms. Rice's position, or at least call for a jurisdictional hearing as to whether she was given appropriate notice of the loss of her Board appeal rights that would result from her joining the excepted service. In <span class="Italic">Park,</span> for example, the Board stated the rule as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee must receive notice from his employing agency regarding the effect of a change in tenure before he can relinquish an agency appointment with career tenure and adverse action appeal rights to accept another appointment within the agency that lacks such tenure and appeal rights.... An employee who has not knowingly consented to the loss of career tenure and appeal rights in accepting another appointment with the agency is thus deemed not to have "accepted" the new appointment and to have retained the rights incident to the former appointment; the Board therefore may exercise jurisdiction over an appeal of an adverse action against that employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Park,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. at 534; <span class="Italic">see also Clarke,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. at 562-63; <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 404, 406 (2000). In the brief it filed as respondent in this case, the Board distinguishes some of the cases in that line of decisions on the ground that Ms. Rice was expressly advised that she was transferring from the competitive service to the excepted service. For that reason, the Board contends that, unlike in <span class="Italic">Exum</span>, the Navy had no reason to believe that Ms. Rice was under a misapprehension about the change in her appeal rights that resulted from her transfer to a new position, and unlike in <span class="Italic">Kaiser v. Department of the Army,</span> 75 M.S.P.R. 440 (1997), Ms. Rice was alerted to the fact that her job status was being changed in an important respect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">What the Board in its brief seems to overlook in characterizing those cases narrowly is that the Board's own rule is quite broad. It requires that the employing agency not merely advise the employee of the change in his job status, but that the agency expressly advise the employee regarding the loss of tenure and Board appeal rights that is attendant to that change. Moreover, under the Board's rule, at least as stated in the <span class="Italic">Edwards</span> and <span class="Italic">Park</span> cases, the agency's duty to advise the employee of the loss of Board appeal rights appears to apply without regard to whether there was evidence that the agency knew or should have known that the employee was operating under the misapprehension that the transfer to a new position would not result in the employee's loss of appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board case that is closest to this one is <span class="Italic">Clarke.</span> In that case an employee transferred from a non-intelligence component within the Department of Defense to an intelligence component and thereafter was involuntarily transferred to other positions within the intelligence component. The effect of the transfers was that, when she was removed from her position, she was statutorily ineligible to appeal the removal action to the Board. Because she had not been advised of, and did not knowingly consent to, the loss of her appeal rights, however, the Board held that she was "deemed to have retained the rights incident to her former position." 102 M.S.P.R. at 563. The Board therefore held that, even though she fell within 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(8), the Board had jurisdiction over her removal appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board, <span class="Italic">qua</span> litigant, makes two weak efforts to distinguish this case from the decision in <span class="Italic">Clarke,</span> issued by the Board <span class="Italic">qua</span> adjudicative body. First, the Board in its brief argues that because Ms. Clarke remained in the same position following her transfer, "the Board found that Ms. Clarke's appeal rights were impacted by 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1612(b)." In fact, the Board in <span class="Italic">Clarke</span> found that because Ms. Clarke changed positions twice after joining the intelligence component, she did <span class="Italic">not</span> have Board appeal rights by virtue of section 1612(b); that is the reason the Board in <span class="Italic">Clarke</span> invoked the <span class="Italic">Park</span> rule, which otherwise would have been unnecessary. Section 1612(b) therefore does nothing to distinguish this case from <span class="Italic">Clarke.</span> Second, the Board in its brief argues that under the circumstances, Ms. Clarke "could not have been expected to know that she was relinquishing her appeal rights," while Ms. Rice was informed "of her change in service status." While that much is true, there is no evidence that Ms. Rice was informed that one effect of her change in service status was that she would lose her Board appeal rights. Merely informing Ms. Rice that she was moving from the competitive service to the excepted service would not seem sufficient to satisfy the Board's standard, which requires that the employee "knowingly consent to the loss of her appeal rights." <span class="Italic">See Clarke,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. at 563.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For those reasons, we do not believe the Board's decisions cited above can be persuasively distinguished on the grounds offered by the Board in its brief (and the similar grounds offered by the Department of the Navy as intervenor). We need not decide whether we would adopt the rule set forth in the cite line of Board cases, however, because the Board's jurisdictional ruling can be affirmed on a different ground, as set forth below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1985 Ms. Rice took a position in the excepted service. At that point, her status as a non-preference-eligible employee in the excepted service meant that she did not have Board appeal rights, because the Civil Service Due Process Amendments, Pub. L. No. 101-376, 104 Stat. 461 (1990), which gave appeal rights to many such individuals in the excepted service, had not yet been enacted. In 1990, when the Civil Service Due Process Amendments statute was enacted, non-preference-eligibles in the excepted service were given Board appeal rights under the provision that became 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C). However, another provision of the same Act, which became 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(8), had the effect of denying Board appeal rights to all non-preference-eligible employees of "an intelligence activity of a military department covered under section 1590 of title 10." Six years later, in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, Pub. L. No. 104-201, &#x00A7; 1634, 110 Stat. 2422, 2753 (1996), Congress again amended section 7511(b)(8), this time adding the reference to "an intelligence component of the Department of Defense (as defined in section 1614 of title 10)," the language that the administrative judge relied on to hold that Ms. Rice was not entitled to appeal her removal to the Board. Thus, as of 1996, it was not Ms. Rice's status as an excepted service employee that barred her from having Board appeal rights, but rather her status as a non-preference-eligible employee of "an intelligence component of the Department of Defense" under section 7511(b)(8). Even if Ms. Rice had enjoyed Board appeal rights before 1990 or 1996, she would have lacked them afterwards because of the operation of that statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no suggestion that the 1990 and 1996 amendments to section 7511(b)(8) cannot be given their intended effect as to Ms. Rice because she was not told at the time of those amendments about the effect they would have on her Board appeal rights. By 1996, it was clear that that section 7511(b)(8) denied Board appeal rights to an employee in her <span id="Page_186"></span>position, and the statutory language is mandatory. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(8) ("This subchapter [sections 7511-7514 of title 5] does not apply to an employee--...whose position is within...an intelligence component of the Department of Defense"). Because Ms. Rice was working in an intelligence component at the time Congress excluded non-preference-eligible employees of such components from the Board's adverse action jurisdiction, the statute foreclosed her--then and at the time of her subsequent removal--from appealing to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In that setting, to "deem" an employee such as Ms. Rice not to have accepted the appointment in the Naval Intelligence Command in 1985 and to have remained a non-employee of that component until the time of her removal would base Board jurisdiction on a fiction. That fiction, moreover, would fly in the face of Congress's determination that an employee such as Ms. Rice should not have the rights created by sections 7511 through 7514 of title 5, including the right to appeal removal actions to the Board under section 7513(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Any failure in 1985 to give Ms. Rice explicit notice that non-preference-eligible employees in the excepted service lack Board appeal rights is insignificant in light of the amendments in 1990 and 1996 to section 7511(b)(8), which denied Board appeal rights to all employees of Defense intelligence components except for preference eligibles. Accordingly, without addressing whether notice of the loss of appeal rights might be required in other settings, as the Board has ruled, we hold that the Board lacks jurisdiction over Ms. Rice's appeal regardless of any failure to alert her to the loss of Board appeal rights when she first joined the excepted service.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alternatively argues that, even if he did not have Board appeal rights based on his service in the CCA position, he nevertheless retained his appeal rights from his former RCA position under the theory set forth in <span class="Italic">Exum</span>.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Exum</span>, the Board found that when an individual moved from a full-time position with Board appeal rights to a part-time position without Board appeal rights within the same agency, and the agency should have known that she was acting under the erroneous impression that her appeal rights would not be affected by the change, the agency was obligated to inform her of the effect that the change in position would have on her Board appeal rights. 62 M.S.P.R. 10 at 345-49.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the agency requests that we overrule <span class="Italic">Exum</span> and subsequent decisions relying on Exum.[9] We decline to do so here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;In requesting that we overrule <span class="Italic">Exum</span>, the agency erroneously asserts that the Federal Circuit "criticized <span class="Italic">Exum</span> and its progeny" in <span class="Italic">Rice v.

In <span class="Italic">Rice</span>, the Federal Circuit declined to decide whether it would adopt the rule set forth in <span class="Italic">Exum</span>, but instead found that regardless, the rule could not be applied to the facts at issue, where statutory amendments to section 7511 enacted after the appellant accepted her new position would have denied her Board appeal rights in that position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1319-20.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Alternatively, the agency requests that we narrow the application of <span class="Italic">Exum</span> to circumstances where the agency has reason to know that an employee erroneously believes that he will retain his appeal rights despite a change in position. However, at this time, we decline to overrule or narrow subsequent Board decisions applying an agency's duty to advise an employee of the loss of Board appeal rights regardless of whether there was evidence that the agency knew or should have known that the employee was operating under a misapprehension regarding the effect of moving to a new position with the agency. <span class="Italic">See Clarke v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we must determine whether, under the circumstances at issue here, the appellant raised a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction over his appeal based on the theory set forth in <span class="Italic">Exum</span> and its progeny. It is undisputed that the appellant was an employee with Board appeal rights in the RCA position when he accepted the CCA position, because he was preference eligible and served in that position continuously for more than a year. We further find that when, as here, the appellant was selected for the CCA position while he was serving in the RCA position, and the 5-day break in service only occurred because he was changing positions within the agency, the break in service does not preclude the application of the theory set forth in <span class="Italic">Exum. Cf. Williams-Hargraves v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">It appears undisputed that the agency did not explicitly inform the appellant that he would lose his Board appeal rights if he moved from <span id="Page_187"></span>the RCA position to the CCA position. However, the agency contends that it gave the appellant "sufficient information to understand he would waive his appeal rights by changing positions" because: (1) the CCA vacancy announcement stated that breaks in service were required and that the position was a temporary appointment not to exceed 360 days; and (2) the appellant's job offer letter for the CCA position stated that his appointment would be subject to a probationary period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, for a preference-eligible individual in the excepted service, such as the appellant, the absence or completion of a probationary or trial period is not determinative of whether he is an employee with Board appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Maibaum v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 234, &#x00B6; 9 (2011). Rather, the dispositive issue is whether the appellant satisfied the requirement of 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions, and service in a temporary appointment may be counted towards the completion of that requirement. Id.; see 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B). Although the appellant was aware that a break in service was required at the time that he changed positions, there is no indication that he understood the legal implications of the required break in service on his Board appeal rights.[10]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;However, the appellant has not directly asserted that he failed to understand the legal implications of the break.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not decide whether the information that the agency provided the appellant was sufficient to notify him that he would lose his appeal rights because regardless, for another reason, we find that he failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction over his appeal under the theory in <span class="Italic">Exum</span>. Under <span class="Italic">Exum</span> and its progeny, an appellant may only retain Board appeal rights from a former position if he establishes that he would not have accepted his new position with the agency if he had known of the resulting loss of appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Yeressian</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 21, &#x00B6; 13 (remanding an appeal for a jurisdictional finding regarding whether an appellant would have accepted a new position if he had known of the loss of appeal rights); <span class="Italic">Exum</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. at 350 (same). On remand, we ordered the appellant to submit evidence and argument regarding whether he would have accepted the CCA position if the agency had informed him that he would lose his appeal rights. In response, the appellant submitted a declaration under penalty of perjury, which stated, "At this point in time, I do not know whether I would have accepted the CCA position in April 2015 had I been informed by the [agency] that I would have allegedly lost my appeal rights." Because the appellant failed to allege that he would not have accepted the CCA position if he had known that he would lose his appeal rights, we find that he failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Mr. Williams again appealed to the Federal Circuit. The court affirmed the result reached by the Board. The court disavowed the soundness of the general approach of <span class="Italic">Exum</span>, while allowing for possible survival of appeal rights when a position move results from deceptive or coercive agency action, <span class="Italic">Williams v. MSPB</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20180611110">892 F.3d 1156</a>, 1162-63 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (cert. den., <span class="Italic">Williams v. MSPB</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/insco20190401h32">139 S. Ct. 1472</a> (2019)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, we turn to whether Mr. Williams has appeal rights before the Board under the <span class="Italic">Exum</span> rule. In <span class="Italic">Exum</span>, the Board held that an agency's failure to inform an employee that a voluntary change in position might lead to a loss of appeal rights could result in the retention of appeal rights. 62 M.S.P.R. at 349. Mr. Williams argues the <span class="Italic">Exum</span> rule should apply to him because the Postal Service failed to notify him that his change from a position with appeal rights (RCA) to a position without such rights (CCA) would result in a loss of appeal rights. We reject this argument and the <span class="Italic">Exum</span> rule. As we held in <span class="Italic">Carrow v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, an agency's failure to advise federal employees on the terms of their appointment "does not create appeal rights for positions as to which Congress has not given the Board appellate jurisdiction." 626 F.3d 1348, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board itself has limited the <span class="Italic">Exum</span> rule to transfers within the same agency. <span class="Italic">Park v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs</span>., 78 M.S.P.R. 527 (1998). In <span class="Italic">Park</span>, the Board explained that in intra-agency transfers, "the agency ha[s] all of the necessary information at hand to inform the appellant properly of the consequences of the acceptance of the new position." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 534-35. By contrast, "a new employing agency may not possess and cannot be expected to have specific knowledge of the terms of the potential employee's previous employment. It should not have the same obligation to advise the employee of all possible consequences of changing positions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 535.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Carrow</span>, we confirmed that <span class="Italic">Exum</span> does not apply to federal workers who transfer between agencies, but we relied on a different rationale than the Board. 626 F.3d at 1353-54. There, the appellant transferred from the Department of the Army to the Department of Veterans Affairs, from which he was subsequently removed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We explained that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[The statute] does not give the Board jurisdiction over an appeal from a removal by a person who does not qualify as an "employee."...By statute, [the appellant's] position with the DVA did not carry Board appeal rights, and the DVA's failure to advise Mr. Carrow of the terms of his appointment does not create appeal rights for positions as to which Congress has not given the Board appellate jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1353. Because <span class="Italic">Carrow</span> did not involve a federal worker who transferred within the same agency, we declined to "approve or disapprove the Board's rule in <span class="Italic">Exum</span> and its progeny" that an employee can retain appeal rights from a prior position for an intra-agency transfer. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1354.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although <span class="Italic">Carrow</span> involved an inter-agency transfer, its rationale is equally applicable to transfers within the same agency. Unlike the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Park</span>, our reasoning did not depend on the agency's lack of knowledge about the potential employee's previous appointment. Instead, the dispositive issue was whether an employee's position carries statutorily created appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The agency's failure to advise an employee cannot create appellate jurisdiction for positions that do not otherwise have appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. It makes no difference whether the employee transferred within the same agency or to a different agency. Thus, we specifically disapprove the <span class="Italic">Exum</span> rule, even for intra-agency transfers, and hold that an agency's failure to inform an employee of the consequences of a voluntary transfer cannot confer appeal rights to an employee in a position which has no appeal rights by statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our decision here is distinguishable from situations in which an employee with appeal rights is coerced or deceived into resigning or retiring. <span class="Italic">Covington v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs</span>., 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984). In those situations, our precedent makes clear that a seemingly voluntary act by an employee can be considered involuntary based on deceptive or coercive agency action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., id.; Middleton v. Dep't of Def</span>., 185 F.3d 1374, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 1999). And in those cases, we have held that an employee could exercise appeal rights to the Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By contrast, Mr. Williams made no allegation that he was misled or coerced into taking the new CCA position. He voluntarily applied, and was selected, for the CCA position. Taking on a new position often leads to various changes in benefits. The agency has no obligation to advise its employees of all the potential changes associated with a new job. And certainly the agency's failure to advise its employee on the full range of consequences associated with a new position does not make the employee's decision to accept the position involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Conceivably, there may be situations in which an agency coerces or deceives an employee into accepting a new position. We need not consider those scenarios here. Mr. Williams alleges only that the Postal Service failed to advise him on the loss of appeal rights that would result from his reappointment as a CCA. We hold that the agency's failure to advise Mr. Williams does not allow him to retain appeal rights from a prior appointment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to terminations of persons in Federal Career Internship Program appointments, <span class="Italic">Scull v. DHS</span>, 113 MSPR 287, 2010 MSPB 40 (2010), explained that an FCIP appointment is a temporary appointment and that if the appointment lapses, the separation of the employee is not an appealable adverse action unless that program participant has immediate prior service within the same agency as a career or career-conditional appointee and meets the definition of "employee" under 5 USC 7511 at the time of the FCIP appointment. If the appellant has that status, he has an appeal right to the Board if the FCIP internship was ended for reasons unrelated to misconduct or suitability. The appellant in <span class="Italic">Council v. MSPB</span>, 355 Fed. Appx. 398 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP), held a competitive service GS-6 supply clerk position. Council was then was selected to participate in a training program conducted under the Federal Career Intern Program in a GS-7 excepted service prosthetic representative trainee position. Less than a year into the training program, the employee was demoted to a GS-6 purchasing agent position. The court agreed that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the ensuing appeal. The employee's appeal rights were to be determined through the appointment he held when he was demoted--an excepted service position. The position before and during the excepted service job were not the same or similar. Although the employee had sufficient service as a competitive service appointee to have appealed from an adverse action involving that appointment, he lacked the requisite year of service as an excepted service employee with a year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions under 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(B). Before accepting the FCIP position, the employee entered into an agreement with the agency stating that the job was in the excepted service, that the employee was leaving the competitive service, and that the employee would be returned to his original, or a similar, grade and position, if he did not complete the training program. The court did not rule on the validity of that agreement.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_188"></span>The appellant also asserts that the AJ should have found that the agency had erred by failing to advise him that he would lose his acquired appeal rights upon his acceptance of the new position. The uncontested record evidence establishes that the appellant had completed more than 2 years of continuous service in his previous SCEP position prior to his acceptance of the SCEP position from which he was subsequently terminated. IAF, Tab 5, Exs. 2-3, 7 (regarding his appointment as a Student Trainee (Administration &#x0026; Support) from October 2, 2005, to April 1, 2008). The Board and its reviewing court have found that the completion of 2 years of continuous service in the same excepted service position satisfies the definition of employee under 5 U.S.C. 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii), notwithstanding the appellant's inability to satisfy the definition of employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i). <span class="Italic">See Van Wersch</span>, 197 F.3d at 1151; <span class="Italic">Beck v. General Services Administration</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 489, &#x00B6; 11 (2000). Thus, upon completing 2 years of continuous service in his previous SCEP position, the appellant had satisfied the definition of employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) and he had acquired appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d). The AJ's finding that the appellant did not acquire appeal rights in his previous SCEP position is legally erroneous because it impermissibly required the appellant to have satisfied the requirements of both 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) and (C)(ii) while in that position. <span class="Italic">See Van Wersch</span>, 197 F.3d at 1151; <span class="Italic">Beck</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 489</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an employee moves between positions within the same agency, and forfeits his appeal rights as a result of accepting the new appointment, the agency must inform the employee of the effect the move will have on his appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See Lopez</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 55, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">Exum v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 344, 349 (1994).

Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 527, 534 (1998). Thus, if an AJ finds that an appellant was not informed of the loss of his appeal rights and that he would not have accepted the new position if he had been properly informed of the loss of his appeal rights, the AJ should afford the appellant the appeal rights he possessed prior to accepting the new position. <span class="Italic">See Lopez</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 55, &#x00B6; 12; Park, 78 M.S.P.R. at 534; Exum, 62 M.S.P.R. at 350-51.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the uncontested record evidence establishes that the agency failed to inform the appellant that he would lose the appeal rights he had acquired in his former SCEP position prior to his acceptance of the SCEP position from which he was terminated. Indeed, the agency has consistently maintained that the appellant has never acquired appeal rights. However, the appellant did not assert in his sworn affidavit that he would not have accepted the new SCEP position if he had been informed that he would lose his appeal rights upon accepting the new position. Thus, the AJ must address that factual issue upon remand.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The decisions involving notice of loss of appeal rights through changes in positions within an agency are inapplicable to a new appointment following a substantial break in service. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams-Hargraves v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">When an employee, like the appellant in this matter, "moves between positions within the same agency, and forfeits his appeal rights as a result of accepting the new appointment, the agency must inform the employee of the effect the move will have on his appeal rights." <span class="Italic">Yeressian v.

The appellant served over 1 year in a prior position with the agency, and, therefore, as a preference eligible employee, he acquired Board appeal rights as a result of that service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B); <span class="Italic">Bates v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not give the parties notice regarding the burdens and elements of this issue below.

<p class="Block-Quote1">During the pendency of the instant appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a precedential decision that arguably has implications for the continued validity of the <span class="Italic">Exum-Yeressian</span> line of cases. <span class="Italic">Carrow v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 626 F.3d 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Specifically, the record does not show whether the agency informed the appellant of the legal effect of accepting the FAM position, and if not, whether the appellant would have accepted the position regardless. In any event, because <span class="Italic">Exum</span> and <span class="Italic">Yeressian</span> remain binding precedent, the administrative judge shall apply the standard set forth in those cases on remand.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Park v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 527, 534-35 (1998), the Board explained its rationale for the distinction between situations when an employee moves within an agency and when an employee moves to a new agency. In that case, the Board explained that, when an employee moves to a new position within the same agency, the agency has readily accessible information about the employee's new and previous positions, while, when an employee moves to a new agency, the new employer may not possess and cannot be expected to have specific knowledge of the employee's previous position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We see no reason to question that reasoning.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with the appellant's assertion that his removal appeal is now moot as a result of the administrative judge's rulings on jurisdiction in this matter. The Board has held that, when an employee has not knowingly consented to the loss of appeal rights in accepting another appointment with the agency and would not have accepted the new position if he had been properly informed of the loss of appeal rights, the remedy is for the appellant to retain the appeal rights he possessed prior to accepting the new position and for the administrative judge to adjudicate the merits of the removal appeal. E.g., <span class="Italic">Yeressian</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 21, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12, 14; <span class="Italic">Lopez v.

In her order on jurisdiction, the administrative judge correctly determined that the next step in this matter is adjudication on the merits of the removal action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Member Robbins dissented, raising points not addressed by the majority:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The problems with the <span class="Italic">Exum</span>-<span class="Italic">Yeressian</span> line of cases are manifold. To begin with, the plain language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) contains no exception for employees who do not understand their circumstances. Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that there is a statutory "gap" concerning employees with <span id="Page_189"></span>appeal rights who accept reassignments to positions without appeal rights, <span class="Italic">see Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 843-44 (1984), the agency with the authority to promulgate regulations under chapter 75, the Office of Personnel Management, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7514, has not filled the gap administratively.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, "[a]ppointment, not contract law, is the central concept" in federal employment. <span class="Italic">Bartel v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 14 M.S.P.R. 24, 36 (1982). The <span class="Italic">Exum-Yeressian</span> line of cases flies in the face of this principle by suggesting that the rights of a federal employee are not always determined by the statute that governs the employee's appointment but instead may depend upon whether there was a meeting of the minds between the employee and the agency at the time of appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A related principle is that parties cannot confer jurisdiction on the Board by agreement or consent where it otherwise does not exist. <span class="Italic">Metzenbaum v. General Services Administration</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 104, &#x00B6; 9 (2004); <span class="Italic">Waldrop v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 12, 15 (1996). If this is so, then a fortiori a party (the agency) cannot unilaterally confer Board jurisdiction by neglect, i.e., by failing to warn an employee of the effect of changing positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another problem with <span class="Italic">Exum</span> and <span class="Italic">Yeressian</span> is the confusion those decisions create. If an employee with appeal rights is truly deemed not to have accepted a reassignment to a position without appeal rights and to have retained the rights incident to his first position, it is difficult to explain which position the employee is considered to have been removed from and the remedy if the Board appeal is successful. <span class="Italic">Exum</span> and <span class="Italic">Yeressian</span> appear inconsistent in this regard. <span class="Italic">Compare Exum</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 419-20 (finding that the appellant's due process rights were violated and ordering her reinstatement to the position she held before her reassignment), <span class="Italic">with Yeressian</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 21, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12, 14 (directing the administrative judge to adjudicate the propriety of the appellant's removal from the position he held after he was reassigned).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The biggest obstacle to taking jurisdiction in this case under the <span class="Italic">Exum-Yeressian</span> doctrine is <span class="Italic">Carrow v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 626 F.3d 1348 (2010). There, an individual who had appeal rights while employed by the Army accepted a transfer to a position with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in which he was required to complete a new period of current continuous service before regaining appeal rights. When the VA separated him before he completed that new period of service, he appealed and argued that he should be considered to have retained his appeal rights because the VA had not warned him about the effect of accepting the transfer. The court disagreed. It observed that there was no "statutory or regulatory requirement" that the VA provide such a warning and held that the lack of such a warning could not "create appeal rights" for someone who does not fall within the plain terms of section 7511(a)(1). <span class="Italic">Carrow</span>, 626 F.3d at 1353. According to the court, the relevant inquiry was not what Mr. Carrow may or may not have known when he took the job at the VA but simply whether he met the plain terms of the statute at the time he was separated from the VA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that, in <span class="Italic">Carrow</span>, the court expressly declined to say whether <span class="Italic">Exum</span> and <span class="Italic">Yeressian</span> were correctly decided. 626 F.3d 1354. This was because it was "not necessary" for the court to do so, <span class="Italic">id</span>., inasmuch as Mr. Carrow moved from one agency to another rather than to a new position in the same agency. Nonetheless, the logic of <span class="Italic">Carrow</span> applies equally to the facts presented here. There is no statutory or regulatory requirement that an agency inform an employee who has appeal rights that by accepting a reassignment he will lose those rights. Further, an agency's failure to provide such information to an employee who is moving to another position in the same agency cannot "create appeal rights" where the employee does not meet the plain terms of the statute at the time of separation.</p>
