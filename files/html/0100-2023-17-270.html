<p class="noindent">A contract provision affecting leave entitlements need not, for purposes of application by an arbitrator, be tailored to benefit only adversely affected employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE</span>, 66 FLRA 62, 65 (2011) (Member Beck dissenting in part) ("[B]ecause an arbitration award necessarily applies an agreement provision to actual aggrieved parties, arbitration awards are inherently tailored to adversely affected employees, and the Authority does not conduct a tailoring analysis in resolving exceptions to arbitration awards. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Fed.

<p class="noindent">An arbitrator properly determines whether, under a provision of a negotiated agreement, or under 5 CFR 630.403 (allowing an agency to require a medical <span id="page_2207"></span>certificate when the agency determines it necessary for a request of sick leave of less than three days), an agency properly requires medical documentation to support a leave request, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, USP Marion and AFGE Local 2343</span>, 59 FLRA 811, 813 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Arbitrator found that the Agency had the right, through its supervisors, to make determinations of necessity for medical documentation. However, the Arbitrator added that supervisors must determine whether documentation is necessary in a reasonable manner. Applying the regulation to the facts of this case, the Arbitrator determined that the Agency had abused its discretion. The Arbitrator expressly found that the supervisors admitted that they had not previously required an employee to submit medical documentation "for such a short period [of time,]" that the grievant had explained to the supervisor that he had been treated previously by this physician for the same condition, and that the grievant had not been identified as an employee suspected of abusing sick leave. In effect, the Arbitrator found that the Agency had not properly determined that medical documentation was necessary.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's argument that the award in this case is contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6126 because it permits the grievant to accumulate credit hours in excess of the limit in that section. Section 6126, as plainly worded, precludes an <span class="Italic">employee </span>from accumulating, more than 24 credit hours for carryover. Section 6126 contains no limit on what an <span class="Italic">arbitrator </span>can do to remedy an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. In this case, the <span class="Italic">Arbitrator </span>awarded the hours; the grievant did not accumulate them. We note that, when Congress wanted to limit leave accrual as a remedy, it did so clearly. Specifically, in 1975, Congress amended the Back Pay Act to permit restoration of unlimited leave. Prior to that amendment, the Back Pay Act limited an employee who had experienced an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action to a remedy of 30 days of annual leave. S. Rep. No. 536, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 2, <span class="Italic">reprinted in </span>2 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2105, 2106 (1975). No similar limitation is contained in section 6126.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The legislative history to section 6126(a) provides evidence of Congress's intent in limiting the number of credit hours that may be accumulated. In particular, the legislative history states that the limitation was "necessary to ensure that credit hours are not accumulated and used as a basis for long term leave." S. Rep. No. 365, 97th Cong., 2 Sess. 12, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1982 USCCAN 565, 574. The award in this case will not result in the use of credit hours in a manner contrary to the purpose of the limitation. In this regard, the Arbitrator limited the awarded credit hours available for use by the grievant in any pay period to 24 hours, finding the limit "consistent with the credit hour program condition" contained in the Staff Bulletin, which is the same 24-hour limitation found in section 6126(a). The Arbitrator imposed this limit specifically to prevent the grievant from taking unlimited credit hours in any pay period, which "would be unfair to the Agency and inconsistent with the credit hour policy[.]" <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we find that the award in this case is not contrary to section 6126. In so doing, we note that the remedy awarded by the Arbitrator is a make-whole remedy.

We also note that awarding the grievant the total number of credit hours she would have earned but for the Agency's unwarranted suspension of the grievant from the credit hours program is consistent with the practice of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) in cases involving awards of leave under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g., Wilkins v.

<p class="noindent-1">...Annual leave is governed by chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code. OPM is responsible for prescribing regulations necessary for the administration of the annual leave provisions contained in that chapter. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6311. In interpreting those statutory and regulatory provisions, OPM has specifically held that an agency may require employees under a flexiplace agreement to continue to work at their alternative worksite when the agency's official duty site is closed due to extreme weather conditions. <span class="Italic">See</span> U.S. Office of Personnel Management, <span class="Italic">Telework: A Management Priority, A Guide for Managers, Supervisors, and Telework Coordinators; Appendix D, Frequently Asked Questions and Answers</span> (2003). The Authority normally defers to guidance from OPM on statutory matters that OPM is entrusted to interpret if that guidance constitutes a reasonable interpretation of the statutory language. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1978</span>, <span id="page_2208"></span>56 FLRA 894, 897 (2000). As OPM reasonably has found that it is lawful for an agency to require employees to report to duty at their alternative work site on a day when the official duty site is closed due to a snow emergency, we defer to the OPM guidance on this matter and find that the Union has not shown that the award is unlawful.</p>
<p class="noindent">"The Authority has ruled that recrediting of annual leave is appropriate when annual leave is taken to perform representational activities for periods when official time should have been granted, but was improperly denied." <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 1929</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-024.html">61 FLRA 122</a>, 126 (2005) (citing <span class="Italic">Veterans Admin.

<p class="noindent-1">The United States is immune from liability under the doctrine of sovereign immunity.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Lane v. Pena</span>, 518 U.S. 187 (1996). Sovereign immunity can be waived by statute, but a waiver will be found only if "unequivocally expressed in statutory text...and will not be implied[.]" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 192. Thus, a Federal agency will be subject to a monetary claim only if the statute on which the claim is based unambiguously establishes that the Government has waived its sovereign immunity to permit suit, and that the scope of that waiver extends to an award of money damages. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> <span class="Italic">See also INS, Los Angeles Dist., Los Angeles, Cal.</span>, 52 FLRA 103 (1996) (<span class="Italic">INS, Los Angeles</span>). As such, an award by an arbitrator that an agency provide monetary reimbursement for a grievant's medical co-pay and mileage must be supported by statutory authority to impose such a remedy. In the present case, for the reasons discussed below, neither the Back Pay Act nor the Statute provides the requisite statutory authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A government employee found to have been affected by an improper or unwarranted personnel action resulting in the withdrawal or reduction of pay, allowances or differentials may be made whole under the authority of the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(a). Here, there is no contention that the Arbitrator's remedy--the reimbursement of the grievant's co-pay and mileage--is based on a loss of pay, allowances, or differentials under the Back Pay Act. In this regard, we note that in denying the grievant's request for overtime pay, the Arbitrator found that "such an award would not be appropriate; the Grievant was not working at the time, and, therefore, the Arbitrator cannot find that 'but for' the Agency's violation, he would have received overtime." The grievant requested, and was granted, sick leave. He did not suffer a loss of pay, allowances, or differentials. Accordingly, the grievant is not entitled to reimbursement under the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has previously found that the remedial provisions of the Statute do not meet the strict test for waiver of sovereign immunity.&#x2003;Accordingly, the Authority will not award money damages that do not constitute pay, allowances, or differentials, without an express and unambiguous grant of authority to do so. <span class="Italic">See INS, Los Angeles</span>, 52 FLRA at 106, adopting <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Army v. FLRA</span>, 56 F.3d 273 (D.C. Cir. 1995). Here, neither the Union nor the Arbitrator pointed to any statute that would support a waiver of sovereign immunity in the circumstances of this case. In this regard, the Authority has explicitly held that an award of a grievant's personal medical expenses was precluded by sovereign immunity. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Transp., FAA</span>, 52 FLRA 46 (1996)<span class="Italic"> (FAA</span>).[6] Accordingly, we set aside the Arbitrator's award of money damages as contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin., Wilkes-Barre Data Operations Ctr.</span>, 28 FLRA 198 (1987), the Authority upheld an arbitrator's award requiring an agency to reimburse a grievant for the $56 she incurred in obtaining a medical certificate. There was no exception that such a monetary award was contrary to the Back Pay Act or that the remedy was barred by sovereign immunity. We will no longer follow this precedent, as is clear by this case and <span class="Italic">FAA, </span>52 FLRA 46, because it fails to follow the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The statutory authority for the granting of military leave for reservists of the uniformed services and National Guardsmen who are civilian employees of the Federal Government is contained in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323. Reservists and guardsmen are entitled to leave without loss of pay, time or performance or efficiency rating for up to 15 days in a fiscal year for training and, to the extent that the leave is not used in a fiscal year, allowed to accrue and accumulate leave for use in the succeeding fiscal year. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As interpreted and applied by the Comptroller General, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323(a) requires that in order for nonworkdays to be charged to military leave, they must occur wholly within the period of absence on military duty; that is, nonworkdays occurring at the beginning or end of the military training period are not charged to military leave. <span class="Italic">See</span> 27 Comp.

Applying 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323(a), the above-cited Comptroller General decisions, and the FPM Supplement, we find that in order for nonworkdays to be charged to military leave, they must occur wholly within the period of absence on military duty; that is, nonworkdays occurring at the beginning or end of the military training period are not charged to military leave.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The grievant is an Air Traffic Control Specialist at John Wayne Airport Air Traffic Control Tower, in Costa Mesa, California. He is also a Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves. On December 3, 1996, the grievant applied for two weeks of military leave for the period of February 16, 1997, through March 1, 1997. The Agency denied the grievant's request, basing its refusal upon the fact that some of the grievant's coworkers were scheduled to attend a training class during the second week, from February 23 through March 1. The grievant subsequently applied for, and was granted, annual leave for the first week. The grievant performed drills during that week....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties stipulated to the following issue to be resolved: "[w]as the disapproval of the [g]rievant's military leave request in accordance with <span id="page_2209"></span>applicable laws, rules, and regulations? If not, what is the proper remedy?" The Arbitrator noted the parties' additional stipulation that "military leave is not authorized for periods of inactive duty training[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Based upon the evidence before him, the Arbitrator concluded that the grievant had been scheduled for inactive duty. Accordingly, the Arbitrator held that "because the [g]rievant was not requesting military leave for a period of active duty, the leave was properly denied."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323 is the statutory authority for granting military leave to Reservists of the uniformed services and National Guardsmen who are civilian employees of the Federal Government. <span class="Italic">See National Guard Bureau, </span>42 FLRA 67. Specifically, with certain exceptions not relevant here, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323 entitles Federal Government employees to up to 15 days per fiscal year of "leave without loss in pay, time or performance or efficiency rating for active duty...as a Reserve of the armed forces or member of the National guard." A federal employee may receive his or her civilian pay through military leave, for the same period that he or she receives pay from the military for Reserve active duty.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, the Union contends that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323 does not govern this case, and that the award conflicts with the protections extended to employees by the USERRA, 38 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4301-4333. We disagree. As explained in <span class="Italic">National Association of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Local R1-109 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Newington, Connecticut,</span> 43 FLRA 1140, 1143-45 (1992) <span class="Italic">(VAMC Newington),</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 6323 and the USERRA's predecessor statute, the Veterans Re-employment Rights Act (38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2021-27), are not inconsistent statutory provisions. In that case, the Authority found that "5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323(a) involves only the accrual and use of <span class="Italic">military leave</span> for Federal employees required to attend military training[,]" while "38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2024(d) involves only the obligation to grant employees <span class="Italic">leaves of absence</span> to attend military training[.]" <span class="Italic">VAMC Newington</span>, 43 FLRA at 1144 (emphasis added). In this regard, and as recognized by the Arbitrator, the USERRA is inapplicable to a question of whether an employee is entitled to paid, military leave for the time that he or she performs Reserve duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the award demonstrates that the Arbitrator found that the issue, as stipulated, specifically concerned whether the Agency properly denied the grievant's application to use <span class="Italic">military leave </span>to perform Reserve duties. The parties also stipulated that military leave is not authorized for periods of inactive duty. In this connection, we note that military leave is granted only for periods of active duty. <span class="Italic">See supra </span>note 1. Consequently, the Union argued before the Arbitrator that the grievant requested leave for active duty, and was therefore entitled to use military leave for the period of his absence. However, the Arbitrator relied on the testimony of the grievant's commanding officer in finding that the grievant had been scheduled to perform two weeks of inactive duty. The Authority defers to an arbitrator's findings of fact. <span class="Italic">U.S. DOA, </span>53 FLRA at 1710. Accordingly, we find that the Agency properly denied the grievant's application for military leave because the grievant had not been scheduled to perform active duty in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's arguments to the contrary are unconvincing. The USERRA entitles any person "whose absence from a position of employment is necessitated by reason of service in the uniformed services" to the "reemployment rights and benefits and other employment benefits of this chapter...." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4312(a). Applying the USERRA to this case, it might be possible to find that the Agency should have granted the grievant's request for two weeks of leave, regardless of whether the request was for active or inactive duty. However, the stipulated issue in the arbitration concerned the propriety of the Agency's handling of the "military leave" request which is governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323. The required application of &#x00A7; 6323 to the issue in this case is underscored by the implementing regulations under Title 38, where the definitions section distinguishes between "military leave" and "leave of absence," the former being subject to &#x00A7; 6323. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Arbitrator addressed an argument by the Union that the Agency was obligated to grant the grievant's request for "annual leave for the [two week] period he requested" even if the period of service was for inactive duty. On this issue, the Arbitrator found that "there is no requirement that an employee's request for leave for inactive military duty trump all other obligations to other employees." The Arbitrator also found that "[t]he employer was under no duty...to accommodate the [g]rievant's request for leave<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. In making this determination, the Arbitrator did not consider whether the Agency was required by the USERRA to grant a request for leave to perform inactive duty. We find that the Arbitrator's statements in this regard are dicta, and therefore, there is no basis on which to consider whether they are contrary to law. The Arbitrator's resolution of the issue, as narrowly stipulated by the parties, is consistent with applicable law, i.e., 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323.</p>
<p class="noindent">Exceptions were denied as to an award finding that a grievance concerning leave accrual rates was untimely because, prior to the existence of the bargaining unit the matter was not raised under the administrative grievance procedure, and because the union lacked authority to file a grievance on the grievants' behalf under the parties' newly negotiated agreement. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 479 and Dept. of Air Force, NAS Pensacola</span>, 67 FLRA 284 (2014).</p>
