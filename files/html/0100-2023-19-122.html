<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-118"><span class="space">4.</span> Causal Connection: Misconduct Caused by Disease</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Moving beyond proof that the appellant is or was impaired, to prevail in a defense based on substance abuse or alcoholism, the appellant must show a causal connection between the problems leading to the personnel action and the disease. The appellant's misconduct must be the manifestation of his alleged disabling condition before the agency has a statutory or regulatory obligation to offer accommodation. <span class="Italic">Brinkley v. VA</span>, 37 MSPR 682, 684-88 (1988), considered causation. Appellant was a pharmacy technician who was charged with theft of Darvon. His defense was that he took the drug to "help him come off of cocaine." The charged misconduct did not result from a disabling condition:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge further found that the appellant's handicap caused his misconduct, citing the appellant's testimony that he stole the Darvon to help him come off of cocaine....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish an affirmative defense of handicap discrimination, an appellant must first prove that he suffers from a handicap and that his handicap caused his misconduct or that the misconduct was entirely a manifestation of his handicap. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Richardson</span> <span class="Italic">v. United States Postal Service,</span> 613 F. Supp. 1213, 1215-16 (D.C.D.C. 1985); <span class="Italic">McCaffrey v. United States Postal Service</span>, 36 MSPR 224, 224 (1988). In finding that the appellant was handicapped, the administrative judge cited <span class="Italic">Downing v. Department of the Navy</span>, 16 MSPR 388 (1983), for the proposition that proof of a drinking or drug abuse problem is sufficient.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recently overruled <span class="Italic">Downing</span>, holding instead that the presence of a drug or alcohol problem alone is insufficient to establish a handicapping condition within the scope of 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(a)<span class="Italic">. McCaffrey,</span> 36 MSPB at 224 n.6. In <span class="Italic">McCaffrey</span> the Board held that to establish an alcohol or drug handicap, an appellant must provide evidence: (1) Showing a pattern of drug use and its ill effects and (2) from medical or diagnostic experts as to whether that pattern along with the other symptoms demonstrated by the appellant constitutes the handicap of drug or alcohol abuse. It noted that the expert evidence may include: (1) Objective clinical findings such as test results and observation of physical signs; medical diagnoses based on evaluation; and (3) evaluation and assessment by a non-medical expert in the field of drug rehabilitation, such as a qualified Employee Assistance Program Counselor. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 229-30.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find here, however, no need to determine whether the appellant met these evidentiary standards because we agree with the agency that the appellant failed to present sufficient evidence to establish a causal connection between the agency's charges and his alleged handicap.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the appellant did not show that he was under the influence of any controlled substance or alcohol either when he stole the Darvon or later when he returned to work. While it is undisputed that the appellant took Darvon to relieve some of the pain caused by "coming down off of" the cocaine, he did not prove that he was suffering from any drug or alcohol effects when he stole the Darvon. Nor was there any evidence that he consumed any Darvon at the time he stole the capsules. Indeed, the large number of capsules found in his possession suggests that he did not take them because of any concurrent physical pain; rather, he stole them for some unspecified future use. Concerning the second charge, the appellant testified that he was under the influence of alcohol when he was arrested. Even if this is true and supports the appellant's claim that he was handicapped by alcohol abuse, the agency's charge is based primarily on the appellant's possession of drugs, including the Darvon, when he was arrested.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, even assuming the appellant stole the Darvon to alleviate the present or future effects of his cocaine use, it is irrelevant to and must be distinguished from his criminal intent to commit theft of government property entrusted to his care. Once this intent is proven, it is immaterial that the appellant may also have had some secondary, or even overriding intent, which is more properly labeled a motive. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Kabat,</span> 797 F.2d 580, 587-88 (8th Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span> __U.S.__, 107 S. Ct. 1958, 95 L. Ed.2d 530 (1987). Here, as previously noted, the appellant failed to show that he was so impaired at the time of the theft that he lacked control over his actions. Therefore, he has not shown that any handicapping condition related to drug or alcohol use vitiated his intent to steal the drugs. Moreover, there is no indication that the appellant was unable, due to his alleged impairment, to return the property and ask for help after the incident. He did not admit the theft, however, until he was confronted with the evidence almost two weeks later. We find, therefore, that the appellant has failed to establish a direct connection between any alleged handicapping condition from which he suffers and his misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here we are adopting the same causation standard we have applied in other mental and physical handicap cases.[4] <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Ensinger v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 36 MSPR 430 (1988); <span class="Italic">Curry v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 35 MSPR 301 (1987); <span class="Italic">Conti v. Department of the Army</span>, 34 MSPR 272 (1987). In each of these cases, the Board recognized the distinction between misconduct committed by a handicapped employee that is a manifestation of a mental or physical handicap, and misconduct committed by a handicapped employee that is not caused by the handicap. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Ensinger,</span> the Board found that although the appellant sought help for a condition of anxiety and stress, he failed to establish a causal connection between an alleged mental handicap of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and the misconduct with which he was charged--failing to carry out assigned work by deliberately misrepresenting and falsifying official documents. The Board found that the appellant's anxiety disorder very likely resulted from the stress of impending disciplinary action for his misconduct, not from his alleged handicap.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In doing so, however, we note that we are modifying our decision in <span class="Italic">Ruzek v.</span> <span class="Italic">General Services Administration,</span> 7 MSPB 307, 7 MSPR 437, 444 (1981). In <span class="Italic">Ruzek,</span> we held that rehabilitative assistance is mandated before discipline may be imposed for performance or misconduct problems "related to" alcoholism. Here, we find that the problems must be "caused" by the addictive condition before rehabilitative assistance must be afforded. In this regard, we overrule <span class="Italic">Green v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 31 MSPR 152 (1986), as to its findings on the causation issue. We note that although <span class="Italic">Green</span> recited that the administrative judge had found causation in the initial decision, the full Board did not specifically address that issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Curry</span>, the Board rejected the appellant's assertion that her epilepsy caused her to fail to report some incidents, leading to her removal for falsification of official documents. The Board noted that although the appellant's doctor acknowledged that it was plausible that the appellant could have had some memory lapses, loss of memory of a large block of time was rare. Moreover, the medical evidence showed that the appellant was normal with respect to memory, judgment, intelligence, orientation, and consciousness. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 306.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, in <span class="Italic">Conti</span>, the Board found that although the evidence established that the appellant was a qualified handicapped employee, it also showed that his poor performance was unrelated to his physical handicap of poor vision. It found that the appellant had previously performed satisfactorily and that neither his handicap nor his critical elements had changed since then. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 277-78<span class="Italic">. See also Turner v. Department of the Army,</span> EEOC Petition No. 03830069 at 3 (November 1, 1983) (the Commission <span id="Page_3538"></span>concluded that the agency did not discriminate against the petitioner on the basis of a claim of an alcohol handicap, noting that the petitioner had denied any state of intoxication as a direct or contributory factor causing him to assault his supervisor); <span class="Italic">Clancy v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Navy,</span> 6 MSPB 173, 6 MSPR 196, 200 (1981) (nervous condition not shown to be basis for unauthorized possession of government property, absence without authority and tardiness).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our adoption and application of these precedents to misconduct cases presenting defenses of alcohol or drug handicaps is further supported by the narrow scope and purpose of the Rehabilitation and Abuse Acts.[5] These statutes afford employees accommodation only from adverse actions based solely on their alcohol and drug abuse. They do not prohibit an agency from discharging or otherwise disciplining an employee for misconduct when the adverse action is, as here, based solely on the conduct itself.[6] Any other rule would provide a shield for the drug or alcohol user from the disciplinary consequences of independent misconduct that non-drug users or alcohol consumers or physically and mentally handicapped employees who commit identical acts of misconduct cannot share.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 USC &#x00A7; 791 <span class="Italic">et seq.;</span> the Drug Abuse Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act, 42 USC &#x00A7; 290ee-1; and the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Act, 42 USC &#x00A7; 290dd-1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;&#x00A7; 290dd-1(c) of the Alcohol Abuse Act and &#x00A7; 290ee-1(c) of the Drug Abuse Act each provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">This section shall not be construed to prohibit the dismissal from employment of a Federal civilian employee who cannot properly function in his employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nothing in the Acts suggests that alcoholics and drug abusers should be treated more favorably in disciplinary situations than other physically or mentally handicapped or non-handicapped employees. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Richardson,</span> 613 F. Supp. at 1215-16; <span class="Italic">Spragg v.</span> <span class="Italic">Campbell,</span> 466 F. Supp. 658, 660-61 (D. S. Dak. 1979).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the limited and specific scope of the Rehabilitation and Abuse Acts, we conclude that their accommodation requirement does not encompass adverse actions not caused by the alleged drug or alcohol handicap.[6] Since, as we have found, the appellant's misconduct is not the manifestation of his alleged handicapping condition, the agency had no statutory or regulatory obligation to offer him accommodation. The agency's failure to do so cannot be a reason for reversing its removal action. Accordingly we sustain the appellant's removal on the admitted theft charges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;This situation sharply contrasts with <span class="Italic">School Board of Nassau County v. Arline,</span> 480 U.S. 273, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 94 L. Ed.2d 307 (1987). There, the employee was terminated because of a fear of contagiousness directly associated with the underlying disease of tuberculosis. Here, the agency's action was based solely on appellant's theft and in no way depended upon even a perception of a handicap.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Schaffer v. USPS</span>, 39 MSPR 153, 156-57 (1988), added as to a charge of involvement in distribution of marijuana that the appellant must demonstrate that at the time of the misconduct he was under the debilitating influence of drugs:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was not discharged because of his alleged drug addiction, but primarily because of his misconduct in aiding marijuana distribution. The proposing and deciding officials both testified at the hearing that they made the decision to remove the appellant based on the nature and gravity of the distribution charges. The administrative judge erred in assuming that, because the appellant's distribution offenses involved marijuana, they necessarily resulted from a handicapping condition. While the appellant may have been immersed in the drug milieu, as the administrative judge found, and may have used marijuana, this does not itself establish a causal relationship between his alleged handicapping condition and the specific distribution misconduct. There is no evidence in the record that the appellant was under the debilitating influence of marijuana at work or at the time he offered to help his fellow employee secure marijuana. The appellant does not claim, and the record evidence does not indicate, that his analytical judgment or free will was impaired by controlled substances at the time he committed the sustained misconduct. Thus, the acts of misconduct were not the result of the appellant's handicapping condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency, therefore, did not have a duty to offer rehabilitative assistance to the appellant prior to its taking a disciplinary action for his drug distribution activities. <span class="Italic">See Brinkley</span> at 688; <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> at 696.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Simms v. USPS</span>, 39 MSPR 308, 311 (1988), summarized causation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In order to prove causation, the appellant must show that he was under the direct influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the misconduct, and that his misconduct was the concurrent product of mental or physical impairment caused by such influence. The extent of impairment must be such that the appellant lacks control over his actions, i.e., that his capacity for analytical judgment, intent, and/or free will is diminished.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Campbell v. DLA</span>, 37 MSPR 691, 694-96 (1988), made more explicit the distinction between casual use and impairment, and summarized the need for expert evidence of addiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish an affirmative defense of handicap discrimination because of drug addiction, an appellant must first establish that he or she is a drug addict as distinguished from merely a drug user. <span class="Italic">McCaffrey v. United States Postal Service</span>, 36 MSPR 224, 229 (1988). Second, an appellant must prove that the misconduct for which the agency's discipline was imposed occurred while under the influence of a controlled substance. <span class="Italic">Brinkley v. Veterans Administration</span>, 37 MSPR 682, 685 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the appellant was handicapped, the administrative judge relied on the appellant's testimony of marijuana use, the fact that her appraisals showed a decline in performance, and the testimony, given at the hearing on the appellant's indefinite suspension, of her second-line supervisor, that the appellant occasionally returned from lunch in an apparently intoxicated condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although this cumulative evidence falls short of the <span class="Italic">McCaffrey</span> standard, the appellant did not have the benefit of the Board's guidance there in preparing her case.[2] Therefore, we assume <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant would, upon remand, be able to prove she was a drug addict at the time of her removal. We further find, however, that she has failed to present sufficient evidence to establish a causal connection between her misconduct and her alleged handicap of drug addiction. Therefore, we conclude that this case is controlled by our recent <span class="Italic">Brinkley</span> decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Under the <span class="Italic">McCaffrey</span> evidentiary standard, an appellant must: (1) Demonstrate a pattern of drug use and its effects and (2) provide evidence from medical or diagnostic experts as to whether that pattern, along with other symptoms demonstrated by the appellant, constitutes the handicap of drug addiction or abuse. <span class="Italic">McCaffrey,</span> 36 MSPR at 229. Expert evidence may include: (1) Objective clinical findings such as test results and observation of physical signs; (2) medical diagnoses based on evaluation; and (3) evaluation and assessment by a non-medical expert in the field of drug rehabilitation, such as a qualified Employee Assistance Program Counselor. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 229-30. Testimony from the appellant, family, and friends will not generally be sufficient by itself to establish a drug condition of sufficient severity to constitute a handicapping condition. Evidentiary weight will not be afforded to conclusory expert opinions<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant does not claim, and the record evidence does not otherwise indicate, that her analytical judgment or free will was impaired by drugs at the time she committed the sustained misconduct. Although she argues that she sold drugs to finance her own use of drugs, she did not prove that she was suffering from any drug effects when she sold the marijuana or when she was later arrested on agency premises with the drug in her possession. Thus, it is clear on this record that the agency removed the appellant solely on the basis of her misconduct which stands separate and apart from her alleged drug addiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor can the appellant's claim of general marijuana dependency insulate her from discipline for willful acts of misconduct committed independently from that condition. Her alleged need for drugs or money to support her drug habit does not, in and of itself, equate with a finding of impairment. <span class="Italic">See Brinkley</span> at 686. Even crediting the appellant's allegation that she sold marijuana to finance her own marijuana addiction, that fact is irrelevant to and must be distinguished from her intent to possess and distribute drugs in such a manner as to adversely affect the employer-employee relationship. Once this intent is proven, as it has been in this case, it is immaterial that the appellant may have had some secondary intent or other motive. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We reiterate that the appellant has not shown that, at the time she possessed the drugs with the intent to distribute them, her mental faculties were impaired to the extent that she lacked self control over her actions. Therefore, she has not shown that any handicapping condition related to her marijuana abuse vitiated her criminal intent to possess and distribute drugs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore conclude that, because the appellant has not shown that her criminal misconduct was caused by her alleged handicapping condition, she does not qualify for the accommodation obligation of the Rehabilitation and Drug Abuse Acts, and, therefore, the agency's decision to remove her rather than offer her rehabilitation cannot be a legal basis for reversing the agency's action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Causation was also an element in the analysis of alcohol or substance dependency in <span class="Italic">Burton v. USPS</span>, 112 MSPR 115, 121-22 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-17, 2009 MSPB 157 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding his claim of disability discrimination, the appellant asserts that his alcohol and drug addictions establish that he was substantially limited in his ability to work. The appellant explained in his oral response to the notice of proposed removal that, "late in his career, he experimented <span id="Page_3539"></span>with crack cocaine," that he "also began to drink alcohol more frequently," and that due to a back injury, "he then began using prescription pain medications along with the crack cocaine and the alcohol." He then went on to assert that he became "[an] other person" under the influence of the drugs and alcohol and that "it was this other person that he had become that committed [the] offenses."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish an affirmative defense of disability discrimination, an appellant must first prove that he suffers from a disability and that it caused his misconduct or that the misconduct was entirely a manifestation of his disability. <span class="Italic">Brinkley v. Veterans Administration</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 682, 684 (1988). We need not determine whether the appellant has established that he was addicted to alcohol or drugs.[3] Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that he has, his claim that his addiction caused his personality to change, and that this in turn led him to engage in misconduct, is insufficient to establish that his misconduct was caused by, or entirely a manifestation of, his addiction. <span class="Italic">See Noguera v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 156, 161 (1990) (the appellant's claim that he suffered a general loss of judgment because of his abuse of the drug to which he was addicted cannot insulate him from discipline for the willful acts of misconduct committed independently from that condition).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by the Americans with Disabilities Act, excludes current illegal drug users from its protection. <span class="Italic">Little v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 574, 581-82 (1995). Thus, to the extent that the appellant claims his behavior was a product of his addiction to illegal drugs, his allegations could not support a finding of disability discrimination even if he could establish such an addiction and meet the causal connection test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, even if the appellant had established that he was addicted to alcohol or legal drugs, and even if he had established that his misconduct was caused by or was entirely a manifestation of his addiction, he still would not have established that his removal constituted disability discrimination. Neither the Rehabilitation Act nor the Americans with Disabilities Act immunizes disabled employees from being disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, provided the agency would impose the same discipline on an employee without a disability. <span class="Italic">Laniewicz v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 477, &#x00B6; 5 (1999). The appellant has not established that the agency retained nondisabled employees after those employees committed similar offenses. As we have indicated above, the comparison employees to whom he has referred were charged with misconduct materially different from the misconduct with which he was charged, and their circumstances otherwise materially differ from his.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant appears to argue that the agency should have accommodated his addictions by providing him with an opportunity to obtain treatment. Although the Rehabilitation Act requires agencies to provide accommodation to employees who are otherwise qualified for their jobs, employees who have committed misconduct are not "otherwise qualified." <span class="Italic">Laniewicz</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 477, &#x00B6; 8. Because the appellant engaged in misconduct, the agency had no obligation to accommodate his addictions. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> </p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency does not deny the causal relationship between alcoholism and the absences leading to removal, the Board may accept the relation as established. Under older law, lacking agency accommodation through an offer of rehabilitative assistance and permission to take sick leave for treatment before taking disciplinary action, the removal would be reversed. <span class="Italic">Mayers v. District of Columbia Gov't</span>, 21 MSPR 144, 147 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The employee may deny that misconduct was the product of alcoholism but claim a disability discrimination defense. The Board looks to the evidence rather than to the pleadings or the appellant's contentions to determine if the employee was an alcoholic and if the disease caused the charged offense, <span class="Italic">Tate v. DOD</span>, 57 MSPR 180, 186-89 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record before us presents an anomalous situation where the appellant pled an affirmative defense of handicap discrimination based upon alcoholism, but denied throughout the hearing that he was ever intoxicated while on duty and further presented no evidence that he is an alcoholic. Based upon these facts, the administrative judge found that the appellant was not an alcoholic and that he had not shown that his misconduct was caused by alcoholism. Thus, he rejected the appellant's affirmative defense of handicap discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that the evidence of record is sufficient to show that the appellant is addicted to alcohol, as opposed to merely being a user, despite the appellant's denial of intoxication on duty.[2] <span class="Italic">See McCaffrey v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 36 MSPR 224, 229 (1988). Charles Braswell, the Employee Assistance Program Coordinator, testified that the appellant participated in an outpatient treatment program for alcoholism in 1981, and that he participated in an inpatient treatment program in 1988, and was given advanced sick leave by the agency in order to do so. The appellant also participated in follow-up aftercare. In February 1991, the appellant again requested assistance and was referred by "sources" for treatment of his alcoholism but, according to Braswell, the appellant decided that he was not yet ready to participate in further treatment programs. Moreover, Mr. Ward, a co-worker, testified that it "was normal" to smell alcohol on the appellant's breath and that he did "most of the work, most of the time" when he and the appellant worked together because the appellant was unable to function due to drinking.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;During his testimony, the appellant was never specifically questioned as to whether he believed that he was an alcoholic. Also, he denied intoxication while on duty and said that he was suffering from "stress" when he went to the Employee Assistance Program Coordinator, Charles Braswell, in February 1991. Denial may be a manifestation of the disease of alcoholism<span class="Italic">. See Clement v. United States</span>, 772 F. Supp. 20, 27 (D. Maine 1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, [No. 91-1839] (1st Cir. [Nov. 25,] 1992); <span class="Italic">Terry v. Department of the Navy</span>, 39 MSPR 565, 570 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Chick v. Department of the Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 275, 278 (1991), the Board found an appellant to be an alcoholic largely on the basis of testimony by an Employee Assistance Program Coordinator, even in the face of denial of the condition and refusal to seek outpatient or inpatient treatment, where the appellant was absent from work due to incarceration for driving while under the influence of alcohol. In <span class="Italic">Chick</span>, the Board also concluded that the agency knew of the appellant's alcoholism. Similarly, here, in light of the appellant's intoxication while on duty on two occasions, his participation in the Employee Assistance Program, and his advanced sick leave for treatment at an inpatient facility, we find that the appellant is an alcoholic, as opposed to merely being a casual user of alcohol, and that the agency had knowledge of his handicap.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find here that the appellant's handicap caused his misconduct of being intoxicated and unfit to perform the duties of a Forklift Operator on February 1, 1991 and February 26, 1991, and his AWOL on both dates. As held in <span class="Italic">Brinkley v. Veterans Administration</span>, 37 MSPR 682, 684 (1988), to establish an affirmative defense of handicap discrimination, an appellant must first prove that he suffers from a handicap and that his handicap caused his misconduct or that the misconduct was entirely a manifestation of his handicap. As further held in <span class="Italic">Gleim v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 47 MSPR 502, 507 (1991), the determination of causation depends on the circumstances of a particular case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because it is established that the appellant is an alcoholic, the misconduct of intoxication on duty on February 1, and February 26, 1991, the appellant's leaving the worksite without permission and AWOL on February 1, 1991, immediately prior to his being intoxicated while on duty that same day, and his AWOL on February 26, 1991, just after being intoxicated while on duty, were more likely than not caused by the appellant's alcohol addiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was apparently in the midst of "binge" drinking on February 1, 1991. As the administrative judge found concerning the events of February 1, 1991, the appellant testified that he had been drinking until 3:00 am on January 31, 1991; his tour of duty commenced at 6:15 am. Employee Perry testified that he was ordered to work with the appellant as part of a team on February 1, 1991, and that after working together for a few minutes, the appellant stated that he had something to do, left the assigned work area, and never returned to the work area. When the appellant was finally found at 2:00 pm, he was incontrovertibly intoxicated. Thus, the "binge" had begun sometime on January 31, 1991, and had continued until at least 2:00 pm on February 1, 1991. The Board has held that the charged misconduct is related to the handicapping condition of alcoholism, when the misconduct is a product of "binge" drinking<span class="Italic">. See Corral v. Department of the Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 209, 212 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the intoxication and AWOL on February 26, 1991, as the administrative judge found, Charles Wade the appellant's supervisor, testified that as he was filling out a pass for the appellant to go to the Depot dispensary at about 8:40 am on February 26, 1991, he smelled alcohol on the appellant's breath. Some 15 or 20 minutes later, Wade telephoned the dispensary to find out if the appellant was intoxicated, and the nurse on duty told him that the appellant was in no condition to work because he was intoxicated. After more time had passed, Wade again telephoned the dispensary. The nurse told him that she had released the appellant to go back to Wade's office, not to return home, and that the appellant had left the dispensary. The appellant did not return to work on February 26th nor did he request leave. Thus, Wade placed him on AWOL for the remainder of the day. Because the appellant's supervisor smelled alcohol on the appellant's breath in the morning on February 26, 1991, it is likely that the appellant had begun drinking the night before or had begun on the morning on February 26th. Thus, the conclusion is inescapable that there is a direct relationship between the appellant's addiction, the intoxication resulting from his addiction, and the misconduct resulting from his addiction on February 26, 1991<span class="Italic">. See Holley v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 46 MSPR 80, 83-84 (1990); <span class="Italic">Brinkley v. Veterans Administration</span>, 37 MSPR at 684-85<span class="Italic">.

A defense based on alcoholism was rejected when the Board determined that the appellant admitted in reply to the agency's notice of proposed removal that he had been AWOL for reasons unrelated to his alcoholism, e.g., home electrical problems, a dental appointment, and illness.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">O'Connor v. VA</span>, 59 MSPR 653, 659 (1993), summarized Board law on proof and causation in affirmative defenses based on chemical dependency when removal is based on conviction for distribution of a controlled substance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish his claim of handicap discrimination based on his "chemical dependency," the appellant must establish that he suffers from a handicap and that his handicap caused his misconduct or that the misconduct was entirely a manifestation of his handicap<span class="Italic">. See Brinkley v. Veterans Administration</span>, 37 MSPR 682, 684 (1988). To establish a handicapping condition, the appellant must provide evidence from himself concerning his pattern of drug abuse and its ill effects, and from medical or diagnostic experts that that pattern, along with his other symptoms, constitutes the handicap of drug or alcohol abuse<span class="Italic">. See McCaffrey v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 36 MSPR 224, 229 (1988). Here, the appellant testified that he had been abusing drugs and alcohol since he was 19 years old (he is now 34), and that he had a bad marijuana habit during the time, from 1987-1989, when he was transporting marijuana. He was unable, however, to present medical or other expert testimony regarding his use of marijuana and its effect on him during that period. The doctor who treated the appellant did not begin seeing him until May of 1989. In any event, even if we find that the appellant has established that he was addicted to marijuana, he has not shown that his addiction caused his misconduct. This defense must therefore fail.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The employee may be charged with several acts of misconduct over a short period of time, some caused by alcoholism, some not. Even if the agency fails to accommodate properly for the misconduct caused by the disease, the agency may take discipline on the somewhat related actions of the employee that cannot definitely be attributed to alcoholism. As to the latter offenses, the Board may consider the appellant's illness as a mitigating factor if there is a potential for rehabilitation of the employee--a matter that can call into question the employee's contrition for his actions and his willingness to seek treatment for alcoholism. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tate v. DOD</span>, 57 MSPR 180, 190 (1993) (sustaining removal: some AWOL was a product of alcoholism, but other AWOL and threats were not caused by the disease). If some incidents are alcohol-related and others are not, the agency need not follow accommodation rules as to the unrelated misconduct. <span class="Italic">Peru v. DOJ</span>, 22 MSPR 52, 58 (1984), <span class="Italic">followed</span>, <span class="Italic">Stephenson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 40 MSPR 431, 436 (1989); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Brinkley v. VA</span>, 37 MSPR 682, 685-86 (1988) (theft of Darvon from a pharmacy was to be assessed on the basis of the criminal nature of the conduct, irrespective of the disability impairment of drug addiction at the time of the theft).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although charged misconduct is related to the disabling condition of alcoholism when the misconduct is the product of binge drinking, <span class="Italic">Tate v. DOD</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Board examines a continuum of events, rather than only the moments of misconduct, to evaluate a disability defense. In <span class="Italic">Clemons v. Dept. of Army</span>, 21 MSPR 166, 168 (1984), the employee was charged with theft of government property (an outboard motor), conspiracy to dispose of the stolen property, and submission of false sick leave requests to cover the period of absence involved in the transactions. Although the theft of the motor may have resulted from inebriation, there was plenty of time after the incident, when alcohol was not being used, to reconsider the course of action; instead, sick leave requests were falsified and plans were made to sell the motor. The theft essentially continued after the alcoholic episode, meaning there were offenses that were not a product of alcoholism. The discharge was sustained. <span class="Italic">Brinkley</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, made the point that nothing in the Rehabilitation Act suggests that alcoholics and drug abusers should be treated more favorably in disciplinary situations than other physically or mentally disabled or nondisabled employees. The Board's Vice-Chairman argued in a dissenting opinion to <span class="Italic">Dougherty v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 35 MSPR 381, 384-87 (1987), that when charges include some offenses caused by alcoholism and others not related to the disease, removal should be affirmed if the penalty reasonably relates to only those offenses not caused by the disease.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board seemed to strain the requirement of proof of causal connection in <span class="Italic">Harbo v. USPS</span>, 53 MSPR 450, 455 (1992). The employee was placed in a custodial drug rehabilitation program following an arrest for possession and distribution of marijuana. Not knowing of his status, the agency placed the appellant on AWOL. This charge, with others, led to adverse action. The Board reasoned that there was no connection between the disability and conduct leading to the discipline because "[t]here [was] no evidence that the appellant was so impaired by drug use he could not inform the agency of his status and request leave."
