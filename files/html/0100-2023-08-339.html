<p class="Body-Text">After demise of the Federal Career Intern Program, the excepted service Pathways Employment Program was tested and survived Board VEOA scrutiny, <span class="Italic">Dean v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 122 MSPR 276, 278-88 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-31, 2015 MSPB 22 (2015) (rev'd as to jurisdiction, aff'd as to result, <span class="Italic">Dean v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 808 F.3d 497 (Fed. Cir. 2015), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Department of Labor (DOL or agency) announced a vacancy for a GS-1849-07/09 "Recent Graduate" Wage and Hour Specialist position. The announcement indicated that the "appointment is [a part] of the Pathways Employment Program" and open to "[e]ligible recent graduates from qualifying educational institutions." The appellant, a preference-eligible veteran, applied for the position. The DOL rated him ineligible because he did not graduate from a qualifying educational institution within the timeframes established under the Pathways Recent Graduates Program. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 362.302.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Section 362.302 states that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(a)&#x2003;A Recent Graduate is an individual who obtained a qualifying associates, bachelors, master's, professional, doctorate, vocational or technical degree or certificate from a qualifying educational institution, within the previous 2 years or other applicable period provided below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(b)(1)&#x2003;Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an individual may apply for a position in the Recent Graduates Program only if the individual's application is received not later than 2 years after the date the individual completed all requirements of an academic course of study leading to a qualifying associates, bachelor's, master's, professional, doctorate, vocational or technical degree or certificate from a qualifying educational institution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;A veteran, as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108, who, due to a military service obligation, was precluded from applying to the Recent Graduates Program during any portion of the 2-year eligibility period described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall have a full 2-year period of eligibility upon his or her release or discharge from active duty. In no event, however, may the individual's eligibility period extend beyond 6 years from the date on which the individual completed the requirements of an academic course of study.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After exhausting his administrative remedies, the appellant filed a VEOA appeal with the Board and requested a hearing. He argued that the DOL violated his veterans' preference rights by excluding him from consideration for the "Recent Graduate" Wage and Hour Specialist job on the basis that he did not meet the Pathways Recent Graduates Program criteria....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The History of the Pathways Recent Graduates Program</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">All civilian positions in the executive branch are either in the competitive service, the excepted service, the senior executive service, or by presidential appointment with the advice and consent of the Senate. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2102(a); <span class="Italic">Isabella v. Department of State,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 259, &#x00B6; 12 (2006); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 212.101(a). Congress intended that appointment to the civil service through competitive examination be the norm. <span class="Italic">Dean v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 11 (2005). Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1), however, "[t]he President may prescribe rules governing the competitive service" that "provide, as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant, for--necessary exceptions of positions from the competitive service." Citing this authority, the Pathways Programs were authorized and created by Executive Order (E.O.) 13,562, signed by President Obama on December 27, 2010.[2] This E.O. came 6 weeks after the Board issued its decision in <span class="Italic">Dean v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 157 (2010), which invalidated the Federal Career Internship Program (FCIP), itself created in 2000, by an E.O. signed by President Clinton. We believe it is fair to characterize the Pathways Programs as successors to FCIP, especially to the extent that they were designed in good faith to address the inherent problems with FCIP that underlay the Board's decision in the 2010 <span class="Italic">Dean</span> decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;E.O. No. 13,562 established the Internship Program and the Recent Graduates Program, which, along with the Presidential Management Fellows Program, are collectively known as the Pathways Programs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">E.O. 13,562 succinctly sets forth its purpose and the public policy goals it advances. It provides for appropriate merit-based procedures for recruitment, assessment, placement, and ongoing career development for participants in the programs. In addition, as we discuss below, it applies veterans' preference. Following this executive order, OPM published in the Federal Register[3] a more detailed discussion of the purpose of the Pathways Programs and its structure, parameters, and procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 77 Fed. Reg. 28194-01 (May 11, 2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequently, pursuant to E.O. No. 13,562, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2, 7, OPM promulgated regulations governing the Recent Graduates Program. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3401; 5 C.F.R. Part 362, Subparts A, C; 5 C.F.R. Parts 213, 302, 315, 330, 334, 531, 536, 537, 550, 575, and 890; <span class="Italic">see</span> 77 Fed. Reg. 28,194 (May 11, 2012). Under OPM's regulations, an individual may apply for a Recent Graduates position only if his application is received not later than 2 years after the date that he completed all requirements of an academic course of study leading to a qualifying associate's, bachelor's, master's, professional, doctorate, vocational, or technical degree or certificate from a qualifying educational institution. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 362.302(b)(1). The duration of the Recent Graduates appointment in the excepted service is a trial period. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 362.303(f).

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3308 is not a statute relating to veterans5 preference.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before analyzing the dispositive issues in this case, we wish to clarify an error in our case law related to this subject. The appellant contended that the Pathways Program violated his veterans' preference rights because the vacancy announcement prescribed a minimum educational requirement. Although the appellant did not specifically cite to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3308, we find that his arguments implicate this statute, which states that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Office of Personnel Management or other examining agency may not prescribe a minimum educational requirement for an examination for the competitive service except when the Office decides that the duties of a scientific, technical, or professional position cannot be performed by an individual who does not have a prescribed minimum education. The Office shall make the reasons for its decision under this section a part of its public records.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Previously, the Board has found that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3308 is a statute relating to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Department of the Army</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 656, &#x00B6; 12, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 445 F. App'x 347 (Fed. Cir. 2011).[4] As support for its determination that section 3308 relates to veterans' preference, the Board in <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> made a conclusory finding that section 3308 "ultimately derives from section 5 of the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944."[5] <span class="Italic">Id.</span> However, upon further review of this matter, we find that a mere general similarity between provisions of section 3308 and the Veterans' Preference Act, by itself, is insufficient to conclude that this section relates to veterans' preference. Section 3308 was enacted in 1966, and there is no evidence, including legislative history, that Congress considered it in context related to the Veterans' Preference Act, enacted 22 years earlier, or any other issue related to veterans' employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Although neither party cited to <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> in their pleadings, we find it necessary to analyze this issue in reference to our pertinent case law, including <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) in <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> agreed with the Board's determination that the Department of the Army did not unlawfully include a minimum education requirement in its job posting for an Aerospace Engineer position, but it did not expressly <span id="Page_600"></span>reach the issue in dispute here, <span class="Italic">see infra</span>; namely, whether section 3808 is a law relating to veterans' preference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 78-359, 59 Stat. 387 (codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2108, 3309-3320).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As additional support for its determination that section 3308 relates to veterans' preference, the Board in <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> also cited to 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2)(B), a subpart of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (Ford Act), a law which governs employees of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 106-181, 114 Stat. 61 (2000). <span id="Page_601"></span>Under section 40122(g)(2), Congress granted the FAA the authority to establish a personnel system that is not subject to the provisions of Title 5, with certain exceptions. <span class="Italic">See Ivery v. Department of Transportation</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 356, &#x00B6; 12 (2006). It is not evident how Title 49 could have applied in the Burroughs case, given that the responding agency there was the Department of the Army. Similarly, the responding agency here is the DOL, not the FAA, and so Title 49 is not implicated. In fact, the Board clearly stated in <span class="Italic">Belhumeur v. Department of Transportation</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 408, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9 (2007), that VEOA does not apply to the FAA. Consequently, we find that the Board's reliance on 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2)(B) in <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> and subsequent precedent to hold that section 3308 is a statute that relates to veterans' preference was incorrect, and so we OVERRULE our determinations in <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> and its progeny on that issue.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., Asatov v. Agency for International Development,</span> 119 M.S.P.R. 692, &#x00B6; 10 (2013).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Even if 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3308 were a statute relating to veterans' preference, the Pathways Recent Graduates Program comports with that statute.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As mentioned earlier, the vacancy at issue in this appeal was announced under the Recent Graduates Program. Broadly speaking, then, the question here is whether the educational requirement of the Recent Graduates Program, as applied in this case, is consistent with veterans' preference rights. We find that it is.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3308, minimum educational requirements are generally prohibited in federal employment. An examining agency or OPM may not prescribe a minimum educational requirement for the competitive service[7] except when OPM decides that the duties of a scientific, technical, or professional position cannot be performed by an individual who does not have a prescribed minimum education. If OPM decides that a minimum educational requirement is necessary, it is required to make the reasons for its decision a part of its public records.[8] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3308.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;While this restriction, on its face, applies only to competitive service appointments, it also applies to appointments in the excepted service pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320. <span class="Italic">See Gingery v. Department of Defense</span>, 550 F.3d 1347, 1351-54 (Fed. Cir. 2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;This provision, enacted by Pub. L. No. 89-554 in 1966, before higher education was as prevalent as it is today, was intended in part to prevent the misuse of an educational requirement to discriminate against women and minorities in federal hiring.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "professional" as used in section 3308 does not appear to have ever been defined, either in statute, by OPM regulations, or through Board case law. This is not surprising, given the commonly understood meaning of the term is that of an occupation requiring either a certain level of education or training, or a public license, which generally requires some level of preparatory study. But when put in the context of professional development by way of on-the-job training or an apprenticeship, the term "professional" naturally expands. In career development programs, a "career ladder" is created to improve and enhance management-quality skills among employees. No individual position stands alone. A GS-5 entry-level position standing alone is completely different than that exact same GS-5 entry-level position that comprises the first rung of a career development ladder. The former likely does not require a college degree, while the latter does. We find no legal authority that prevents this construct of the term "professional" in the context of section 3308.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the position title on the DOL vacancy announcement is "Recent Graduate" Wage and Hour Specialist. While this position by itself may share the same duties and responsibilities with the Wage and Hour Specialist position, the two positions in fact serve different functions within the broader personnel management scheme. While the latter is a discrete job, the former is the first step in a formal career development and advancement program, which the President and OPM believe requires a minimum education requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, the President's E.O. and OPM's subsequent regulations implementing the Recent Graduates Program fully justify its educational requirements, and no party is in a better position to explain and defend them than OPM. In fact, OPM has made clear that there are historic, legal, and policy issues which support and clarify the operation of the Recent Graduates Program. As explained below, the general prohibition of educational requirements for federal employment set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3308 should not impede the operation of this program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board must review whether OPM "examine[d] the relevant data and articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action including a 'rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.'" <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Horner</span>, 854 F.2d 490, 498-99 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (citing <span class="Italic">Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co</span>., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983), and quoting <span class="Italic">Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States</span>, 371 U.S. 156, 168, (1962)). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has found that OPM's use of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302 to authorize an exception to competitive examining must be supported by data showing the necessity for such an exception and evidence that OPM engaged in an analysis of that data. <span class="Italic">Horner</span>, 854 F.2d at 498-99; <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 157, &#x00B6; 19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on our review, we find that OPM published the criteria it used to provide a rational basis for this program in its public records, including its pertinent regulations, its Federal Register notices, and other records contained on OPM's website, which show that a rational basis for section 3308 has been met, both under the law and in the spirit of that law.[9] For instance, the goal of the Recent Graduates Program and of Pathways in general is to achieve the recruitment and selection of "sufficient" numbers of recent graduates. E.O. No. 13,562, &#x00A7; 1; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 6.1, 213.3401. There are two related reasons behind this goal: to achieve a workforce more representative of all segments of society, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3401; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(2), and to benefit from the infusion of the "enthusiasm, talents, and unique perspectives" that students and recent graduates bring to the workplace, E.O. 13,562, &#x00A7; 1. Similarly, the program answers a need to foster "a diverse workforce that includes students and recent graduates" because current competitive hiring practices provide significant barriers to these individuals. E.O. No. 13,562. There also has been a finding that the Pathways exception is necessary to achieve this goal. Specifically, E.O. 13,562, &#x00A7; 1 explains that the Pathways exception is necessary as a condition of good administration to promote employment opportunities for students and recent graduates in the federal workforce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;The Board may take official notice of certain facts of common knowledge or matters that can be easily verified without requiring such evidence to be introduced to establish those facts. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.64.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, other regulations supply ample justification for the program's existence, including 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 362.301, which details the administration of the program, and states that the program "provides an entry-level developmental experience designed to lead to a civil service career in the Federal Government" for recent graduates, meaning that the person must apply within 2 years of having completed all academic course work. Section 362.302(b)(2) also reflects that veterans' rights were being taken into account, given that the regulation states that a "veteran, as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108, who due to military service obligation, was precluded from applying" to the program "shall have a full 2-year period of eligibility upon his or her release or discharge from active duty." Moreover, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 362.303(b)(3)(v), which deals with filling positions within the program, states that the positions "must have progressively more responsible duties that provide career advancement opportunities" to permit participants to ascend a career ladder.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, OPM, in the Federal Register notice for the Pathways Program, stated that the purpose of the program is to train and prepare participants for careers in the government by providing them with a 2-year "try-out" period, culminating in conversion to the competitive service if all goes well. 77 Fed. Reg. 28,194-01 (May 11, 2012). OPM indicated therein that it was seeking to provide a "meaningful training and developmental experience, as well as the potential for a permanent job" for "[h]igh potential applicants who are interested in public service." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 28,195. OPM added that, based on its experience with the civil service, "training and career development are among the attributes most often cited by recent graduates as desirable in employment opportunities." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> OPM stated that, in keeping with the nature of the program, it was "designed to leverage the cognitive abilities of students and recent graduates," and to provide them "with training and mentoring opportunities." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 28,201. OPM emphasized that the appointments in these programs "must have career advancement opportunities, i.e., they must be career ladder positions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 28,211. OPM opined that, at the same time, the program would allow agencies a period of time to evaluate "the potential of the Recent Graduate for a career in government." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 28,201. OPM observed that it was "asking agencies to make an investment in these individuals through mentorship, training, and developmental activities," so that the agencies could "be able to reap the benefits of that investment by retaining those who successfully complete their Programs." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 28,200.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has furnished information on its website that explains in great detail the reasons behind the formation of the program. As an example, OPM observes that "[t]he Federal Government values the contributions made by students and recent graduates of all ages and backgrounds. We <span id="Page_602"></span>have been placed at a competitive disadvantage, though, compared to other sectors in recruiting and hiring students and recent graduates." <span class="Italic">See Hiring Authorities--Students and Recent Graduates</span>, <a href="http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-authorities/students-recent-graduates/">http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-authorities/students-recent-graduates/</a>. Also, in its transition guidance for the program, titled "Pathways for Students &#x0026; Recent Graduates to Federal Careers," OPM points out that the program "targets individuals who have graduated recently from qualifying educational institution or programs" so that they "will be placed in a dynamic, career development program." <span class="Italic">See Pathways--For Students and Recent Graduates to Federal Careers--Transition and Implementation Guidance</span>, <a href="http://www.chcoc.gov/Documents/Attachments/Document146.pdf">http://www.chcoc.gov/Documents/Attachments/Document146.pdf</a>. The guidance explains that the program "enables individuals who lack experience to explore Federal civil service employment at the beginning of their careers," and "engages them at the onset of their work lives, before their career paths are fully established." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. OPM also specifically notes in this guidance that it has taken into consideration the rights of veterans, given that it states that veterans are able to circumvent the 2-year application deadline "due to their military service obligation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Importantly, the guidance further highlights that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Veterans' preference applies to selection for positions in the Pathways Programs. Selections must be made in accordance with the requirement of 5 CFR part 302, veterans' preference laws, and OPM guidance issued as a Memorandum for Chief Human Capital Officers dated February 9, 2009, on <span class="Italic">Procedures of Compensably-Disabled Preference Eligibles in the Excepted Service</span>. This includes, but is not limited to, ranked and unranked referral lists.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding the above, there is the matter of whether the Recent Graduates Program, in effect, excepts individuals from competitive examining procedures rather than "positions" as appears to be contemplated in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1). As relevant here, within the past 3 years, the DOL has appointed 1849-series Wage and Hour Specialists under both competitive and excepted appointing authorities. We recognize that this fact is not inconsistent with OPM's regulations, which by their own terms do not restrict Recent Graduates positions to those that are impracticable to fill through the competitive process. <span class="Italic">Cf. Dean</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 157, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23-25. And as discussed above, we do not question that the position of "Recent Graduate" Wage and Hour Specialist (as it is titled in the DOL announcement) is a different position from Wage and Hour Specialist. In any event, it could be argued that the intent of the Pathways Program is to allow agencies to fill positions that would normally be in the competitive service with individuals who would not likely be within reach on a certificate of eligibles generated under the competitive examining process. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3401. If this is the case, then OPM would have to address whether 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1) permits an exception of this type. We find that it does.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Pathways Programs are an important recruiting and hiring tool into the federal workforce for applicants of all ages, backgrounds and experiences; especially veterans returning from service who strive to better their lives and that of their families by successfully pursuing higher education, and then want to continue serving their country in the federal civil service. As a result, we cannot agree with the appellant's claim that the Pathways Programs' minimum educational eligibility requirement inherently violated his and other veterans' preference rights. The record reflects that no fewer than 34 veterans met the minimum eligibility requirements of being a recent graduate who were on the certificate of eligibles for the vacancy announcement. These individuals were referred to the selecting official. If the minimum educational requirement did not prohibit these 34 individuals from being considered, then it does not follow that the requirement violated anyone's veterans' preference rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To further bolster our view about the legal propriety of the Pathways Programs, we note that, recently, in an unpublished decision, the Federal Circuit considered another challenge by Mr. Dean to an OPM-approved excepted service program in which he alleged that the program violated civil service competition rules and veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">See Dean v. Department of the Air Force</span>, No. 2014-3114, 2014 WL 5786656 (Fed. Cir. Nov. 7, 2014) (unpublished). The program at issue in that case, the 2002 PALACE Acquire program, allows an agency to recruit and hire applicants for Criminal Investigator positions at various college campus recruiting events. As with the Pathways Programs, merit-based qualifications and veterans' preference are key elements of the PALACE Acquire Programs' applicant consideration process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court in that <span class="Italic">Dean</span> case affirmed the Board's earlier order, which noted that OPM had been delegated the authority to determine if a position is in the competitive service or not. <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, 2014 WL 5786656, at *2; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1.2. The court held that, when OPM makes a proper finding that a position should be excepted from the competitive service for conditions of good administration, the Board lacks authority to override OPM's discretionary classification. The court concluded that, because OPM had made such a finding, as it can do likewise with the Pathways Programs, the Board properly found that the PALACE Acquire positions were legally classified as being in the excepted service and that the agency in that case did not violate competitive service laws or veterans' preference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We thus find that the agency here properly imposed a minimum educational requirement for the GS-1849-07/09 "Recent Graduate" Wage and Hour Specialist position, and we conclude that the appellant failed to show that the agency acted contrary to any veterans' preference laws or rules, or violated his veterans' preference rights, when it considered this minimum educational requirement as the basis for excluding him from consideration.[10]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;The appellant does not appear to dispute the fact that he did not meet the minimum educational requirement for the vacancy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant argues that the administrative judge's decision is in contravention of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney</span>, 442 U.S. 256 (1979), and the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Lazaro v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 666 F.3d 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2012). We disagree. To the extent the appellant's argument is based on a constitutional challenge to VEOA on the ground that it impermissibly gives preference to certain veterans with degrees over other veteran applicants, his claim fails. Courts generally have rejected constitutional challenges to laws granting veterans' preference in government hiring; such laws have generally been upheld so long as they require that the veteran possess the minimum qualifications necessary to perform the position's duties. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Feeney</span>, 442 U.S. at 277; <span class="Italic">White v. Gates</span>, 253 F.2d 868, 869 (D.C. Cir. 1958); <span class="Italic">Fredrick v. United States</span>, 507 F.2d 1264, 1266-69 (Ct. Cl. 1974). Also, in <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span>, the Federal Circuit ruled that VEOA does not confer any special treatment to a veteran who is deemed unsuitable to hold a particular position, as occurred here. <span class="Italic">See Lazaro</span>, 666 F.3d at 1319 ("[T]he VEOA does not enable veterans to be considered for positions for which they are not qualified.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit determined that the Pathways Program, including the educational limitations imposed by OPM, was subject to the application of veterans preference, <span class="Italic">Dean v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 808 F.3d 497, 499-508 (Fed. Cir. 2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Most federal civil service employees are employed in either the competitive service or the excepted service. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union v. Horner</span>, 854 F.2d 490, 492 (D.C. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2102(a)(1), 2103(a). Applicants for employment in the competitive service must generally take a "competitive examination" administered by the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM"). <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union</span>, 854 F.2d at 492. The President, however, is authorized to make "necessary exceptions of positions from the competitive service" when warranted by "conditions of good administration." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1)). Applicants for excepted service positions are not required to take a competitive examination; instead, more flexible and informal procedures can be used to hire employees into the excepted service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Veterans' Preference Act ("VPA") is also an important aspect of competitive service hiring. Under the VPA, agencies must provide advantages to veterans and their families, known as "preference eligibles." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3) (defining "preference eligible" to include certain veterans and their family members); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309-3318 (describing advantages given to preference eligibles). Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320, these veterans' preference programs also apply to hiring in the excepted service. Specifically, &#x00A7; 3320 provides that the excepted service shall be filled "in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service by sections 3308-3318." OPM's regulations provide that when numerical scores are used to evaluate candidates, the agency will grant additional points to preference eligibles. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.201(a). If, however, candidates for an excepted service position are evaluated without numerical ratings, the agency can use the veterans' preference as a plus factor. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 302.201(b); <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Dep't of Interior</span>, 424 F.3d 1151, 1158-59 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Further, the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act ("VEOA") provides a remedy for a preference-eligible veteran "who alleges that an agency has violated...[his or her] rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">The Federal Government benefits from a diverse workforce that includes students and recent graduates, who infuse the workplace with their enthusiasm, talents, and unique perspectives. The existing competitive hiring process for the Federal civil service, however, is structured in a manner that, even at the entry level, favors job applicants who have significant previous work experience. This structure, along with the complexity of the rules governing admission to the career civil service, creates a barrier to recruiting and hiring students and recent graduates. It places the Federal <span id="Page_603"></span>Government at a competitive disadvantage compared to private-sector employers when it comes to hiring qualified applicants for entry-level positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. The order directed OPM to issue regulations implementing the Pathways Programs. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, we must satisfy ourselves as to whether the Board possessed jurisdiction over Mr. Dean's complaint. As previously noted, the Board's jurisdiction over VEOA complaints is provided by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a and is limited to alleged violations of any statute or regulation "relating to veterans' preference." Because Mr. Dean's complaint implicated &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3302(1) and 3308 of Title 5, we must consider whether these statutes relate to veterans' preference. Notably, the government argues that they do not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1) Relates to Veterans5 Preference</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that &#x00A7; 3302(1) is a statute "relating to veterans' preference" and thus the VEOA confers jurisdiction to consider claims under that section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 3302(1) provides that "[t]he President may prescribe rules governing the competitive service. The rules shall provide, as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant, for necessary exceptions of positions from the competitive service." The Board previously held that &#x00A7; 3302(1) is a statute relating to veterans' preference within the meaning of &#x00A7; 3330a. <span class="Italic">Dean v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 157 (2010). Because "relating to" is not defined by any statute or regulation, the Board gave the phrase its common meaning, i.e., "stands in some relation to," "has bearing on," "concerns," or "has a connection with." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 165. The Board ultimately determined that "section 3302(1) is a statute relating to veterans' preference because veterans' preference is a central feature of the system for examining candidates for entry into the competitive service; the creation of exceptions from the competitive service necessarily implicates veterans' preference rights." The Board further explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Veterans' preference in hiring has its force and effect under the two methods for assessing candidates for the competitive service.... By establishing competitive-service hiring as the norm, section 3302(1) is intrinsically connected to veterans' preference rights in that it ensures that such rights are not circumvented or ignored.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 166, 168.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that veterans' preferences apply to both the competitive service and the excepted service by operation of &#x00A7; 3320. However, the government never disputes that moving positions from the competitive service to the excepted service necessarily implicates the strength of the impact of veterans' preferences on hiring decisions. Instead, the government argues that &#x00A7; 3302(1) is not a statute relating to veterans' preference. The government first notes that the text of &#x00A7; 3302(1) does not refer to veterans or veterans' preferences and argues that it therefore is not a statute relating to veterans' preference. We are not persuaded that a statute must recite the term "veteran" to be a statute relating to veterans' preference. Rather, we are persuaded by the Board's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. at 166, 168.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government next argues that the context and structure of the VEOA bolster its position, noting that the VEOA defines the term 'veterans' preference requirement" and "expressly identifie[s] a list of the statutes and types of regulations that qualify as a 'veterans' preference requirement' for purposes of the VEOA." <span class="Italic">See</span> VEOA &#x00A7; 6, 112 Stat. 3182, 3187-88 (codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(e)(1)). Because &#x00A7; 3302(1) is not included in that list of 'veterans' preference requirements," the government argues that it is not a statute "relating to veterans' preference." This argument is not persuasive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The phrase "relating to veterans' preference" in &#x00A7; 3330a is broader in scope on its face than a "veterans' preference requirement" as defined in &#x00A7; 2302(e)(1). Nothing in the text of &#x00A7; 3330a or the VEOA suggests that a "statute...relating to veterans' preference" is limited to a "veterans' preference requirement" as defined in &#x00A7; 2302 (e) (1). To the contrary, &#x00A7; 2302(e)(1) specifically defines "veterans' preference requirement" for the purpose of &#x00A7; 2302 only. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(e)(1) ("For the purpose of this section, the term 'veterans' preference requirement' means any of the following provisions of law....") Congress used broader language in &#x00A7; 3330a ("relating to veterans' preference") to delimit the scope of complaints that could be brought by preference-eligible veterans under the VEOA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we agree that statutes "relating to veterans' preference" may include the statutes enumerated in &#x00A7; 2302(e)(1), we do not find it appropriate to restrict the scope of statutes "relating to veterans' preference" under &#x00A7; 3330a to only the "veterans' preference requirements" enumerated in &#x00A7; 2302(e)(1). <span class="Italic">See Sosa v. Alvarez Machain</span>, 542 U.S. 692, 711 n.9 (2004) (recognizing "the usual rule that when the legislature uses certain language in one part of the statute and different language in another, the court assumes different meanings were intended" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <span class="Italic">Res-Care, Inc. v. United States</span>, 735 F.3d 1384, 1389 (Fed. Cir. 2013) ("A cardinal doctrine of statutory interpretation is the presumption that Congress's 'use of different terms within related statutes generally implies that different meanings were intended."' (quoting 2A Norman Singer, <span class="Italic">Statutes and Statutory Construction</span> &#x00A7; 46.06 (7th ed. 2007))). Congress could have listed the statutes "relating to veterans' preference" for the purpose of &#x00A7; 3330a--just as it listed the "veterans' preference requirements" for the purpose of &#x00A7; 2302--but it did not do so. The government's attempt to limit the scope of &#x00A7; 3330a to the "veterans' preference requirements" of &#x00A7; 2302 is inconsistent with broader language used by Congress in &#x00A7; 3330a.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons articulated above, we agree with the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. at 168, that &#x00A7; 3302(1) is a statute relating to veterans' preference for the purpose of jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 3330a.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3308 Relates to Veterans5 Preference</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board held, and the government argues, that the Board lacked jurisdiction under the VEOA to consider a violation of &#x00A7; 3308. As explained below, we disagree and hold that the VEOA confers jurisdiction on the Board to consider violations of &#x00A7; 3308 because it is a statute "relating to veterans' preference."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 3308 states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Office of Personnel Management or other examining agency may not prescribe a minimum educational requirement for an examination for the competitive service except when the Office decides that the duties of a scientific, technical, or professional position cannot be performed by an individual who does not have a prescribed minimum education. The Office shall make the reasons for its decision under this section a part of its public records.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board held that &#x00A7; 3308 is not a statute relating to veterans' preference for the purpose of &#x00A7; 3330a, overruling its prior decision in <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, the Board held that &#x00A7; 3308 is a statute relating to veterans' preference, explaining that &#x00A7; 3308 derives from &#x00A7; 5 of the VPA. 115 M.S.P.R. at 661; <span class="Italic">see also</span> VPA &#x00A7; 5, 58 Stat. 387, 388-89. Section 5 of the VPA provided that "[n]o minimum educational requirement will be prescribed in any civil-service examination except for such scientific, technical, or professional positions the duties of which the Civil Service Commission decides cannot be performed by a person who does not have such education." VPA &#x00A7; 5, 58 Stat. 387, 388-89 (codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 854 (1946)). The Board in <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> also cited 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2)(B) for additional support that &#x00A7; 3308 is a statute relating to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Section 40122(g) lists provisions of Title 5 that apply to the Federal Aviation Administration's ("FAA") personnel management system, including "sections 3308-3320, relating to veterans' preference." 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g). We affirmed the Board's holdings in <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>. 445 Fed. Appx. 347, 350 (Fed. Cir. 2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board in this case, however, reversed its holding in <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, concluding that &#x00A7; 3308 is not a statute relating to veterans' preference. The Board acknowledged the similarity between &#x00A7; 3308 and &#x00A7; 5 of the VPA, but reasoned that "a mere general similarity between provisions of section 3308 and the Veterans' Preference Act, by itself, is insufficient to conclude that this section relates to veterans' preference." 122 M.S.P.R. 276, 282 (2015). The Board also discounted 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)--the FAA statute that expressly states that "sections 3308-3320" "relat[e] to veterans' preference"--because the VEOA does not apply to the FAA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government similarly argues that &#x00A7; 3308 is not a statute relating to veterans' preference because the text of the statute does not specifically refer to veterans or veterans' preference, and because &#x00A7; 2302(e)(1) does not list &#x00A7; 3308 as a "veterans' preference requirement." As discussed above with respect to &#x00A7; 3302, we are not persuaded by these arguments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that &#x00A7; 3308 is a statute relating to veterans' preference and reverse the Board's holding to the contrary. Section 3308 has its roots in the VPA. While the Board characterizes the relationship between &#x00A7; 3308 and &#x00A7; 5 of the VPA as "a mere general similarity," 122 M.S.P.R. at 282, the provisions are almost identical. The fact that the language of &#x00A7; 3308 is nearly identical to a provision within the VPA is strong evidence that Congress understood &#x00A7; 3308 as relating to veterans' preference. Moreover, Congress explicitly stated that &#x00A7; 3308 relates to veterans' preference. 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g). We see no reason to ignore Congress's clear statement that &#x00A7; 3308 "relat[es] to veterans' preference" just because the VEOA does not apply to the FAA.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_604"></span>Turning to the merits of Mr. Dean's appeal, we consider whether placement of the "Recent Graduate" Wage and Hour Specialist position into the excepted service as part of the Recent Graduates Program violated &#x00A7; 3302(1). Mr. Dean appears to argue that the Recent Graduates Program is invalid to the extent it excludes certain veterans who are not recent graduates from applying to positions within the program. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under &#x00A7; 3302(1), the President may make "as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant, for necessary exceptions of positions from the competitive service." Pursuant to this authority, President Obama created the Pathways Programs, including the Recent Graduates Program. Exec. Order No. 13,562, 75 Fed. Reg. 82,585. Section 7 of the Executive Order amended 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 6.1(a) to provide:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">OPM may except positions from the competitive service when it determines that...recruitment from among students attending qualifying educational institutions or individuals who have recently completed qualifying educational programs can better be achieved by devising additional means for recruiting and assessing candidates that diverge from the processes generally applicable to the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 82,587. Section 7 also amended 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 6.2 to create Schedule D for the excepted service, which includes:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Positions...for which the competitive service requirements make impracticable the adequate recruitment of sufficient numbers of...individuals who have recently completed qualifying educational programs. These positions...are temporarily placed in the excepted service to enable more effective recruitment from all segments of society by using means of recruiting and assessing candidates that diverge from the rules generally applicable to the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In creating the Pathways Programs, the President stated that "conditions of good administration (specifically, the need to promote employment opportunities for students and recent graduates in the Federal workforce) make necessary an exception to the competitive hiring rules for certain positions in the Federal civil service," citing the merit system principle set out in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(1) for the Federal Government "to achieve a work force from all segments of society." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 82,585. The President explained the benefits the Federal Government derives from a diverse workforce that includes recent graduates, as well as the barriers to hiring these same individuals. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, beginning in August of 2009, OPM conducted a review of the Federal Government's ability to recruit and hire students and recent graduates, soliciting input from agencies, academic organizations, and the public. Excepted Service, Career and Career-Conditional Employment; and Pathways Programs, 76 Fed. Reg. 47,495, 47,496 (proposed Aug. 5, 2011). OPM drew several conclusions from this review. OPM found barriers to hiring students and recent graduates, observing that these individuals lack the experience needed to compete in the competitive hiring system. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 47,497. OPM also concluded:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">By exposing students and recent graduates to jobs in the Federal civil service at the beginning of their careers, we will engage them at the outset of their work lives, before their career paths are fully established, inform them about the wide variety of interesting opportunities available in the Federal Government, and break through commonly held stereotypes about "government work."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. This review informed the President's decision to issue Executive Order No. 13,562. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The President delegated to OPM the authority to issue regulations implementing the Pathways Programs. Exec. Order No. 13,562, 75 Fed. Reg. at 82,585. OPM issued 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.102, defining "positions" that may be excepted under &#x00A7; 3302(1) to include "[t]hose that are intended to be removed temporarily from the competitive service to allow for targeted recruiting and hiring from among a particular class of persons." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.102(c)(2). In drafting this regulation, OPM noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This clarification reflects the President's (and several of his predecessors') interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1) and will permit OPM...to continue its practice of allowing agencies to fill positions that would normally be in the competitive service through excepted service appointments in order to allow them to recruit and hire from among classes of individuals that are disadvantaged by competitive examining.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Excepted Service, Career and Career-Conditional Employment; and Pathways Programs, 76 Fed. Reg. at 47,498.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the President's and OPM's thorough discussion of the barriers to hiring recent graduates into positions in the competitive service, the noted benefits recent graduates provide in the workforce, and the merit system principle in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(1) for the Federal Government "to achieve a work force from all segments of society," we conclude that the President acted within the authority Congress granted him in &#x00A7; 3302(1) to create the Recent Graduates Program and except positions from the competitive service to fulfill the goals of the program. We see no conflict between &#x00A7; 3302 and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.102, OPM's regulation permitting temporary exception of positions that would normally be in the competitive service to allow for targeting of a particular class of persons, in this case recent graduates. As the "Recent Graduate" Wage and Hour Specialist position was excepted from the competitive service pursuant to OPM's regulations implementing the Recent Graduates Program, we also conclude that this position was properly excepted from the competitive service pursuant to &#x00A7; 3302(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next consider whether placement of the "Recent Graduate" Wage and Hour Specialist position into the excepted service as part of the Recent Graduates Program violated &#x00A7; 3308. Section 3308 restricts the use of minimum educational requirements for an examination for the competitive service. This restriction also applies to the excepted service through &#x00A7; 3320, which provides that positions in the excepted service shall be filled "in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service by sections 3308-3318." Congress delegated the responsibility for implementing &#x00A7; 3320 to OPM. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1302(c). Accordingly, OPM has issued regulations setting forth procedures for applying veterans' preference rights to the excepted service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. pt. 302. In particular, OPM issued 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.202, which provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An agency shall not include a minimum educational requirement <span class="Italic">in qualification standards</span> except for a scientific, technical, or professional position the duties of which the agency decides cannot be performed by a person who does not have a prescribed minimum education.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered how veterans' preference provisions apply to the excepted service through &#x00A7; 3320 in three prior cases. In doing so, we have construed &#x00A7; 3320 as requiring application of veterans' preference procedures in excepted service hiring to the extent that it is administratively feasible to do so. <span class="Italic">See Jarrard v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 669 F.3d 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2012); <span class="Italic">Gingery v. Dep't of Def</span>., 550 F.3d 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>, 424 F.3d 1151.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>, we considered application of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309 to the excepted service via &#x00A7; 3320. 424 F.3d 1151. Section 3309 entitles a preference-eligible veteran "who receives a passing grade in an examination to additional points above his earned rating." A preference-eligible veteran alleged that his veterans' preference rights under &#x00A7; 3309 were violated by not adding additional points to his rating. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1154. The attorney position at issue, however, was in the excepted service, and not subject to examination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1157-58. We concluded that "Congress has not spoken on the issue of how to apply the principles of veterans' preference to positions within the excepted service that are not subject to examination," and that OPM's regulations were therefore entitled to deference under <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1158-59. OPM's regulation required hiring agencies to "follow the principle of veterans' preference as far as administratively feasible" for attorney positions in the excepted service. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c). Because the attorney position was not subject to examination or numerical scores and ranking, the agency instead considered veteran status as a positive factor in reviewing applications. <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>, 424 F.3d at 1159. We concluded that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c) and the positive factor test were reasonable interpretations of how &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309 and 3320 apply to attorney positions within the excepted service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1159-60.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Gingery</span>, we considered application of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318 to the excepted service via &#x00A7; 3320. 550 F.3d 1347. Section 3318 requires that an appointing authority obtain OPM's permission to pass over a preference eligible on a certificate, and notify the preference eligible of the proposed pass over, the reasons for the pass over, and his right to respond when the preference eligible has a compensable service-connected disability of 30% or more. The preference-eligible veteran in <span class="Italic">Gingery</span> had a compensable service-connected disability of 30% and sought an auditor position in the excepted service as part of the Federal Career Intern Program ("FCIP"). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1350. A category rating system was used to fill the auditor position, and applicants were selected from certificates. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In passing over Mr. Gingery, the agency followed 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401(b), which applied to the excepted service and only required the agency to record its reasons for passing over a preference-eligible veteran and furnish a copy to the veteran <span class="Italic">if requested. Id</span>. The preference-eligible veteran therefore alleged that the pass-over procedures of &#x00A7; 3318 were not followed when he was not selected for an auditor position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We agreed with the veteran and concluded that, unlike <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>, there was nothing to preclude application of &#x00A7; 3318 to the excepted service because &#x00A7; 3318 "applies to selection from certificates, which are used in both the competitive and excepted services." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1353. We therefore held 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401(b) invalid because it provided less protection than Congress guaranteed certain veterans in &#x00A7; 3318. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_605"></span>In <span class="Italic">Jarrard</span>, we again considered application of &#x00A7; 3318 to the excepted service through &#x00A7; 3320. 669 F.3d 1320. A preference-eligible veteran applied for attorney positions in the excepted service and alleged that the agencies did not follow the pass-over provisions of &#x00A7; 3318, instead just considering his veteran status as a "positive factor." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1321. We first determined that rating or other examination systems were barred for attorney positions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1325. We concluded that the pass-over provisions of &#x00A7; 3318 were inconsistent with the bar on attorney ratings because &#x00A7; 3318 "requires the submission of a certificate that ranks applicants" and held that agencies were exempt from the procedures of &#x00A7; 3318 for attorney positions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1325-26.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With this background, we turn to how the restriction in &#x00A7; 3308 on minimum educational requirements for examinations applies to hiring in the excepted service, which does not use examinations. We recognize that, under &#x00A7; 3320, &#x00A7; 3308's prohibition of educational requirements for an examination for the competitive service applies to the excepted service "in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service." Congress has not, however, addressed how &#x00A7; 3308 applies to the excepted service when there is no examination. Thus, Congress left a gap in the statute and OPM's regulations to fill this gap are entitled to deference under <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>. As such, we must consider whether OPM's regulations are based on a permissible construction of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3308 and 3320.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with &#x00A7; 3308, OPM's regulations governing employment in the excepted service prohibit an agency from including "a minimum educational requirement <span class="Italic">in qualification standards</span>, except for a scientific, technical, or professional position the duties of which the agency decides cannot be performed by a person who does not have a prescribed minimum education." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.202 (emphasis added). This regulation applies to making an appointment to a specific position within the excepted service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Notably, OPM's regulations do not prohibit a minimum educational requirement as a <span class="Italic">program eligibility</span> condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The educational requirement at issue in this case is not a qualification standard. It relates to eligibility for a specific program--the Recent Graduates Program. Indeed, OPM explained the distinction between "qualification standards" and "eligibility" in its regulations implementing the Recent Graduates Program. First, OPM issued a regulation entitled "Eligibility," explaining that eligibility is limited to "individual[s] who obtained a qualifying associates, bachelors, master's, professional, doctorate, vocational or technical degree or certificate from a qualifying educational institution, within the previous 2 years or other applicable period provided [in subsection (b)]." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 362.302(a). OPM also issued a regulation explaining the qualification standards an agency must apply when evaluating candidates for positions in the Recent Graduates Program: "Qualifications. An agency must evaluate candidates using OPM Qualification Standards for the occupation and the grade level of the position being filled." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 362.303(d). Thus, because the "Recent Graduate" Wage and Hour Specialist position was placed in the excepted service pursuant to the authority Congress granted to the President in &#x00A7; 3302, the eligibility criteria of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 362.302 and the qualification standard of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 362.303(d) apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we conclude that OPM's regulations implementing &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3308 and 3320 are permissible and reasonable. For excepted service positions not subject to examinations, OPM's regulations restrict the use of minimum educational requirements in qualification standards for positions. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.202. Under the Recent Graduates Program, OPM's implementing regulations instruct agencies to follow OPM Qualification Standards for the occupation and grade level of each position while restricting only the eligibility for the program to recent graduates. We find no conflict between OPM's regulations and Congress's intent expressed in &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3308 and 3320.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Dean appears to argue that the inclusion of any minimum educational requirement, including in the Recent Graduates Program eligibility criteria, for the "Recent Graduate" Wage and Hour Specialist position is a violation of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3308 and 3320. While Mr. Dean's position may represent a permissible interpretation of these statutory provisions, Congress has not mandated such a result and we cannot substitute our judgment for OPM's reasonable regulations implementing these statutes. The agency's "interpretation governs in the absence of unambiguous statutory language to the contrary or unreasonable resolution of language that is ambiguous." <span class="Italic">United States v. Eurodif S.A.,</span> 555 U.S. 305, 316 (2009).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Donahue v. VA</span>, PH-3330-16-0342-I-1 (NP 7/21/2022) ("Next, the appellant reasserts that it was improper for the agency to use the Pathways Program, arguing that the program is altogether illegal and invalid. However, as noted above, our reviewing court has held otherwise. <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, 808 F.3d at 504-06. The court also has found that an agency does not act contrary to any veterans' preference laws or rules, or violate veterans' preference rights, by considering the Pathways Program's education requirement as the basis for excluding a veteran from consideration. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 506-08.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit's approach was followed in a subsequently-decided challenge by the same appellant to the PALACE Acquire Program, <span class="Italic">Dean v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> AT-3330-14-0020-I-1 (NP 4/2/2015) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Dean v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 620 Fed. Appx. 959 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts on review that the administrative judge erred by not considering the case of <span class="Italic">Gingery v. Department of Defense</span>, 550 F.3d 1347 (2008). He further states that the administrative judge erred when she concluded that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3302, 3309, 3318, and 3319 only applied to the competitive service. The appellant's argument in this regard has some merit, but for the following reasons, it does not warrant a different outcome.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320 states that appointments for vacancies in the excepted service shall be selected "in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service by sections 3308-3318 of this title." Consistent with this statutory directive, our reviewing court has analyzed the application of some of these provisions to the excepted service. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gingery</span>, 550 F.3d at 1351-54 (discussing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)); <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Department of the Interior</span>, 424 F.3d 1151, 1156-60 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (discussing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309). Thus, the administrative judge's finding that the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309 and 3318 only apply to the competitive service was in error, and we modify the initial decision accordingly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding this error, the appellant has not persuaded us that the agency, by using the PALACE Acquire Program to fill AFOSI vacancies, violated either of these statutory provisions. Section 3309 states that preference eligibles who receive a passing grade on an examination into the competitive service are entitled to additional points. In <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>, 424 F.3d at 1156-60, our reviewing court addressed how an agency should apply veterans' preference principles found in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309 in making hiring decisions to fill attorney vacancies, which are in the excepted service and not subject to examination. Because Congress had not spoken on this issue, the court found that OPM's "gap-filling" at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c), which requires that veterans' preference be followed "as far as administratively feasible," was entitled to deference.[3] <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>, 424 F.3d at 1157-59. The court concluded that the agency's decision to consider Mr. Patterson's veterans' preference status as a "positive factor" in evaluating his application was a "reasonable interpretation" of how 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309 and 3320 apply to attorney positions within the excepted service, and it found that Mr. Patterson failed to assert a violation of his veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>, 424 F.3d at 1159-60.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Subsections (c)(6) and (c)(8) of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101 state that Schedule A positions and attorney positions, among others, are exempt from the appointment procedures of this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on our review of the documentary evidence in this record and the <span class="Italic">Dean</span> matter before the Federal Circuit, it appears that the agency calculated a weighted score based on various factors for applicants who apply for AFOSI criminal investigator positions through the PALACE Acquire Program, and veterans' preference points were later added to that weighted score. The appellant does not appear to challenge on review the agency's method for awarding veterans' preference for applicants in this regard. We conclude that he has not proven that the agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309 as interpreted by our reviewing court in <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the appellant, who did not attend any of the campus recruiting events, has not proven that the agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318. Section 3318 sets forth the criteria for selection from certificates, including passover and other notification requirements. To the extent that the appellant asserts on review that the agency is "attempting to evade applications from veterans," he has presented no persuasive evidence in support of this assertion. In light of our findings above, we also are not persuaded that the agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3302 or 3319, which authorize the President to prescribe rules governing the competitive service (and to make necessary exceptions thereto) and which discuss alternative ranking and selection procedures, respectively.</p>

Interviews through PAQ are open to the public and applicants are selected based upon a weighted score that includes veteran's status.").</p>
