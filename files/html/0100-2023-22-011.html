<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-12"><span class="space">c.</span> OSC Case: Prohibited Personnel Practice and Hatch Act Litigation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">In a decision arising from an OSC case, a reviewing court concluded the Board had broad authority to award fees in any litigation before it that involved employees as parties. The court remanded the case to the Board for a determination of whether the employee-litigants were entitled to fees under &#x00A7; 7701(g). <span class="Italic">Frazier v. MSPB</span>, 672 F.2d 150 (D.C. Cir. 1982). The Board earlier decided that, under 5 USC 7701(g), the reference to an employee or applicant as a "party" precluded fee awards in cases brought by the Special Counsel under 5 USC 1206(c)(1)(B) [now 5 USC 1214]; the fee provision was limited to cases brought under the Board's appellate procedures. The Board reasoned that although the Back Pay Act would provide authority for awards in original jurisdiction cases if back pay was awarded, without back pay there was no basis under the Act for an award of fees. <span class="Italic">In re Frazier</span>, 2 MSPR 415, 419, 2 MSPB 577 (1980).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Coffman v. OSC &#x0026; DHS</span>, 2022 MSPB 18, &#x00B6; 18 (2022), a disciplinary case unsuccessfully pursued by OSC, announced that an award of fees to the successful employee-respondent should not be denied on the supposition that the award would hamper OSC's pursuit of its statutory goals:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC asserts that, even if the petitioner was substantially innocent, the Board should exercise its discretion and not award fees because of OSC's "unique role in protecting the merit system." In this regard, OSC asserts that it "must be permitted to bring challenging, even controversial cases, in an effort to define and develop the prohibitions set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 33. We are not persuaded by this argument. Both versions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) state that fees "may" be awarded if the petitioner is a prevailing party and an award is warranted in the interest of justice, but we decline OSC's invitation to invoke our discretion and not award fees in this matter. Importantly, there is nothing inconsistent between OSC's authority to initiate disciplinary action against Federal employees whom it believes committed a PPP, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1215(a)(1)(A), and Congress's clear intent to allow employees in unsuccessful disciplinary actions to recoup attorney fees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., James</span>, 328 F.3d at 1383 ("We agree with the Board that Congress's intent to invigorate OSC enforcement [through the OSC Reauthorization Act] in no way categorically precludes a separately manifested intent that employees who successfully defend an OSC disciplinary action recoup attorney fees [under the earlier version of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1)]."). The petitioner is a prevailing party, we have affirmed the ALJ's determination that she is substantially innocent, and we find it appropriate to award fees to the petitioner pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) in this matter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Individuals on whose behalf cases are brought to the Board by the Special Counsel may, on application to the Board, participate through counsel as any other party. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">In re Frazier</span>, 1 MSPR 90, 90-91, 1 MSPB 85 (1979). But if an employee is not a party to an OSC case, there is no authority for an award of fees. The Board cannot order payment of fees only because the employee might have filed an appeal with the Board if the Board had not stayed the proposed appealable action at the request of OSC. If the Board does not correct the action against the employee but the agency does (a situation that might occur as a result of discussions between the agency and OSC), 5 USC 5596 (the Back Pay Act) provides no authority for a Board fee award, even though the agency might have the authority to make the award were there an agency determination that the employee was subjected to an unwarranted personnel action, <span class="Italic">In re Lewis</span>, 11 MSPR 515, 516-17 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Robert J. Endres, an employee of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), has petitioned the Board for an award of attorney fees in connection with this action on his behalf by the Special Counsel. The FAA proposed Mr. Endres' removal because of his refusal to accept a geographic reassignment, but the removal was stayed by the Board at the request of the Special Counsel, who alleged that the reassignment was motivated by discrimination on the basis of a handicapping condition in violation of 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1)(D). Subsequently, the agency negotiated a settlement with Mr. Endres under which it agreed to retain him in a position at the same grade level in the same geographic area and to withdraw the proposal to remove. Thus Mr. Endres' removal was never effectuated, and the Board did not rule on the merits of whether permanent corrective action in the matter was required.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here Mr. Endres asks the Board to require the agency to pay his attorney fees for work in connection with this matter, apparently in responding to the notice of proposed removal, obtaining the Special Counsel's assistance, and negotiating the settlement with the agency. However, the Board has no authority to award fees in a case of this kind.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Special Counsel obtained a stay of Mr. Endres' removal, petitioner was not a party to that proceeding. Thus 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g), which authorizes the Board to require payment of attorney fees incurred by an employee or applicant who is the prevailing party, has no application here.[1] Mr. Endres argues that the Board should read section 7701(g) as authority for awarding fees to an employee who might have filed an appeal if the Board had not stayed the proposed appealable action, but such an interpretation would violate the well-established principle that statutory waivers of sovereign immunity, such as those permitting payment of fees by the Federal Government, are narrowly construed. <span class="Italic">United</span> <span class="Italic">States v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor is the Board authorized to award attorney fees in this case by the Back Pay Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(ii). An employee is eligible for an award of attorney fees under that provision only if an "appropriate authority" has determined that he or she has been subjected to an unjustified personnel action which resulted in a loss of pay. Although the implementing regulations provide, at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.803 (1982), that the Board is an "appropriate authority," the Board has not made the requisite determination. The personnel action challenged here was corrected by the employing agency, not by the Board. The Board simply provided interim relief in the form of a stay of Mr. Endres' removal pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 1208. The issuance of such a stay is not a final decision on the merits. Accordingly, the motion for attorney fees is DENIED.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">In 1994, legislation amended the Reform Act to permit counsel fees under the "interest of justice" to individuals who prevail in Special Counsel disciplinary cases brought under 5 USC 1215. If the respondent is the victim of discrimination in a Special Counsel disciplinary case, Title VII standards govern the award of fees. 5 USC 1204(m); Pub. L. 103-424, &#x00A7; 2. The effect of the fee-shifting in disciplinary cases unsuccessfully prosecuted by OSC was to dissuade OSC from initiating disciplinary cases because of the possible financial impact of fee awards against OSC--a small agency with a limited budget. OSC cases defined at 5 USC 1215 include Hatch Act cases under 5 USC 1216. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 1215(a)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act amendments of 2012 modified the statutory scheme so that the fee-shifting statute applicable to an OSC disciplinary case; 5 USC 1204, now places liability on the employing agency rather than OSC:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(m)(1)&#x2003;Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Board, or an administrative law judge or other employee of the Board designated to hear a case arising under section 1215, may require payment by the agency where the prevailing party was employed or had applied for employment at the time of the events giving rise to the case of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee or applicant for employment if the employee or applicant is the prevailing party and the Board, administrative law judge, or other employee (as the case may be) determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice, including any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency or any case in which the agency's action was clearly without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;If an employee or applicant for employment is the prevailing party of a case arising under section 1215 and the decision is based on a finding of discrimination prohibited under section 2302(b)(1) of this title, the payment of attorney fees shall be in accordance with the standards prescribed under section 706(k) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(k)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Fee awards against agencies based on OSC's unsuccessful prosecution of a disciplinary against an employee left agencies unable to control or settle the OSC litigation and liable for whatever the ensuing fee award might be. That could be a problem for a micro-agency, <span class="Italic">Coffman v. OSC &#x0026; DHS</span>, 2022 MSPB 18, &#x00B6; 37 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that an agency like DHS, which likely had little to no involvement in OSC's decision to pursue disciplinary action against the petitioner, is obligated to pay the petitioner's substantial fees, which now total more than half a million dollars. The adverse impact of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) on an agency with a small budget could be significant. However, the Board's role as an adjudicatory agency is not to set or debate policy, and Congress has spoken clearly on this issue. <span class="Italic">See King v.

<p class="Body-Text">The statutory shift in liability for fee awards to agency-employers and away from OSC was explained in <span class="Italic">Coffman</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 2022 MSPB 18, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-35 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1994, Congress created 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1), which stated, in relevant part, that the Board or an ALJ designated to hear a case arising under section 1215 "may require payment by the agency involved of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee...if the employee...is the prevailing party and the Board [or ALJ]...determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice." United States Office of Special Counsel, Merit Systems Protection Board: Authorization, Pub. L. No. 103-424, &#x00A7; 2, 108 Stat. 4361 (1994). In <span class="Italic">Santella</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3, 12-18, the Board addressed the applicability of section 1204(m)(1) in a fee matter that, like this matter, stemmed from an OSC disciplinary action. The Board reviewed the legislative history of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1), determined that OSC was the "agency involved," and ordered OSC to pay the petitioners' fees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-18, 20-40. The Board's decision was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Santella</span>, 328 F.3d 1374.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2012, Congress made a significant change to section 1204(m)(1) when it struck the term "agency involved" and replaced it with "agency where the prevailing party was employed." Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (WPEA), Pub. L. No. 112-199, &#x00A7; 107(a), 126 Stat. 1465, 1469 (2012). The Senate Report for the WPEA explained that the change in section 1204(m)(1) was necessary because of the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Santella</span> and the corresponding financial burden on OSC, "a small agency with a limited budget," to pay fees in disciplinary actions. S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 15-16 (2012), <span class="Italic">as reprinted in</span> 2012 U.S.C.C.A.N. 589, 603-04. The Senate Report articulated the concern that "[s]hould the [<span class="Italic">Santella</span>] case remain valid law, the OSC would be subject to heavy financial penalties unless it can predict to a certainty that it will prevail before bringing a disciplinary action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 16. The Senate Report further stated that such a financial burden on OSC "hinders [its] use of disciplinary action as an enforcement mechanism and threatens the OSC's ability to implement and enforce the [whistleblower protection statutes]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. To correct this problem, section 107(a) of the WPEA modified section 1204(m)(1) to state that, in a case arising under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1215, the Board or ALJ,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">may require payment by the <span class="Italic">agency where the prevailing party was employed</span>...at the time of the events giving rise to the case of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee...if the employee...is the prevailing party and the Board [or ALJ]...determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) (2012) (emphasis supplied). This change to section 1204(m)(1) became effective December 27, 2012. WPEA, &#x00A7; 202, 126 Stat. at 1476.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="italic">The ALJ erred when he applied the 2011 version of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) to this matter.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, OSC asserts, among other things, that the ALJ ignored the plain language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) and disregarded Congressional intent to insulate OSC from liability to pay fees. We grant OSC's petition for review because, based on our review of the 2011 version of section 1204(m)(1), the legislative history underlying Congress's decision to amend this section in 2012, the effective date of this change, and the date the complaint was filed, the 2012 version of section 1204(m)(1) controls the outcome of this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered the petitioner's assertion that the earlier version of section 1204(m)(1) applies because OSC began its investigation of her, and she incurred fees, in 2011, before the December 27, 2012 effective date of the WPEA. However, we find that the operative event in this matter is the date that OSC filed its complaint, April 8, 2014, which is well after the December 27, 2012 effective date of the WPEA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1215(a)(1)(A) (authorizing OSC to prepare and file with the Board a complaint against the employee if it determines that disciplinary action should be taken against the employee for having committed a PPP). Importantly, OSC's complaint for disciplinary action constitutes "a case arising under section 1215" as described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1), and the petitioner could only achieve prevailing party status after such a complaint has been filed and adjudicated in her favor. <span class="Italic">Cf. Krafsur v. Social Security Administration</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-13 (2015) (finding that the respondent ALJ was not a prevailing party, a prerequisite to obtain attorney fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, because the agency withdrew its complaint for disciplinary action against him and the Board dismissed the complaint as withdrawn).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not persuaded by the ALJ's attempt to distinguish OSC disciplinary actions taken pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1215 and whistleblower appeals. Rather, the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16 (1989), <span class="Italic">amended</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1206(g) to incorporate the language of that section concerning the presentment of a complaint into a new section 1215(a). <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Santella</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 99, 101 n.1 (1990). Thus, OSC disciplinary actions taken pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1215 fall under the same statutory scheme as whistleblower appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, because the 2012 version of section 1204(m)(1) requires payment by the employing agency, we vacate the initial decision in this regard, and we find that DHS is solely responsible for the payment of the petitioner's fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="italic">The general fee provision at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) does not apply to this matter.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although DHS did not file a petition for review or cross petition for review, it asserts that the Board may exercise discretion to determine under which remedial statute to award fees. In this regard, DHS asserts, among other things, that the general fee provision at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) authorizes the Board to award fees in "any case" involving PPPs, and the Board may grant a remedy under a statute of general application even when there is a specific remedial provision. We are not persuaded by these arguments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), the Board or an ALJ "may require payment by the agency involved of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee...if the employee...is the prevailing party" and the Board or ALJ "determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice, including any case in which a [PPP] was engaged in by the agency or any case in which the agency's action was clearly without merit." Importantly, the "payment by the agency involved" language of section 7701(g)(1) is identical to the language in the 2011 version of section 1204(m)(1). <span class="Italic">Santella</span>, 328 F.3d at 1376-78.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7701(g)(1) is an attorney fee provision that is generally applicable to Board appeals, <span class="Italic">Jacobsen v. Department of Justice</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 134, &#x00B6; 6 (2006), whereas section 1204(m)(1) is a specific statutory fee provision that is aimed at cases "arising under section 1215." There is well-settled precedent that specific statutory language aimed at a particular situation ordinarily controls over general statutory language. <span class="Italic">Biogen MA, Inc. v. Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research</span>, 785 F.3d 648, 656 (Fed. Cir. 2015); <span class="Italic">Almond Brothers Lumber Company v. United States</span>, 651 F.3d 1343, 1354 (Fed.

Department of Justice</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 256, &#x00B6; 25 (2005). DHS acknowledges this longstanding precedent. However, it distinguishes cases like <span class="Italic">Jacobsen</span> and others by asserting that the Board has authority to grant a remedy under a statute of general application, even when the statute under which an appeal is brought contains a specific remedial provision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 12-14. DHS notes that, in <span class="Italic">Auker v. Department of Defense</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 468 (2000), the Board found that section 7701(g)(1) applied to individual right of action (IRA) appeals, even though the whistleblower protection statutes contained a specific fee provision tailored to such appeals in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DHS's argument is not persuasive because this matter is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Auker</span>. Mr. Auker filed an IRA appeal, alleging that his 1-day suspension for misconduct was taken in reprisal for his whistleblowing disclosures. <span class="Italic">Auker</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 2. Mr. Auker and the agency subsequently entered into a settlement agreement, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal without making any findings on the merits, and Mr. Auker filed a motion for attorney fees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3. The administrative judge granted the motion, finding that Mr. Auker was entitled to an award under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(2), which stated that an appellant in an IRA appeal is entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs "[i]f [he] is the prevailing party <span id="Page_4536"></span>before the [Board], and the decision is based on a finding of a [PPP]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-4. On review, however, the Board found that section 1221(g)(2) did not apply because, among other things, there was no finding of a PPP. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-6. The Board held instead that attorney fees may be awarded to Mr. Auker under section 7701(g)(1). <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching this conclusion, the Board in <span class="Italic">Auker</span> relied on a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which held that the reference in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) to "‘any case' involving prohibited practices plainly extends to all proceedings in which action is sought to identify and correct such practices." <span class="Italic">Auker</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 9 (quoting <span class="Italic">Frazier v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 672 F.2d 150, 169 (D.C. Cir. 1982)). The Board in <span class="Italic">Auker</span> concluded that an IRA appeal constitutes such a proceeding because it is a case in which an appellant is seeking a finding that he has been affected by a particular kind of PPP (reprisal for whistleblowing disclosures under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)) and in which he is seeking an order correcting the effects of that practice. <span class="Italic">Auker</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 10. The <span class="Italic">Auker</span> Board's reliance on <span class="Italic">Frazier</span> is understandable because, similar to an IRA appeal seeking corrective action against an agency, <span class="Italic">Frazier</span> involved an OSC corrective action proceeding, and the Board "permitted the [employees against whom reprisal allegedly occurred], through their attorneys ‘fully [to] participate in this proceeding as any other party.'" <span class="Italic">Frazier</span>, 672 F.2d at 153, 155, 168. Relevant to this matter, however, the <span class="Italic">Frazier</span> court limited its decision regarding the broad applicability of section 7701(g)(1) in fee matters. Although the court first stated that section 7701(g)(1) provides the Board authority to award fees "in any case in which an employee...appears as a party," it later noted that Congress granted the Board the authority to award such fees "in all cases within its jurisdiction in which <span class="Italic">complaining</span> employees appear as parties." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 169-70 (emphasis added). In contrast to an OSC corrective action or an IRA appeal, the petitioner is not a complaining employee in an OSC disciplinary action. Thus, we do not find <span class="Italic">Auker</span> or its reliance on the language from <span class="Italic">Frazier</span> applicable in an OSC disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the legislative history of the relevant statutory provisions distinguishes this matter from <span class="Italic">Auker</span>. In <span class="Italic">Auker</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 11, the Board remarked that the legislative history of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221 indicated that the drafters considered 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) to be a basis for awarding attorney fees in IRA appeals. Moreover, the Board found that Congress intended in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g) to make it easier for appellants who prevail in IRA appeals to recover attorney fees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 12. By contrast, the application of section 7701(g)(1) to this matter, which would obligate OSC, as the agency involved, to pay the petitioner's fees, runs counter to Congress's clear intent in the WPEA not to burden OSC with such liability. <span class="Italic">Supra</span>, &#x00B6; 21. Indeed, if Congress wanted 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) to apply to the petitioner's request for fees in an OSC disciplinary action, there would have been no reason for it to have modified 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) in the WPEA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered DHS's remaining arguments in support of its assertion that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) is not the exclusive remedy in this matter, but none warrant a different outcome. For example, DHS asserts that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1222 and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.202(a) give the Board discretion to award fees under section 7701(g)(1). Section 1222 states that, with exceptions not relevant to this matter, "nothing in this chapter or chapter 23 shall be construed to limit any right or remedy available under a provision of statute which is outside of both this chapter and chapter 23." The regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.202(a) identifies various statutory authorities for awarding fees, "includ[ing], but [ ] not limited to," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m). Even if section 1222 or 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.202(a) gives us discretion to award fees under section 7701(g)(1), we decline to rely on this authority because both provisions directly contravene the specific statutory language of the 2012 version of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) and the corresponding congressional intent. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., supra</span>, &#x00B6; 31 (discussing the precedent that specific statutory language aimed at a particular situation ordinarily controls over general statutory language); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of Justice</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 59, 67 (1996) (stating that the provisions of a statute will prevail in any case in which there is a conflict between a statute and an agency regulation).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC is the "agency involved" within the meaning of 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Office of Special Counsel Reauthorization Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-424, 1994 USCCAN (108 Stat.) 4361 (hereafter referred to as "Reauthorization Act"), which went into effect on October 29, 1994, states, in relevant part, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Board, or an administrative law judge or other employee of the Board designated to hear a case arising under section 1215, may require payment by the <span class="Italic">agency involved</span> of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee or applicant for employment if the employee or applicant is the prevailing party and the Board, administrative law judge, or other employee (as the case may be) determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice, including any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency or any case in which the agency's action was clearly without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) (emphasis added). OSC makes numerous arguments, which the CALJ addressed below, in support of its position that, here, the IRS is the "agency involved," and is liable for any attorney fee awarded to the petitioners.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, OSC claims that the fact that Congress used the term "agency involved" indicates that the potentially liable party will vary from case to case. OSC further asserts that, since it is the only agency authorized to bring a disciplinary action under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1215, if Congress had intended OSC to be the liable party in every case, it would have referred directly to OSC in section 1204(m)(1) (or in the legislative history of the Reauthorization Act), as it did in other portions of section 1204. OSC contends that, in the instant case, as in attorney fee petitions brought under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), the employing agency is the "agency involved," since a disciplinary action proceeding focuses on the legitimacy of the agency's decision to take the action that was effected by the accused official(s). Finally, OSC points out that, in light of the fact that the legislative history of the Reauthorization Act indicates congressional concerns about OSC's lack of aggressiveness in protecting whistleblowers, it is doubtful that Congress intended to subject OSC to attorney fee liability without making such liability explicit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the CALJ that section 1204(m)(1) of the statute is ambiguous, since "agency involved" could mean either the employing agency or OSC. <span class="Italic">See Sutherland Stat. Const.</span> &#x00A7; 45.02 (5th ed. 1992). Where there is a silence or an ambiguity in the statute, the agency responsible for applying it--in this case the Board--must determine the proper interpretation. <span class="Italic">See Regions Hospital v. Shalala</span>, 522 U.S. 448, 118 S. Ct. 909, 915, 139 L. Ed.2d 895 (1998); <span class="Italic">Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 843-44, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed.2d 694 (1984) (if a statute is ambiguous, a reasonable interpretation by the agency charged with its administration is entitled to deference); <span class="Italic">De Jesus v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 63 MSPR 586, 592 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 62 F.3d 1431 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table) (same). As discussed below, we agree with the CALJ's finding that it is more reasonable to interpret section 1204(m)(1) as extending attorney fee liability to OSC when it brings a disciplinary action under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1215 and the petitioner establishes the other prerequisites in the statute, rather than holding an employing agency which was not a party to the action liable for the results of that action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we note that Congress used almost identical language in section 1204(m)(1) as it had in section 7701(g)(1) of the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA). As the CALJ stated, there is no indication in the legislative history of the Reauthorization Act that the language codified at section 1204(m)(1) was intended to be construed differently from that in the CSRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 103-358 (1994), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1994 USCCAN 3549; H.R. Rep. No. 103-769 (1994).[5] <span class="Italic">See also Sutherland Stat. Const.</span> &#x00A7; 51.02 (5th ed. 1992) (unless context indicates otherwise, phrases in provision of prior act pertaining to same subject matter will be construed in same sense; need for uniformity is more imperative where same term is used in statutory sections that are similar in purpose and content); <span class="Italic">see also id.</span> &#x00A7; 53.01 (construing statutes by reference to others advances values of harmony and consistency). Although the legislative history of the Reauthorization Act provides little help in determining congressional intent with regard to the term "agency involved," we note that, in explaining the need for an attorney fee provision for cases brought under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1215, the Senate Report did refer to the fact that "[e]mployees who prevail before the MSPB when the matter arises under MSPB's appellate jurisdiction are currently eligible to receive attorney fees under Section 7701(g)(1) and (2)." Although OSC argues that the similarity in language means that the employing agency will normally pay attorney fees, as it often does in section 7701(g)(1) appeals, we agree with the CALJ that it is unlikely that Congress intended that an agency that played no role in the decision to take an action should pay attorney fees after the employee prevails. In support of this finding, we note that in attorney fee petitions adjudicated under section 7701(g)(1) where the appellant's employing agency was not a party to an action, the Board has consistently held that the agency that was a party, rather than the employing agency, is the "agency involved," and must pay any fees owed a prevailing appellant. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Howard v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 79 MSPR 172 (1998) (holding OPM liable for attorney fees where the appellant prevailed in his appeal of a denial of his application for disability retirement). Similarly, here, we believe that OSC, rather than the IRS, is the agency involved, and should be held liable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The Section-By-Section Analysis in the Senate Report states as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_4537"></span>Section 2 amends Section 1204 of Title 5, U.S. Code, to make employees who prevail after prosecution by OSC before the MSPB under section 1215 eligible to recoup their attorney fees. Employees who prevail before the MSPB when the matter arises under MSPB's appellate jurisdiction are currently eligible to receive attorney fees under Section 7701(g)(1) and (2). However, if OSC brings a disciplinary action under section 1215 and prosecutes the employee before the MSPB and the employee prevails, there is currently no authority for the employee to recover attorney fees. Section[2] grants that authority. S. Rep. No. 103-358, at 5 (1994), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1994 USCCAN 3549, 3553.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find unpersuasive OSC's contention that the IRS is the "agency involved" because the accused officials who took the actions at issue, which resulted in OSC bringing the disciplinary action, did so as agents of their employing agency. OSC argues that, as a result, the IRS must either pay for, or provide the petitioners with counsel, the same as if the petitioners had committed a tort in the scope of their employment.[6] As the CALJ pointed out, however, when a federal employee is sued for acts committed within the scope of his employment, the agency is the party to the action, so the agency is representing its own interests by providing counsel. <span class="Italic">See Gutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno</span>, 515 U.S. 417, 420, 115 S. Ct. 2227, 132 L. Ed.2d 375 (1995) (when the federal employee is found to be acting within the scope of employment he is dismissed from the action and the U.S. is the defendant). In an OSC disciplinary action case, in contrast, the agency is not a party. Moreover, the statutes OSC cites to support its argument (the Federal Tort Claims Act and the Westfall Act) are not comparable to the relevant section in the Reauthorization Act because, under those statutes, the Department of Justice always defends the employee (as long as the acts in question were committed within the scope of his employment), while here, the attorney fee provision of the Reauthorization Act only applies when the employee is the prevailing party. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 28 USC &#x00A7; 2679(c) <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1).[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Under this theory, OSC admits that it might be the "agency involved" in other types of cases it brings under section 1215, such as Hatch Act cases, in which the disciplinary action is not based on the employee's acts taken within the scope of employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The IRS asserts that, after investigating the charges and determining that the petitioners did not commit the prohibited personnel practices that OSC claimed, it agreed to reimburse the petitioners for attorney fees they incurred in defending themselves against OSC's prosecution. The reimbursement covered the period from 1990 until April 15, 1992. Nothing in this decision should be construed as affecting an agency's discretionary authority to pay for counsel to defend employees against whom OSC brings an action under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1215.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC also reiterates its assertion that, had Congress intended to subject it to liability for attorney fees, there would be an explicit mention of such a policy change in the legislative history, or the statute itself would have made such liability explicit. We agree that there is no obvious explanation why Congress used the term "agency involved" in section 1204(m)(1) if it meant to subject OSC to liability, since only OSC can bring an action under section 1215. The alternative, however, of subjecting the IRS to attorney fee liability in a case where it investigated the matter and correctly (as decided by the Board) determined that the petitioners did not commit a prohibited personnel practice, seems even less likely to be in line with congressional intent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize, as OSC points out, that it is somewhat anomalous for Congress to express concern that OSC is not doing enough to protect whistleblowers from prohibited personnel practices, <span class="Italic">see</span> S. Rep. No. 103-358, at 3 (1994), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1994 USCCAN 3540, 3551, and at the same time to expose OSC to broad liability for attorney fees when it brings an action that is ultimately unsuccessful. Nevertheless, as discussed above, in the absence of any evidence that Congress intended to make the employing agency liable for attorney fees in a case where OSC's attempted prosecution fails, we believe that logic supports our holding. In addition, although we have given serious consideration to OSC's assertion that the responsibility of paying attorney fees for actions brought under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1215 could impose a heavy burden on it, given its small size, we consider it a budgetary consideration that OSC must address with Congress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The petitioners were the"prevailing parties" as that term is used in 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(m)</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Attorney fees may be awarded under the provision in question only to the "prevailing party." 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1). The same criterion is included in the statutory provisions under which the Board awards attorney fees in appellate jurisdiction cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1221(g), 7701(g). Under those provisions, the Board has held that an employee is the "prevailing party" if he obtains an enforceable judgment against the agency, or enforceable relief through a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Joyce v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 74 MSPR 112, 117-18 (1997), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds</span>, 83 MSPR 666 (1999); <span class="Italic">Ray v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 64 MSPR 100, 104-05 (1994). As we stated above, the purpose of 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) appears to be quite similar to the purpose of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g), and neither the legislative histories of the provisions nor the statutes in which the two provisions were enacted suggest that the term "prevailing party" as it is used in 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) should be construed differently than the same term as it is used in connection with appellate jurisdiction cases. <span class="Italic">See Sutherland Stat. Const.</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 51.02, 53.01 (5th ed. 1992). We therefore find that a "prevailing party" under section 1204(m) is one who obtains an enforceable judgment against the agency, or enforceable relief through a settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is clear that the petitioners in this case obtained an enforceable judgment against OSC during the merits stage of this proceeding. While OSC alleged that the petitioners had violated 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) a total of four times, and while it asked that they be disciplined for those alleged violations, the Board agreed with the petitioners that none of the four counts should be sustained, imposed no disciplinary action, and dismissed OSC's complaint. <span class="Italic">See Santella</span>, 77 MSPR at 673. Moreover, OSC does not argue on review that the petitioners were not the prevailing parties. We find, therefore, that the petitioners are the prevailing parties in this case for purposes of 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board denied OPM's reconsideration petition in <span class="Italic">Santella</span>, again explaining the basis for a fee award against OSC in a disciplinary case, <span class="Italic">Santella v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[B]y enacting an attorney fees provision, Congress manifested its intent to defray the costs incurred by a federal employee in successfully defending an OSC disciplinary action. It is the prerogative of Congress to strike a balance among these various interests. <span class="Italic">See Muwwakkil v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 18 F.3d 921, 925 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (the burden that compliance with a statutory requirement places on an agency is a matter for Congress to consider, not the Board); <span class="Italic">Newman v. Love,</span> 962 F.2d 1008, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (an agency may not rewrite a statute to contain costs or to avoid what it views as an inappropriate allocation of benefits). Congress struck this balance by incorporating in section 1204(m)(1) the interest of justice standard of section 7701(g)(1). We are not at liberty to ignore the expressed will of Congress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not believe that application of the "substantially innocent" standard to determine whether an award of attorney fees is warranted under section 1204(m)(1) will frustrate Congress' intention that OSC aggressively carry out its prosecutorial activities. Congress has assigned OSC particular duties and it has taken action, in the Whistleblower Protection Act and the Reauthorization Act, to encourage OSC to vigorously carry out those duties. Congress has funded OSC at the level deemed appropriate to accomplish those duties. We presume that the Special Counsel and her staff perform their duties in a conscientious manner. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Alexander</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 636, 649 (1996). We do not believe that the specter of an occasional attorney fees award will deter OSC from the diligent performance of its duties any more than it deters OPM from vigorously guarding the retirement fund or employing agencies from taking disciplinary actions they believe warranted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We do not mean to suggest that the Board will automatically apply every interpretation of the interest of justice standard under section 7701(g) to cases under section 1204(m)(1). <span class="Italic">See Allen</span>, 2 MSPB 582, 2 M.S.P.R. at 433 (Congress intended the Board to develop and apply the interest of justice standard in light of its experience). However, we find that the "substantially innocent" standard provides an appropriate basis for an award of fees under the interest of justice standard in section 1204(m)(1).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed the Board's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Santella</span>, and rejected additional arguments advanced on behalf of OSC by OPM, in <span class="Italic">James v. Santella</span>, <a href="http://openjurist.org/328/f3d/1374/james-v-santella">328 F.3d 1374</a>, 1377-84 (Fed. Cir. 2003)<span class="Italic">:</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The crux of OPM's argument on appeal is that the Board unlawfully construed 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) by concluding that the "substantially innocent" category articulated in <span class="Italic">Allen v. United States Postal Service</span>, 2 MSPB 582, 2 M.S.P.R. 420 (1980), in the context of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), is an appropriate standard for determining whether a grant of attorney fees is "warranted in the interest of justice." In essence, OPM advocates a more stringent test here, which would make it much more difficult for prevailing parties to qualify for attorney fees. In the course of making this argument, OPM challenges the adequacy and correctness of the Board's basic statutory construction analysis, and then goes on to offer several more specific arguments as to why, in its view, the Board's ultimate conclusion cannot be sustained. Thus, we begin with a discussion and analysis of the statute and the Board's statutory construction before turning to OPM's more specific arguments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, section 1204(m)(1) was enacted as part of the OSC Reauthorization Act. This section provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_4538"></span>Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Board, or an administrative law judge or other employee of the Board designated to hear a case arising under section 1215, may require payment by the agency involved of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee or applicant for employment if the employee or applicant is the prevailing party and the Board, administrative law judge, or other employee (as the case may be) determines that payment by the agency is <span class="Italic">warranted in the interest of justice</span>, including any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency or any case in which the agency's action was clearly without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The language of this provision is virtually identical to that of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), which authorizes attorney fees to prevailing employees who successfully challenge certain adverse actions taken by their employing agencies. In dispute here is the proper interpretation and application of the phrase "warranted in the interest of justice," which, along with being a "prevailing party," is one of the two statutory criteria for the award of attorney fees under both sections 7701(g)(1) and 1204(m)(1). The phrase "warranted in the interest of justice" is not statutorily defined as to either provision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board summarized its reasons for concluding that <span class="Italic">Allen's</span> "substantially innocent" category could be applied to section 1204(m)(1) in <span class="Italic">Santella IV</span> as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In the Reauthorization Act, Congress enacted an attorney fees provision for OSC disciplinary actions that is substantially identical to the attorney fees provision applicable to cases arising under the Board's appellate jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). Generally, words or phrases in a statutory provision that were used in a prior act pertaining to the same subject matter will be construed in the same sense. <span class="Italic">Marks v. United States</span>, 161 U.S. 297, 302, 31 Ct. Cl. 453, 16 S. Ct. 476, 40 L. Ed. 706 (1896); Sutherland Stat. Const. &#x00A7; 51.02 (5th ed. 1992). Congress is presumed to have been aware of the existing interpretations of section 7701(g)(1) when it enacted section 1204(m)(1). <span class="Italic">Lorillard v. Pons</span>, 434 U.S. 575, 580, 98 S. Ct. 866, 55 L. Ed.2d 40 (1978). Further, the legislative history of the new attorney fees provision identified section 7701(g) as the model for that provision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Santella IV</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. at 176-77.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">From this analysis, the Board concluded that the "substantially innocent" standard that had been adopted in the context of section 7701(g)(1) "provides an appropriate basis for an award of fees under the interest of justice [requirement] in section 1204(m)(1)." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 179. In doing so, however, the Board clarified that it did "not mean to suggest that the Board will automatically apply every interpretation of the interest of justice standard under section 7701(g)(1) to cases under section 1204(m)(1)."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the statutory construction does not preclude the application of the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> categories to cases brought under section 1204(m)(1). As noted above, the phrase "warranted in the interest of justice" is not statutorily defined, and this phrase might therefore appropriately be subject to any number of different interpretations and applications. However, as the Board noted, we cannot ignore the fact that Congress, in enacting section 1204(m)(1), chose to use language that is virtually identical to that of section 7701(g)(1). Thus, although we do not conclude that Congress intended to dictate that the two provisions be applied in precisely the same manner, there is certainly nothing to suggest that Congress intended to preclude this outcome. Therefore, in our view, in enacting section 1204(m)(1) Congress left the precise definition and application of "warranted in the interest of justice" to the Board's discretion. We accord deference in this particular case to the Board's interpretation of a statutory provision authorizing it to grant attorney fees. We therefore apply that deference as we turn to OPM's more specific challenges and consider whether the Board's decision was reasonable and permissible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM makes three principal, and to a certain extent overlapping, arguments as to why the Board's application of the "substantially innocent" category from the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> framework to section 1204(m)(1) was erroneous. First, OPM contends that the contexts in which sections 1204(m)(1) and 7701(g)(1) apply are so fundamentally different that the Board was precluded from adopting the "significantly innocent" standard of section 7701(g)(1) for application to section 1204(m)(1). Second, OPM argues that, in the context of OSC disciplinary actions, the prerequisites for a finding of "substantial innocence"--which under <span class="Italic">Allen</span> satisfies the "warranted in the interest of justice" requirement--will be identical to those necessary to demonstrate "prevailing party" status. Thus, according to OPM, the result is an unlawful conflation of the distinct statutory requirements that an employee be a "prevailing party" and that an award of attorney fees be "warranted in the interest of justice." Third, OPM argues that application of the "substantially innocent" standard will chill enforcement of the WPA by subjecting OSC to potential liability for attorney fees, thereby contravening Congress's intent in enacting the OSC Reauthorization Act of ensuring vigorous enforcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an additional fourth contention, OPM, in reasoning first fully articulated at oral argument, argues that employees who succeed in defending OSC enforcement actions cannot, as a matter of law, be "prevailing parties" because the Board's failure to sustain charges does not result in the type of material alteration in the legal relationship between the charged employee and OSC that is necessary to permit an award of attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See Buckhannon Bd. &#x0026; Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Res.</span>, 532 U.S. 598, 604 (2001) (articulating this requirement). We address these arguments in turn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, OPM first contends that the Board erred in adopting the "substantially innocent" <span class="Italic">Allen</span> criterion because the Board did not sufficiently take into account the "materially different contexts" in which sections 7701(g)(1) and 1204(m)(1) apply. OPM's main assertion in support of its argument appears to be that the Board "viewed the language of the two statutes in a vacuum, overlooking the materially different contexts within the civil service system in which these two statutes operate," resulting in the Board's adoption of an unlawful standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that OPM has failed to demonstrate that the differences between cases brought under section 7701(g)(1) and those brought under section 1204(m)(1) preclude application of the "substantially innocent" standard in section 1204(m)(1) cases. We agree with the Board that, "while OSC's interests in bringing a disciplinary proceeding under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1215 differ somewhat from the interests of an employing agency, the nature of charges an employing agency brings against its own employee may be quite similar to the nature of charges OSC may bring." <span class="Italic">Santella III</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. at 61. We find that, after analyzing the various similarities and differences between the actions brought by employing agencies and OSC--as well as OSC's distinct role in the civil service system--the Board reasonably concluded that the differences were not sufficiently significant to preclude application of the "substantially innocent" Allen category. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 61-63. We therefore reject OPM's arguments to the contrary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also reject OPM's related argument that the Board was required to adopt a different standard here because its precedents demonstrate a practice of modifying its application of <span class="Italic">Allen</span> to fit the unique characteristics of certain types of cases. OPM relies on, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, cases in which the Board has recognized that the "concept of substantial innocence is inapplicable in the retirement-related appeal context, where no charges of misconduct are leveled against the employee." OPM also cites cases in which the Board ruled that it would interpret the "warranted in the interest of justice" language of section 7701(g)(1) differently in certain employee-initiated actions, such as disability retirement cases, when the employee has brought the burden of litigation on himself.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not persuaded that the Board's modification of how it applies <span class="Italic">Allen</span> in the cases cited by OPM precludes it from applying the "substantially innocent" standard in section 1204(m)(1) cases. Unlike the retirement-related appeals in which an employee's guilt or innocence is simply not a factor--therefore rendering an inquiry into "substantial innocence" meaningless--an OSC disciplinary action is based on charges of malfeasance of which the employee must be found either guilty or innocent to resolve the case. Also, because OSC initiates disciplinary actions, it is impossible for employees to be responsible for the costs of litigation in the same manner as the disability retirement cases cited by OPM. Additionally, OSC disciplinary actions clearly have the potential to force employees to defend themselves against unsubstantiated accusations, imposing precisely the type of burden that fee-shifting is intended to ameliorate. Accordingly, we find that the Board correctly concluded that the cases cited by OPM do not require that the Board abandon or modify the "substantially innocent" category in the manner urged by OPM. Therefore, we reject OPM's arguments to the contrary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the same reasons, we reject OPM's further argument that the Board was required to adopt a more stringent standard in section 1204(m)(1) cases, such as the standard applicable in Title VII cases or under the Equal Access to Justice Act. Moreover, we find that the attorney fee provisions cited by OPM as providing more appropriate standards are so different from section 1204(m)(1) in both language and purpose that the Board acted reasonably in declining to adopt a standard derived from one of these other provisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next address OPM's second and related contention that the Board's application of the "substantially innocent" standard to section 1204(m)(1) "necessarily collapses the distinction between the statutory requirement that an employee be a 'prevailing party' and the separate statutory requirement that a fee award be 'warranted in the interest of justice.'" OPM argues that because OSC disciplinary actions are "all or nothing propositions," without the possibility of partial victories or mitigation of penalties, an employee cannot prevail in such actions without also being automatically found "substantially innocent." Thus, OPM asserts that, by conflating these two statutory requirements, the Board's interpretation "<span id="Page_4539"></span>effectively renders superfluous" the "warranted in the interest of justice" requirement of section 1204(m)(1), thereby violating the general rule against construing a statute in a way that renders one of its parts inoperative. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Duncan v. Walker</span>, 533 U.S. 167, 174, 121 S. Ct. 2120, 100 L. Ed. 2d 251 (2001) (counseling against statutory constructions that have this effect).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find OPM's argument unpersuasive for at least two reasons. First, OSC clearly may bring multiple charges against an employee in an enforcement action. It is not clear to this court why in cases where OSC brings multiple charges it is not possible--or even probable--that at least some charges will sometimes be sustained when others are not, resulting in only a partial victory for the charged employee that would not "automatically" result in either "prevailing party" status or a finding of "substantial innocence." OPM has not explained why the Board's decision would preclude an employee from being found to be a "prevailing party" but not "substantially innocent" in such cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the possibility of such partial victories, the Board in its brief points to precedents of this court demonstrating various circumstances in which an employee might be found to be a prevailing party but not substantially innocent. For example, in <span class="Italic">Sterner v. Department of the Army</span>, this court upheld the Board's denial of attorney fees to an employee who confessed to two of five charges and successfully defended against the remaining three. 711 F.2d 1563, 1567-69 (Fed. Cir. 1983). Thus, although the employee technically prevailed on every contested charge, the Board concluded that he was not "substantially innocent" and therefore ineligible for attorney fees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Another example is <span class="Italic">Wise v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 780 F.2d 997, 1000-01 (Fed. Cir. 1985), where an employee who prevailed before the Board was found not to be substantially innocent because he deliberately withheld exculpatory evidence from his employing agency. <span class="Italic">See also</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Dunn v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 98 F.3d 1308, 1313-14 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (holding employee to be prevailing party, but denying fees due to demonstration of culpability associated with charged conduct).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we briefly address OPM's assertion that the Board expressly held that any employee against whom no charges are sustained in an OSC enforcement action will automatically be found to be both a "prevailing party" and "substantially innocent." In making this assertion, OPM relies heavily on the Board statement that it could "not see any basis for finding that unsustained charges can justify a conclusion that an employee was not found to be substantially innocent of the charges." <span class="Italic">Santella III</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. at 65. OPM also prominently quotes the Board's conclusion that "[i]n this case, as indicated above, all the charges were unsustained. Clearly, therefore, the petitioners were 'substantially innocent.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We believe that OPM's reliance on these statements is misplaced. In response to OSC's claim that adopting the "substantially innocent" standard would result in "strict liability," the Board explained that it "has consistently stated that it will not automatically award fees under the substantially innocent criterion simply because a charge, or charges, were not sustained." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citations omitted). Thus, the Board explicitly rejected the holding that OPM contends it adopted. Therefore, reading the statements upon which OPM relies in the context of the entire decision, we conclude that the Board did not adopt the rule that an employee who prevails on all charges in an OSC disciplinary action will automatically be found "substantially innocent."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's penultimate argument is that adoption of the "substantially innocent" standard would impermissibly chill OSC's enforcement activities by subjecting it to substantial potential liability for attorney fees, thereby frustrating Congress's central purpose in enacting the OSC Reauthorization Act of increasing vigorous enforcement of the WPA. OPM contends that the threat of liability would discourage OSC from "prosecuting all but the most ironclad and safest of cases" undermining the OSC Reauthorization Act's clear legislative intent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find OPM's argument unpersuasive because we cannot accept its underlying premise that Congress' intent that OSC vigorously enforce the WPA is necessarily inconsistent with authorizing prevailing employees found to be substantially innocent to recoup attorney fees from OSC. As the Board stated in <span class="Italic">Santella IV</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Indeed, Congress' primary purpose in passing the Reauthorization Act was to invigorate OSC's enforcement activities. S. Rep. 103-358 at 1-2. However, by enacting an attorney fees provision, Congress manifested its intent to defray the costs incurred by a federal employee in successfully defending an OSC disciplinary action. It is the prerogative of Congress to strike a balance among these various interests. <span class="Italic">See Muwwakkil v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 18 F.3d 921, 925 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (the burden that compliance with a statutory requirement places on an agency is a matter for Congress to consider, not the Board); <span class="Italic">Newman v. Love</span>, 962 F.2d 1008, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (an agency may not rewrite a statute to contain costs or to avoid what it views as an inappropriate allocation of benefits).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Santella IV</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. at 177.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that Congress's intent to invigorate OSC enforcement in no way categorically precludes a separately manifested intent that employees who successfully defend an OSC disciplinary action recoup attorney fees. Because the goal of invigorating OSC enforcement is not inherently inconsistent with the objective of defraying the cost to defending employees subjected to unsuccessful OSC enforcement actions, we cannot conclude that the Board's decision violates clearly expressed Congressional intent or that the Board acted unreasonably in rejecting OPM's arguments to the contrary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its final contention, which was first fully articulated at oral argument, OPM appears to assert that employees against whom OSC enforcement actions are not sustained cannot be "prevailing parties" under the Supreme Court's recent jurisprudence. OPM's reasoning, as we understand it, is that an accused employee in an OSC enforcement action cannot "prevail" as a matter of law because an employee who begins the proceedings with the presumption of innocence and is subsequently found to be innocent has not effected the "'material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties' necessary to permit an award of attorney's fees." <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, 532 U.S. at 604 (quoting <span class="Italic">Tex. State Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist.</span>, 489 U.S. 782, 792-93, 109 S. Ct. 1486, 103 L. Ed. 2d 866 (1989)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we typically do not address issues that are raised for the first time at oral argument, we choose to do so here because OPM based its argument, at least in part, on an intervening Supreme Court case. Accordingly, we consider and reject OPM's final contention. If a defendant employee in an OSC action who is successful in defending each and every charge brought by OSC cannot, as a matter of law, be considered a "prevailing party," then it is difficult to imagine circumstances in which any employee defending against an OSC complaint would be a prevailing party. In short, OPM's proffered reading would effectively render section 1204(m)(1) a nullity and is not, in our view, compelled by Supreme Court precedent. For this reason, we decline to adopt OPM's interpretation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Perkins v. Office of Special Counsel</span>, 522 F.3d 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (noting the legislative history giving rise to the ability of employees to obtain fees from OSC when they successfully defend OSC disciplinary actions).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the 1994 amendments to 5 USC 1215, earlier noted, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Saldana</span>, 20 MSPR 308, 313-14 (1984), ruled that counsel fees are not available to employees who prevail in OSC Hatch Act prosecutions under 5 USC 7324 and 5 USC 1206(g) [now &#x00A7; 1216]. The Board explained as to the litigation involving Mr. Saldana, an EPA employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The conduct which is subject to actions under section 1207 (use of personnel authority to commit prohibited personnel practices violating the rights of other employees, wrongful withholding of information in violation of the Freedom of Information Act, and political activity prohibited by the Hatch Act) involves abuse of office. By providing a separate mechanism for sanctioning such misbehavior, Congress has implicitly treated it as different in kind from the employee misconduct or performance failures on which most disciplinary actions appealed to the Board under section 7701 are based.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to this difference between Special Counsel disciplinary actions and the typical case in which Congress contemplated fee awards, section 1207 itself provides an important indication of what Congress intended. This provision was enacted at the same time as section 7701, and like section 7701, it specifies the procedural rights of employees in the cases to which it applies. Section 1207 entitles respondents to a reasonable time to answer the complaint, a hearing on the record, representation by counsel, and a written decision. When Congress has specified in detail the procedural rights of employees in disciplinary actions, its failure to mention attorney fee awards creates a significant doubt as to whether such awards were intended to be authorized. In our view, this omission creates the same kind of ambiguity which led the court in <span class="Italic">Williams, supra,</span> 710 F.2d at 1556, to conclude that the statute did not clearly waive sovereign immunity to permit fee awards in the retirement cases involved there. Thus, we cannot find that Congress has spoken with sufficient clarity to authorize the Board to award fees against the Special Counsel in a section 1207 proceeding.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's ruling in <span class="Italic">Saldana</span> was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Saldana v. MSPB</span>, 766 F.2d 514, 516-18 (Fed. Cir. 1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that attorney fees cannot be awarded against the Federal Government unless specifically authorized by a statutory waiver of sovereign immunity. <span class="Italic">Williams v. OPM</span>, 718 F.2d 1553 (Fed. Cir. 1983). Such statutory authorization must be express and specific; it cannot be extended beyond the statute's literal terms and it cannot be implied....&#8197;Here Saldana relies on 5 USC 7701(g)(1) for an award of attorney fees....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Saldana, relying on <span class="Italic">Frazier v. MSPB</span>, 672 F.2d 150 (D.C. Cir. 1982), argues that 5 USC 7701(g)(1) is not limited to appeals brought under chapter 77 but extends to "any case." This assertion is said to be buttressed by the Senate Conference Report, which states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[Section 7701(g)(1)] authorizes attorneys fees in cases where <span id="Page_4540"></span>the employee prevails on the merits and the deciding official determines that attorneys' fees are warranted in the interest of justice, including a case involving a prohibited personnel practice or where the agency's action was clearly without merit. Reference to these two types of cases is illustrative only and does not limit the official from awarding attorneys' fees in other kinds of cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">H. Conf. Rep. No. 1717,...reprinted at 1978 USCCAN 2723, 2876. Thus, this case, like <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, raises the issue of how "far afield" from section 7701 actions does 5 USC 7701(g)(1) authorize an award of attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By refusing to award attorney fees in a physical disability retirement case under 5 USC 8347(d)(1), the panel in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> clearly declined to adopt the broad holding in <span class="Italic">Frazier</span>, 672 F.2d at 170, that 5 USC 7701(g)(1) authorizes such awards in "any case in which an employee or applicant for employment appears as a party." The test is whether there is clear statutory language connecting 5 USC 7701(g)(1) to the section covering the underlying action....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Frazier</span>, such a connection existed between 5 USC 7701(g)(1) and 5 USC 1206(c) because the Special Counsel's action against the agency under the latter statute was for a prohibited personnel practice which the former statute expressly covers....&#8197;Although the Special Counsel's complaint against Saldana was also brought under 5 USC 1206, this action (taken pursuant to subsection (g)) differs significantly from that in <span class="Italic">Frazier</span>. In <span class="Italic">Frazier</span>,...the Special Counsel brought an action <span class="Italic">against the employing agency</span> for taking retaliatory action against whistleblowers. In this case, the Special Counsel's action <span class="Italic">against Saldana</span> was for engaging in prohibited political activity. Therefore, the action against Saldana does not fall within the "any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency" provision of 5 USC 7701(g)(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although attorney fees may also be awarded under 5 USC 7701(g)(1) in "any case in which the agency's action was clearly without merit," we are not persuaded that this provision possesses the breadth Saldana suggests....&#8197;Saldana has not cited specific statutory language clearly connecting 5 USC 7701(g)(1) to complaints under 5 USC 1206(g). On the contrary, provisions in Title 5 indicate otherwise. Under 5 USC 1207(a), employees against whom complaints are filed by the Special Counsel have various procedural rights including: a reasonable time to answer the complaint, a hearing on the record, representation by counsel, and a written decision. 5 USC 7701 gives employees and applicants for employment many of these same procedural rights and, additionally, authorizes attorney fee awards. By setting forth overlapping procedural rights in both these statutory provisions, it is apparent that Congress did not intend to permit employees who prevail in actions by the Special Counsel to supplement their rights, specifically provided for by 5 USC 1207(a), with those separately provided for under 5 USC 7701. Accordingly, we are satisfied that Congress did not intend to waive sovereign immunity by extending the provisions of 5 USC 7701(g)(1) to complaints by the Special Counsel under 5 USC 1206(g).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After the 1994 amendments, fees still can not be awarded to individuals prevailing in Hatch Act cases if they are not federal employees. The prohibition of counsel fee awards for prevailing defendants in State and local Hatch Act cases who sought fees under 5 USC 1215 and 5 USC 1204(m) was applied in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Perkins</span>, 104 MSPR 148, 154-60 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-24, 2006 MSPB 344 (2006) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Perkins v. Office of Special Counsel</span>, 522 F.3d 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2008), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first ruling the administrative law judge made in his September 27, 2006 order was that State and local Hatch Act cases are matters arising under section 1215 and that subsection 1204(m) therefore provides the waiver of sovereign immunity necessary to award attorney fees to the prevailing parties in such cases. For the following reasons, we disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, section 2105 of title 5, United States Code, includes a definition of the term "employee" which, for the purposes of title 5, applies "except as otherwise provided by this section or <span class="Italic">when specifically modified</span>." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a) (emphasis added). The definition of the term "employee" means an individual who is:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;appointed in the civil service[2] by one of the following acting in an official capacity-</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;the President;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;a Member or Members of Congress, or the Congress;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(C)&#x2003;a member of a uniformed service;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(D)&#x2003;an individual who is an employee under this section;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(E)&#x2003;the head of a Government controlled corporation; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(F)&#x2003;an adjutant general designated by the Secretary concerned under section 709(c) of title 32;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;engaged in the performance of a Federal function under authority of law or an Executive act; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;subject to the supervision of an individual named by paragraph (1) of this subsection while engaged in the performance of the duties of his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">[2]&#x2003;For the purposes of title 5, "civil service" is defined as "all appointive positions in the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of the Government of the United States, except positions in the uniformed services." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2101(1). Neither Perkins nor the Henderson Police Department has alleged that Perkins was appointed to a position in any of the branches of the Government of the United States.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. The exceptions "otherwise provided by this section" do not address individuals employed or appointed by a State, a municipality, or any other political subdivision of a State, or by an agency or department thereof; rather, these exceptions address particular individuals employed at the United States Naval Academy, employees paid from nonappropriated funds of the various exchanges and other instrumentalities of the United States under the jurisdiction of the armed forces, a reserve member of the armed forces who is not on active duty or who is on active duty for training, employees of the United States Postal Service or of the Postal Rate Commission, and employees appointed under chapter 73 or 74 of title 38. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(b)-(f). Thus, the term "employee," as it is used in title 5, does not include individuals employed by a State, a municipality, or a political subdivision of a State, or by an agency or department thereof, except where the term is specifically modified to so indicate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1215 authorizes OSC to file a disciplinary action complaint with the Board against:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">any employee for having--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;committed a prohibited personnel practice,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;violated the provisions of any law, rule, or regulation, or engaged in any other conduct within the jurisdiction of the Special Counsel as described in section 1216, or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(C)&#x2003;knowingly and willfully refused or failed to comply with an order of the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1215(a)(1). While section 1215 authorizes OSC to file disciplinary actions against "employees," the section does not explicitly modify the term "employee" to include an officer or employee of a State or local agency within the reach of the section. At best, the section might be interpreted to include such officers and employees by implication because subsection 1215(a)(1)(B) refers to violations of any law, rule, or regulation within the jurisdiction of the Special Counsel as described in section 1216, and the laws, rules, and regulations described in section 1216 include chapter 15 of title 5, the provisions of the Hatch Act that are applicable to State and local officers and employees. However, the plain language of sections 1215 and 1216, as well as the structure of the various provisions relating to disciplinary actions against the various types of employees, supports the conclusion that complaints alleging that an individual appointed or employed by a State or local agency has violated chapter 15 do not arise under section 1215.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1216(a) provides that the Special Counsel shall conduct an investigation of any allegation concerning, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "political activity prohibited under chapter 15, relating to political activities by certain State and local officers and employees." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1216(a)(2). Accordingly, section 1216 authorizes OSC to investigate allegations concerning political activity prohibited under chapter 15. However, by its terms, section 1215 only authorizes OSC to bring disciplinary action complaints against "employees." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1215(a)(1). Section 1215 also sets forth the procedures under which the Board considers the complaint filed by OSC. These procedures entitle the employee to a reasonable time to answer the complaint and provide affidavits and documentary evidence in support of the answer, to be represented by an attorney or other representative, to a hearing before the Board or an administrative law judge designated by the Board, to have a transcript kept of the hearing, and to a written decision and reasons therefore at the earliest practicable date, including a copy of any final order imposing disciplinary action. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1215(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1215 also sets forth the disciplinary actions the Board can impose against an employee, including removal, reduction in grade, debarment from Federal employment for a period not to exceed 5 years, suspension, reprimand, or an assessment of a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1215(a)(2), (3). An employee subject to a final order imposing disciplinary action under &#x00A7; 1215 may obtain "judicial review of the order by filing a petition therefor with such court, and within such time, as provided for under section 7703(b)." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1215(a)(4). With respect to the case of any State or local officer or employee under chapter 15, section 1215(a)(5) provides that "the Board shall consider the case in accordance with the provisions of such chapter."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Chapter 15, which is entitled "Political Activity of Certain State and Local Employees," defines "State or local officer or employee" as:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an individual employed by a State or local agency whose principal employment is in connection with an activity which is financed in whole or in part by loans or grants made by the United States or a Federal agency, but does not include--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3"><span id="Page_4541"></span>(A)&#x2003;an individual who exercises no functions in connection with that activity; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;an individual employed by an educational or research institution, establishment, agency, or system which is supported in whole or in part by a State or political subdivision thereof, or by a recognized religious, philanthropic, or cultural organization.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1501(4). Subsection 1502(a) describes the political activities in which State or local officers or employees may not engage:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A State or local officer or employee may not--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;use his official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election or a nomination for office;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;directly or indirectly coerce, attempt to coerce, command, or advise a State or local officer or employee to pay, lend, or contribute anything of value to a party, committee, organization, agency, or person for political purposes; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;be a candidate for elective office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1502(a). However, section 1503 provides that section 1502(a)(3) does not prohibit any State or local officer or employee from being a candidate in a nonpartisan election. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1503. When a Federal agency charged with the duty of making a loan or grant of funds of the United States for use by a State or local officer or employee has reason to believe that the officer or employee has violated section 1502, section 1504 directs the agency to report the matter to the Special Counsel, and upon receipt of the report, or other information which warrants an investigation, section 1504 authorizes the Special Counsel to investigate the matter and to present his findings and any charges based on such findings to the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1504.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When OSC presents charges against a State or local officer or employee, chapter 15 describes the procedures the Board is to follow in considering the charges. The Board is required to fix a time and place for a hearing and to provide the officer or employee charged with the violation, as well as the State or local agency employing him, notice which sets forth a summary of the alleged violation and gives the time and place of the hearing, which may not be held earlier than 10 days after the mailing of the notice. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1504. The officer or employee, as well as the State or local agency employing him, or both, are entitled to appear with counsel at the hearing before the Board. Following the hearing, the Board: (1) determines whether a violation of section 1502 has occurred; (2) determines whether the violation warrants the removal of the officer or employee from his office or employment; and (3) notifies the officer or employee and the agency of its determination by registered mail. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1505.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, unlike a proceeding under section 1215, in which the statute authorizes the Board to impose disciplinary action against an "employee," the Board does not have the authority to impose discipline directly against the State or local officer or employee. Instead, under chapter 15, if the Board finds that the State or local agency has not acted in accordance with its determination that the officer or employee violated section 1502 and that the violation warrants removal, the Board has the authority to order the appropriate Federal agency to withhold from its loans or grants to the appropriate State or local agency an amount equal to 2 years' pay at the rate the officer or employee was receiving at the time of the violation.[4] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1506(a). In addition, unlike a final order under section 1215, which the affected employee can appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a party aggrieved by a Board order under sections 1504, 1505, or 1506 may seek review of the Board's order in the United States District Court for the district in which the State or local officer or employee resides. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1508.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The Board may order a Federal agency to withhold loans or grants when it finds that the employee has not been removed within 30 days after notice of the Board's determinations or when the employee has been removed and has been reappointed within 18 months of his removal to an office or employment in the same State. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1506(a). If the officer or employee has not been removed, or is reappointed within 18 months of his removal to a position in a State or local agency which does not receive loans or grants from a Federal agency, the Board orders the loans or grants to be withheld from the State or local agency that employed the officer or employee at the time of the violation. If the State or local agency to which the officer or employee is reappointed within 18 months of his removal is one that receives loans or grants from a Federal agency, the Board orders the loans or grants to be withheld from that State or local agency. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1506(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, a comparison of the two types of disciplinary action cases reveals that the provisions of each of the two types of disciplinary actions are complete without reference to the other type of action. The provisions of section 1215 and chapter 15 each describe the class of individuals to whom they apply, they each proscribe the activity that can result in disciplinary action, they each define the procedure the Board is to follow in considering complaints for disciplinary action, they each define the actions the Board can take upon determining that disciplinary action is warranted, and they each define the appeal rights of an individual or other party aggrieved by a Board order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the fact that a State or local employee against whom OSC brings disciplinary action charges under chapter 15 is subject to none of the procedural or substantive aspects of a disciplinary action case brought against an "employee" under section 1215, we reject the argument that subsection 1215(a)(5) should be interpreted as implicitly modifying the term "employee" as it is used in subsection 1215(a)(1) to include State and local officers or employees as individuals against whom OSC can bring disciplinary action complaints under that section. Instead, we interpret subsection 1215(a)(5) in accordance with its plain language, as indicating that the Board must consider disciplinary action complaints against State or local officers or employees in accordance with the provisions of another authority, specifically, chapter 15 of title 5. In addition, despite the fact that chapter 15 is among the laws described in subsection 1216(a) as falling within OSC's authority, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1216(a)(2), we note that subsection 1216(c) specifically provides, with respect to all of the other matters described in subsection 1216(a) as falling within OSC's authority, that OSC may investigate and seek disciplinary action under section 1215 "in the same way as if a prohibited personnel practice were involved," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1216(c). We find that the exclusion of political activity prohibited under chapter 15 from those matters for which subsection 1216(c) provides OSC may seek disciplinary action under section 1215, in the same way as if a prohibited personnel practice were involved, provides further support for the proposition that Congress did not intend to modify the term "employee" as used in subsection 1215(a)(1) to include State or local officers or employees.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;We also reject the respondents' argument that the instant complaint arises under section 1215 because OSC cited that section as one of the bases of its authority to bring the disciplinary action complaint against respondent Perkins. It is well-settled that the Board has limited jurisdiction and that an agency cannot confer jurisdiction on the Board where it does not otherwise exist. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Zufan v. Department of Transportation</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 258, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-13 (2002) (the fact that the agency conceded that the appellant was an "employee" cannot confer jurisdiction on the Board where it does not otherwise exist). Thus, OSC's mistaken reliance on section 1215 in its pleadings cannot bring the disciplinary action complaint it filed against respondent Perkins within the coverage of that section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because section 1215 authorizes OSC to file a disciplinary action complaint against "any employee," and we find no basis to conclude that the term "employee" as used in that section has been specifically modified to include individuals such as an officer or employee appointed or employed by a State or local agency, we find that a disciplinary action complaint alleging that an individual employed by a State or local agency engaged in political activity prohibited by chapter 15 does not arise under section 1215. Accordingly, we REVERSE the administrative law judge's ruling to the contrary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having determined that a case based on a disciplinary action complaint filed under chapter 15 does not arise under section 1215, we also REVERSE the administrative law judge's rulings that the respondents in this case are eligible for attorney fees and costs pursuant to subsection 1204(m). This subsection provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Board, or an administrative law judge or other employee of the Board designated to hear a case arising under section 1215, may require payment by the agency involved of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee or applicant for employment if the employee or applicant is the prevailing party and the Board, administrative law judge, or other employee (as the case may be) determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice, including any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency or any case in which the agency's action was clearly without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;If an employee or applicant for employment is the prevailing party of a case arising under section 1215 and the decision is based on a finding of discrimination prohibited under section 2302(b)(1) of this title, the payment of attorney fees shall be in accordance with the standards prescribed under section 706(k) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(k)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m). As the administrative law judge noted in his order, provisions allowing for the award of attorney fees constitute waivers of sovereign immunity, and they are strictly construed in favor of the sovereign, <span class="Italic">see Lane v. Pena</span>, 518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996) (a waiver of sovereign immunity will not be implied; a waiver must be unequivocally expressed in the statutory text and will be strictly construed); <span class="Italic">see also Hubbard <span id="Page_4542"></span>v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 205 F.3d 1315, 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (the Board's statutory authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(4)(A) to order corrective action to remedy a prohibited personnel practice did not constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity that would permit it to award back pay for the period for which the appellant had improperly been denied employment); <span class="Italic">Nibali v. United States</span>, 634 F.2d 494, 497 (Ct. Cl. 1980) (in finding that the court was without authority to award attorney fees in a civilian pay case pending before the court on the effective date of the Civil Service Reform Act, the court relied on the "long-standing rule of law that the consent of the United States to be sued will not be extended beyond its literal terms and will not be implied, [and t]his rule applies not only to the general subject of the suit but to specific items of award."). By its terms, subsection 1204(m) refers only to "a case arising under section 1215," and, while the respondents have argued that the instant case is one that arises under that section, they have not argued that the authority to award attorney fees under subsection 1204(m) applies to cases that arise under any other law, rule, or regulation. Having determined that a case based on a disciplinary action complaint filed under chapter 15 does not arise under section 1215, and construing the scope of subsection 1204(m) strictly in favor of the sovereign, we find that this subsection does not authorize the Board to award attorney fees to an individual, or to a State or local agency that employs that individual, whom OSC names as a respondent in a Hatch Act disciplinary action case in which OSC charges the individual with engaging in political activity prohibited by chapter 15 of title 5. Accordingly, because the instant case involves the charge that respondent Perkins engaged in political activity prohibited by chapter 15, specifically, subsection 1502(a)(3), we REVERSE the administrative law judge's ruling that the respondents are eligible for an award of attorney fees under subsection 1204(m).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal the Federal Circuit affirmed the preclusion of fees against OSC in <span class="Italic">Perkins v. Office of Special Counsel</span>, 522 F.3d 1373, 1377-81 (Fed. Cir. 2008). The <span class="Italic">Perkins</span> decision noted a change in the law after <span class="Italic">Saldana</span>, decided in 1984, allowing fees in cases involving federal employees defending against Special Counsel actions, but the court decided that the statutory modification did not encompass state and local employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue in this case is whether Mr. Perkins is eligible to receive attorney fees in connection with his successful defense in OSC's proceeding against him. For cases arising under the Board's appellate jurisdiction, section 7701(g)(1) authorizes the Board to award attorney fees in "any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency or any case in which the agency's action was clearly without merit." In <span class="Italic">Frazier v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held that section 7701(g)(1) authorized the Board to award attorney fees to employees appearing before the Board in a corrective action proceeding brought by the Special Counsel. 672 F.2d 150, 170 (D.C. Cir. 1982). In <span class="Italic">Saldana v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, however, we concluded that section 7701(g)(1) does not authorize the Board to award attorney fees to employees appearing before the Board in disciplinary action proceedings. 766 F.2d 514, 518 (Fed. Cir. 1985). We reached that conclusion because, "[u]nder 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1207(a) [(1982)], employees against whom complaints are filed by the Special Counsel have various procedural rights, including: a reasonable time to answer the complaint, a hearing on the record, representation by counsel, and a written decision." Section 1207(a), which is now codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1215(a)(2), did not include a right to attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1994, Congress authorized the Board to award attorney fees to employees who succeed in disciplinary action proceedings initiated by OSC. Pub.L. No. 103-424, 108 Stat. 4361, &#x00A7; 2 (codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m)). The language of section 1204(m) mirrors the language of section 7701(g)(1), but specifies that the Board may award attorney fees to "employees" in cases "arising under section 1215." Congress did not specify in section 1204(m) whether state or local employees in proceedings under chapter 15 are likewise entitled to attorney fees, nor did it provide a parallel provision for attorney fees in chapter 15. As Mr. Perkins is an employee of a local police department, his eligibility for attorney fees for the proceedings before the Board depends on whether section 1204(m) extends to state and local employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, OSC argues that this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain Mr. Perkins' petition for review. Citing the definition of "employee" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105, OSC contends that we lack jurisdiction because Mr. Perkins is not an "employee" and thus has no right of appeal under section 7703(a) of title 5. Instead, OSC asserts that jurisdiction lies with the district court in which Mr. Perkins resides because, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1508, that is where Mr. Perkins would have sought review of a decision on the merits if the Board had found a violation of section 1502. Mr. Perkins responds that he is an "employee" under section 7703(a) because he is an "employee" under section 1215. We agree with Mr. Perkins that he would qualify as an "employee" under section 7703(a) if he could establish that he is an "employee" under section 1215. We therefore conclude that we are required to address that legal issue in the course of deciding whether we have jurisdiction over the appeal in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1204(m) provides that the Board, or an administrative law judge or other employee of the Board designated to hear a case "arising under" section 1215, may require an agency to pay attorney fees incurred by an "employee" or "applicant for employment" if the employee or applicant is the prevailing party and the adjudicator determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1). In order to be entitled to a fee award, Mr. Perkins was thus required to show that he is an "employee" within the meaning of that statute and that the case in which he is seeking fees "arose under" section 1215.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The general definition of "employee" for purposes of title 5 is found in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105. That definition states that, "except as otherwise provided by this section or when specifically modified," the term "employee" refers to persons who are appointed in the federal civil service, who are engaged in the performance of a federal function under federal authority, or who are subject to the supervision of a federal officer. Mr. Perkins acknowledges that he is not an employee under the general definition of "employee" in section 2105. He argues, however, that the general definition of "employee" is "specifically modified" by section 1215 to include state or local employees and that he is therefore an "employee" for purposes of section 1215 and, by extension, for purposes of section 1204(m).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find unconvincing Mr. Perkins' argument that the definition of "employee" in section 2105 has been "specifically modified" by section 1215 to include state or local employees. Mr. Perkins' argument rests on two provisions of section 1215. First, he points to section 1215(a)(5), which provides that "[i]n the case of any State or local officer or employee under chapter 15 [the chapter containing the provisions of the Hatch Act applicable to state and local employees], the Board shall consider the case in accordance with the provisions of such chapter." The reference to "State or local officer or employee," according to Mr. Perkins, indicates both that state and local employees are "employees" for purposes of section 1215, and that a Hatch Act action against a state and local employee arises under section 1215 for purposes of section 1204(m).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither contention holds water. Nothing about the reference to state and local employees in section 1215(a)(5) indicates that Congress intended to modify the definition of employee for purposes of section 1215(a)(1). In particular, nothing in section 1215 "specifically modifie[s]" the definition of "employee" in section 2105 to include state and local employees. Section 1215 reads quite sensibly without straining the language of the statute in that manner: paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) contain provisions describing the process of adjudication of complaints against federal employees from complaint through decision and judicial review. Section 1215(a)(5) then states that in a case involving state or local employees, the Board will consider the case under chapter 15. Chapter 15 sets forth both the substantive prohibitions of the Hatch Act as applied to state and local employees, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1502-1503, and also the procedures to be followed in state and local cases from investigation through decision and judicial review, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1504-1508. The procedures set forth in chapter 15 differ in various respects from the procedures set forth in section 1215; the differences make clear that the reference to state and local employees in section 1215(a)(5) did not make section 1215 applicable to state and local employees, but simply served to direct those concerned with proceedings involving state and local employees to a different portion of title 5, i.e., chapter 15. Thus, there is nothing in section 1215(a)(5) that converts state and local employees into "employees" within the meaning of section 2105, and section 1215(a)(5) does not support Mr. Perkins' contention that actions against state and local employees "arise under" section 1215.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second provision of section 1215 on which Mr. Perkins relies is section 1215(a)(1)(B), which states that the Special Counsel shall file a complaint against an employee upon determining that disciplinary action should be taken against the employee for having violated "the provisions of any law, rule, or regulation, or engaged in any other conduct within the jurisdiction of the Special Counsel as described in section 1216." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1215(a)(1)(B). Section 1216 describes various matters within the jurisdiction of the Special Counsel, including, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, Hatch Act violations by federal employees and Hatch Act violations by state and local employees. Mr. Perkins argues that because section 1216(a)(2) gives OSC authority to investigate the political activities of state and local employees, the reference to section 1216 in section 1215(a)(1)(B) must mean that state and local employees fall within the definition of "employee" under section 2105.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That conclusion does not follow at all. Section 1215 authorizes the Special Counsel to file a complaint against an "employee" for having engaged in conduct within the jurisdiction of the Special Counsel under section 1216. That simply means that the employee must have committed one of the acts listed in section 1216 that can be committed by a federal employee. It does not mean that one should examine all of the violations referred to in section 1216 and then construe the term "employee" in section 1215(a)(1)(B) broadly enough that all of the violations listed in section 1216 could be committed by some employees under section 1215. That would amount to reading the statutes backwards.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4543"></span>Because the jurisdiction of the Special Counsel extends to persons other than federal employees, it is not surprising that section 1216, which describes the Special Counsel's investigative authority, would include references to violations that can be committed by persons other than federal employees. But that does not mean that the term "employee" in section 1215, which deals with the procedures applicable in disciplinary action cases against federal employees, must be interpreted to include state and local officers and employees, even though they are not subject to the "disciplinary actions" that the Board may impose under section 1215(a)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Perkins' interpretation of section 1215 would create a conflict between the provisions of chapter 15 and paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of section 1215. Paragraph (a)(3) of section 1215 provides that "[a] final order of the Board may impose disciplinary action consisting of removal, reduction in grade, debarment from Federal employment for a period not to exceed 5 years, suspension, reprimand, or an assessment of a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000." Under chapter 15, however, the Board's authority is limited to ordering funds to be withheld from a state or local agency that declines to remove an employee after receiving notice from the Board that the employee violated section 1502 and that removal is warranted. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1505, 1506. Additionally, paragraph (a)(4) of section 1215 states that "[a]n employee subject to a final order imposing disciplinary action under this subsection may obtain judicial review" in this court. Chapter 15, however, provides for judicial review of determinations or orders under sections 1504, 1505, and 1506 in the district court in which the employee resides. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1508.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Perkins deals with that conflict by asserting that section 1215(a)(1) authorizes OSC to initiate proceedings against state or local employees by filing a complaint, and that section 1215(a)(5) instructs the Board, once a complaint has been filed, to follow the provisions of chapter 15. Mr. Perkins argues that, as long as paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(4) are understood to apply only to federal employees while paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(5) are understood to apply to state or local employees, his interpretation of section 1215 does not conflict with any provisions of chapter 15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Perkins' interpretation of section 1215 is not persuasive. First, it is difficult to accept the argument that Mr. Perkins is an "employee" for the purposes of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(5), but not an "employee" for any of the paragraphs in between, as the same term, "employee" is used in each of paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(4), and (a)(5). Second, the argument that section 1215(a)(1) governs the filing of a complaint in state and local employee cases and that chapter 15 governs Board proceedings thereafter is unconvincing because chapter 15 addresses not only the procedures to be followed before the Board after a complaint is filed, but also the procedures leading up to the OSC's filing of findings and charges with the Board in state and local employee cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1504. The simple and straightforward response to Mr. Perkins' Ptolemaic interpretation of the interaction of section 1215 and chapter 15 is that when section 1215 refers to "employees" it refers to federal employees, as defined in section 2105, and when it refers to "State or local officer or employee," it refers to state and local employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1501(4) ("'State or local officer or employee' means an individual employed by a State or local agency...."). Read in that manner, section 1215 gives no support to Mr. Perkins' contention that he should be regarded as an "employee" for purposes of section 1215 and that the action against him should be regarded as arising under section 1215.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we conclude that Mr. Perkins is not an "employee" under section 1215. Because he is not an "employee" for purposes of that provision, there is no basis on which to argue that he is an "employee" for purposes of section 7703, which defines this court's jurisdiction to review decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board. Because we conclude that Mr. Perkins is not an "employee" for purposes of section 7703, we are required to dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Fees were denied when the respondent, a federal employee, settled for a suspension rather than the removal initially sought by OSC's Hatch Act complaint. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Salas</span>, 119 MSPR 530, 533-36 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-9, 2013 MSPB 43 (2013), determined that the respondent, although a prevailing party, did not demonstrate entitlement under an interest of justice analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with the administrative law judge's analysis regarding whether the respondent is the prevailing party. We conclude, however, that an award of attorney fees would not be warranted in the interest of justice, and we affirm the addendum initial decision accordingly. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1), an involved agency may be required to pay reasonable attorney fees that an employee or applicant incurs if that employee or applicant is the prevailing party and the Board or adjudicating official "determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice...." The Board has held that an employee is the "prevailing party" if she obtains an enforceable judgment against the agency or enforceable relief through a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Santella v. Special Counsel</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-21 (2000) (construing "prevailing party" standard under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) to be the same as the standard applied under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1)), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 328 F.3d 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2003). The prevailing party need only "succeed on any issue in the litigation which achieves some of the benefit he sought in bringing the action." <span class="Italic">Ray v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 100, 104 (1994) (citing <span class="Italic">Texas State Teachers Association v. Garland Independent School District</span>, 489 U.S. 782 (1989)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent asserted that she was the prevailing party here because she successfully petitioned the Board for review of the decision ordering her removal and the parties then reached a settlement agreement under which she served a 30-day suspension, a significant reduction in penalty. Citing <span class="Italic">Ray</span>, the administrative law judge instead found that the respondent could not be the prevailing party because she did not initiate the litigation, and OSC initiated it instead. <span class="Italic">See Ray</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. at 104 (to be a prevailing party, a party must "succeed on any issue in the litigation which achieves some of the benefit that [s]he sought in bringing the action sufficient to change the legal relationship between the parties"). He distinguished the cases that the respondent had cited wherein appellants received attorney fees after their appeals were settled, resulting in more favorable terms for separation, or after their removal penalties were mitigated or canceled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative law judge cited <span class="Italic">Santella</span> for the proposition that prevailing party analysis in appellate and original jurisdiction cases does not differ, his reasoning here is inconsistent with the Board's analysis in <span class="Italic">Santella</span>. In <span class="Italic">Santella</span>, OSC initiated the litigation as it did here by bringing a complaint. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel v. Santella</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 672, 673 (1998). The Board nevertheless found that the employees who were charged with a prohibited personnel practice were entitled to attorney fees. <span class="Italic">Santella</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 36-40.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative law judge also found that the respondent did not prevail on any of her claims but OSC prevailed because the respondent did not entirely avoid a penalty. He further found that OSC, and not the respondent, obtained a "material alteration of the legal relationship between the parties" because she had "to alter her behavior to OSC's benefit." <span class="Italic">See Buckhannon Board &#x0026; Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health &#x0026; Human Resources</span>, 532 U.S. 598, 603-04 (2001). Although <span class="Italic">Santella</span> differs from the appeal now before Board because the underlying complaint was decided on the merits in the respondents' favor, <span class="Italic">see Santella</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 2, the fact that an employee negotiates for, or the Board imposes, a lesser penalty rather than none at all does not preclude an award of attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Miller v. Department of the Army</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 547, &#x00B6; 2 (2007) (removal mitigated to 60-day suspension); <span class="Italic">Griffith v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 251, &#x00B6; 3 (2004) (settlement agreement changed the basis of the appellant's removal from misconduct to "medical inability to perform the duties of his position"). Further, the administrative law judge cited no authority from which we might conclude that a purpose of Hatch Act proceedings is to secure behavioral charges that benefit <span class="Italic">OSC</span>. Via the settlement agreement here, the respondent obtained a significant alteration in her relationship with OSC, that is, she retained her job. Accordingly, the respondent was the prevailing party in this litigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We nevertheless reach the same result as the administrative law judge because we cannot find that an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice. In <span class="Italic">Allen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 420, 434-35 (1980), the Board set forth the following examples of situations where an award of attorney fees would be warranted in the interest of justice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g): (1) Where the agency engaged in a "prohibited personnel practice"; (2) where the agency's action was "clearly without merit," or was "wholly unfounded," or the employee is "substantially innocent" of the charges; (3) where the agency initiated the action against the employee in "bad faith"; (4) where the agency committed a "gross procedural error" that "prolonged the proceeding" or "severely prejudiced" the employee; or (5) where the agency "knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits" when it brought the action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(m)(1) (situations where attorney fees are warranted by the interests of justice include "any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency or any case in which the agency's action was clearly without merit"); <span class="Italic">Santella</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 24 (applying analysis of section 7701(g)(1) to petitions brought under section 1204(m)(1)). The examples cited in the statute are "illustrative only" and do not preclude the award of attorney fees in other meritorious situations. <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 435 n.38.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent has not argued that OSC engaged in a prohibited personnel practice. Although she argues that her conduct was "an aberration," she has not shown that OSC's charges were "clearly without merit" or "wholly unfounded," or that she was "substantially innocent" of the charges. An employee is substantially innocent of the charges against him, for attorney fee purposes, if he is innocent of the primary or major charges or of the more important and greater part of the original charges. <span class="Italic">Santella</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 35. Here, the respondent admitted in the settlement agreement that she engaged in the conduct underlying <span id="Page_4544"></span>the charges, and the agency's email records also establish that it took place. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Sims v. Department of the Navy</span>, 711 F.2d 1578, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (attorney fees warranted because charged conduct took place even if no prohibited personnel practice occurred). The respondent agreed that her actions warranted the minimum statutory penalty under the Hatch Act. Although she claims that she did not understand the significance of her actions at the time and did not intend to engage in political activity or influence election results, she has not shown that her violation was an inadvertent or technical error. <span class="Italic">Cf. Van Fossen v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 788 F.2d 748, 750 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (the appellant made a good faith effort to follow regulations and reasonably relied on past approvals). The record shows that the respondent was a capable employee who informally supervised other clerical employees and who had received Hatch Act training during the month before she forwarded the email message.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also cannot conclude that OSC acted in bad faith when it initiated the charges, unreasonably perpetuated litigation against the respondent, or knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits when it brought the charges. OSC conducted a full investigation. OSC notified the respondent that a complaint had been filed and that she had a right to file an answer. The respondent admitted that she had received the complaint. OSC did not assert in the complaint that that removal was the only appropriate penalty and instead left the penalty determination to the Board's discretion. Within weeks after the Board vacated the default judgment and remanded the complaint to the administrative law judge for a decision on the merits, the parties reached a settlement consistent with Board precedent. <span class="Italic">See also Special Counsel v. Mark</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 516, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-24 (2010). Accordingly, the respondent did not establish her entitlement to attorney fees.</p>
