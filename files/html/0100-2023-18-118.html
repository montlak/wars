<h4 class="h4" id="sec11-118"><span class="space">c.</span> Deciding Official Who Is Biased, Whose Decision Is Directed, Who Lacks Discretion</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Assume that the proposing official is neutral, but the deciding official is not. The predisposition of agency officials to take adverse action is not harmful error. The presumption of good faith and integrity that accompanies administrative adjudications must be overcome to show that the deciding official prejudged the action. <span class="Italic">Teichmann v. Dept. of Army</span>, 34 MSPR 447, 452 (1987). The Board gives the deciding official the benefit of the doubt, <span class="Italic">Deskin v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 505, 517-18 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...That the deciding official may have been predisposed to severely discipline an employee before receiving his response to the notice of proposed adverse action does not constitute harmful procedural error or a violation of law when, as here, the employee was afforded an opportunity to reply to the charges against him and, in fact, did submit a response which was considered by the deciding official before he made <span id="Page_3300"></span>his final decision. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 22 MSPR 350, 353 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Bivens v. TVA</span>, 8 MSPR 458, 461 (1981), the deciding official testified that "he did not want to sign the letter removing the appellants but was instructed to do so." The Board did not find that the directed decision vitiated the action. Instead, the Board concluded that because the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> [<span class="Italic">Douglas v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/DOUGLAS_CURTIS_ET_AL_AT075299006_OPINION_AND_ORDER_253434.pdf">5 MSPR 280</a>, 305-06, 5 MSPB 313 (1981)] mitigation factors were not properly considered, it fell to the Board to determine the penalty without deference to the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Holm v. DOJ</span>, 40 MSPR 630, 635 (1988) (harmful error when the deciding official was put "in the untenable position of trying to render an objective decision in the appellant's case when his superior had already expressed his view that the appellant was guilty of reprisal"); <span class="Italic">Coons v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 15 MSPR 1, 3 (1983) (when the deciding official testified that he would have imposed any penalty short of no penalty at all had it been recommended by the proposing official, who was found to be biased, the Board decided that "the bias...is not the kind of factor that should have been analyzed under the harmful error standard...but rather is a factor that goes towards determining whether the penalty imposed by the agency was within the parameters of reasonableness."). [Refer to Chapter 7, "<a href="0100-2023-14-034.html#sec7-35"><span class="Italic">Douglas</span> Standards; Decision to Reflect Mitigating Factors or MSPB Imposes Maximum Reasonable Penalty</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Singh v. USPS</span>, 2022 MSPB 15, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 27-28 (2022), rejected an argument that the deciding official's decision was outside his authority or directed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant failed to show that his demotion was ultra vires or otherwise procedurally improper.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges that the decision to demote him was actually made by another agency official and communicated to the deciding official; he argues that the action is therefore <span class="Italic">ultra vires</span> and should be reversed as not in accordance with law. Agency actions have been found to be not in accordance with law when the individual taking the action lacked the legal authority to do so. For example, in <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 486, 487-88 (1993), the Board found that a demotion was not in accordance with law because the deciding official had retired from the agency prior to issuing the decision. In <span class="Italic">McCollum v. National Credit Union Administration</span>, 417 F.3d 1332, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2005), the Federal Circuit held that a removal was not in accordance with law because the only entity within the agency with the authority to authorize the appellant's removal never did so. Here, by contrast, there is no claim that the deciding official lacked the authority to demote the appellant. Therefore, that action was not ultra vires.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, the Board does require that the ultimate decision regarding an adverse action be made by the deciding official, not by some other individual. <span class="Italic">See Fontes v. Department of Transportation</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 655, 668 (1991). Here, the deciding official testified that the decision to demote the appellant was his alone. The appellant points to testimony from another agency official who stated that he told the deciding official to place the appellant in the EAS-19 position. However, the official could not recall when that conversation took place, except that it was sometime before December 1, 2014. The decision demoting the appellant was issued on November 26, 2014. Thus, even if the conversation took place as the official claimed, it may have taken place after the decision to demote the appellant already had been made. Accordingly, we find that the appellant failed to show that the decision to demote him was made by someone other than the deciding official. <span class="Italic">See Gores v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 100, 121 (1995) (finding no harmful procedural error when the appellant failed to show that the deciding official did not make the ultimate decision), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 132 F.3d 50 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Privette v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 60 MSPR 150, 154 (1993), remanded an appeal when some evidence suggested that the deciding official was forced to terminate the appellant, while other evidence suggested that the deciding official made his own decision. The AJ was required to resolve the credibility conflict on the significant point of the deciding official's decisional independence. Although removal proceedings may be improperly tainted as a result of outside influences, the Federal Circuit rejected the argument in the air traffic controller cases that a determination by the President that the strikers would be fired rendered the reply proceedings a sham. The Board ruled that comments by public officials about actions leading to discipline, specifically comments by the President and the Secretary of Transportation concerning the ATC strike, were not harmful <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications with agency officials responsible for deciding disciplinary cases. The employees and their representatives knew of the statements and had the opportunity to rebut them. <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 15 MSPR 92, 109 (1983).

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 15 MSPR 157, 165-66 (1983), analyzed the "command influence" argument:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In their petition for review, appellants continue to contend that public statements of President Reagan and high level agency officials, and alleged deficiencies in the notice of proposed removal and agency reply process, resulted in the denial of a meaningful opportunity for oral and written replies. They argue that such a denial constitutes harmful error and requires reversal of the agency action pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A). Basically, appellants argue that the effect of the President's remarks[13] and instructions issued by agency headquarters to the individual agency facilities subjected the deciding officials to a "command influence" that rendered the oral reply opportunities meaningless and futile. In sum, the contention is that the deciding official lacked independent authority to make the final decision in each individual action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13]&#x2003;At approximately 11 AM EDT August 3, 1981, President Reagan, after stating that an air traffic controller strike was in progress, announced that if air traffic controllers did not report for duty within 48 hours, they would "have forfeited their jobs and will be terminated." 17 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 845 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated by the agency in its <span class="Italic">amicus</span> brief, the "command influence" claim requires determination of the underlying questions of whether Executive Branch officials could establish a level of discipline for controllers participating in an illegal strike and whether any statement or instruction to FAA facilities deprived the deciding officials of the requisite authority to determine or recommend final action in the individual cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of the statements made by President Reagan, then Secretary of Transportation Drew Lewis, and Federal Aviation Administrator Helms, demonstrates that all such statements constituted specific information to the striking air traffic controllers regarding the penalty to be imposed for striking in the event that they chose not to avail themselves of the opportunity to return within the grace period. Thus, they were general statements of the penalty which would be imposed for those who were found to have participated in the illegal strike against the Federal government. We can find no wording in these statements which in any way could be said to have suggested any determination as to whether any particular individual or group of individuals was either participating in the strike or AWOL or both.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established that broad discretion is vested in management to establish appropriate discipline for employee misconduct subject to required statutory and regulatory procedures, providing that it is not arbitrary, capricious, or so unreasonable as to constitute an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">Harris v. United States</span>, 640 F.2d 1309, 226 Ct. Cl. 330 (1981). Among the limitations on the exercise of such discretionary authority is the requirement that employees be afforded prior knowledge of disciplinary guidelines<span class="Italic">. Tucker v. Veterans Administration</span>, 10 MSPB 112 (1982). In the instant case, the disciplinary guideline was not only publicly announced by the President of the United States and high level agency officials, but it is clearly set forth in the governing statute, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7311. Further, the statements setting forth the discipline to be imposed for those found to have participated in an illegal strike are in no way different from announced agency penalty tables or policy statements issued by agency officials indicating future disciplinary standards. None impinge on the deciding official's ability or authority to decide whether individual charges are sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The law does not require that the deciding official operate without guidelines or standards, but only that he bear the employee's explanation, assess its credibility, and determine whether the charges should be sustained. <span class="Italic">Pascal v. United States,</span> 543 F.2d 1284, 211 Ct. Cl. 183 (1976). Accordingly, we hold that there is no evidence that the public statements of President Reagan and high level agency officials either improperly affected the agency reply process or in any way adversely affected the appellants' rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A reviewing court found nothing amiss in the Board's approach, <span class="Italic">DiMasso v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 735 F.2d 526 (Fed. Cir. 1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reiterate as well that this court is bound by Court of Claims precedent...which has held that there is "nothing improper" about an agency's predetermining the penalty of removal, provided that the employee has full opportunity to present facts rebutting the charges. <span class="Italic">Pascal v. United States</span>, 543 F.2d 1284 (Ct. Cl. 1976).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Congressional scrutiny of an agency program, and alleged support by agency officials, including the deciding official, for disciplinary actions called for in congress did not invalidate a decision that the Board and its reviewing court believed to be properly reached by the deciding official in <span class="Italic">Robinson v. VA</span>, <a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/17-2143.Opinion.5-6-2019.pdf">923 F.3d 1004</a>, 1020-22 (Fed. Cir. 2019):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">E.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Due Process</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next turn to Mr. Robinson's procedural due process arguments. Mr. Robinson does not dispute that he received notice of the charges against him. Nor does he argue that the VA's notice of removal was deficient in any way. Instead, Mr. Robinson contends that Mr. Gibson and the VA violated Robinson's due process rights by determining his termination before he had the opportunity to respond to the second notice of proposed removal. He argues that Mr. Gibson's <span class="Italic">New York Times</span> statements, other public statements presupposing the removal of VA officials, and the fact that Gibson was both the Proposing Official and Deciding Official all show that "Robinson's removal was a foregone conclusion." Mr. Robinson <span id="Page_3301"></span>also contends that the AJ erred when he failed to assess all the evidence showing that Mr. Gibson and the VA were intent on removing Robinson from the outset, or at the very least, gave the appearance of having already predetermined the outcome.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One of the fundamental requirements of due process is "that an individual be given an opportunity for a hearing <span class="Italic">before</span> he is deprived of any significant property interest." <span class="Italic">Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 542 (1985) (emphasis in original) (quoting <span class="Italic">Boddie v. Conn</span>., 401 U.S. 371, 379 (1971)). This requirement may be fulfilled by "some kind of a hearing." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Bd. of Regents v. Roth</span>, 408 U.S. 564, 570 n.7 (1972)). In other instances, the requirement may be satisfied by an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 546 ("The essential requirements of due process...are notice and an opportunity to respond.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have stated that public employees in Mr. Robinson's position have a property interest in their continued employment. <span class="Italic">Stone v. F.D.I.C</span>., 179 F.3d 1368, 1374-75 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (collecting cases). As a public employee, Mr. Robinson was therefore entitled to an opportunity to be heard prior to any decision of removal. But the record appears to indicate that Mr. Robinson was not afforded an opportunity to respond to the second notice of removal before public statements regarding his termination were made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Statements credited to Mr. Gibson in the <span class="Italic">New York Times</span>, for example, are greatly troublesome. The article describes Gibson as disappointed that it took so long to remove Robinson, Deering, and Curry, who presumably are responsible for a "national scandal...over secret waiting lists and unnecessary deaths." The March 15, 2016 article and Mr. Gibson's alleged statements paint a picture showing Mr. Robinson to be responsible, in part, for the "wait-time scandal" and that Mr. Gibson made up his mind about Robinson's guilt before he was served with the second proposal of removal on March 16, 2016. Thus, it appears that Gibson publicly announced Robinson's termination before Robinson even knew about the proposed removal. The public statements about Robinson and his removal would appear on their face to violate Mr. Robinson's due process rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While Mr. Gibson's alleged <span class="Italic">New York Times</span> statements are troubling, the AJ credited Mr. Gibson's testimony that he was misquoted by the article's author. The AJ also relied on Mr. Gibson's testimony that "he did not predetermine the outcome of the case" and that Gibson gave the evidence "a lot of deliberation." Other than general accusations of bias, Mr. Robinson does not contend that Mr. Gibson is untruthful or that his testimony is otherwise impeachable. As discussed above, the AJ thought Gibson to be a credible witness and we will not disturb findings relying on Gibson's testimony. <span class="Italic">See Chauvin v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 38 F.3d 563, 566 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (stating a finding based on the demeanor of a witness, whether expressly or implicitly, cannot be overturned without "articulated sound reasons" (citing <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Veterans Admin</span>., 768 F.2d 1325, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 1985))).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Robinson contends that other occurrences indicate that he did not receive the pretermination consideration he is entitled to under the Due Process Clause. For instance, Mr. Robinson contends that political pressure and public assurances that those responsible at the VA would be removed indicate that Robinson was guaranteed to be removed from the outset. Mr. Robinson also argues that the fact that Mr. Gibson replaced Kevin Hanretta as Deciding Official shows the VA's effort to ensure a preferred outcome. Finally, Mr. Robinson contends that Mr. Gibson exhibited his pretermination bias by accusing Robinson of whistleblower retaliation (Charge 3) even though the same charge was previously rejected by the Board in a different case. We address each of these in turn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the Board addressed and dismissed Mr. Robinson's "political pressure" argument because statements made by the President and Congress only promised disciplinary action if misconduct was found. No political entity required removal prior to an opportunity to be heard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, we have previously noted that "[a]t the pretermination stage, it is not a violation of due process when the proposing and deciding roles are performed by the same person." <span class="Italic">DeSarno v. Dep't of Commerce</span>, 761 F.2d 657, 660 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">see also Holton v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 884 F.3d 1142, 1150 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Thus, the fact that Mr. Gibson was both the proposing official and the deciding official does not show that Mr. Robinson did not receive pretermination due process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, Mr. Gibson's discussion of Charge 3 in the Decision Regarding Proposed Removal shows that he took into consideration Mr. Robinson's response to the second notice of proposed removal. Mr. Robinson's written response to the removal allegations is dated April 20, 2016, and addresses all specifications to Charge 3 (the whistleblower retaliation charge). Mr. Gibson's removal decision is dated June 7, 2016. In the Decision Regarding Proposed Removal, Mr. Gibson stated he was persuaded by Robinson's explanation of one of the specifications, and as a result, did not sustain that particular specification to Charge 3. Therefore, based on this record, it is not unreasonable to conclude that Mr. Gibson fully considered Mr. Robinson's response prior to deciding his removal. <span class="Italic">See Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 545-46 (stating a pretermination opportunity to respond "should be an initial check against mistaken decisions--essentially, a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action."); <span class="Italic">accord Hodges v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 2012 M.S.P.B. 116, &#x00B6; 6 (2012) ("We find the deciding official's complete failure to consider the appellant's written response to the proposal notice before issuing a decision constitutes--in and of itself--a violation of minimum due process law.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, Mr. Robinson's implication that Charge 3 could not have been brought at all in the face of the Board's prior decision is incorrect. The AJ relied on collateral estoppel to reject only one of the five other specifications to Charge 3. The remaining specifications were not sustained due to alternate grounds. Thus, the fact that Mr. Gibson sustained Charge 3 on the remaining specifications notwithstanding Mr. Robinson's written response is no indication of a due process violation or that Mr. Robinson's removal was a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Robinson clearly had notice and a pretermination opportunity to be heard. His response swayed Mr. Gibson to dismiss one of the original Charge 3 specifications. Mr. Robinson therefore had a meaningful opportunity to respond prior to his disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">See Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 546 ("The opportunity to present reasons, either in person or in writing, why proposed action should not be taken is a fundamental due process requirement."). We see no error in the Board's conclusion that Mr. Robinson failed to show that his removal was predetermined. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. (stating that to require more than notice of the charges, an explanation of the evidence, and an opportunity to be heard "would intrude to an unwarranted extent on the government's interest in quickly removing an unsatisfactory employee.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The allegation may be that the deciding official considered offenses other than those cited in the proposal notice. <span class="Italic">Cross v. VA</span>, 16 MSPR 429, 430-31 (1983), decided prior to <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, determined that this error was not a basis for reversal of a suspension since the penalty was appropriate based on the seriousness of the sustained charges. [Refer to Chapter 7, "<a href="0100-2023-14-036.html#sec7-37">Proposal to List Aggravating Factors; Treatment of Warnings; Due Process Considerations</a>"; "<a href="0100-2023-14-039.html#sec7-40">Articulation of Relevant Factors</a>"; for due process implications of furloughs, and limitations on the discretion of deciding officials, refer to <span class="Italic">Gajdos v.

<p class="Body-Text">A deciding official who terminated the appellant when his term appointment expired, and who lacked authority to further extend the appointment, did not deny the appellant due process in <span class="Italic">Baker v. DOD</span>, SF-0752-16-0128-I-1 (NP 11/22/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An agency's failure to provide a tenured public employee with an opportunity to present a response, either in person or in writing, to an appealable agency action that deprives him of his property right in employment constitutes an abridgement of his constitutional right to minimum due process of law, i.e., prior notice and an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985). However, due process is a flexible concept that calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gajdos v. Department of the Army</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 361, &#x00B6; 18 (2014). It does not require that the deciding official have unfettered discretion to take any action he or she believes is appropriate upon considering the proposed adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Rodgers v. Department of the Navy</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 559, &#x00B6; 6 (2015); <span class="Italic">Putnam v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 532, &#x00B6; 13 (2014); <span class="Italic">see also Buelna v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 27 (2014) (stating that due process does not demand that the deciding official consider alternatives that are prohibited, impractical, or outside of management's purview).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Although these Board cases arose in the context of a Government-wide furlough, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(5), the due process concepts cited therein remain applicable in the case of a removal, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of his claim that he was denied due process, the appellant argues on review, as he did below, that he was not provided a meaningful opportunity to respond because the deciding official had no choice but to remove him, and that he, the appellant, was a loyal and devoted employee. The deciding official testified that, faced with a "tough" decision, he contacted the Human Resources (HR) Chief and the Office of General Counsel (OGC) to find out whether there were any alternatives to removal, but was advised that, pursuant to the pertinent provisions of the DOD AI and the DODEA AI, there were none because the appellant had failed to respond to the one valid job offer under the PPP to which he was entitled. While it is true that the deciding official lacked the authority to grant an extension of the appellant's tour, the deciding official possessed sufficient decision-making authority in the context of this removal action to satisfy the appellant's right to due process. <span class="Italic">Cf. Gajdos</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 361, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-23, 25 (finding that the procedures used by the agency did not deprive the appellant of constitutional due process even when the deciding official's <span id="Page_3302"></span>discretion to invoke alternatives to the furlough was limited); <span class="Italic">Putnam</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 532, &#x00B6; 12 (finding that the right to due process is not violated by a deciding official's limited authority to select a penalty other than the proposed indefinite suspension for the revocation of a security clearance).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An unusual case, even by Board standards, <span class="Italic">Rose v. DOD,</span> AT-0752-12-0063-B-2 (NP 8/10/2015), involved an individual working on a military installation who was falsely accused of making a threat and then barred from the base of the facility commanding officer. The employee was then charged AWOL and removed for the extensive AWOL that followed the bar order. The deciding official failed to consider alternatives to removal, e.g., administrative leave, denying the employee a due process right to fair consideration of the penalty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e agree with the administrative judge that the deciding official did not believe that he had the authority to reach any outcome other than removal. Moreover, we find that there was at least one viable alternative for the deciding official to consider other than removal--namely, the placement of the appellant on administrative leave pending the outcome of criminal proceedings. S<span class="Italic">ee Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 28 (indicating that placement on administrative leave might, in appropriate circumstances, be a viable alternative); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of Defense</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 584, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16 (2014) (finding that the appellant failed to establish a due process violation in the absence of a showing that there were viable alternatives to his removal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that it did not prevent the appellant from "asking" that the decision be held in abeyance. However, due process entails not the right to request a particular alternative, but rather the right to appeal to someone with the proper amount of authority. <span class="Italic">See Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 544-45 (1985) (discussing the right of a tenured employee to have a meaningful opportunity to invoke the discretion of a decisionmaker before his removal takes effect, and indicating that "where the employer perceives a significant hazard in keeping the employee on the job [during the response period], it can avoid the problem by suspending with pay").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Based on the foregoing, we agree with the administrative judge that the deciding official believed that he lacked discretion to select any alternative to removal, that there was in fact a viable alternative for him to consider, that the removal process was an empty formality, and that the agency violated the appellant's due process rights.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The agency also disagrees with the administrative judge's finding that reassignment may have been a viable alternative to removal. We need not consider this argument in light of our finding that postponement of the decision was a viable alternative that the deciding official could have considered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the agency argues that the Board's decision intrudes upon the authority of military commanders to bar individuals from their areas of command and unfairly saddles the agency with the financial consequences of a barment order over which it has no control. We disagree. We recognize military commanders' broad authority to exclude civilians from their areas of control, <span class="Italic">see Cafeteria &#x0026; Restaurant Workers Union, Local 473, AFL-CIO v. McElroy</span>, 367 U.S. 886, 893-94 (1961), and nothing in this Final Order, our Remand Order, or the remand initial decision purports that such authority is subject to Board review. As for the financial and administrative burdens the agency claims that the Board has unfairly placed upon it, we find that this was a matter entirely within the agency's control. The agency could have avoided this problem by assigning a deciding official who was able to exercise discretion.</p>
