<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-214"><span class="space">g.</span> Adverse Action Reply; MSPB Settlement</h5>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Ray Brook and AFGE Local 3882</span>, 29 FLRA 584 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3882 v. FLRA</span>, 865 F.2d 1283, 1286-88 (D.C. Cir. 1989), <span class="Italic">post</span>, an oral reply to an adverse action is not a grievance; the union does not have the right to be present during an employee's oral reply if the employee does not request union representation. Noting <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno Serv. Ctr. v. FLRA</span>, 706 F.2d 1019, 1023-25 (9th Cir. 1983) (EEO complaint procedures not grievance procedures), FLRA explained, 29 FLRA at 590-93:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]n <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 774 F.2d 1181 [(D.C. Cir. 1985)]...the D.C. Circuit disagreed with the Ninth Circuit's decision in the <span class="Italic">Fresno</span> case, and...concluded...that "grievance"...should be interpreted in light of its broad definition in section 7103(a)(9) of the Statute....&#8197;On reexamination, we believe that a return is warranted to the Authority's resolution of this issue in <span class="Italic">Fresno Service Center</span>. Therefore, consistent with the rationale in the D.C. Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, we conclude that a "grievance" within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A) can encompass a statutory appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Of course, as noted by the court in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, a union's institutional role with respect to statutory appeal matters is more restricted than its role in the negotiated grievance procedure. Furthermore, as noted by the court in <span class="Italic">IRS Fresno</span>, there must be consideration given to any conflict between rights under section 7114(a)(2)(A) and those under alternative statutory procedures. In <span class="Italic">U.S. Government Printing Office</span>, 23 FLRA No. 6 (1986), we resolved a conflict between section 7114 rights and the procedural requirements for a complaint of discrimination under 29 C.F.R. Part 1613, promulgated by the EEOC. We concluded that the informal adjustment of an EEO complaint did not constitute a bypass of the union in that case because the direct dealings between the employee and the management representatives occurred pursuant to specific regulations of the EEOC. Similarly, if there is a conflict between rights under section 7114(a)(2)(A) and those under other statutes, we will consider that conflict in determining whether section 7114(a)(2)(A) has been violated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the oral reply meeting in this case did not concern a "grievance."...&#8197;The sole purpose of the meeting was to permit the employee to make an oral reply to accusations that led to the proposed action against the employee. No final decision had been made by the agency regarding the proposed action, which at the time of the meeting was merely a possibility. In the absence of any final action by the agency as of the time the meeting was held, the employee had no basis for filing, and had not filed, an appeal pursuant to any statutory appeal procedure. Moreover, no grievance under a contractual grievance procedure was involved. In these circumstances, there was no "complaint"...and thus no "grievance"...and the Union therefore did not have a right to be represented under section 7114(a)(2)(A)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is not apparent how the interests of the unit would have been furthered by the union's presence at the meeting at issue in this case....&#8197;[T]he format of the meeting contemplated a wholly passive role for the agency. The meeting was held at the employee's request for the limited purpose of permitting the employee to make an oral presentation to management concerning the action that management had proposed taking against the employee. Nothing in the record provides a basis for finding that any settlement discussions were anticipated, or that any statement was expected from management reflecting the state of management's deliberations concerning the validity of the discipline proposed. Further, nothing in the record indicates the presence of any intimidation or coercion....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that the oral reply is a personal right of the employee under 5 U.S.C. 7513(b), and under that section the employee has a statutory right to "be represented by an attorney or other representative[.]" The employee elected to make an oral reply and elected to choose an attorney to represent him. While he could have chosen the union to represent him, he chose an attorney instead. In these circumstances, in which we have already concluded that no independent right to representation exists under section 7114(a)(2)(A)...we can find no statutory purpose that would be served by requiring that the Union be given an opportunity to be represented....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="page_1477"></span>Affirming FLRA, a reviewing court opined in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3882 v. FLRA</span>, 865 F.2d 1283, 1288 (D.C. Cir. 1989):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Under the plain language of section 7103(a)(9)...a "grievance" must involve a <span class="Italic">complaint</span> by an employee. Prior to the meeting at issue, the employee had not initiated any complaint; he filed a grievance against his employer only after the Warden had decided to formally reprimand him. Nor did the meeting concern an adverse decision affecting his employment, as was the case in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span> [774 F.2d 1181 (D.C. Cir. 1985)], in which we held that an employee's appeal of an improper <span class="Italic">dismissal</span> "meets the statutory definition of grievance as an employee 'complaint' concerning a 'matter relating to [his] employment.'"...&#8197;Indeed, at the oral reply stage, the employee was seeking to <span class="Italic">avoid</span> such an adverse decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The real issue in this case is whether the Union had some independent right to be present at the management/employee meeting when a charge against the employee was being discussed. In deciding this issue, the following facts are critical and determinative: the meeting at issue arose under section 7513(b); the employee did not request Union representation during the meeting; the meeting did not involve a matter covered by section 7114(a)(2)(A); and the Authority found that the meeting did not involve an application of the parties' contract grievance procedure (which might have required the invocation of section 7121(b)(3)). In light of this record, we can discern no legal basis for the Union's claim of a right to be present at the meeting.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA reached a different result regarding the union's role when, following an adverse action decision, an employee retained private counsel, appealed to MSPB, and then settled on the basis of a last chance settlement agreement. The union then had the right to notice of the settlement discussions and the right to participate in the process to the extent defined by FLRA and court decisions, as FLRA concluded in <span class="Italic">GSA Region 9 and AFGE Council 236</span>, 48 FLRA 1348, 1354-56 (1994), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, 53 FLRA 925 (1997), <span class="Italic">post</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;An exclusive representative of an appropriate unit in an agency shall be given the opportunity to be represented at--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;any formal discussion between one or more representatives of the agency and one or more employees in the unit or their representatives concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practices or other general condition of employment[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7103(a)(9) of the Statute pertinently defines "grievance" as "any complaint...by any employee concerning any matter relating to the employment of the employee[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order for a union to have a right to representation under the Statute, all the elements of section 7114(a)(2)(A) must exist. There must be: (1) a discussion; (2) which is formal; (3) between one or more representatives of the agency and one or more unit employees or their representatives; (4) concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practice or other general condition of employment....&#8197;In determining whether the elements of section 7114(a)(2)(A) exist in a particular case, we are guided by the intent and purpose of the section to provide the union with an opportunity to safeguard its interests and the interests of unit employees viewed in the context of the union's full range of responsibilities under the Statute....&#8197;In deciding whether the Union had a right under the Statute to notification of and an opportunity for representation at the settlement discussions and negotiations, the Arbitrator did not address these elements of section 7114(a)(2)(A). Examining the totality of the circumstances in this case, we conclude that all the elements of the Statute were present with respect to the discussions and negotiations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear that the negotiations and discussions were between one or more agency representatives and the unit employee and her representative.&#x2003;It is also clear that the discussions concerned a grievance within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A), notwithstanding that the discussions related to the employee's appeal to the MSPB. The Authority does not limit the term "grievance" in section 7114(a)(2)(A) to a complaint under the negotiated grievance procedure. We apply the term broadly to encompass complaints under statutory appeal procedures, such as appeals to the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, United States Border Patrol, El Paso, Texas</span>, 47 FLRA 170, 183-84 (1993) (and cases cited in the decision).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we find that, by their very nature, negotiations between an agency representative or representatives and the employee and her private attorney, resulting in a last chance agreement reinstating the employee in settlement of her appeal to the MSPB of her removal constitute formal discussions within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. In determining whether a discussion is formal within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A), we have advised that the totality of the circumstances presented must be examined, but that a number of factors are relevant: (1) the status of the individual who held the discussions; (2) whether any other management representatives attended; (3) the site of the discussions; (4) how the meetings for the discussions were called; (5) how long the discussions lasted; (6) whether a formal agenda was established for the discussions; and (7) the manner in which the discussions were conducted....&#8197;Although the Arbitrator did not address the element of formality, we can perceive [sic] of no informal aspects of the negotiations and discussions in this case that could possibly predominate over their obviously formal aspects: An agency representative or representatives authorized to settle a removal case on appeal to the MSPB on the behalf of the Agency discussed with an employee and her private attorney the terms of a last chance agreement, which would settle the removal case and result in the reinstatement of the employee. Applying the purposes of section 7114(a)(2)(A), we conclude that such negotiations and discussions by their very nature could not have the predominant aspects of informality that have characterized the Authority's decisions as to what discussions are informal<span class="Italic">. For example, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow</span>, <span class="Italic">California</span>, 45 FLRA 1332, 1335-36 (1992) (a spontaneous and unplanned meeting of short duration on the shop floor); <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration and Social Security Administration Field Operations, Region II</span>, 29 FLRA 1205, 1216 (1987) (a short, spontaneous meeting with the first-level supervisor at the employees' work place with no formal agenda); <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration and Social Security Administration, Field Operations, New York Region</span>, 16 FLRA 1021, 1033-34 (1984) (a meeting, at which the attendance of employee complainants was voluntary, conducted by a "facilitator," who did not act as a representative of management, to attempt to settle EEO complaints).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">GSA</span> returned to FLRA through exceptions following a remand to the arbitrator to clarify his remedy. The remedy directed by the arbitrator was that the agency post a notice that it would stop engaging in settlement discussions during the course of MSPB cases unless the union was provided notice of the discussions and an opportunity to be represented. FLRA sustained the award, determining to be unwarranted the agency's concerns about the Privacy Act, in <span class="Italic">GSA and AFGE Council 236</span>, 53 FLRA 925, 932-37 (1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">General Services</span> [50 FLRA 401 (1995)], issued subsequent to <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, the Authority held that consideration of the intent and purpose of section 7114(a)(2)(A) does not constitute a separate element in the analytical framework for determining whether a meeting constitutes a "formal discussion" within the meaning of that statutory provision; rather, it is only a guiding principle that informs the Authority's judgments in applying the statutory criteria. 50 FLRA at 404 n.3. The Authority further held that, to the extent that some Authority precedent sets forth that consideration as an independent element of the analytical framework, that precedent will no longer be followed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's contention that the Arbitrator's remedy for the violation of 7114(a)(2)(A) is contrary to law because <span class="Italic">GSA</span> was overruled by <span class="Italic">General Services</span>. In <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, the Authority found that the negotiations conducted by the Agency with the employee and her attorney met the elements set forth in section 7114(a)(2)(A) insofar as they were discussions that were formal between a representative of the Agency and an employee in the bargaining unit. In so doing, the Authority did not consider the intent and purpose of section 7114(a)(2)(A) as an independent, separate element of the analytical framework. Rather, the Authority relied on the purposes of that section as guidance only. Therefore, we find that General Services Administration is consistent with the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">General Services</span> and provides the appropriate legal basis for the remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Union's contention that the Arbitrator's failure to order the remedy requested by the Union is contrary to unspecified Authority precedent. In <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, the Authority did not direct the Arbitrator to fashion a particular remedy for the violation of section 7114(a)(2)(A). Rather, the Authority remanded that portion of the award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator to fashion a remedy. Furthermore, the remedy ordering the Agency to cease and desist from its unlawful acts and to post a notice is consistent with Authority precedent. <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Phoenix, Arizona</span>, 52 FLRA 182, 184 (1996) (the Authority found that in the circumstances of the case a remedy beyond a cease-and-desist order and the posting of a notice was not necessary to remedy the violation of section 7114(a)(2)(A)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In assessing whether the Union's presence at settlement negotiations of MSPB appeals would necessarily result in disclosure of information from a record protected under the Privacy Act, we are guided by our construction of section 7114 of the Statute and law that has been developed both by the Federal courts and by the Authority. <span class="Italic">See FAA</span>, 50 FLRA at 346.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, a union has the right to be represented at <span class="Italic">"any formal discussion</span> between one or more representatives of the agency and one or more employees in the unit or their representatives <span class="Italic">concerning any</span> <span class="Italic">grievance or any personnel policy or <span id="page_1478"></span>practices or other</span> <span class="Italic">general condition of employment(.)</span>" (Emphasis added.) In contrast, section 7114(b)(4) obligates an agency to furnish to the union, <span class="Italic">"to the extent not prohibited by law,"</span> data that meets the criteria set forth in that section. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a, restricts the disclosure, and redisclosure, of personally identifiable records. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b) provides, with certain exceptions, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">No agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The courts hold that a "disclosure" within the meaning of the Privacy Act is the actual retrieval of any information from a "record" within the meaning of that Act. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Bartel v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 725 F.2d 1403, 1408 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (<span class="Italic">Bartel</span>). The leading case articulating this "actual retrieval" standard is <span class="Italic">Savarese v. United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare</span>, 479 F. Supp. 304 (N.D. Ga. 1979), <span class="Italic">aff'd mem. sub nom, Savarese v. Harris</span>, 620 F.2d 298 (5th Cir. 1980), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 449 U.S. 1078 (1981) where the court held that for disclosure to be covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b) "there must have initially been a retrieval from the system of records which was at some point a source of the information." 479 F. Supp. at 308.[3] However, in <span class="Italic">Bartel</span> the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the "actual retrieval" standard is inapplicable where a disclosure is made by agency personnel who had a role in creating the record that contains the released information. 725 F.2d at 1408-11; <span class="Italic">see also Wilborn v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 49 F.3d 597, 601 (9th Cir. 1995) (<span class="Italic">Wilborn</span>) (court held that "'independent knowledge,' gained by the creation of records, cannot be used to sidestep the Privacy Act").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;Thus, under the courts, prevailing "actual retrieval" standard, if a party discloses information obtained independently of any records, such a disclosure does not violate the Privacy Act even if identical information is contained in records protected by the Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.</span> <span class="Italic">Kline v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 927 F.2d 522 (10th Cir. 1991) (disclosed information had been previously disclosed to the recipient by the employee); <span class="Italic">Doyle v. Behan</span>, 670 F.2d 535 (5th Cir. 1982) (there was no evidence that the manager's disclosure was drawn from an examination of a record that was created by other personnel, as opposed to her memory and personal knowledge as the case unfolded).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that, based on the plain wording of section 7114(a)(2)(A), the remedy fashioned by the Arbitrator is not precluded by the Privacy Act, as contented by the Agency. The remedy affords the Union representation at settlement negotiations of MSPB appeals. As the Authority found in <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, those negotiations constitute formal discussions under section 7114(a)(2)(A). Thus, the remedy appropriately affords the Union its statutory right to be present at formal discussions. In this regard, it is significant that section 7114(a)(2)(A) provides a union the right to be represented at "any formal discussion" concerning "any grievance or any personnel policy or practices" and thus places no legal conditions on a union's right to attend such discussions.[4] Therefore, under the plain wording of section 7114(a)(2)(A), a union has the right to be represented at a formal discussion without regard to the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;In contrast, section 7114(b)(4) places conditions on an agency's obligation to furnish data to a union by providing that an agency will furnish requested data "to the extent not prohibited by law."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that affording the Union the opportunity to attend settlement negotiations of MSPB appeals would necessarily result in the disclosure of the fact that an employee has appealed an adverse action to MSPB and the fact that an adverse action had been taken against an identified employee.&#x2003;However, the Agency has not established that the Union's acquiring knowledge of those two events as a result of the Agency providing notice of, and the Union's attendance at, settlement negotiations would be related to information in, or retrieved from, a "record" within the meaning of the Privacy Act. The Agency also argues that sensitive information not incorporated into any resulting settlement agreement would be disclosed to the Union at such meetings. Similarly, the Agency has not shown that such sensitive information would be information contained in or retrieved from a "record" within the meaning of the Privacy Act. Thus, the Agency has not supported the expansive reading of the Privacy Act that it asserts overrides the requirements of section 7114(a)(2)(A)<span class="Italic">. Cf. Naval Ordnance Station of Louisville, Kentucky and</span> <span class="Italic">International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers</span>, <span class="Italic">AFL-CIO, Local Lodge 830</span>, 34 FLRA 687, 689 (1990) (the union did not establish that a requirement that the grievant explain his reasons to support a request for relief from an overtime duty assignment would be maintained by the Activity in a "record" within the meaning of the Privacy Act from which the information could be retrieved).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency further argues that Union attendance at settlement negotiations of MSPB appeals would necessarily result in the disclosure of information in documents protected by the Privacy Act pertaining to disciplinary and health matters, and the terms of any resulting settlement agreement. It is clear that the Agency's concern here relates to information in a "record" within the meaning of the Privacy Act. However, the Agency has offered nothing beyond its speculation about such future disclosures. As the remedy for the violation of section 7114(a)(2)(A) addressed in GSA provides for the Union to attend formal discussions, the Union's statutory right to be represented at such meetings cannot be nullified on the speculative grounds of potential privacy problems under the Privacy Act. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson Air Force Base</span>, 38 FLRA at 333 (Proposal 3, which granted the union the right to be present when a last chance agreement is offered to an employee, did not violate the Privacy Act because it did not require the disclosure of "records" within the meaning of the Privacy Act).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent the Agency's concern that information in a "record" within the meaning of the Privacy Act could be disclosed at such negotiations, we note that the Agency will be a full participant in the settlement negotiations and in charge of the records within its control. Thus, the Agency will be required to conduct those negotiations without prohibited disclosures. If problems arise within those negotiations, they can be dealt with at that time when the nature of particular documents and the ability to protect the employee's privacy interests in those documents will no longer be speculative and can be evaluated under Privacy Act precedent.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;The courts' decisions in <span class="Italic">Bartel</span> and <span class="Italic">Wilborn</span> have limited applicability because those cases did not concern, as here, a prospective remedial order. Rather, those cases concerned information that had already been disclosed and, therefore could be assessed under the standards set forth in the Privacy Act. They would, however, be applicable in determining whether information is disclosed at a particular negotiation where the management official negotiating the settlement is the same as the one who imposed the discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, we note that the Arbitrator directed the Agency to post a notice advising employees that the Agency would afford the Union an opportunity to participate in settlement negotiations and that the terms of that notice must be worked out by the parties, "based on FLRA case law." As such, in addition to the fact that nothing in Authority case law requires the Agency to disclose prohibited information in the meetings encompassed by the notice, the parties are free to recognize that and tailor the notice to the employees accordingly.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's reliance on the Authority's decisions in <span class="Italic">FAA, Westbury</span> and <span class="Italic">FAA</span> is misplaced because the unions in those cases specifically sought the disclosure of "records" within the meaning of the Privacy Act. For the same reasons, this case is distinguishable from the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Correctional Facility, El Reno, Oklahoma</span> <span class="Italic">and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 171</span>, 51 FLRA 584 (1995) (the agency's refusal to provide the union a copy of a settlement agreement and the agency's written response to the employee's MSPB complaint did not violate the Statute because disclosure of the requested information is prohibited by the Privacy Act).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor, Office of Ass't Sec'y for Admin. and Mgmt. and AFGE Local 648</span>, 32 FLRA 465, 471-72 (1988) (relying on <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Ray Brook</span>, 29 FLRA 584 (1987)), the agency committed a ULP when it met with an employee and the employee's lawyer pursuant to a clause in an MSPB settlement agreement that required the meeting to discuss the employee's position responsibilities and conduct upon reinstatement to the agency. "The rights and expectations of unit employees are influenced by the expression by management of its views on the propriety and acceptability of employee conduct of the sort discussed in the...meeting."
