<h3 class="h3" id="sec5-18"><span class="space">C.</span> MATTERS AFFECTING NONUNIT EMPLOYEES</h3>
<p class="noindent">A proposal is nonnegotiable that seeks directly to negotiate the working conditions of nonunit employees. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1985 and VAMC Dublin</span>, 55 FLRA 1145, 1151-52 (1999) (Proposal 3), explained as to a proposal, offered by a unit of nursing assistants, to reduce the number of resident nurses (part of another bargaining unit):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A proposal that directly affects conditions of employment of employees in other bargaining units is outside the duty to bargain.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2879, AFL-CIO</span> <span class="Italic">and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings and</span> <span class="Italic">Appeals, San Diego, California, </span>49 FLRA 1074, 1089 (1994) <span class="Italic">(SSA San Diego). </span>As the court stated in <span class="Italic">Cherry</span> <span class="Italic">Point:</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">We are not aware of any case--in either the public or private sectors--in which an employer has been required to bargain with a union over the conditions of employment of <span class="Italic">employees in another bargaining unit.</span>...&#8197;There is a good reason why no such case appears to exist--for a court to so hold would violate the fundamental principle that a union is the exclusive representative of employees in the certified or recognized unit, and those employees <span class="Italic">only.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">952 F.2d at 1442 (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying <span class="Italic">Cherry Point, </span>the Authority has determined that "[a]n agency is not required under the Statute to bargain with one exclusive representative about conditions of employment in a unit represented <span id="page_518"></span>by another union because such a requirement would run afoul of the principle of exclusive recognition." <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, National Council of</span> <span class="Italic">HUD Locals 222 and U.S. Department of Housing and</span> <span class="Italic">Urban Development, </span>54 FLRA 1267, 1276 n.11 (1998) (Member Wasserman dissenting as to other matters), <span class="Italic">citing American Federation of Government Employees,</span> <span class="Italic">Local 32 and U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Washington, D.C.</span>, 51 FLRA 491, 505, 507-08 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA</span>, 110 F.3d 810 (D.C. Cir. 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, it is undisputed that the RNs are represented by the Georgia Nurses Association, a unit different from that represented by the Union. It is also undisputed that the proposal, by its express terms, would require that "the number of RNs be decreased." A decrease in the number of RNs would directly affect their conditions of employment. As the Union made no request to sever and separately address the portion of the proposal relating to Nas...we find that Proposal 3 in its entirety is outside the duty to bargain since it would directly affect conditions of employment of employees represented in a different bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">See SSA</span> <span class="Italic">San Diego, </span>49 FLRA at 1089 (proposal establishing criteria by which employees in another bargaining unit would qualify for parking permits). <span class="Italic">Cf. International</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers,</span> <span class="Italic">Local 35 and U.S. Department of the Navy, Norfolk</span> <span class="Italic">Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia, </span>54 FLRA 1377, 1381-82 (1998) (proposal that restaurant be located at site prescribed by union held to be within the duty to bargain despite proposal's effect on, among others, employees in other bargaining units, because such effects were indirect).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusion: Proposal 4 concerns the conditions of employment of employees who are represented by another union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that Proposal 4 is nonnegotiable because it concerns the conditions of employment of employees who are represented by another union in a different agency.&#x2003;Proposals that directly determine the conditions of employment of employees who are represented by another union are outside the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R1&#8209;109</span>, 61 FLRA 593, 597 (2006) (<span class="Italic">NAGE</span>) (citation omitted). The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit explained that allowing bargaining over such proposals "would violate the fundamental principle that a union is the exclusive representative of employees in the certified or recognized unit, <span class="Italic">and those employees only</span>." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Cherry Point, N.C. v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 1434, 1442 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>) (emphasis added). Applying <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, the Authority has agreed that "[a]n agency is not required under the Statute to bargain with one exclusive representative about conditions of employment in a unit represented by another union because such a requirement would run afoul of the principle of exclusive recognition." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Council of HUD Locals 222</span>, 54 FLRA 1267, 1276 n.11 (1998) (Member Wassermen dissenting as to other matters) (citation omitted); <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion &#x0026; Repair, Newport News, Va.</span>, 65 FLRA 1052, 1054 (2011) (citations omitted), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom., NAIL v. FLRA</span>, 680 F.3d 839 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (concluding that contract provision that determined conditions of employment of employees who were represented by another union was unenforceable).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 4 requires the Agency to offer VSIP to employees who were transferred to the Army.&#x2003;The Union does not dispute the Agency's assertion that these employees are represented by the National Federation of Federal Employees rather than the Union. Proposal 4, therefore, directly determines the conditions of employment of employees who are represented by another union. Because such proposals are outside the duty to bargain, we find that Proposal 4 is similarly outside the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NAGE</span>, 61 FLRA at 597 (citation omitted) (finding several proposals were outside the duty to bargain because they determined conditions of employment for employees who were represented by another union).</p>
<p class="noindent">In a straightforward analysis of a proposal for negotiations over parking spaces, <span class="Italic">AFCSME Local 2910 and Library of Congress</span>, 53 FLRA 1334, 1338-39 (1998), FLRA explained that "proposals that directly implicate the working conditions of unit employees, and that are otherwise within the duty to bargain, are not removed from the duty simply because they also affect non-unit employees":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A proposal that directly determines the conditions of employment of non-unit employees, including supervisors, is outside the duty to bargain.[5] <span class="Italic">American Federation of</span> <span class="Italic">Government Employees, Local 32 and U.S. Office of Personnel</span> <span class="Italic">Management, Washington, D.C.</span>, 51 FLRA 491, 505-13 (1995) <span class="Italic">(OPM), aff'd sub nom. American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees v. FLRA</span>, 110 F.3d 810 (D.C. Cir. 1997). However, the fact that a proposal affects non-unit employees is not sufficient to remove it from the duty to bargain. In this regard, "[n]early every bargaining proposal, if accepted, will have some effect on non-unit personnel<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. At 815. That a proposal has an indirect effect on non-unit employees may relate to its reasonableness or merits, but does not render the proposal outside the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">Id.;</span> and <span class="Italic">Cherry</span> <span class="Italic">Point</span>, 952 F.2d at 1441 n.8. Accordingly, proposals that directly implicate the working conditions of unit employees, and that are otherwise within the duty to bargain, are not removed from the duty simply because they also affect non-unit employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;However, "an agency is fully empowered to bargain over, and to choose to agree to, a contract proposal that directly implicates the working conditions of its supervisors" because such proposals address permissive subjects of bargaining<span class="Italic">. American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3302 and</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security</span> <span class="Italic">Administration</span>, 52 FLRA 677, 681-82 (1996) <span class="Italic">(AFGE, Local 3302)</span>. Accordingly, "[o]nce an agency and a union agree to such a proposal, it is enforceable provided that it is otherwise consistent with the Statute<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. At 682.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The precise line between proposals that have an indirect effect on non-unit employees, and proposals that have a direct effect may be difficult to discern, but nothing on the face of this proposal indicates a direct effect on non-unit employees. The Union's proposal would require the Agency only to provide a proportionate number of parking spaces to unit members. It would not directly determine the allocation of parking spaces to non-unit employees. Although allocation of spaces to employees in the Union's unit obviously would reduce the number of spaces available to others, that effect is not sufficient to remove the proposal from the Agency's duty to bargain. In this regard, the court held, in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, that a proposal that determined parking for all employees, not just bargaining unit members, was outside the duty to bargain because it directly determined conditions of employment of non-unit employees. <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, 952 F.2d at 1441-42. However, the court also stated that a proposal requiring the agency to allocate all parking-spaces to unit employees would be within the duty to bargain. The court stated that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Such a proposal arguably would be unreasonable, for, if accepted, it would leave no parking space for persons outside of the unit. But "reasonableness" does not determine whether a subject is bargainable. The employer's recourse in response to such a proposal is to reject it or to counter with a more reasonable proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, 952 F.2d at 1441 n.8.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, as the Union's proposal does not directly determine conditions of employment of non-unit employees, it is within the duty to bargain unless it is removed from that duty for some reason other than the effect of the proposal on such employees....</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiability problems arise from proposals that define conditions of employment of unit employees in a fashion that may impact the working conditions of nonunit employees, not from proposals that seek to define working conditions of nonunit employees. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 14 FLRA 754, 754-56 (1984), determined that because of the impact on nonunit employees a proposal was not negotiable that defined the competitive area for purposes of a RIF. The case was reconsidered in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 22 FLRA 478 (1986), <span class="Italic">on remand from Local 32, AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 774 F.2d 498, 565-06 (D.C. Cir. 1985). The appeals court had directed FLRA to resolve the apparent conflict between the <span class="Italic">Local 32</span> case and <span class="Italic">ACT, Pennsylvania State Council and Pennsylvania Army and Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 14 FLRA 38 (1984), concluding that a proposed competitive area was within the duty to bargain. FLRA then determined in its 1986 decision, expressly disavowing a "vitally affects" test employed by the NLRB, 22 FLRA at 480:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_519"></span>...The Authority has, in a number of instances, been presented with bargaining proposals regarding the conditions of employment of unit employees which also affect employees outside the unit. Proposals relating to RIF frequently have this result because controlling Government-wide regulations mandate uniform procedures. In such circumstances, the Authority has attempted to strike an appropriate balance between the right of the union to negotiate over the conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees and the right of the agency to set conditions of employment of nonbargaining unit employees....&#8197;On the one hand, it is the Authority's view that the scope of bargaining would be unduly restricted by a rule limiting the bargaining obligation to negotiable proposals which have absolutely no effect on employees outside the bargaining unit. Therefore, it has not adopted such a rule. On the other hand, a rule requiring negotiations on proposals which actually establish conditions of employment of nonunit employees goes beyond the requirements of the Statute and might unduly impede the Agency in functioning effectively and efficiently. To balance these conflicting rights, the Authority has distinguished (1) permissively negotiable proposals which would affirmatively establish or define a condition of employment for nonunit employees or positions [2] from (2) mandatorily negotiable proposals which would affect conditions of employment of nonunit employees or positions only to a lesser degree.[3]</p>

<p class="noindent">Continuing its commentary concerning the impact of proposals on nonunit employees, FLRA explained that the point of nonnegotiability was determined by "whether the nature and degree of the impact of the proposal is so intrinsically related to the working conditions of nonunit employees so as to invade the purview of other unit representatives or require the agency to act in a way that will have significant effect on the rights of employees not represented by the union offering the disputed proposal," 22 FLRA at 482:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Statute, in determining the negotiability of proposals which affect the conditions of employment of unit as well as non-unit employees, the Authority will balance the right of the union to negotiate over the conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees and the right of the agency to set the conditions of employment of nonbargaining unit employees. In weighing the parties' respective rights, we will determine whether the nature and degree of the impact of the proposal is so intrinsically related to the working conditions of nonunit employees so as to invade the purview of other unit representatives or require the agency to act in a way that will have significant effect on the rights of employees not represented by the union offering the disputed proposal. In such a case, management is not required to bargain. However, where the proposal has only a limited or indirect effect on the interests of employees outside the bargaining unit it will be subject to appropriate negotiations.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Local 32</span> result continued to be challenged in court. In 1988 the D.C. Circuit decided essentially that FLRA had not created a test that could readily be discerned. During the protracted litigation over the negotiability of proposals concerning the definition of competitive areas, the court explained, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 v. FLRA</span>, 853 F.2d 986, 992-93 (D.C. Cir. 1988):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor does the <span class="Italic">Local 32 II</span> decision indicate to us that the FLRA has a clear vision of the standard it is purporting to follow. At one point, the Authority states that a proposal is not bargainable if it "actually determines" the working conditions of nonunit employees; at another, the Authority defines a lower standard, under which a proposal is not bargainable if it has a "significant effect" on nonunit employees....&#8197;More recently, the FLRA has altered its formulation yet again, limiting invocation of its asserted inherent authority to "[a] proposal which has a direct and significant effect <span class="Italic">on vital interests</span> of nonunit employees"....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having twice failed to articulate an intelligible rationale for determining when an impact on nonunit employees precludes mandatory bargaining over a competitive area proposal, the Authority should reconsider the standard that obtains in the private sector. Under that standard, the expert adjudicator inquires only whether vital interests of unit employees would be affected by a given proposal, and permits bargaining over such proposals without regard to the potential effect on nonunit employees. Before asserting that the FSLMRA requires more with respect to competitive area proposals or any other subjects of bargaining, the FLRA must tie its disposition to a solid foundation. It is not enough to refer in Delphic tones to inherent authority, or to rely vaguely on the Authority's general duty to interpret the statute with government efficiency in mind.</p>
<p class="noindent">Finally, in 1988, the Authority disavowed its balancing test. It shifted to a test permitting negotiability of proposals (otherwise negotiable) that "vitally affect" unit members, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 33 FLRA 335, 337-38 (1988):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have reviewed our approach in light of the court's decision. On reexamination, we adopt the private sector test used by the NLRB in determining questions involving the duty to bargain over proposals concerning conditions of employment of unit employees which also affect employees or positions outside the unit. In determining whether there is a duty to bargain over such proposals, the NLRB focuses on whether the matter "vitally affects" terms and conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees. The NLRB limits its examination to the interests of unit employees; the NLRB does not consider the effect of the proposal on nonunit employees. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Allied Chemical &#x0026; Alkali Workers, Local 1 v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass</span>, 404 U.S. 157 (1971). Consistent with the private sector standard, we have formulated the following approach to resolving disputes over the negotiability of such proposals under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the statutory scheme established by sections 7103(a)(12), 7106, 7114, and 7117 of the Statute, a proposal which concerns a condition of employment of bargaining unit employees is negotiable if it is consistent with Federal law, Government-wide regulations, and agency regulations for which there is a compelling need. The term "conditions of employment" is defined in section 7103(a)(14) as:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[P]ersonnel policies, practices, and matters, whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise, affecting working conditions, except that such term does not include policies, practices, and matters--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;relating to political activities prohibited under subchapter III of chapter 73 of this title;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;relating to the classification of any position; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x2003;to the extent such matters are specifically provided for by Federal statute[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In cases which do not involve an exclusion from the definition of "conditions of employment," we will examine only one factor in deciding whether a proposal concerns a condition of employment of bargaining unit employees: Whether the proposal vitally affects the working conditions of employees in the bargaining unit....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We will find that a proposal is within the duty to bargain under the Statute if it (1) vitally affects the working conditions of unit employees, and (2) is consistent with applicable law and regulations. We no longer will examine the effect of the proposal on nonunit employees or positions. Prior Authority decisions which are inconsistent with this approach will no longer be followed.</p>
<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit declined, for technical reasons, to consider the Authority's revision in thinking. <span class="Italic">OPM v. FLRA</span>, 905 F.2d 430, 435-37 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (with concurring opinion by Judge Silberman, who would have revisited the "vitally affects" test).</p>
