<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-87"><span class="space">b.</span> Same Line of Work</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Haning v. Marine Corps</span>, 31 MSPR 252, 253-55 (1986), described the relation between prolonged temporary status and tenure, or appeal rights, in a career-conditional appointment involving an employee who had a temporary appointment not to exceed one year when he was converted to a career-conditional appointment. Although time in temporary appointments can be credited toward completion of an appointment requiring completion of probation, Mr. Haning's time in a temporary appointment was not credited toward completion of probation in the career-conditional appointment because the temporary appointment was not in the same line of work as the career-conditional appointment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant was originally hired as a Mechanic, WG-3809, 8/1 (hereinafter WG-8) under a temporary appointment not to exceed one year. Later, appellant was converted to a career conditional appointment to the position of Mechanic, WG-3809, 10/1 (hereinafter WG-10), subject to a one-year probationary period. Appellant was terminated during his alleged probationary period and appealed to the Board's San Francisco Regional Office contending that his prior service in the WG-8 position counted toward completion of the probationary period, and his removal was improper because he did not receive required procedural rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that where an employee is converted to a career conditional appointment the employee is required to serve a probationary period. <span class="Italic">See Coltin v. Department of the Navy</span>, 20 MSPR 16, 17 (1984). The Board has also recognized, however, that time spent under a temporary appointment prior to the conversion to the career conditional appointment can be credited towards completion of the probationary period when the requirements of Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Chapter 315, Appendix A-3(c)(1) are satisfied. <span class="Italic">Coltin, supra.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under this provision of the FPM, prior service is creditable towards completion of the probationary period where, among other things, the prior service was: (1) rendered immediately preceding the career-conditional conversion; (2) in the same agency; (3) in the same line of work. FPM Chapter 315, Appendix A-3(c)(1)(a)--(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue raised in the present case is whether appellant's service in his temporary appointment as a Mechanic, WG-8, was in the same line of work as his career conditional position of Mechanic, WG-10. The term "same line of work" must be considered a term of art and has been defined in the FPM as meaning that the two positions are so similar they require the same qualifications, and the nature of the work would place the positions in the same competitive level for reduction in force purposes. Under this definition, an incumbent could be interchanged between the positions without significant training and without unduly interrupting the work program in the manner prescribed by FPM Chapter 351, subchapter 2-3. FPM Chapter 315, Appendix A-3(c)(3). The Board has interpreted the FPM to mean that in determining whether two positions are in the same line of work, the nature and character of the duties being performed controls over questions of intent or technical title. <span class="Italic">Van Skiver v. United States Postal Service</span>, 6 MSPB 680, 682, 7 MSPR 18, 20 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying these considerations to the present case reveals that the two positions in question are not within the same line of work as defined by the FPM. The record establishes that while WG-8 workers repair metal body components, WG-10 workers also repair damage to mainframes and body structural members, effect more difficult repairs and engage in work requiring closer tolerances than those required of WG-8 workers. Further, the WG-10 position requires greater skill and knowledge than the WG-8 position, including the ability to interpret work orders, blueprints, sketches and drawings, as well as the ability to plan and lay out work including the determination of material, equipment, and parts required. Finally, the WG-8 and WG-10 positions could not be placed in the same competitive level for reduction in force purposes. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Burner v. Tennessee Valley Authority,</span> 20 MSPR 167 (1984); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 851.408. Thus, we conclude that the nature and character of the duties of these two positions are sufficiently different that an incumbent could not be interchanged between the positions without unduly interrupting the work program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the time appellant spent in his temporary appointment is not creditable for purposes of determining whether appellant completed his probationary period. Appellant was, therefore, terminated during this period and the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Davis v. MSPB</span>, 340 Fed. Appx. 660, 660-65 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP), examined the "line of work" component of 5 CFR 315.802(b)(2):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Davis was employed by the Navy at the Naval Safety Center in Norfolk, Virginia from July 24, 2006, until March 27, 2008, when she was terminated. Initially, she had a temporary appointment as a GS-6 Statistical Assistant in the Navy's Office of the Staff Executive Director, Data Management and Analysis Department, Data Analysis Support Division, but on April 1, 2007, Davis was selected to a permanent career appointment as a YD-02 Mathematical Statistician with the Marine Corps' Information Management Directorate, Statistics and Mathematics Division. She was terminated less than a year after that permanent appointment for "misuse of the government travel card." <span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span>, No. DC-315H-08-0459-I-1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Davis had not completed one year of current continuous service under her permanent appointment when she was removed, but she argued that she was not serving a probationary period and therefore qualified as an "employee." Prior service under a temporary limited appointment "counts toward completion of probation when the prior service: (1) [i]s in the same agency, e.g., Department of the Army; (2) [i]s in the same line of work (determined by the employee's actual duties and responsibilities); and (3) [c]ontains or is followed by no more than a single break in service that does not exceed 30 calendar days." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_126"></span>Without ruling on the merits of Davis's petition, the administrative judge ("AJ") ordered the parties to submit evidence and argument on whether the Board had jurisdiction over the appeal. On July 8, 2008, the AJ held a jurisdictional hearing. In an initial decision issued on July 30, 2008, the AJ dismissed Davis's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The AJ held that Davis was a probationary employee, finding that Davis's prior service as a Statistical Assistant did not count toward completion of her probation because it was not "in the same line of work" as her service as a Mathematical Statistician. The AJ reasoned that "the positions were identified by different occupational codes and paid widely divergent annual salaries of $34,317.00 and $63,417.00, respectively." The AJ also reasoned that the official descriptions of the positions were dissimilar; the Statistical Assistant would "research and maintain unit information on Department of Defense activities, manage the unit information database, and research and maintain historical operational and administrative chain of command and unit information for Navy and Marine Corps units," while the Mathematical Statistician would work on "Marine Corps statistical interpretation, providing expert advisory and analytical services regarding data collection, trends, forecasts, and research, and conducting in depth research and analyses of mishap data." Finally, the AJ heard testimony from Davis and two of her first-line supervisors, all of whom testified that, in both jobs, Davis managed unit information, as well as analyzing data and fulfilling requests. However, according to Davis and the two supervisors, as a Statistical Assistant, Davis mostly managed unit information, while as a Mathematical Statistician, Davis mostly analyzed data and fulfilled requests. The AJ therefore found that a preponderance of the evidence showed that Davis's two jobs "were not 'in the same line of work' because the actual duties and responsibilities of the two positions were for the most part significantly different." The AJ thus found Davis to have been a probationary employee at the time of her termination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with Davis that substantial evidence does not support the Board's decision that Davis's two positions were not "in the same line of work." The Board's regulation states that the "same line of work" is "determined by the employee's actual duties and responsibilities." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(b). We have explained that "the same line of work" language is akin to "similar positions." <span class="Italic">Mathis</span>, 865 F.2d at 234. Such an analysis requires a comparison of "the nature of the work [Davis] actually performed" in each job. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quotation marks omitted). Thus, for "determining completion of a probationary period, positions are in the same line of work if experience in a position demonstrates the knowledge[ ], skills, and abilities required to perform the work of the other job." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quotation marks omitted). For example, in <span class="Italic">Mathis</span>, we held that a postal service worker's jobs of special delivery messenger and distribution clerk were "similar positions" because "[t]he duties of each position involved the handling of the mail, and the skills required to perform the work were closely related." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 235. "There [was] no indication that [the petitioner] was unable to perform the duties of a distribution clerk..., or that performance of those duties required him to undergo extensive retraining." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We also held that differences in the nature of the work performed were not inconsistent with their being "similar positions" because the fundamental character of the work, handling the mail, was the same, even though the petitioner "did that handling in different physical locations and in different steps of the mail distribution process." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in this case, Davis performed the same basic duties in both of her positions: managing unit data, analyzing data, and fulfilling requests. As a Statistical Assistant, the Board found that Davis primarily managed the Unit Identification Code (managing unit data), accounting for 70 to 75% of her time. <span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span>, No. DC-315H-08-0459-I-1. The Board found that she spent most of the remainder of her time doing "data extraction" in response to data requests (analyzing data and fulfilling requests).<span class="Italic"></span> According to the Board, she also compiled a daily summary of mishap information (managing unit data).<span class="Italic"></span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a Mathematical Statistician, the Board found that Davis spent either 50% or the majority of her time fulfilling requests and analyzing data. The Board found that Davis spent the remainder of her time managing unit data, including doing web-based updates, compiling daily executive summaries, and managing various databases, including the Unit Identification Code<span class="Italic">.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, although Davis switched from spending the majority of her time managing unit data to spending the majority of her time analyzing data and fulfilling requests, she performed all three functions in each of her two positions. It is therefore clear that her position as a Mathematical Statistician did not require "extensive retraining," but instead that the two positions required the same "knowledge[ ], skills, and abilities." <span class="Italic">Mathis</span>, 865 F.2d at 234-35. It was therefore error for the Board to find that the two positions were not "in the same line of work."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also points to the widely divergent annual salaries and different job descriptions of the two positions to support its determination that they were not "in the same line of work." However, we do not find either of those points conclusive. As for the widely divergent annual salaries, salary is based on numerous factors, including whether a job is temporary or permanent, and we did not rely on salary as indicative of an employee's "line of work" in <span class="Italic">Mathis</span>. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> The job description is also not conclusive, as the Board has held that "the nature and character of the duties being performed controls over intent or job titles for determining whether two positions are in the same line of work." <span class="Italic">Aizin v. Dod</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 146, 150 (1991); <span class="Italic">see also Mathis</span>, 865 F.2d at 234.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore hold that the Board's finding that Davis's two positions were not "in the same line of work" was unsupported by substantial evidence....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Sandoval v. USDA</span>, 115 MSPR 71, 75-77 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-15, 2010 MSPB 197 (2010), periods of service as a Forestry Aid and Forestry Technician tacked. Of significance is commentary that tacking requirements will be realistically applied to reflect the realities of a probationary appointment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In analyzing this appeal, we have considered the purpose of the probationary period and the Federal Circuit's decisions in <span class="Italic">Mathis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 865 F.2d 232 (Fed. Cir. 1988), and <span class="Italic">Coradeschi v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 439 F.3d 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.803(a) encourages agencies to utilize the probationary period "to determine the fitness of the employee and shall terminate his services during this period if he fails to demonstrate fully his qualifications for continued employment." <span class="Italic">See Angell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 266, 268 (1980). In our 2005 Report, <span class="Italic">The Probationary Period: A Critical Assessment Opportunity</span>, we explained that the purpose of the probationary period "is to provide the Government with an opportunity to evaluate an individual's conduct and performance on the job to determine if an appointment to the civil service should become final." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at i. Thus, by the time the agency terminated the appellant in August 2009, it had over 15 months to evaluate his fitness for continued federal employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Mathis</span>, 865 F.2d at 234, the Federal Circuit concluded that, to satisfy the "similar positions" test under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B),[2] an employee "must occupy positions that involve related or comparable work that requires the same or similar skills." Utilizing this standard, the court reversed the initial decision and held that the special delivery messenger and distribution clerk positions were similar positions because the "duties of each position involved the handling of the mail, and the skills required to perform the work were closely related." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 235. Notably, in <span class="Italic">Mathis</span>, the court warned against a narrow interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 233.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;An individual is an "employee" under section 7511(a)(1)(B) if he is a preference eligible in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency or in the United States Postal Service or Postal Regulatory Commission. Our reviewing court explained that "'the same line of work' language [found in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(b)] is akin to [the] 'similar positions'" language found in section 7511(a)(1)(B). <span class="Italic">Davis v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 340 Fed. Appx. 660, 663 (Fed. Cir. 2009), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Mathis</span>, 865 F.2d at 234. Therefore, we may rely on cases discussing whether positions are "the same or similar" under section 7511(a)(1)(B) in our analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Coradeschi</span>, the court considered whether the appellant's Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Service (INS) agent and Federal Air Marshal (FAM) positions were the same or similar under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii).[3] In that appeal, the administrative judge determined that these positions were not similar, noting that an INS agent enforces immigration laws at his office and other establishments and a FAM deters criminal activity on aircraft; only a FAM must undergo specialized training and obtain a top security clearance; and only a FAM "must be physically capable of 'long, arduous hours of international air travel.'" <span class="Italic">Coradeschi</span>, 439 F.3d at 1331. The court, however, concluded that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that his work as an INS agent was the same or similar to his FAM work:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">From the limited evidence presented without even a hearing, it appears that both positions required Coradeschi to apprehend and subdue criminals, carry and be proficient with a firearm, and investigate criminal activity. Moreover, both positions carried an 1801 occupation code, a fact that seems important in both the TSA Bulletin in effect when Coradeschi was hired and the TSA Directive in effect when he was terminated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1334. Significantly, in <span class="Italic">Coradeschi</span>, the Federal Circuit cautioned against placing too much emphasis on job description dissimilarities, explaining instead that the focus should be on the skills and fundamental character of the positions in question. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;An individual is an employee under section 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) if he is an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible), "who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_127"></span>Consistent with the Federal Circuit's approach, which focuses on the skills and fundamental character of the relevant positions, and the purpose of the probationary period--to allow agencies an opportunity to evaluate an employee's fitness for continued employment--we conclude that the Forestry Aid and Forestry Technician positions are sufficiently similar, such that these positions are in the same line of work under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(b)(2).[4] For these reasons, the appellant may tack his service as an Aid to his service as a Technician, he has completed his one-year probationary period, and thus, he is properly considered an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(I).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Like in <span class="Italic">Coradeschi</span>, the Aid and Technician positions share the same 0462 occupational code.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of these conclusions, we also find the agency's action violated the appellant's constitutional right to minimum due process. An agency's failure to provide a tenured public employee with an opportunity to present a response, either in person or in writing, to an appealable agency action that deprives him of his property right in his employment constitutes an abridgement of his constitutional right to minimum due process of law, i.e., prior notice and an opportunity to respond<span class="Italic">. Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985). The record shows that the appellant was informed on August 14, 2009, that his termination would be effective five days later, on August 19, 2009, and he was not given an opportunity to respond to the notice. Since the agency's procedures for effecting the appellant's removal did not comport with his constitutional right to minimum due process, the agency's action must be reversed. <span class="Italic">See Gadsden v. Department of State</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 79, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17 (2006).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kaiser v. Dept. of Army</span>, 75 MSPR 440, 446-47 (1997), remanded for analysis of the similarity of two industrial hygienist positions that arguably tacked:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find two additional issues implicating jurisdiction that require further consideration. First, regarding the appellant's entitlement to credit for prior service, the administrative judge noted that the incumbent of the new GS-13 position was required to be board certified, whereas the previous GM-13 position had no such certification requirement. Further, the administrative judge noted that this distinction would result in the former GM-13 position being in a different competitive level for reduction-in-force purposes from the GS-13 position in which appellant was required to serve a new probationary period. Therefore, he concluded that the two positions were not in the "same line of work" for the purpose of determining whether prior service can be counted toward completion of the new probationary period. As authority for his rationale, the administrative judge cited to <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 32 M.S.P.R. 194, 196 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> held, however, that where two positions are dissimilar in qualifications and type of work so as to be in different competitive levels for reduction-in-force purposes, they are not in the same line of work. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Board has since held that identical competitive levels for reduction-in-force purposes is but one of many factors to be considered in analyzing the "same line of work" requirement. <span class="Italic">See Aizin,</span> 52 M.S.P.R. at 150. Thus, it was error for the administrative judge to rely on <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> and to find that the appellant had not satisfied 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(b)(2). We find, therefore, that the controlling authority for proof of jurisdiction in this case is 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(b)(2), which requires a close analysis of the "actual duties and responsibilities" of the two positions to determine whether the appellant's prior service is creditable towards his probationary period.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 60 MSPR 134, 138 (1993), placed some emphasis on personnel documents as <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> evidence of similarity of positions for the "line of work" analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant submitted evidence to show that his prior service as a Park Ranger in Washington, D.C., should have been credited toward the completion of the probationary period applicable to his next position in Philadelphia. The appellant's SF-50--both the original version submitted by the appellant and the revised version submitted by the agency--does not state whether or not the change in his job location in August 1991 was a "transfer," but it does show that the appellant's new appointment carried the same title, grade level, and occupational code as his prior appointment. On its face, then, the appellant's SF-50 constitutes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing that the appellant's prior service immediately preceded his subsequent service, was not interrupted by a break of 30 days or more, was in the same agency, and was sufficiently similar to his subsequent service to be creditable towards his probationary period. We find that the appellant has thus made a sufficient showing to warrant a hearing on the issue of the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stokes</span>, 761 F.2d at 685-86; <span class="Italic">Jones v. United States Postal Service</span>, 55 MSPR 491, 493-94 (1992); <span class="Italic">Collins v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 55 MSPR 185, 188 (1992), and cases cited therein. Accordingly, we REMAND this appeal to the Philadelphia Regional Office for a jurisdictional hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Robinson v. DHHS</span>, 3 MSPR 101, 103 (1980), discounted undetailed statements made in the course of a probationer's appeal concerning the type and length of his prior government service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Yancey v. Dept. of Army</span>, 32 MSPR 606, 609-10 (1987), analyzing a probationary termination appeal, considered "line of work" as described in the (late) FPM:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Same line of work" is a term of art, defined in the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) at Chapter 315, Appendix A-3c(3) (May 7, 1981) as meaning that the two positions are so similar they require the same qualifications, and the nature of the work would place the positions in the same competitive level for reduction-in-force purposes. Under this definition, an incumbent could be interchanged between the positions without significant training and without unduly interrupting the work program. The Board has interpreted the FPM to mean that in determining whether two positions are in the same line of work, the nature and character of the duties being performed control over questions of intent or technical title. <span class="Italic">Haning v. Marine Corps</span>, 31 MSPR 252, 254 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying these considerations to this case, we find that the two positions are not within the same line of work. Although the appellant asserts that his duties were "essentially the same" in both positions, he admits that he had "some increase in duties and responsibilities in the position of Museum Technician." The evidence submitted by the appellant shows that this increase was substantial. As an Exhibit Specialist, GS-5, the appellant's responsibilities included preparing and maintaining exhibits, conducting guided tours, accepting objects as gifts or loans subject to acceptance by the Acquisition Committee, and requisitioning supplies and equipment. In this position, the appellant remained in close contact with the Curator, performing his responsibilities according to the Curator's instructions. As a Museum Technician, however, the appellant performed his assignments independently, working under only the general supervision of the Curator. Moreover, the appellant's responsibilities included not only implementing the Curator's directions concerning preparing and maintaining exhibits, but planning, designing, and preparing the displays and exhibits. In addition, he was to serve as an advisor to the Curator, conduct research, contact sources to acquire properties for the museum, prepare publicity material, assist the Curator in educational and outreach programs, and act as Curator in the Curator's absence. Finally, the GS-5 and GS-7 positions could not be placed in the same competitive level for reduction-in-force purposes. <span class="Italic">Haning</span>, 31 MSPR at 254. Therefore, the nature and character of the duties of these two positions are different enough that an incumbent could not be interchanged between the positions without unduly interrupting the work program. Because the appellant does not meet the exceptions listed above, the appellant's service as an Exhibit Specialist may not be counted towards the completion of his probationary period as a Museum Technician.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nimmo v. DHS,</span> NY-0752-11-0326-I-1 (NP 9/14/2012) (sufficiently similar to proceed to a hearing: duties of an Immigration Enforcement Agent (IEA) position and a Transportation Security Officer (TSO) position); <span class="Italic">Martinez v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Aizin v. DOD</span>, 52 MSPR 146, 149-50 (1991), relied on in <span class="Italic">Kaiser, supra,</span> eschewed reliance on competitive levels for tacking analysis of the duties of a GS-7 probationary auditor, subsequently upgraded by what apparently was a new appointment from a register to GS-9:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FPM states that "same line of work" means that the two positions are so similar that they require the same qualifications, and the nature of the work would place the positions in the same competitive level for reduction in force purposes. FPM Chapter 315, Appendix A-3c(3). In <span class="Italic">Mathis v. USPS</span>, 865 F.2d 232 (Fed. Cir. 1988), however, the court did not rely on competitive levels in determining whether two positions were in the same line of work, but instead looked to the nature of the work being performed. Thus, the competitive level for reduction in force purposes is but one factor in determining whether two positions are in the same line of work. The Board has further held that the nature and character of the duties being performed controls over intent or job titles for determining whether two positions are in the same line of work. <span class="Italic">Raman v. DHUD</span>, 34 MSPR 428 (1987)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case the appellant asserted in an uncontroverted affidavit that he performed the same duties, for the same supervisor at the same location in both positions. Thus, the appellant has at a minimum made a nonfrivolous allegation that he served more than one year in the same or similar positions, and a jurisdictional hearing is warranted<span class="Italic">. Stokes v. FAA</span>, 761 F.2d 682, 685-86 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But a RIF competitive level entered the "line of work" analysis in <span class="Italic">Spych v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 833 F.2d 1022, 1022 (Fed. Cir. NP 1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board correctly determined that it lacks jurisdiction over petitioner's appeal from his removal from the position of aviation safety inspector, GS-12, in Allentown, Pennsylvania, because he had not completed a one-year probationary period before being terminated for unsatisfactory conduct. Persons such as petitioner who hold a competitive career-conditional position are on probationary status for the first year of their service. 5 C.F.R. Sec. 315.801. Appeals from agency action by those <span id="Page_128"></span>persons are permitted in the limited circumstances that the agency action is alleged to be based on partisan political reasons or marital status. 5 C.F.R. Sec. 315.806.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, the board considered petitioner's claim that his prior federal service in a lower-level position was in the 'same line of work' and therefore should be credited toward the one-year probationary period for the position from which he was terminated. We agree with the board's conclusion that petitioner's prior position could not be counted toward fulfillment of the probationary period. Prior service does not count toward satisfaction of the probationary period unless the prior service was (1) for the same agency, (2) in the 'same line of work,' and (3) rendered immediately preceding the appointment at issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), Chapter 315, Appendix A-3(c). The 'same line of work' requirement has not been met in petitioner's case. The two positions do not qualify as 'so similar [that] they require the same qualifications and, insofar as the nature of the work is concerned, would be in the same competitive level for reduction in force purposes.' FPM, Ch. 315, Appendix A-3(c)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner unsuccessfully asserts that his prior position, because it was service under the Veterans Readjustment Act, is not subject to a 'same line of work' requirement.
