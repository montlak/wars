<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-150"><span class="space">d.</span> Refiling Date</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An AJ sets a refiling date for a DWOP, "in the interest of efficiency and repose" that is reasonable and that is communicated to the appellant. <span class="Italic">Wear v. MSPB</span>, 129 Fed. Appx. 625, 627 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP). The refiling deadline must be met, as with other appeals, or the appeal will be dismissed as untimely without a showing of good cause for the filing delay. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Swinarski v. Dept. of Army</span>, 54 MSPR 513, 516 (1992) ("We find that these unrebutted sworn statements are specific and credible concerning the steps the appellant took to mail his appeal letter and are thus sufficient to overcome any presumption created by the postmark on the envelope in the record."). The exception is the DWOP that includes in the initial decision dismissing the appeal a provision that the appeal will be automatically refiled on a stated date. Without an automatic refiling date, it is the appellant's burden to monitor the calendar and refile the appeal before the last date allowed for refiling. After the appeal is refiled, the AJ will likely issue an acknowledgment order. The parties should monitor the e-filing repository to ensure that automatic redocketing occurs. If, after a suitable interval, the e-filing repository does not show a refiling (and the appeal refiling may be under a docket number that would end with the next number following the original docket number, e.g., the original number is DC-0752-19-0000-I-1, and the refiled appeal appears as DC-0752-19-0000-I-2), give the AJ a call and see whether there is a problem.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The DWOP should not be open-ended, that is, without a definite refiling deadline, <span class="Italic">Davis v. USPS</span>, 91 MSPR 75, 77-78 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (2002):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dismissal of a case without prejudice to refiling is a procedural option that is left to the sound discretion of the administrative judge, but this discretion must be exercised in a manner consistent with the policies set forth by the Board<span class="Italic">. Milner v. Department of Justice,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 660 &#x00B6; 13 (2001). Given the Congressional mandate that Board cases be expeditiously adjudicated, the Board has held that a case may not go on indefinitely. <span class="Italic">Ayers v. National Aeronautics &#x0026; Space Administration</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 550 &#x00B6; 7 (1999). Thus, an administrative judge may establish reasonable interim deadlines for refiling an appeal that has been dismissed without prejudice. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. 204, 208 (1995). We find here that, although the administrative judge properly dismissed this appeal without prejudice, she should have set a date certain by which the appellant must refile his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the parties in this case originally sought a dismissal without prejudice, the basis for the request was that the appellant "is seeking disability retirement." They did not, however, allege or submit evidence showing that the appellant had actually applied for disability retirement. Thus, it was improper to set a refiling date that was solely contingent on the existence of a final reconsideration decision by OPM that might never be issued. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Whitfield v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 651 &#x00B6; 6 (1998) (finding it "unfortunate[&#8197;] " that the administrative judge did not establish an alternative refiling date to account for the possibility that the appellant might decide not to file a disability retirement application); <span class="Italic">Ballard v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 598, 601 (1997) (a dismissal without prejudice was an abuse of discretion where there was no evidence that the basis for the dismissal, a state licensing board proceeding, had occurred or would ever occur). Dismissals without prejudice should avoid open-ended periods for resolving appeals, and should instead set a date certain by which the appellant must refile an appeal. <span class="Italic">Bowens v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. 390, 393 (1993). Further, we agree with the agency's contention that the events that have occurred after the initial decision was issued (the appellant has filed an incomplete disability retirement application with the agency and has not responded to the agency's request to submit the required medical documentation) still leave the agency with the possibility of having an appeal that is open forever. Our finding in this regard, however, is limited to the particular facts of this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When the AJ fails to set a date certain for refiling an appeal, the Board modifies the initial decision, on PFR, by setting a date certain. <span class="Italic">See Cowart v. USPS,</span> SF-0752-12-0112-I-1 (NP 7/6/2012) (AJ clocked the refiling date from the conclusion of another appeal, leaving the refiling date uncertain; relying on <span class="Italic">Mojarro v. USPS,</span> 115 MSPR 433, 436-37 &#x00B6; 8, 2010 MSPB 225 (2010)).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge has wide discretion to dismiss an appeal without prejudice in the interests of fairness, due process, and administrative efficiency, and the administrative judge may order such a dismissal at the request of one or both parties, or to avoid a lengthy or indefinite continuance. <span class="Italic">See Gingery v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 134, &#x00B6; 9 (2009). The administrative judge, however, must exercise her discretion in a manner consistent with Board policy, including the Board's policy that cases be adjudicated expeditiously. <span class="Italic">See Schulte v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 141, &#x00B6; 5 (2005). Therefore, when an administrative judge dismisses a case without prejudice, she must set a date certain for refiling, rather than leaving the refiling date open or ambiguous. <span class="Italic">See Dey v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 167, &#x00B6; 8 (2007); <span class="Italic">see also Selig v. Department of the Army</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 7 (2006) (the refiling date should not be set as the date the appellant's application for benefits with a third-party agency is denied at some unidentified point in the future).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another DWOP led to a reopening of an appeal when the AJ conditioned the refiling on OPM's action on a disability retirement application that the appellant ultimately did not pursue, <span class="Italic">Mojarro v. USPS</span>, 115 MSPR 433, 435-37 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9, 2010 MSPB 225 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge has wide discretion to control the proceedings before him and the dismissal of an appeal without prejudice to refiling is a procedural option committed to his sound discretion. <span class="Italic">Argabright v.

The Board disfavors dismissals without prejudice that do not contain a specific refiling date, especially where it is unclear when the matter underlying the dismissal will be resolved. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 8. Given the Congressional mandate that Board cases be expeditiously adjudicated, a case may not go on indefinitely. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge did not set a date certain for refiling the appeal, but, rather, made the refiling date solely contingent on a final decision from the Board that would affirm an OPM decision to deny the appellant disability retirement benefits. Thus, the administrative judge abused his discretion by dismissing this appeal without prejudice without setting a date certain for refiling the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Argabright</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 152, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Selig</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7; <span class="Italic">see</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Whitfield v. <span id="Page_1107"></span>Department of the Air Force</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 651, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-7 (1998) (finding that the administrative judge, who dismissed the appellant's removal appeal without prejudice to refiling pending the outcome of her application for disability retirement, could have established an alternative refiling date in the event that the appellant did not file an application or OPM did not issue a reconsideration decision within a reasonable time).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an administrative judge has abused his discretion by failing to set a date certain for refiling an appeal, the Board has modified the initial decision by setting a date certain for an appellant to refile his appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g, Selig</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 8 (modifying the initial decision to allow the appellant to refile his appeal within 120 days of the date of the Opinion and Order or within 30 days of the date of issuance of the final decisions regarding his application for benefits, whichever date occurs earlier). We find, however, that setting a date certain for refiling is not necessary in this case. The appellant asserted on review that he will not file an application for disability retirement with OPM in light of his physician's refusal to provide him with a medical certificate to support a disability retirement application, and, therefore, he requests "reinstatement" of his alleged involuntary retirement appeal. Because the dismissal of this appeal without prejudice was premised on the appellant's ability to pursue disability retirement, and the appellant has asserted that the absence of supporting medical certification precludes him from any likelihood of succeeding in his application, it would be futile for the appellant to pursue a disability retirement application with OPM and, subsequently, with the Board if OPM denies his application for a disability retirement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Whitfield</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 651, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-7 (the appellant timely refiled her removal appeal that was dismissed without prejudice pending the outcome of her application for disability retirement when the appellant, who never actually filed an application for disability retirement, refiled her appeal one year later).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, because the appellant has indicated that he cannot pursue his application for a FERS disability retirement, we find that the appellant's August 4, 2010 request to reinstate his appeal constitutes a timely refiled appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board remanded an appeal over an agency objection to an open-ended DWOP issued without allowing the agency time to respond, coupled with a failure of the appellant to properly support the DWOP request with medical evidence or detailed explanation of its necessity, <span class="Italic">Argabright v.

Department of the Army</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 6 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant failed not only to substantiate the existence of his medical condition, he failed even to identify or describe the condition. He did not explain why the condition rendered him unable to proceed with his appeals, and he did not indicate how long the condition might be expected to persist. Moreover, it does not appear that the agency had an adequate opportunity to respond to the appellant's motion before the administrative judge ruled on it. <span class="Italic">[S]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">ee Paine v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 135, 137 (1987) (before dismissing the appeal without prejudice due to the appellant's alleged medical condition, the administrative judge should have required the appellant to submit a supporting affidavit and given the agency an opportunity to respond). The agency has now challenged the appellant's contention that his alleged medical condition renders him unable to proceed with the appeals at this time. Under the circumstances, we find it appropriate to remand for further development of the record regarding the basis for a dismissal without prejudice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the administrative judge abused his discretion in dismissing the appeals without prejudice without setting a refiling date. The Board disfavors dismissals without prejudice that do not contain a specific refiling date, especially where it is unclear when the matter underlying the dismissal will be resolved. <span class="Italic">See Selig</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7; <span class="Italic">Schulte v.

<p class="Body-Text">The need for some certainty in the adjudication process, through a definite, not an open-ended refiling date, was noted in the appeal of an indefinite suspension based on a security clearance suspension. The Board required that a specific refiling date be set, although it did not suggest what it would do if the clearance was not adjudicated by the time of the refiling, <span class="Italic">Schulte v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 100 MSPR 141, 143-44 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-6 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appealed the agency's decision to suspend him indefinitely based on the revocation of his security clearance. That appeal was dismissed without prejudice to refiling because the agency had not made a final decision on the appellant's appeal to the agency of the revocation of his security clearance. <span class="Italic">Schulte v</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force</span>, MSPB Docket No. DE-0752-03-0403-I-1 (Aug. 28, 2003). Pursuant to that decision, the appellant refiled his appeal on August 12, 2004.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 8, 2004, the appellant requested that the appeal be delayed again because the agency still had not rendered a final decision on his appeal of the revocation of his security clearance. The agency did not object. Thus, the administrative judge (AJ) issued a decision dismissing the appeal without prejudice to refiling no later than 30 days from the date the appellant receives notification of the final decision on his security clearance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has filed correspondence which the Board has docketed as a petition for review (PFR) of the initial decision. However, the appellant's submission does not challenge the initial decision dismissing the appeal without prejudice; instead, it implies that he would like to change his mind about requesting the dismissal of his appeal without prejudice. In this connection, the appellant expresses frustration and anger with the agency's delay in reaching a final decision on the appeal of the revocation of his security clearance, and he states that he is without healthcare or salary while waiting for the agency's decision. The agency has filed a response simply stating that the agency is still investigating the security clearance matter and that the Board will be informed when a final decision is made on the appellant's appeal of the revocation of his security clearance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dismissal of a case without prejudice to refiling is a procedural option that is left to the sound discretion of the AJ, but this discretion must be exercised in a manner consistent with the policies set forth by the Board. <span class="Italic">Davis v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 75 &#x00B6; 6 (2002).

National Aeronautics &#x0026; Space Administration</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 550 &#x00B6; 7 (1999). Thus, an AJ may <span id="Page_1108"></span>establish reasonable interim deadlines for refiling an appeal that has been dismissed without prejudice. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We find here that, although the AJ properly dismissed this appeal without prejudice, she should have set a date certain by which the appellant must refile his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This Board appeal was previously dismissed without prejudice on August 28, 2003, subject to refiling no later than August 28, 2004. The appellant timely refiled his appeal on August 12, 2004. As of the time the agency filed its December 3, 2004 response to the appellant's PFR, the agency had not yet issued a decision on this matter. Moreover, the agency has provided no indication of when it expects the decision to be issued. Thus, the appellant is left with the possibility of an appeal that is open indefinitely. We find that it was improper to set a refiling date that was solely contingent upon the agency's issuing a final decision on the appellant's appeal of the revocation of his security clearance. <span class="Italic">See Davis</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 75 &#x00B6; 7 (it was improper for an AJ to set a refiling date that was solely contingent on the existence of a final reconsideration decision by the Office of Personnel Management that might never be issued, as it left the agency with the possibility of an appeal that was open forever); <span class="Italic">Whitfield v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 651 &#x00B6; 6 (1998) (finding it "unfortunate [&#8197;] " that the AJ did not establish an alternative refiling date to account for the possibility that the appellant might decide not to file a disability retirement application); <span class="Italic">Ballard v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 598, 601 (1997) (a dismissal without prejudice was an abuse of discretion where there was no evidence that the basis for the dismissal, a state licensing board proceeding, had occurred or would ever occur). Dismissals without prejudice should avoid open-ended periods for resolving appeals and should, instead, set a date certain by which the appellant must refile the appeal. <span class="Italic">Bowens v.</span> <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 390, 393 (1993).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As a practical matter, if a case is refiled after a DWOP and the underlying condition generating the need for a DWOP is not met, the appellant may file another DWOP motion. No regulation limits the number of times the DWOP can be employed during the course of an appeal and no regulation limits the duration of a DWOP (a case can ordinarily be refiled before the DWOP refiling deadline). That does not mean that an AJ will grant serial DWOPs, but they may be requested.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appeal is dismissed without prejudice pending the outcome of a retirement application, the dismissal should have a firm cutoff date, although it can also be tied to action taken on that application, <span class="Italic">Selig v. Dept. of Army</span>, 102 MSPR 189, 192-93 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8, 2006 MSPB 159 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dismissal of a case without prejudice to refiling is a procedural option that is left to the sound discretion of the administrative judge; however, this discretion must be exercised in a manner consistent with the policies set forth by the Board. <span class="Italic">E.g., Schulte v.

Consequently, an administrative judge may establish reasonable interim deadlines for refiling an appeal that has been dismissed without prejudice. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We find here that, although the administrative judge properly dismissed this appeal "[p]ursuant to the terms of the parties' settlement agreement," he should have set a date certain by which the appellant must refile the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the parties in this case sought a dismissal without prejudice through the settlement agreement, the request was made for the purpose of allowing the appellant to "pursue[&#8197;] a disability retirement application, a discontinued service retirement, [PPP] registration and a Worker[s'] Compensation application." The parties did not, however, allege or submit evidence showing that the appellant had actually submitted any of those applications. Indeed, the express terms of the settlement agreement, by which the agency "agree[d] to set up a telephone conference for the appellant with a personnelist [who would] discuss the process for filing [for] a disability retirement, a Discontinued Service Retirement and any other appropriate type of retirement that the Appellant may qualify for," strongly suggest that the appellant had not yet applied for any of those options. It was improper to allow the refiling date to be solely contingent on the unsuccessful results of the appellant's various applications. <span class="Italic">See Whitfield v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 651, &#x00B6; 6 (1998) (finding it "unfortunate[&#8197;] " that the administrative judge did not establish an alternative refiling date to account for the possibility that the appellant might decide not to file a disability retirement application); <span class="Italic">Ballard v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the initial decision AS MODIFIED by dismissing this appeal without prejudice to refiling by the appellant within 120 days of the date of this Opinion and Order, or within 30 days of the date of issuance of final decisions denying the appellant's applications for benefits as set forth in the settlement agreement, whichever date occurs earlier. <span class="Italic">See Medina v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 194, 197 (finding no error in the administrative judge's action setting deadlines for refiling within 6 months of the initial decision or upon resolution of a criminal case), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 53 F.3d 348 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">See</span> <span class="italic">Cross v. OPM</span>, NY-844E-16-0220-I-1 (NP 5/10/2022) (disability retirement appeal: "In this case, the administrative judge did not set a date certain for refiling the appeal but instead referred to an uncertain date when the appellant would be able to obtain representation, despite the fact that she had been unable to obtain representation for more than 3 years, or when she would be medically fit. Under these circumstances, we find that the administrative judge erred in dismissing the appeal without prejudice without setting a date certain for refiling the appeal. <span class="italic">Mojarro v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 433, &#x00B6; 7 (2010). When an administrative judge has erred by failing to set a date certain for refiling an appeal, the Board has modified the initial decision by setting a date certain for the refiling. <span class="italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="italic">Selig v. Department of the Army</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 8 (2006).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ should not set a refiling date earlier than 35 days following dismissal without prejudice (the time allowed for an unchallenged initial decision to become final), particularly when one party did not consent to the dismissal, to preserve that party's right to secure Board review of the DWOP through a PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hammond v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 263, 264-65 (1996).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the specified date for refiling falls on a weekend or federal holiday, the refiling date is the next workday. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Diarra v. USPS</span>, 81 MSPR 630, 632 &#x00B6; 4 (1999) (applying 5 CFR 1201.23 to refiling after DWOP: if the filing deadline falls on a Saturday or Sunday, a filing on the next business day is timely).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A refiling deadline should be clearly set to avoid the problem noted in <span class="Italic">Auciella v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 1992 NP No. 92-3348), involving confusion over whether the refiling period was triggered by the issuance date or the finality date of an initial decision entering a DWOP:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the administrative judge's initial decision dated April 5, 1991, the last sentence reads as follows: "the appellant is required to refile her appeal no later than six months from the date of this decision." The next full paragraph on that page begins: "This initial decision will become final on MAY 10, 1991," with the date displayed in block letters larger than the other text. This language would be confusing to a layperson, because it appears that the last date to refile an appeal is six months after May 10, 1991.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge and the Board should have considered the issue of the ambiguous language. The government brief also does not address this issue. We therefore remand to the Board so that it may clarify its position as to whether Ms. Auciella's November 5, 1991, appeal was timely refiled in light of this language.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3050) (directing the Board to adjudicate an appeal dismissed without prejudice, refiled, and dismissed as untimely, when the dismissal notice was unclear whether the refiling period ran from the date of the OPM initial decision or reconsideration decision involving a disability benefits application).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant may state in his motion the conditions or date that will trigger his obligation to file, e.g., he may request that the AJ DWOP the case with leave to refile any time from 60-120 days after the initial decision issues. If the Board determines, on an agency PFR, that the DWOP period granted by the AJ was not appropriate because it was open-ended, the Board may set a finite period for refiling that will accomplish the object of the motion. <span class="Italic">Bowens v. OPM</span>, 59 MSPR 390, 393 (1993) (dismissing to permit the appellant time to obtain medical evidence supporting her disability retirement appeal). If the deadline for refiling is stated in terms of the date of another agency's "final" decision, the AJ (or the parties) must consider the nature of the decisionmaking processes of the second agency, e.g., the possibility that a decision of the agency will not be final because that agency remands the case for rehearing or reconsideration by its factfinder. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stringer-Earnest v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 57 MSPR 533, 536 n.3 (1993) (time for refiling is to run from the final decision of the OWCP); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Acree v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 74 MSPR 119, 125-26 (1997) (implying that the AJ should not condition a refiling on events that are not readily ascertainable by the appellant, e.g., a decision by a federal prosecutor on whether or not to seek prosecution when there is no assurance that the decision will be timely communicated to the appellant; lacking explicit direction in the dismissal notice, the appellant had no duty to periodically inquire about the status of his appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Woods v. USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 216, 218 (1994), the refiling was to occur within 30 days after the appellant's receipt of a final OWCP decision. The Board then had to determine what constituted a final OWCP decision. <span class="Italic">Woods</span> concluded that the final decision constituted a decision from the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board rather than a decision from a regional office of the OWCP. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. VA</span>, 45 MSPR 206, 210 (1990), advised that if appeals are going to be continued for lengthy periods, AJs should "instead of or in addition to scheduling a date for refiling, impose a reporting schedule." The dismissal should not be completely open-ended. The AJ sets a time limit for refiling depending on the circumstances of the case, for a case "cannot go on indefinitely given the Congressional mandate that cases be expeditiously adjudicated." <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 69 MSPR 40, 44 (1995); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hoehing v. USPS</span>, 83 MSPR 314, 317 &#x00B6; 8 (1999) (as to litigation over a DWOP involving an appellant whose illness left her unable to assist her attorney, the Board offered the caveat: "[w]e caution, however, that with or without the appellant's assistance her appeal must be expeditiously adjudicated.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the AJ misinterprets a motion to dismiss an appeal without prejudice and enters a refiling date that does not meet an appellant's expectations, the appellant should clarify and make her position known to the AJ concerning the refiling date. Neither the Board nor the reviewing court will likely excuse a belated refiling if the dismissal order contains an unequivocal filing date. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Swezey v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1992 NP No. 92-3384) (court did not consider that the AJ would not have jurisdiction to correct the situation if the case was dismissed; the problem would need to be addressed through a PFR or on timely refiling of the appeal).</p>
