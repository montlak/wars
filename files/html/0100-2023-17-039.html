<h4 class="h4" id="sec10-40"><span class="space">8.</span> Transfer of Function</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The transfer of function may involve relocating an activity from one agency to another or from one unit to another in the same agency. 5 USC 3503 provides the broad definition of a transfer of function:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Transfer of functions</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;When a function is transferred from one agency to another, each competing employee in the function shall be transferred to the receiving agency for employment in a position for which he is qualified before the receiving agency may make an appointment from another source to that position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;When one agency is replaced by another, each competing employee in the agency to be replaced shall be transferred to the replacing agency for employment in a position for which he is qualified before the replacing agency may make an appointment from another source to that position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM regulations implement the statute. A transfer of function is defined at 5 CFR 351.203 (2022) to mean:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he transfer of the performance of a continuing function from one competitive area and its addition to one or more other competitive areas, except when the function involved is virtually identical to functions already being performed in the other competitive area(s) affected; or the movement of the competitive area in which the function is performed to another commuting area.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Subsection (a) of Section 3503 requires that the receiving agency make the appointment of a qualified individual before the receiving agency appoints a person not from the transferring agency to the position. An implementing regulation, 5 CFR 351.302(a) (2022), provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before a reduction in force is made in connection with the transfer of any or all of the functions of a competitive area to another continuing competitive area, each competing employee in a position identified with the transferring function or functions shall be transferred to the continuing competitive area without any change in the tenure of his or her employment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Biter v. ICC</span>, 76 MSPR 82, 88-89, 94 (1997) (reviewing OPM regulations governing the identification of employees with transfer rights; noting that employees are identified for transfer based on their duties, not their duty stations).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There is no right to an appeal from a transfer of function <span class="Italic">per se</span>; only an adverse action or RIF resulting from the transfer is appealable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Biter v. ICC</span>, 76 MSPR 82, 88 (1997) (transfer of function was not appealable, but the Board may review the transfer process if it directly results in an appealable RIF action). Because a transfer of function is one of several permissible reasons for a RIF, an appellant's separation may still be proper as a RIF even if the agency improperly characterizes the transaction as a transfer of function. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hasler v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 48 MSPR 207, 213 (1991) (remanding for assessment of the appellant's assignment rights); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Qatsha v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 73 MSPR 561, 563 (1997) (no jurisdiction over a transfer of function, <span class="Italic">per se</span>; only an adverse action or RIF action resulting from a transfer is appealable).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mullen v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 76 MSPR 590, 596 (1997), explained appeal rights arising from a transfer of function:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A "function" is "all or a clearly identifiable segment of an agency's mission (including all integral parts of that mission), regardless of how it is performed." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.203. A "transfer of function," in relevant part, is "the transfer of the performance of a continuing function from one competitive area and its addition to one or more other competitive areas, except when the function involved is virtually identical to functions already being performed in the other competitive area(s) affected." <span class="Italic">Id.; see, e.g., Blevins v. Tennessee Valley Authority,</span> 46 MSPR 239, 242-43 (1990). A TOF <span class="Italic">per se</span> is not appealable, but whether the agency afforded an employee his transfer rights is within the scope of a RIF appeal. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. National Transportation Safety Board,</span> 18 MSPR 626, 628 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the Board has jurisdiction over an appeal submitted by an employee adversely affected by a transfer of function, it has jurisdiction to examine the transfer of function process applied to the employee. <span class="Italic">Jackson v.

USDA</span>, 26 MSPR 605, 606-07 (1985), summarized the decisions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official's finding on remand that no transfer of function occurred when the agency transferred the supervision function for the states of Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina from the Savannah (Georgia) Sub-office to the Mobile (Alabama) Field Office is correct. As the presiding official reasoned, the supervision function was at all times performed either in Mobile or in both Savannah and Mobile. When Savannah relinquished responsibility for supervision of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, and Mobile resumed full responsibility for those states in addition to the ones already covered, no transfer of function occurred because Mobile had performed the Supervision function in some form all along. The function in question is supervision for a specified geographic area. The Board has held that, where an agency realigns geographic boundaries so that an installation already performing a particular function begins to handle that function for a wider area, no transfer of function occurs. The receiving installation merely assumes responsibility for another part of a single function. <span class="Italic">See Childress v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States,</span> 650 F.2d 285, 222 Ct. Cl. 557, 558 (1980). <span class="Italic">See also Neilson v.</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Highway Administration,</span> 21 MSPR 178 (1984); <span class="Italic">Kentner v. National Transportation Safety Board,</span> 20 MSPR 595 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Broadening of an activity's scope of authority is not a transfer of function. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hasler v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 48 MSPR 207 (1991). There is no transfer of function if the new office already has the function but picks up the appellant's duties. <span class="Italic">Walsh v.

A transfer of function does not occur only because an agency decides that the duties of one position could be more efficiently performed as part of another position. <span class="Italic">Blevins v.

<p class="Body-Text">As to the movement of an activity within an agency, the concept of transfer of function was described by <span class="Italic">McLean v. Dept. of Army</span>, 55 MSPR 414, 417-18 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 CFR 351.301, a TOF occurs when the work of one or more employees is moved from one competitive area to another. A competitive area may consist of all or part of an agency. The minimum competitive area in the departmental service is a bureau, major command, directorate or other equivalent major subdivision of an agency within the local commuting area. In the field, the minimum competitive area is an activity under separate administration within the local commuting area. A competitive area must be defined solely in terms of an agency's organizational units and geographical location, and it must include all employees within its limits. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 351.402(b). In this case, the administrative judge determined that the transfer of the career development function within Fort Lee was a TOF. She did not, however, specifically find that the career development function was moved from one competitive area to another.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of the record reveals no basis to conclude that the career development function was transferred from one competitive area to another....&#8197;[A]t the time that the career development function was moved, both DIT and DET were located at Fort Lee, were directorates within the Army Logistics Management College, and were within the Army Material Command. Thus, the administrative judge erred in finding that the 1990 transfer of the career development function from DIT to DET was a TOF. Further, because that transfer was not a TOF, the agency was not obligated to follow TOF procedures, and thus the appellant has shown no harmful error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A transfer of function need not entail a geographical relocation. <span class="Italic">Lee v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 6 MSPR 669, 670, 6 MSPB 561 (1981) ("[t]here is no requirement that a function physically move, and it is proper for an agency to have more than one competitive area within one geographical area.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency has the discretion to plan both a RIF and a transfer of function and to implement the RIF first. <span class="Italic">Kurtz v. DHHS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-998); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Holcomb v. United States</span>, 146 F. Supp. 224 (Ct. Cl. 1956) (RIF preceding a transfer of function was permissible). However, an agency need not conduct a RIF before transferring a function to another agency, even though the RIF might better protect employees' assignment rights, <span class="Italic">Cross v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 127 F.3d 1443, 1448 (Fed. Cir. 1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...According to Petitioners, when a RIF is conducted in conjunction with a transfer of function, the RIF should be conducted first, followed by the transfer. Otherwise, petitioners argue, civil service employees who would have superior retention rights during a RIF are given less favorable treatment than employees holding positions covered by the transferred functions, thus contravening the principles behind the merit system.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree. Of course, once a RIF is initiated, it must be conducted pursuant to the procedures outlined in the statutes and regulations. Such procedures are intended to protect the civil service retention rights or preferences of competing employees. On the other hand, an employee occupying a position that is not being transferred to another agency does not have the right to "bump" an employee who is being transferred. Contrary to Petitioners' contentions, the regulations provide that when a RIF is conducted in conjunction with a transfer of function, the transfer of function should occur first, followed by the RIF. The pertinent regulation states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Before a reduction in force is made in connection with the transfer of any or all of the functions of a competitive area to another continuing competitive area, each competing employee in a position identified with the transferring function or functions shall be transferred to the continuing competitive area without any change in the tenure of his or her employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3050"></span>5 CFR 351.302(a) (1997). Therefore, once the agency determined that it would conduct a RIF at the time of the agency's demise, a determination that was within the agency's broad discretion, <span class="Italic">see Gandola</span>, 773 F.2d at 313, it was compelled by the regulation to transfer those employees whose positions were being transferred before conducting the RIF.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit discussed the structure of transfers of function between federal agencies in <span class="Italic">Certain Former CSA Employees v. DHHS</span>, 762 F.2d 978 (Fed. Cir. 1985). After determining that transfer rights were not extended to some employees by the receiving agency, the court decided that the Board correctly ordered individual assessment of transfer rights rather than ordering cancelation of the separations and awards of back pay for all employees who were separated without full compliance with transfer of function regulations. <span class="Italic">CSA Employees</span> rejected the argument that failure to follow regulations automatically invalidated the separations of the employees, affirming instead the Board's approach of ordering remedial action only if the violation of regulations actually resulted in loss of substantive job rights in the transferee agency.

We can discern no basis for finding that the appellant should be required, at the hearing or in his petition for review, to rebut arguments and evidence that neither the agency not competing employees ever advanced, either expressly or by implication.").</p>
