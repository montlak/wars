<h3 class="h3" id="sec9-40"><span class="space">A.</span> ADVERSE ACTION, PERFORMANCE CASES</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Military Dist. of Washington and Fed. Employees and Transp. Workers</span>, 35 FLRA 1272, 1275 (1990), explained the impact of the statutory scheme on review of adverse action (e.g., removal) cases:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[R]eview of awards relating to matters described in section 7121(f) of the Statute is excluded under section 7122(a). The matters described in section 7121(f) include adverse actions covered under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, subchapter II. To be an adverse action covered under chapter 75, subchapter II, the action must be covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 and must have been taken against an employee as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; USC 7511. Review of arbitration awards relating to such matters, like review of decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board, may be obtained by filing an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703. Additionally, review of determinations of procedural arbitrability by arbitrators in grievances relating to adverse actions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 may also be sought by appeal to the Federal Circuit....</p>
<p class="noindent">The exclusionary rule was applied to performance-based removals under 5 USC 4302-03 in <span class="Italic">EPA Narragansett and NAGE Local R1-240</span>, 59 FLRA 591, 592 (2004), involving a challenge to a performance-based removal that led to the grievant's retirement (retirement was collateral issue that did not affect FLRA's jurisdiction to consider exceptions):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute, we lack jurisdiction to review an arbitration award "relating to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f)" of the Statute. The matters described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) are those matters covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 and 7512 and similar matters that arise under other personnel systems. Matters covered under &#x00A7; 4303 are removals and demotions for unacceptable performance<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Dev. Test Ctr., Elgin Air Force Base, Fla., </span>44 FLRA 763, 764 (1992). Arbitration awards relating to these matters are reviewable by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, rather than by the Authority<span class="Italic">. See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We will find that an award relates to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) when the award resolves a grievance over a matter that is covered under &#x00A7; 4303 or is inextricably intertwined with a matter covered under &#x00A7; 4303<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Air Force, Hill Air Force Base, Utah, </span>58 FLRA 476, 477 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting). In making this determination, we look to whether the claim advanced in arbitration is one covered under &#x00A7; 4303<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., United States Dep't of Agriculture, Forest Service, N. Region, Idaho Panhandle Nat'l Forests, </span>49 FLRA 1582, 1587-88 (1994). Applying this precedent, we conclude that the award relates to the grievant's removal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Clearly, the claim advanced in arbitration relates to the grievant's removal. The Union specifically asserted to the Arbitrator that it was disputing the Agency's decision to remove the grievant, which it claimed was a final action, and that it grieved nothing related to the grievant's retirement. In addition, the Arbitrator's award specifically relates to the grievant's removal. In agreement with the Union, the Arbitrator ruled that the case involves the Agency's removal of the grievant, which he found was a final action. Although the Arbitrator acknowledged that the grievant's intervening retirement may present problematic remedial issues, he ruled that the retirement did not render nonarbitrable the grievance that protests his removal.</p>
<p class="noindent">If an arbitration concerns an action under 5 USC 4303 (reductions in grade, removals for unacceptable performance), or 5 USC 7512 (suspension of more than 14 days, demotions, or removals by adverse action procedures), 5 USC 7122(a) precludes the FLRA from receiving exceptions to the award.

The Arbitrator also summarized the dispute as "involv[ing] the...termination of [the grievant]."

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 2455,</span> 67 FLRA 42, 42-44 (2012), determined that FLRA lacked jurisdiction to review an arbitration award concerning the termination of the grievant, who was terminated during the trial period for a border patrol agency under the Federal Career Intern Program. Because the grievant had sufficient service as a preference eligible employee, he had the right to appeal the termination to the MSPB; given that status, FLRA was statutorily barred from reviewing agency exceptions to the arbitrator's award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency hired the grievant, a preference-eligible veteran, as a Border Patrol Agent intern under the Federal Career Intern Program (FCIP). Under the FCIP, the grievant was subject to a two-year "trial period."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A little more than a year into his internship, the grievant was injured while on duty--during a foot pursuit in a field. The Agency placed the grievant in "an injury, non-work status." Subsequently, a few months before the end of the grievant's two-year trial period, the Agency terminated his employment. The Agency stated that "due to the injury...[the grievant] would be unable to successfully complete the Agency's [required]...training during the remaining term of his trial period." However, the Agency almost immediately rescinded the termination because it had failed to notify the grievant of his appeal rights as a "preference[&#8197;]eligible" veteran with over a year of "current, continuous service" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The rescission of the grievant's termination was brief. Shortly after the Agency rescinded the termination, the Agency presented the grievant with a letter "remov[ing] [him] from [his] position" for "[f]ailure to [s]uccessfully [c]omplete [his] [t]rial [p]eriod." The letter advised the grievant of his "remov[al]," as well as his right to appeal the action to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a grievance challenging the grievant's removal. When the parties could not resolve the grievance, they submitted it to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a threshold matter, the Agency contested the grievance's arbitrability, claiming that the grievant was not an "employee" under the parties' agreement. In a bifurcated proceeding, the Arbitrator found the grievance arbitrable, concluding that the grievant was an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B), "with rights to appeal adverse actions to the MSPB" and to pursue arbitration under the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the subsequent award on the merits, the Arbitrator found that the Agency failed to establish that it removed the grievant for just and sufficient cause and for reasons "as will promote the efficiency of the Service." As a remedy, the Arbitrator ordered the Agency to reinstate the grievant to a permanent appointment as a Border Patrol Agent, and to pay him backpay for lost compensation and benefits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that, under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7122(a) and 7121(f) of the Statute, the Authority lacks jurisdiction to consider the Agency's exceptions because the grievant is a preference eligible, excepted-service employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) with appeal rights to the MSPB. On the merits, the Union asserts that the award is not contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusions: The Authority lacks jurisdiction to resolve the Agency's exceptions.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7122 of the Statute, the Authority lacks jurisdiction to review exceptions to an arbitration award "relating to a matter described in [&#x00A7;] 7121(f)" of the Statute. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a). The matters described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) include adverse actions, such as removals, which are covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 or 7512 and are appealable to the MSPB and reviewable by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit), rather than the Authority. <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Fed. BOP, Fed. Det. Ctr., Miami, Fla.</span>, 57 FLRA 677, 678 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority will determine that an award relates to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) when the award resolves, or is "inextricably intertwined" with, a &#x00A7; 4303 or &#x00A7; 7512 matter. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1013,</span> 60 FLRA 712, 713 (2005). In making that determination, the Authority looks not to the outcome of the award, but to whether the claim involved in arbitration is one that would be reviewed by the MSPB and, on appeal, by the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">Id.; U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Serv., </span>57 FLRA 805, 806 (2002).<span class="Italic"> </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award here relates to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) because it resolves a &#x00A7; 7512 matter. To relate to a &#x00A7; 7512 matter, the individual involved must be an "employee" as defined in &#x00A7; 7511<span class="Italic">. See U.S. Dep't of Def., Army &#x0026; Air Force Exch. Serv., Dall., Tex.,</span> 51 FLRA 1651, 1653-54 (1996). As pertinent here, an "employee" includes "a preference eligible in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B). It is undisputed that the grievant in this case, a preference-eligible veteran, satisfies these requirements. In fact, the Agency recognized as much in its removal letter when it advised the grievant of his right to appeal the removal action to the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Accord Scull v. DHS</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287, 292 (2010) (<span class="Italic">Scull</span>) (finding that if an FCIP intern, who was a preference eligible with one year of current, continuous service, could establish that he was subject to an adverse action, he had standing to appeal the action to the MSPB). Accordingly, we find that the grievant is an "employee" for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, to relate to a &#x00A7; 7512 matter, an award must resolve a dispute over an action listed in that section, including a "removal." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(1). There is no basis argued that the Authority should not apply the term "removal" in &#x00A7; 7512(1) according to its plain meaning, as did the Arbitrator, and treat the Agency's termination of the grievant as a removal. The Agency's removal letter, notifying the grievant of his MSPB appeal rights, reflects the same interpretation. Further, although the Agency notes its position "[t]hroughout this proceeding...[that] this action was not a removal," the Agency does not explain or provide authority for its position. Accordingly, we find that the grievant's termination was a "removal" under &#x00A7; 7512(1).<span class="Italic"> Compare McCrary v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 266, 272 (2006) (finding that FCIP intern was subjected to an appealable adverse action where the agency terminated her prior to the expiration of her internship), <span class="Italic">with Scull</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. at 292 (finding that FCIP intern's termination upon expiration of appointment is generally not an adverse action because it merely carries out the terms of the appointment).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's argument that the Authority has jurisdiction because the grievant is a probationary employee lacks merit. Citing Authority precedent, the Agency argues that awards pertaining to a probationary employee's termination do not relate to any of the matters described in &#x00A7; 7121(f). Exceptions at 7-8 (citing<span class="Italic"> NTEU, Chapter 103</span>, 66 FLRA at 417; <span class="Italic">BLS</span>, 66 FLRA at 283).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's contentions would deprive the grievant of explicit statutory entitlements. Matters described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) include actions "covered under" &#x00A7; 7512. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(f). As discussed above, those actions include the grievant's removal. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b) and (d), an "employee" as defined in &#x00A7; 7511, against whom an action listed in &#x00A7; 7512 is proposed or taken, is entitled to various procedural protections and appeal rights. The grievant, a preference-eligible veteran with the requisite service to qualify as an "employee," possesses those entitlements as a statutory right with respect to his removal. And unlike &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i) and (a)(1)(C)(i), &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) does not include an exception for probationary employees. This supports a finding that, even if the grievant is a "probationary" employee as the Agency claims, he is nevertheless an "employee" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B). To hold, as the Agency contends, that the grievant should be denied an "employee's" statutory entitlements because he is arguably a probationary employee grafts onto the provisions of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511 and 7513 an exception that Congress did not enact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Agency's reliance on Authority precedent is misplaced. Neither case cited by the Agency involved a preference-eligible individual with the requisite service who qualified as an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B). <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 103</span>, 66 FLRA at 416; <span class="Italic">BLS</span>, 66 FLRA at 282. For all these reasons, we reject the Agency's claim that the award, setting aside the grievant's removal, does not relate to any of the matters described in &#x00A7; 7121(f), and dismiss the Agency's exceptions for lack of jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the MSPB lacks jurisdiction over the action submitted to arbitration, FLRA may review the ensuing exception, as occurred when an arbitrator decided a grievance involving the removal of an employee of the Veterans Canteen Service, <span class="Italic">VA Canteen Serv. and AFGE Local 2209</span>, 66 FLRA 985, 987-88 (2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1744"></span>The Authority issued an Order to Show Cause (Order), directing the Agency to demonstrate why it should not dismiss its exception for lack of jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 7121(f) of the Statute. The Agency filed a response, asserting that the Authority has jurisdiction to resolve its exception because, based on precedent, "the claim involved...is not reviewable by the MSPB or the Federal Circuit." Conversely, as noted previously, the Union, in its opposition, claims that the Authority lacks jurisdiction over the Agency's exception because the grievance concerns the removal of a VCS employee, which either constitutes a matter covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 or a similar matter which arises under an "other personnel system."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute, the Authority lacks jurisdiction to review an arbitration award "relating to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f)" of the Statute. <span class="Italic">U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, Narragansett, R.I.,</span> 59 FLRA 591, 592 (2004).

<p class="noindent-1">Here, consistent with the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Canteen Service</span>, 66 FLRA 944 (2012) (<span class="Italic">VA, VCS</span>), VCS employees appointed pursuant to &#x00A7; 7802(e) are excluded from the provisions of Chapter 75 of Title 5, including &#x00A7; 7512. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(d)(12) (stating that the requirements of Chapter 75 of Title 5 pertaining to adverse actions do not apply to "[a]n employee whose agency or position has been excluded from the appointing provisions of [T]itle 5...by separate statutory authority in the absence of any provision to place the employee within the coverage of [C]hapter 75 of [T]itle 5"); <span class="Italic">see also Bennett</span>, 635 F.3d at 1216, 1221 (concluding that VCS employees appointed under &#x00A7; 7802(e) are excluded from the provisions of Chapter 75 of Title 5 and thus are barred from appealing their removals to the MSPB). As a result, because the grievant is a VCS employee appointed under &#x00A7; 7802(e), her removal is not "covered under" &#x00A7; 7512. <span class="Italic">Bonner v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Pittsburgh Healthcare Sys.</span>, 477 F.3d 1343, 1346 (Fed.

<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, as discussed further in <span class="Italic">VA, VCS</span>, VCS employees appointed under &#x00A7; 7802(e) are not part of an "other personnel system," but, rather, are part of the personnel system which is applicable to civil service employees and is governed by Title 5. <span class="Italic">VA, VCS</span>, 66 FLRA at 949-50<span class="Italic">.</span> Thus, the grievant's removal is not a similar matter arising under an "other personnel system." <span class="Italic">U.S. Small Bus.

<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that the grievant was removed from employment for unacceptable performance, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. chapter 43, and that the claim advanced at arbitration challenged the Agency's decision to remove the grievant for his unacceptable performance. As the award at issue relates to the grievant's removal for unacceptable performance under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43, the award relates to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f). <span class="Italic">See PTO</span>, 61 FLRA at 477-78 (grievant's removal for unacceptable performance "inextricably intertwined" with &#x00A7; 4303). Thus, the above-cited precedent supports a conclusion that the Authority lacks jurisdiction to consider the Union's exceptions to the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that the removal "flowed from the Agency's commission of" a ULP, and asserts that "only the [Authority] can determine whether" this assertion is correct. However, the Authority previously has dismissed exceptions under &#x00A7; 7121(f) even where the conduct at issue in the arbitration proceeding was alleged to constitute a ULP. <span class="Italic">See VA</span>, 59 FLRA at 570 (Authority lacked jurisdiction to consider exceptions to award that found, among other things, that agency committed a ULP when it suspended grievant for thirty days). In addition, although the MSPB may not adjudicate whether a ULP occurred, it "not only can but must address issues that could properly underlie [ULP] charges where such issues are raised as affirmative defenses alleging 'prohibited personnel practices.'" <span class="Italic">Wildberger v. FLRA</span>, 132 F.3d 784, 791 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9); <span class="Italic">Ireland v. Dep't of HHS, SSA</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 614 (1987); <span class="Italic">Bodinus v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 536, 540-42 (1981)). <span class="Italic">See also Dep't of Commerce, Bureau of the Census v. FLRA</span>, 976 F.2d 882, 890 (4th Cir. 1992). Accordingly, the MSPB addresses claims that employee removals violate 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) because they were taken in retaliation based on union activities. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gustave-Schmidt v. DoL</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 667, 675 (2001). For these reasons, the claim advanced at arbitration in this case is one that could have been reviewed by the MSPB, and, on appeal, by the Federal Circuit. Even if that were not the case, the possibility that there may be no forum in which a party may challenge an arbitration award does not provide a basis for finding that the Authority has jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">E.g., PTO</span>, 61 FLRA at 478 (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Med. Ctr., Newington, Conn</span>., 53 FLRA 440, 443 (1997)).</p>
<p class="noindent">Executive Order 13,839, in part directing agencies to negotiate for contracts excluding adverse actions from the coverage of grievance procedures, does not impliedly vest FLRA with jurisdiction to review an arbitrator's award reversing an adverse action.

<p class="noindent">Because a furlough for thirty days or less is an adverse action, FLRA is without jurisdiction to review an award contesting the furlough. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE</span>, 32 FLRA 79, 83 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">USDA, Forest Serv., N.

<p class="noindent">For analysis under &#x00A7; 7121, a downgrade is treated as a reduction in grade. <span id="page_1745"></span><span class="Italic">AAFES and AFGE Council 236</span>, 33 FLRA 815, 817-18 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">VA and AFGE Local 1915,</span> 34 FLRA 580, 583 (1990) (same result, although issue was whether resignation that followed initiation of downgrade was voluntary action).

<p class="noindent">Reassignment out of a law enforcement position, resulting in discontinuation of law enforcement availability pay (LEAP), was not a reduction in pay under 5 USC 7512.

Action by an agency to collect a monetary loss caused by the grievant is not a reduction in basic pay.

<p class="noindent">An award directing relief for a promotion improperly canceled by the agency was treated as an award involving a demotion and, as a result, FLRA lacked jurisdiction to review the award in <span class="Italic">NASA, Lewis Research Ctr. and IFPTE Local 28</span>, 54 FLRA 620, 623-25 (1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found, and the Agency disputes, that the Agency's actions in this case resulted in the grievants' reduction in grade. Reductions in grade are matters covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. Accordingly, although not raised by the parties, a jurisdictional issue is presented concerning whether the Arbitrator's award is an award relating to a matter described in section 7121(f). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the Authority does not have jurisdiction over the Agency's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(3), the MSPB has statutory jurisdiction over cases concerning reductions in grade. The MSPB has defined "reduction in grade," within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, to include a cancellation of a promotion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Russell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 698, 709 (1981). In <span class="Italic">Barnes v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 337 (1996), the MSPB stated that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In order to establish Board jurisdiction in an appeal from the cancellation of a promotion, the appellant must raise a nonfrivolous allegation that the promotion actually occurred; that is, that the promotion was approved by an authorized appointing official aware that he was making the promotion, and that some action denoting acceptance of the promotion was taken. The promotion must not have been revoked prior to appellant's performance in the higher grade.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 340 (<span class="Italic">Barnes</span>). The MSPB concluded that the appellant in <span class="Italic">Barnes</span> satisfied these requirements, thereby establishing a nonfrivolous allegation of a reduction in grade, by submitting evidence that "there was a promotion, that there was an authorizing official, that the appellant accepted the promotion, and that the appellant was demoted." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator found "no doubt" that the grievants had been promoted. The Arbitrator also found that the Senior Promotion Review Board had reviewed and approved the promotions and that, in recognition of the appointments, the Agency had issued SF-52s to the grievants. The Arbitrator concluded that the Agency's "attempt at revocation of vested promotions" was improper and ineffective. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 19. Consistent with <span class="Italic">Barnes</span>, these findings and conclusions, although disputed in part by the Agency, support a conclusion that a nonfrivolous <span class="Italic">allegation</span> has been made that reductions in grade occurred. Indeed, the Arbitrator reached the <span class="Italic">conclusion</span> that reductions in grade had occurred. In this regard, the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Reagan</span> and <span class="Italic">Dalbey</span> is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Reagan</span>, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the issuance of an SF-52 by an authorized official, along with performance at the higher grade, established appointment to a position, regardless of whether an SF-50 has been issued. In <span class="Italic">Dalbey</span>, the MSPB stated that it will look at the totality of the circumstances in order to determine whether there has been an appointment. These decisions do not call into question the Arbitrator's findings, on which our conclusion that there is a nonfrivolous allegation of a reduction in grade, is based.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency cites 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4302 and 7512 as bases for its exceptions in this case. However, the Authority does not have jurisdiction over matters covered under section 4302 and 7512. Instead, Section 7121(f) states that judicial review of matters covered under these sections, including reductions in grade under section 7512, "shall apply to the award of an arbitrator in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the matter had been decided by the Board." As such, the proper forum for this appeal was the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Authority does not have jurisdiction to review the Agency's exceptions to the award.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the Federal Circuit has jurisdiction to review the merits of the award as well as related procedural issues, e.g., timeliness, as they pertain to an action that could otherwise be appealed to the MSPB, the matter is beyond the jurisdiction of FLRA through the exceptions process. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Birmingham and AFGE</span>, 32 FLRA 1003, 1005 (1988) (citing <span class="Italic">Huey v. DHHS</span>, 782 F.2d 1575, 1577-78 (Fed. Cir. 1986)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 933 and VA Dingell VAMC</span>, 71 FLRA 521, 521 (2020) (if the matter in arbitration is an adverse action, an arbitrator's ruling on a procedural matter is bound up with the nature of the adverse action grieved, making that ruling unreviewable on exceptions to FLRA).
