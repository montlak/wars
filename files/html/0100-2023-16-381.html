<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-381"><span class="space">a.</span> Equal Access to Justice Act</h5>
<p class="noindent">The Equal Access to Justice Act provides some financial assistance to unions that prevail in ULP charges filed against them by FLRA. The EAJA, 5 USC 504, may also be used by a union to secure fees if the union prevails in court in a negotiability or ULP appeal. FLRA's implementing regulations are at 5 CFR Part 2430 (2022). "Awards of Attorney Fees and Other Expenses." [Refer to Chapter 9, "<a href="0100-2023-16-381.html#sec8-381">Equal Access to Justice Act</a>," for cases concerning attempts to use EAJA in grievance arbitration cases.]</p>
<p class="noindent">Whether a union should be awarded counsel fees and expenses under 5 CFR Part 2430, implementing EAJA, was addressed in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 495 and Moore</span>, 22 FLRA 966, 968-69 (1986). The case involved some internal union discipline, and the ALJ concluded that FLRA lacked jurisdiction over the case against the union. No exceptions were filed to the ALJ's decision. The union then filed an application for fees, granted by the ALJ. FLRA's extensive opinion granted the award. It noted that the purpose of the 1980 EAJA was to reduce the extent that individuals and organizations were discouraged from seeking review of or defending against unreasonable government action because of the expense of vindicating their rights. 5 USC 504 governs agencies conducting adversary adjudications under the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 USC 504 made federal agencies liable for litigation expenses to the opposing party in the case, other than the United States or another federal agency, if certain conditions were met: i.e., that the party prevailed in the case; that the party met certain eligibility requirements; that it was determined that the government had not shown either that its action (represented by the position of the agency in the case) was substantially justified, that special circumstances made an award unjust, or that the party applying for the award of costs had engaged in conduct that unduly or unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the case.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA went on to define some of the terminology used in EAJA. "Prevailing party" is one that includes: parties who obtain favorable settlements if the agency or department that initiated the matter seeks dismissal of the case; parties who obtain partial victories; and parties who totally prevail on the merits of their case after a hearing. Eligible under EAJA are labor unions and individuals and other organizations, but not individuals with a net worth exceeding a million [now two million] dollars or organizations having a net worth exceeding five million [now seven million] dollars unless the organization is tax exempt under certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and has less than 500 employees. "Substantially justified" was essentially identified as reasonableness or, whether the government could show that its position had a reasonable basis in law or fact. A case of the General Counsel that consisted of evidence that would not create a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case would be groundless or meritless and readily meets the test of EAJA. Even meeting a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, however, does not necessarily defeat EAJA entitlement. FLRA concluded that the phrase "special circumstances," was intended to be a safety valve ensuring that awards are not made without consideration of equities and ensuring that the government was not deterred from advancing, in good faith, novel but credible extensions and interpretations of the law that often underlie vigorous enforcement efforts<span class="Italic">. AFGE Local 495</span>, 22 FLRA at 969-71.</p>
<p class="noindent">On the facts and law of the case, FLRA first concluded that because there is no requirement for filing exceptions to an ALJ's recommended decision, the failure to file them does not mean that a party who could have filed, but did not, knew that its position was wrong. Nevertheless, the reasonableness of the General Counsel's position was not sustained. The General Counsel did not establish the evidence needed to make a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of a statutory violation. The motion for fees was granted, a bill for a meal during a conference was disallowed (but the time for the conference was allowed), and fees were awarded for the time spent preparing and presenting the EAJA application. The total award was $6,194, including $571 for processing the petition. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 495</span>, 22 FLRA at 979.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another ULP against a union led to an EAJA petition when the union prevailed in its litigation with FLRA. Fees were denied, however, in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 987 and Bradley</span>, 55 FLRA 432, 434-37 (1999). The full decision, along with the dissent by Member Wasserman, should be reviewed for the factual complications of the litigation. The decision is instructive as to the general criteria FLRA applies to EAJA petitions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to the EAJA (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 504(a)(1)), and the Authority's regulations implementing the EAJA (5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2430.1 <span class="Italic">et seq.), </span>an eligible entity may receive an award of attorney fees when it is the prevailing party in an unfair labor practice proceeding. However, notwithstanding eligibility and success, an eligible entity may not receive an award of attorney fees if "the General Counsel's position in the proceeding was substantially justified, or special circumstances make an award unjust." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 2430.1. <span class="Italic">See Temp Tech Industries v. NLRB, </span>756 F.2d 586, 589 (7th Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The determination of whether the position of the General Counsel is "substantially justified" depends on whether the position has a "reasonable basis both in law and fact[,]" or put another way, whether it is "justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person." <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local</span> <span class="Italic">1857, </span>48 FLRA 900, 901 (1993) <span class="Italic">(AFGE Local 1857),</span> <span class="Italic">quoting Pierce v. Underwood, </span>487 U.S. 552, 565 (1988). The General Counsel has the burden of establishing the reasonableness of the position on the law and the facts. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1857, </span>48 FLRA at 901; <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hess Mechanical Corp. v. NLRB, </span>112 F.3d 146,149 (4th Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">Phil Smidt &#x0026; Son, Inc. v. NLRB, </span>810 F.2d 638, 641 (7th Cir. 1987). However, the failure to prevail in the litigation does not necessarily mean that the position asserted was not substantially justified. <span class="Italic">Pierce v.</span> <span class="Italic">Underwood, </span>487 U.S. at 565-66. Indeed, if the General Counsel's mere failure to prevail triggered the right to attorney fees under the EAJA, then the statute's "substantially justified" requirement would be rendered superfluous.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, substantial justification has been found and fee awards have thus been denied where the government has "advanc[ed] in good faith the novel but credible extensions and interpretations of the law that often underlie vigorous enforcement efforts." H.R. Rep. No. 1418, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. at 11, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1980 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News 4953, 4990. This provision was intended as a "safety valve" for government agencies bringing actions against private parties, to allow for such "vigorous enforcement efforts<span class="Italic">." Id. See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g., Marcus v. Shalala, </span>17 F.3d 1033, 1037 (7th Cir. 1994) ("novelty of the question weighs in the government's favor" when deciding whether the government's position was substantially justified); <span class="Italic">Timms v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States, </span>742 F.2d 489, 492 (9th Cir. 1984) (government can show its position was substantially justified by showing that it advance a novel, yet credible position). The Authority has also considered the novelty of the General Counsel's legal theory in resolving a fee application, holding that novelty will not, in and of itself, substantially justify a prosecution or serve as a special circumstance that will render a fee award unjust. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 495,</span> <span class="Italic">AFL-CIO (Veterans Administration Medical Center,</span> <span class="Italic">Tucson, Arizona) </span>22 FLRA 966, 977 (1986) <span class="Italic">(AFGE,</span> <span class="Italic">Local 495) </span>(awarding fees where the General Counsel put forth a novel legal theory, but did not make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case under the novel theory pursued).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "special circumstances" that make a fee award unjust are not specifically described in the EAJA. As a result, courts have concluded "that the statutory language expresses a congressional directive for courts 'to apply traditional equitable principles' in determining whether <span id="page_1655"></span>a prevailing party should receive a fee award under EAJA." <span class="Italic">Air Transport Association of Canada v. F.A.A., </span>156 F.3d 1329, 1333 (D.C. Cir. 1998), quoting <span class="Italic">Oguachuba v.

<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he purpose of permitting a recovery of attorney fees under the EAJA is "to deter the government from bringing unfounded suits or engaging in arbitrary or unjust administrative behavior." <span class="Italic">Oguachuba,</span> 706 F.2d at 98. We do not find the General Counsel to have engaged in any such behavior in this case. Indeed, the Union acknowledges that the General Counsel dismissed other charges Bradley filed against the Union during this period. Rather than proving inconsistency, as the Union asserts, in our view this demonstrates that the General Counsel was exercising independent prosecutorial discretion concerning the relative merits of Bradley's charges against the Union. This conduct is entirely consistent with the General Counsel's autonomous, statutory role of filing and prosecuting complaints. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7104(f)(2)(B). As a public prosecutor, it is appropriate that the General Counsel, as in this case, "is not deterred from advancing in good faith credible extensions and interpretations of the law[.]" H.R. Rep. No. 1418, 96th Cong., 2nd Sess. at 11, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1980 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News 4953, 4990.</p>
<p class="noindent">Counsel fees were denied to a union that successfully defended a charge that it engaged in unlawful picketing. The ALJ determined that the General Counsel's position was not unreasonable, the law was unsettled, and the General Counsel was not required to show a substantial likelihood of success before initiating the ULP proceeding. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2369 and SSA, New York Reg'l Office</span>, 25 FLRA 354, 361 (1987) (ALJ Decision). "Substantial justification" of the General Counsel's position also led to denial of fees to a union that successfully defended a charge that it breached its duty of fair representation, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1857 and Holdahl</span>, 48 FLRA 900, 901-02 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to avoid the imposition of attorney's fees under the EAJA, the General Counsel has the burden of proving that his position was "substantially justified." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 504(a)(1). The U.S. Supreme Court has stated that "substantially justified" means having a "reasonable basis both in law and fact[,]" or "justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person." <span class="Italic">Pierce v. Underwood</span>, 487 U.S. 552, 565 (1988). As there were no facts in dispute, the only question before us is whether the General Counsel propounded a theory that has a reasonable basis in law. In this regard, we note that in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 495, AFL-CIO (Veterans Administration Medical Center, Tucson, Arizona</span>), 22 FLRA 966 (1986), the Authority stated that the EAJA was not intended to deter the General Counsel from advancing "novel or untested legal theories and cases...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 977.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Respondent that the statutory issue in this case is "well-settled and easily understood: A union has no duty of fair representation as to matters in which it is not acting as an employee's exclusive representative." Thus, consistent with <span class="Italic">Fort Bragg Association of Educators, National Education Association, Fort Bragg, North Carolina</span>, 28 FLRA 908 (1987) and <span class="Italic">Antilles Consolidated Education Association (OEA/NEA), San Juan, Puerto Rico</span>, 36 FLRA 776 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Antilles</span>), the only finding necessary for a determination of whether the Union violated the Statute by failing to represent the Charging Party under the General Counsel's primary theory of violation is whether, as a matter of law, the Union was required to act as the employee's exclusive representative in connection with the proposed disciplinary action. As the Judge stated, "the Union was clearly not the exclusive representative of the affected employee for this action." Accordingly, we conclude that the General Counsel did not have a reasonable basis for maintaining the first theory of violation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the General Counsel also argued, as an alternative theory, that the Respondent had assumed certain obligations as a result of the parties' negotiated collective bargaining agreement. That theory relied on <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, in which the Authority held that a union had a duty to represent nonmembers in administering a health care plan because it had negotiated the exclusive right to administer the plan. In this case, the Union had negotiated certain procedural rights concerning discipline, including provisions concerning the content of notices of proposed disciplinary actions and the right to official time if the Union were chosen to represent the employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> 46 FLRA at 905. The Authority distinguished this case from <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> because in this case the employees had certain statutory and regulatory protections and because the negotiated agreement specifically excludes proposed disciplinary actions from the negotiated grievance procedure and, thus, "does not purport to govern the full scope of rights accorded to employees regarding proposed disciplinary actions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 914. Nonetheless, as the Judge correctly noted, "at some stage" the negotiated grievance procedure would be available to unit employees to challenge such discipline. Accordingly, the Judge found, and we agree, that there is a "facial appearance, somewhat akin to <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, of redress of discipline imposed by the agency through the Union negotiated agreement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Consequently, we agree with the Judge that, under Authority precedent, the General Counsel's alternative contractual theory was reasonable, and, therefore, that it was substantially justified.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The application for attorney's fees is dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 23 FLRA 774, 781-72 (1986), noted of a union fee request that FLRA denied under both EAJA and the Back Pay Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its brief to the Authority, the Charging Party requests that it be granted attorney fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act and the Back Pay Act. These requests are denied. With regard to the granting of attorney's fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), the Authority's regulations provide that awards under the EAJA are available only to a respondent, other than the United States, who prevails against the General Counsel in an unfair labor practice proceeding. Therefore, the Union, as a charging party, is not entitled to an award of attorney fees under that Act. <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service (District, Region, National Office Units)</span>, 16 FLRA 904 (1984). The Authority also concludes that the Charging Party's request for attorney fees under the Back Pay Act is ill-founded. It is well established that an award of attorney fees under the Back Pay Act must be based upon a finding that an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action has been committed which has deprived an aggrieved employee of "pay, allowances, or differentials" that the employee would have earned or received if that action had not occurred. In other words, the award of fees must be in conjunction with an award of backpay to the employee(s) on correction of the unwarranted personnel action. <span class="Italic">See, for example, Naval Air Development Center, Department of the Navy and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1928, AFL-CIO,</span> 21 FLRA No. 25 (1986) and cases cited therein. While the refusal of Respondent IRS to comply with a lawful Panel order may have constituted an unwarranted personnel action which resulted in the denial of travel and per diem expenses to certain employees, travel and per diem expenses are not "pay, allowances, or differentials" within the meaning of the Back Pay Act and therefore an order requiring reimbursement of those expenses does not amount to an award of backpay. Rather, as the Authority has previously held, the "pay, allowances, or differentials" encompassed by the Back Pay Act constitute "normal legitimate employee benefits" in the nature of employee compensation or emoluments which do not extend to reimbursement payments such as per diem. <span class="Italic">Community Services Administration and National Council of CSA Locals, AFGE, AFL-CIO</span>, 7 FLRA 206, 208-209 (1981). In the Authority's view, the reimbursement of travel expenses in this context similarly cannot be equated with backpay so as to justify an award of attorney fees.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under FLRA practice, the EAJA application is referred when possible to the same ALJ who presided over the proceeding leading to the underlying decision. The judge is to make findings of fact and law. The decision and the record is then transferred to FLRA and the parties may file exceptions to the award. The Act, it was noted, was extended and made permanent by the Equal Access to Justice Act of 1985, with some clarifications and amendments. One decision suggests (not in the context of a FLRA decision) that EAJA fees are paid to the prevailing party and not to counsel. That decision, however, was written over a better-reasoned dissenting opinion, an opinion that cited to contrary law. <span class="Italic">FDL Technologies, Inc. v. United States</span>, 967 F.2d 1578, 1582-86 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (following <span class="Italic">Phillips v. GSA</span>, 924 F.2d 1577, 1583-84 (Fed. Cir. 1991)). Fees are for lawyers. A lawyer may not split a fee with a client.</p>
<p class="noindent">The "substantial justification" requirement of EAJA does not extend to consideration of the fee application divorced from the merits of the underlying case. If the case-in-chief warrants EAJA fees, then as to fees sought to recover fees, it is immaterial that the government's opposition to the fee petition is substantially justified. <span class="Italic">Commissioner, INS v. Jean</span>, 110 S. Ct. 2316 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Anthony v. Sullivan</span>, 982 F.2d 586, 589-90 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (noting, however, that fees will not be awarded for time spent on unsuccessful claims concerning fee entitlement).</p>
