<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-146"><span class="space">11.</span> Witness Denial--Review Standard</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The broad discretion entrusted to AJs to control the proceedings before them includes ruling on the probative value of proffered testimony of witnesses. <span class="Italic">Butler v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 73 MSPR 313, 317 (1997) (AJ could disregard the direct testimony of a witness who declined to respond to questions on cross-examination). <span class="Italic">Vaughn v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 119 MSPR 605, 611 &#x00B6; 12-13, 2013 MSPB 50 (2013), affirmed the high bar for showing an abuse of discretion should the AJ deny requested witnesses:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge has wide discretion to control the proceedings, including the authority to exclude testimony he believes would be irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious. <span class="Italic">Sanders v. Social Security Administration</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6; 10 (2010). The Board has said that in order to "obtain reversal of an initial decision on the ground that the administrative judge abused his discretion in excluding evidence, the petitioning party must show on review that relevant evidence, which could have affected the outcome, was disallowed." <span class="Italic">Jezouit v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 12 (2004), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 121 Fed. Appx. 865 (Fed. Cir. 2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge approved 9 of the 34 witnesses the appellant requested. He denied "the balance of the appellant's requested witnesses based on the appellant's inability to provide information showing they have relevant or material testimony to provide concerning the agency's charges and specifications, or her affirmative defenses." The appellant's vague assertion on review that the administrative judge erred in disallowing most of her witnesses does not show that their testimony would have been relevant, material, or not repetitious. Therefore, she has not shown that the administrative judge abused his discretion in disallowing these witnesses. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Franco v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 322, 325 (1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McClure v. VA</span>, DE-4324-16-0220-I-1 (NP 2/9/2023) ("[T]he petitioning party must show on review that a relevant witness or evidence, which could have affected the outcome, was disallowed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 453, &#x00B6; 4 (2011).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But remands occur if the AJ clearly and unreasonably hampers the right of a party to offer proof. Such was the situation in <span class="Italic">Gregory v. FCC</span>, 79 MSPR 563, 570-71 &#x00B6; 15 (1998), an appeal involving a coerced resignation, tying the Board's jurisdiction to the merits of the appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well-settled that the administrative judge has wide discretion to exclude witnesses where it has not been shown that their testimony would be relevant, material, and nonrepetitious<span class="Italic">. Franco v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 27 MSPR 322, 325 (1985). However, particularly where, as here, the appellant bears the burden to establish the Board's jurisdiction over her appeal, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)], it is patently unfair for the administrative judge to exclude witnesses whom the appellant indicated could support her claims that she was harassed by management and subjected to difficult working conditions, specifically, Milne, Forster, Myers, and Janckson-Curtis, and then find that she failed to make such a showing. Under these circumstances, therefore, we find that the administrative judge abused her discretion<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Smith v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 54 MSPR 631, 637-38 (1992). Although she granted the appellant a hearing, it was hardly a meaningful one since she foreclosed the appellant from establishing her claim of involuntariness by precluding her from providing corroborating evidence that her working conditions at the time she decided to resign were so difficult that a reasonable person in her position would have felt compelled to resign....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the AJ denies a request for witnesses, on a PFR the Board will review the proffered testimony to determine if it is irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hamilton v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts that the administrative judge erred in refusing to allow it to call a witness to rebut the appellant's testimony that he could have been accommodated by being reassigned to another position. Because the agency has not challenged the administrative judge's finding that it could have accommodated the appellant in his former position, and thus has not shown that the administrative judge erred in finding handicap discrimination, we find that any error by the administrative judge with regard to the issue of reassignment did not prejudice the agency's substantive rights. <span class="Italic">Karapinka v.

<p class="Body-Text">To present an objection to the Board concerning an excluded witness, the <span id="Page_1425"></span>objection must first be presented to the AJ. If the objection has been preserved below through a "general objection," on PFR specific arguments must be offered regarding the disapproved witnesses. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kopec v. Dept. of Army</span>, 63 MSPR 576, 580 (1994). It may be difficult to establish that a witness should have been allowed without a detailed offer of proof. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Matosian v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 56 MSPR 689, 698 (1993) ("[N]one of the proposed witnesses whom the appellant allegedly would have called are identified in the record below, and the appellant has not made an offer of proof as to what their testimony would have been."). An offer of proof may be difficult to supply for an uncooperative or hostile witness. The Board can be rather exacting in its requirements concerning proof and rather circuitous in its reasoning concerning denials of witnesses. Consider <span class="Italic">Brownscombe v. OPM</span>, 37 MSPR 382, 386 (1988), a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> disability retirement appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he administrative judge did not err in denying the appellant's request for the testimony of his former supervisor despite OPM's not objecting to his appearance. The appellant failed to identify the substance of the supervisor's testimony. His speculation that his former supervisor would testify that the statement to OPM that the appellant demonstrated no service deficiency was false is uncorroborated by the record. Additionally, the appellant made no attempt to secure the presence of this witness or his affidavit. Thus, the appellant did not show this witness's absence impaired the proceedings or his rights. <span class="Italic">See Moore v. Dept. of State</span>, 15 MSPR 488, 490, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 765 F.2d 159 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Tiffany v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 795 F.2d 67, 70 (Fed. Cir. 1986), added that, to demonstrate error, the appellant should show the specifics of the testimony she was deprived of, the relevance and materiality of the excluded testimony, the way the testimony could have buttressed her case, and the nonrepetitious nature of the testimony. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Veneziano v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 189 F.3d 1363, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ("The administrative judge has broad discretion in determining how many and which witnesses should be permitted to testify"; the testimony proposed appeared to be cumulative and would have added little to the evidence of record); <span class="Italic">Holtgrewe v.

[Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-10-134.html#sec3-134">Offer of Proof</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At times the Board attempts to surmise the materiality, relevance, and possibly repetitious nature of excluded testimony without a detailed offer of proof. The Board looks to the statement offered in the prehearing submission to determine the nature of the testimony. In an appeal involving a disability discrimination defense, <span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, 54 MSPR 631, 637 (1992), the explanation offered in the prehearing submission was that the witness, a psychologist, would "attest to the status of his [the appellant's] rehabilitation, and his efforts toward recovery and the importance of his continued employment." Although the Board felt that the description did not specifically characterize the content of the testimony expected from the witness, it was sufficient that the description conveyed the general impression that the psychologist would report on the appellant's psychological problems and their effect on his attendance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board required a specific showing of prejudice to set aside an AJ's ruling on witnesses, <span class="Italic">Taylor v. DOJ</span>, 60 MSPR 686, 688-89 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the prehearing conference, the administrative judge ruled that four of the appellant's proposed witnesses, who would have testified regarding the severity of the appellant's medical and family problems during the years at issue, would be excluded, and that the parties should stipulate as to their testimony. The parties were unable to reach a stipulation. The appellant argues that the exclusion of the four witnesses was improper.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge has wide discretion to control the conduct of proceedings, including the exclusion of witnesses. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41(b)(10). Here, the administrative judge admitted into the record extensive, detailed evidence of the appellant's medical and family problems, including medical records, medical bills, court records, and the appellant's declaration. That evidence is uncontroverted. Thus, even if the appellant were to show an abuse of discretion on the part of the administrative judge, he has failed to demonstrate any resulting prejudice. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 MSPR 281, 282 (1984) (an adjudicatory error that is not prejudicial to a party's substantive rights provides no basis for reversal of an initial decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an OPM retirement case, the Board was not inclined to require the appearance of OPM witnesses when the appeal could be resolved on what the Board considered to be adequate documentation, <span class="Italic">Davis v. OPM</span>, 43 MSPR 340, 343-44 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the administrative judge did not err in denying the appellant's request for the OPM officials who decided the appellant's retirement appeal. Also, the administrative judge did not err in denying the appellant's request for the testimony of the agency employee who sent the appellant the June 8, 1987, letters with the application for death benefits and the representative payee questionnaire. The appellant has not established that their testimony would add anything to the information in the record. <span class="Italic">See Farris</span> <span class="Italic">v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 20 MSPR 547, 551 n.3 (1984).

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit addressed witness exclusion, <span class="Italic">Davis v. OPM</span>, 918 F.2d 944, 946 (Fed. Cir. 1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A determination whether the testimony of witnesses should be presented is within the sound discretion of the AJ....&#8197;Petitioner claims that the AJ's refusal to grant his request for witnesses constituted a denial of due process of law. However, petitioner has failed to come forward with evidence that the documents submitted were insufficient, or that the witnesses' testimony would add anything to the information in the record. In light of this failure, we hold that the AJ did not abuse his discretion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hiller v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/18-1244.Opinion.4-22-2019.pdf">767 Fed. Appx. 957</a>, 961 (Fed. Cir. 2019 NP), determined the AJ did not err by declining to permit the appellant to call witnesses who were not timely named in a prehearing submission:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the Administrative Judge did not abuse his discretion. Ms. Hiller learned as early as May 12 that her pre-hearing submissions would be due on July 24. While she did not receive specific details about those submissions until July 19, she knew well before the deadline that it fell during a week in which she planned to take vacation. When she left for that vacation, moreover, she knew that the Administrative Judge had not yet issued the promised detailed order and thus knew that the submissions might include unexpected information. If she had concerns about not having enough time to submit her prehearing submissions, she could have requested a continuance before leaving, postponed her vacation, or otherwise established a contingency plan to ensure she would meet the deadline. In short, Ms. Hiller herself created the circumstances under which she missed the filing deadline for her witness list.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Hiller alleges that this case parallels <span class="Italic">Kennedy v. Military Sealift Command</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 96 (1984), in which the Board reversed a presiding official's decision to deny an appellant's motion for a postponement to obtain the presence of witnesses. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 99. We, however, find <span class="Italic">Kennedy</span> inapposite. In <span class="Italic">Kennedy</span>, the Board found it significant that, although the appellant's request for witnesses was untimely, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 97, he had only learned the deadline two days ahead of time and missed it by one day, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 98-99. Here, in contrast, Ms. Hiller learned of the July 24 deadline for pre-hearing submissions months in advance. She knew that it fell during a week when she planned to take vacation, but she waited to request an extension. Under the circumstances, the fact that she only received notice of the specific contents of the pre-hearing submissions five days before the initial deadline (and one week before the revised deadline) does not place her within <span class="Italic">Kennedy</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Hiller alternatively implies that she did not fail to submit a timely witness list because her statement of facts referenced the individuals she proposed to call as witnesses. She argues that the Administrative Judge had "all of the information needed to request witnesses." But we have held that an Administrative Judge has no duty to pour through a statement of facts to identify potential witnesses or the nature of their testimony on behalf of one of the parties. <span class="Italic">See Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1369 (refusing to find an administrative judge abused her discretion in excluding a witness because the appellant had not timely submitted a detailed summary of that witness's proposed testimony). The Administrative Judge thus did not err in finding that Ms. Hiller's pre-hearing submissions did not sufficiently identify the witnesses she intended to call.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit set aside a Board decision following the appellant's objection to the exclusion of a significant witness. The dispute concerned the agency's assessment of the "undue disruption" that would follow the appointment of the appellant rather than the selectee to a position sought by the appellant through a settlement agreement. By limiting testimony concerning "disruption" to that provided by the appellant and the selecting official, and by excluding a witness offered by the appellant as an expert on qualifications for the job, the Board made it difficult or impossible for the appellant to prove his case or to rebut the agency's proof. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chudson v. EPA</span>, 17 F.3d 380 (Fed. Cir. 1994), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, <span class="Italic">Chudson v. EPA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 95-3135). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">DeLeonardo v. EEOC</span>, 275 Fed. Appx. 995, 998 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP) (distinguishing <span class="Italic">Chudson</span>: the appellant's opportunity to make a case was not inappropriately limited by the AJ when the appellant elected not to call to testify two witnesses who were approved by the AJ); <span class="Italic">Guise v.

Dep't of Justice</span>, 330 F.3d 1376, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Here, the Board considered in-depth testimony from numerous witnesses regarding each event relevant to this case. The Board was therefore well within its discretion to limit additional witness examination and testimony."); <span class="Italic">Byrd v. Campbell</span>, 591 F.2d 326, 329 (5th Cir. 1979) (unless a decision of the appeals officer limiting witnesses who can testify constitutes an abuse of discretion that materially prejudices the employee's presentation at the hearing, the court will not review the determination).</p>
