<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-238"><span class="space">b.</span> Travel Voucher, Related Documentation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Some intricacies of travel at the government's expense were discussed in <span class="Italic">Rosenberg v. Dept. of Transp.,</span> 105 MSPR 130, 134-36 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9, 2007 MSPB 72 (2007), mitigating a suspension based on complex circumstances of the appellant's official travel:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to fully understand the charges at issue in this case, a brief overview of the system under which federal employees pay for official travel is required. Government-wide travel rules are contained in the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR), issued by the General Services Administration (GSA). The FTR can be found in Title 41 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may pay only those travel expenses essential to the transaction of official business, including transportation expenses, per diem expenses, and certain miscellaneous expenses. 41 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 301-2.2. As a general matter, an employee must use his government travel card to pay for travel expenses. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00A7; 301-51.1. However, certain expenses, including items such as laundry/dry cleaning, parking, and tips, are exempt from mandatory use of the government travel card. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00A7; 301-51.2. Meals are exempt when use of the government travel card is impractical, such as in the case of group meals, or when the card is not accepted. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The card may not be used for anything other than expenses related to official travel. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00A7; 301-51.6. Agencies may provide travel advances to employees to cover expenses for which use of the government travel card is not mandatory. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00A7; 301-51.5(b). The FTR does not require agencies to provide travel advances, however, and there is no minimum amount that must be advanced when an agency chooses to provide an advance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee is eligible for an allowance when he performs official travel away from his official station, incurs per diem expenses while performing official travel, and is in a travel status for more than 12 hours. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00A7; 301-11.1. There are four methods by which an agency can reimburse an employee for per diem expenses, <span class="Italic">id.</span>, &#x00A7; 301-11.5, but the "lodgings-plus per diem" method was utilized for each of the trips at issue in this case. Under "lodgings-plus per diem" method, an employee is reimbursed his actual lodging expenses, not to exceed the maximum lodging rate established by GSA for the locality in which the expenses are incurred. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00A7; 301-11.100. The employee also receives an allowance for meals and incidental expenses (M&#x0026;IE) according to the daily M&#x0026;IE rate established by GSA for the locality in question. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00A7; 301-11.101. Therefore, an employee's reimbursement for M&#x0026;IE under the "lodgings-plus per diem" method is based solely on the location to which the employee travels and the number of days he spends in an official travel status. For purposes of reimbursement under the per diem method, it does not matter whether the employee's actual costs for M&#x0026;IE are less than, equal to, or greater than the rate established by GSA. The employee is personally responsible for any expenses beyond those that are reimbursable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00A7; 301-2.4.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;A government traveler may receive reimbursement for "actual expenses" under certain circumstances, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, when costs "escalate" due to a natural disaster and lodging and meals cannot be obtained "within prescribed allowances." 41 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 301-11.300. In this case, however, the appellant sought and received reimbursement under the per diem method for the trips at issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an employee uses a privately owned vehicle (POV) for official government travel, he is entitled to reimbursement based on the number of miles driven and a per-mile reimbursement rate established by GSA. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00A7; 301-10.301. Therefore, an employee's reimbursement for mileage is based on a predetermined formula rather than on his actual expenses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Implicit in a charge of falsification of travel vouchers is the allegation that the employee did so intentionally and with purpose to defraud the government.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board's definition of fraud occasionally approaches negligence. <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 782 F.2d 975 (Fed. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, should be reviewed because the Federal Circuit demonstrated that it will not permit the Board to equate negligence to intent. The Board may decide a case by distinguishing the two bases of culpability, determining that unintentional submission of an inaccurate voucher is not the same as deliberate falsification. Implicit in a charge of deliberate misrepresentation is intent to defraud. The evidence did not sustain that charge when the appellant testified that the errors in his vouchers were those of dates, not amounts, that he was owed what he received, and that the errors were transcription errors of the typist. The appellant handled a high volume of paperwork and relied on secretarial assistance to get his vouchers completed accurately. Although sloppy review of vouchers by a manager was not inconsequential, the appellant's negligence did not warrant removal in a situation involving vouchers amounting to approximately $50 owed the appellant. The Board reduced the removal to a 30-day suspension. No one considered the appellant less than competent, honest, and trustworthy. There was no evidence that the misconduct had a significant effect on the appellant's reputation for honesty and integrity or in his ability to carry out his job. <span class="Italic">Yoder v.

USPS</span>, 31 MSPR 80, 84 (1986), affirmed removal of a postal inspector who submitted incorrect vouchers that were prepared by his wife for travel and temporary lodging expenses. As an inspector, the appellant was in a position of certifying by his signature the correctness of the information contained in the vouchers. The appellant's claim that he did not review the documentation provided to support the claims he certified to be correct in his travel voucher was insufficient to overcome the agency's showing of specific intent. The finding of intent was apparently based on misrepresentations made intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth or with a conscious purpose of avoiding the truth. As a law enforcement officer, the appellant's job, requiring certification of documents, was sufficiently compromised as to his trustworthiness, integrity, and credibility to warrant removal. <span class="Italic">Garner v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bradley v. VA</span>, 900 F.2d 233 (Fed. Cir. 1990), reminded the Board that fraud requires an intent to obtain something not otherwise available to the employee. Mr. Bradley legitimately incurred relocation expenses, but on the form he used to claim those expenses he misrepresented the true identities of the family members who relocated to maintain the privacy of his family life. He was indisputably entitled to the relocation allowance. Although the Board determined that his actions constituted fraud, the court reversed, concluding that the misrepresentation was not material and could not be fraudulent because through the misrepresentation, the employee neither received nor intended to obtain a greater monetary (or other) benefit from the government than he could have received had he supplied accurate information concerning his family. <span class="Italic">Bradley</span> was applied in <span class="Italic">Powell-Belnavis v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While backdating the document was not necessarily the correct way to obtain relief, we find that the mere act of doing so does not necessarily establish an intent to defraud. The particular circumstances must be considered. The appellant here sought to remedy what she correctly perceived to be an administrative error by her agency. She sought the advice of an agency personnelist, a reasonable course of action, and followed her advice. The agency has presented no more reasonable course of action that the appellant should have followed. Moreover, she neither attempted to obtain, nor actually obtained, any improper benefit as the result of her actions. Thus, based on the facts of this case, we find that the agency has failed to prove that the appellant intended to defraud the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our finding is consistent with the recent holding...in <span class="Italic">Bradley v. <span id="Page_2767"></span>Veterans Administration</span>, 900 F.2d 233 (1990). In that case, the appellant intentionally misstated the family members who traveled with him in his application for reimbursement for expenses during an intra-agency transfer....&#8197;The court found that, because the appellant was entitled to the funds for the family members who did travel with him, there was no intent to falsify....&#8197;The court stated that a misrepresentation which does not support an inference to defraud the government is not material, and thus held that, since the employee did not receive or attempt to receive any greater monetary benefit from the government as a result of the falsification, the misrepresentation was not material....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as in <span class="Italic">Bradley</span>, the appellant did not receive or attempt to receive any additional monetary benefit by backdating the SF 2809. Thus, we find no intent to defraud and so the falsification charge cannot stand.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant's specialized knowledge of travel vouchers was relied on by the Board to infer intent to falsify vouchers, despite contrary explanations by the appellant for the entries on those vouchers, in <span class="Italic">Leatherbury v. Dept. of Army</span>, 105 MSPR 405, 413-15 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-17, 2007 MSPB 107 (2007) (reversed and remanded, <span class="Italic">Leatherbury v. Dept. of Army</span>, 524 F.3d 1293 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Filing a false travel voucher is similar in nature to a charge of filing a false claim against the government; thus, we shall apply the same elements of proof used in assessing the merits of Charge 1, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the agency must prove by preponderant evidence that the appellant knowingly supplied incorrect information with the intention of defrauding the agency. <span class="Italic">See Naekel</span>, 782 F.2d at 977. The agency supported Charge 2 with 11 specifications, each of which related to a separate travel voucher submitted by the appellant between January 2002 and June 2004, in which he sought reimbursement for travel between The Dalles Dam and John Day Dam that, in fact, was incurred during his normal daily commute to/from his duty station. With each of the specifications, the agency alleged that the appellant "knew or should have known that the amount [he] claimed that was attributable to [his] normal daily commute...was not reimbursable under the JTR." The agency alleged that the amount of non-reimbursable travel that the appellant claimed in the 11 travel vouchers totaled approximately $1,257.57. It is undisputed that the travel vouchers were not in accordance with the JTR. Although the narrative of Charge 2 gave no indication that an element of intent was integrated into the charge, the AJ nonetheless correctly included the element of intent in his analysis of the merits of Charge 2, as the deciding official had done in the Notice of Decision on Proposed Removal. Because the agency chose to label the alleged misconduct in the Notice of Proposed Removal as "[f]iling a false travel voucher," the agency is obligated to prove the elements that make up the legal definition of the charge, which is, in essence, filing a false claim against the government. <span class="Italic">See Otero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 198, 202 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, in his position as both a supervisor and a Travel Approving Official, is responsible for understanding the rules and regulations surrounding the approval of travel vouchers. The appellant's position obligates him to review the travel vouchers of subordinate employees, taking care to ensure that any agency expenditure of funds with respect to the vouchers is in accordance with the JTR. The agency produced evidence that the appellant attended a May 2001 training course at which he was informed, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, of the general rule "that normal daily commute mileage is to be deducted from local travel vouchers." The agency also produced numerous policy memoranda setting forth the general rule regarding daily commute mileage, as well as a February 4, 2004 e-mail message sent to all Travel Approving Officials, including the appellant, which reminded them of the travel rule at issue here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the totality of the circumstances, it appears more likely to be true than untrue that either the appellant possessed a specific intent to defraud the government by submitting the false travel vouchers, or that he acted with a reckless disregard either for the truth or for ascertaining the truth in the matter. <span class="Italic">See Dogar</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 52, &#x00B6; 7. The appellant, as a supervisor and Travel Approving Official, was in a position of considerable trust and responsibility regarding the approval of travel vouchers and the resultant expenditure of agency funds. For that reason, the agency provided the appellant with training on the JTR, along with reminders of the travel rules through e-mail and policy memoranda. Yet, despite the repeated agency notifications to the appellant intended to educate him as to the JTR, particularly the rule regarding daily commute mileage, the appellant nevertheless submitted the 11 travel vouchers that admittedly were not in accordance with the JTR.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the aforementioned reasons, we find that the agency has proven by preponderant evidence Specifications 1-11 of Charge 2. Accordingly, Charge 2 is sustained.</p>
