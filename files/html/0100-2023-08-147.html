<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-146"><span class="space">b.</span> Schedule F Positions</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">On October 21, 2020, President Trump issued (a now revoked) "Executive Order on Creating Schedule F in the Excepted Service." The purpose of the Executive Order 13957 was to designate categories of positions that could be taken out of competitive service hiring and removal procedures by placing them into the excepted service--more particularly, by making them confidential employees removed from adverse action appellate protections for employees defined and excluded by &#x00A7; 7511:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;This subchapter does not apply to an employee--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;whose appointment is made by and with the advice and consent of the Senate;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;whose position has been determined to be of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character by--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;the President for a position that the President has excepted from the competitive service;...</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Executive Order 13957 described the reasoning for and the types of positions to be included in Schedule F:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sec.&#x2003;1. <span class="Italic">Policy</span>. To effectively carry out the broad array of activities <span id="Page_229"></span>assigned to the executive branch under law, the President and his appointees must rely on men and women in the Federal service employed in positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character. Faithful execution of the law requires that the President have appropriate management oversight regarding this select cadre of professionals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Government benefits from career professionals in positions that are not normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition but who discharge significant duties and exercise significant discretion in formulating and implementing executive branch policy and programs under the laws of the United States. The heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) and the American people also entrust these career professionals with non-public information that must be kept confidential.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With the exception of attorneys in the Federal service who are appointed pursuant to Schedule A of the excepted service and members of the Senior Executive Service, appointments to these positions are generally made through the competitive service. Given the importance of the functions they discharge, employees in such positions must display appropriate temperament, acumen, impartiality, and sound judgment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Due to these requirements, agencies should have a greater degree of appointment flexibility with respect to these employees than is afforded by the existing competitive service process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, effective performance management of employees in confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating positions is of the utmost importance. Unfortunately, the Government's current performance management is inadequate, as recognized by Federal workers themselves. For instance, the 2016 Merit Principles Survey reveals that less than a quarter of Federal employees believe their agency addresses poor performers effectively.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Separating employees who cannot or will not meet required performance standards is important, and it is particularly important with regard to employees in confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating positions. High performance by such employees can meaningfully enhance agency operations, while poor performance can significantly hinder them. Senior agency officials report that poor performance by career employees in policy-relevant positions has resulted in long delays and substandard-quality work for important agency projects, such as drafting and issuing regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to my authority under section 3302(1) of title 5, United States Code, I find that conditions of good administration make necessary an exception to the competitive hiring rules and examinations for career positions in the Federal service of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character. These conditions include the need to provide agency heads with additional flexibility to assess prospective appointees without the limitations imposed by competitive service selection procedures. Placing these positions in the excepted service will mitigate undue limitations on their selection. This action will also give agencies greater ability and discretion to assess critical qualities in applicants to fill these positions, such as work ethic, judgment, and ability to meet the particular needs of the agency. These are all qualities individuals should have before wielding the authority inherent in their prospective positions, and agencies should be able to assess candidates without proceeding through complicated and elaborate competitive service processes or rating procedures that do not necessarily reflect their particular needs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Conditions of good administration similarly make necessary excepting such positions from the adverse action procedures set forth in chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code. Chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code, requires agencies to comply with extensive procedures before taking adverse action against an employee. These requirements can make removing poorly performing employees difficult. Only a quarter of Federal supervisors are confident that they could remove a poor performer. Career employees in confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, and policy-advocating positions wield significant influence over Government operations and effectiveness. Agencies need the flexibility to expeditiously remove poorly performing employees from these positions without facing extensive delays or litigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sec.&#x2003;2. <span class="Italic">Definition</span>. The phrase "normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition" refers to positions whose occupants are, as a matter of practice, expected to resign upon a Presidential transition and includes all positions whose appointment requires the assent of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sec.&#x2003;3. <span class="Italic">Excepted Service</span>.

<p class="Body-Text">President Trump's Executive Order was revoked by President Biden's Executive Order 14,003 (January 22, 2021), <span class="Italic">Protecting the Federal Workforce</span>. <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/27/2021-01924/protecting-the-federal-workforce">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/27/2021-01924/protecting-the-federal-workforce</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM provided instructions on implementing Schedule F in an Oct. 23, 2020, memo for agency heads:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 21, 2020, the President signed an Executive Order titled "Creating Schedule F in the Excepted Service." This Executive Order excepts from the competitive service positions that are of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character, typically filled by individuals not normally subject to replacement or change as a result of a Presidential transition. As a result of this Executive Order, such positions will be rescheduled into the newly created Schedule F and exempt from both the competitive hiring rules as well as the adverse action procedures set forth in chapter 75 of title 5 of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The terms "confidential," "policy-determining," "policy-making," and "policy-advocating" in the Executive Order are drawn from 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(2) and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(B)(i). Neither the U.S. Code nor judicial precedents precisely define these terms in the context of their statutory usage. Although the Supreme Court has generally addressed the concepts of policymaking and confidential positions for purposes of employee First Amendment rights*, no case law binds the President's particular delineation of specific characteristics within the scope of the ordinary meaning of these terms for purposes of adding positions to a new Schedule F. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(2)(A) (expressly envisioning the President excepting from the competitive service those positions that he determines "to be of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character"). In Section 5 of the order the President provided guideposts for agencies about the characteristics suggesting that a position category belongs in Schedule F, which include positions and job categories involving:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"substantive participation in the advocacy for or development or formulation of policy, especially: (A) substantive participation in the development or drafting of regulations and guidance; or (B) substantive policy-related work in an agency or agency component that primarily focuses on policy"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"the supervision of attorneys"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"substantial discretion to determine the manner in which the agency exercises functions committed to the agency by law"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"viewing, circulating, or otherwise working with proposed regulations, guidance, executive orders, or other non-public policy proposals or deliberations generally covered by deliberative process privilege and either: (A) directly reporting to or regularly working with an individual appointed by either the President or an agency head who is paid at a rate not less than that earned by employees at Grade 13 of the General Schedule; or (B) working in the agency or agency component executive secretariat (or equivalent)"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"conducting, on the agency's behalf, collective bargaining negotiations under chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Executive Order directs each agency head to review positions within his or her agency and identify those positions appropriately categorized as confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating, and then petition OPM to place those positions in Schedule F. Agencies have 90 days to conduct a preliminary review of positions and submit petitions, with an additional 120 days to finalize that review and submit any remaining petitions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The position attributes described in section 5 are guideposts; they are not determinative. Agencies may include positions based on additional characteristics not expressly specified in section 5 in their petitions, and OPM may except those positions so long as the agency demonstrates that the position is of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character. Conversely, OPM is not required to transfer positions to Schedule F simply because they fall within the section 5 guideposts. OPM retains final authority over which categories and types of positions will be placed in Schedule F.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The order further directs that all agency petitions "shall include a written explanation documenting the basis for the agency head's determination that such position[s] should be placed in Schedule F." Written explanations must demonstrate that the position's duties are policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating, or require working closely with senior officials in the case of confidential positions. That objective definition of the position's duties must be derived from a statute, regulation, or internal agency document such as the position description. To ensure placement into Schedule F satisfies procedural due process, the individualized characteristics and attributes of the particular employee encumbering a position are irrelevant to whether the underlying position or office itself is appropriately categorized into Schedule F. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Bi-Metallic Inv. Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization</span>, 239 U.S. 441, 445 (1915) (concluding, in a landmark case routinely cited regarding whether procedural due process rights apply to generalized classes, that individuals have rights to notice and a hearing only where a "relatively small number of persons [are] concerned, who [are] exceptionally <span id="Page_230"></span>affected, in each case upon individual grounds" and not where a government policy or rule is operating on a general class).</p>
