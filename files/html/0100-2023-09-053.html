<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-52"><span class="space">c.</span> Duty of Agency and Judge to Produce and Develop Evidence Concerning Timeliness</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant bears the burden of proving timely filing. But a problem that can arise in a timeliness dispute involves access to evidence--if the agency has the evidence that would demonstrate the timeliness of the appeal, yet it is not required to provide that evidence to the Board within the time allowed for the appellant to prove his appeal is timely. The problem can occur when the time for filing an appeal runs from the date of a document, e.g., an OPM reconsideration decision, and there are conflicting dates on the document that only OPM can explain. Another example is an agency's certified mail receipt showing the delivery date for an adverse action decision. If the AJ jumps into the case by issuing a show-cause order to the appellant, the appellant will be responsible for providing evidence in the control of OPM or his own agency before the respondent is required to file its administrative record with the Board. The show-cause order may close the record on timeliness well before the time permitted for appellant to initiate and conclude discovery. A sophisticated appellant, or an appellant with informed counsel, may avoid the procedural trap by requesting an extension of time to respond to the show-cause order, to permit discovery on the timeliness issue. Other appellants may essentially be defaulted because they do not have the proof necessary to show the timeliness of their appeals and because the Board dismisses their appeals as untimely before the respondents are required to file the documentary case records that contain evidence material to the timeliness issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The problem of agency control over information necessary to adjudication of timeliness issues was touched on but not resolved in <span class="Italic">May v. OPM</span>, 39 MSPR 576, 578 (1989). In <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. MSPB</span>, 75 F.3d 639, 641-67 (Fed. Cir. 1996), however, the Federal Circuit emphasized both the importance of fair notice to the appellant of the requirements for meeting a timeliness issue and the agency's burden of production of evidence that bears upon the issue--even if that evidence favors the appellant. The court determined that the agency must provide proof concerning timeliness of an appeal that depends, in part, upon proof in the agency's possession (a receipt for certified mail) of the date of delivery to appellant of a final agency decision on an EEO complaint:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Kim Hamilton worked as an Air Traffic Control Specialist for the Federal Aviation Administration ("the FAA"). In 1989, Hamilton was receiving training for her position at the Washington ARTC Center in Leesburg, Virginia. Despite completing maximum training, Hamilton was declared a training failure on April 23, 1990. Her removal was effected on May 17, 1991.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Shortly after her removal, Hamilton filed a complaint of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), alleging that her removal resulted from sex discrimination and as reprisal for two earlier filed complaints. The earlier complaints also alleged sex discrimination. The EEOC dismissed Hamilton's case because her charge of discrimination was asserted in connection with her termination, a personnel action appealable to the MSPB. As noted in its order of dismissal, under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.302(d), an individual who elects to file a mixed case, that is, one seeking to overturn an adverse personnel action on the ground of discrimination, must first proceed before the employing agency and the MSPB. Accordingly, the case was sent to the FAA for investigation and decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FAA issued a final decision on June 21, 1993, concluding that Hamilton had not been the victim of discrimination. The letter accompanying the decision correctly stated, "Within 20 days of <span class="Italic">your receipt</span> of this final decision, you have the right to appeal this decision to the [MSPB]." (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hamilton's appeal papers were mailed by certified mail to the Board on August 13, 1993. Upon receipt, the AJ issued a lengthy form letter designated an "Acknowledgement Order" containing directives to both parties on procedures to be followed, as discussed more fully hereinafter, and advising that failure to follow the AJ's orders could result in the imposition of sanctions under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.43 (1991). As part of the <span id="Page_928"></span>Order, the AJ <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> questioned the timeliness of the appeal without, however, providing information respecting the dates on which the AJ relied and ordered Hamilton to submit evidence and argument to establish that her appeal was timely or that good cause existed for the delay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hamilton timely responded to the above Order on August 30, 1993, supplying a copy of the Certified Mail receipt showing that she had mailed her appeal on August 13, 1993. However, she did not submit evidence showing when she received the FAA's decision, nor did she ask for a waiver of the time limit for good cause. The FAA filed a very brief conclusory response asserting only that Hamilton had not met her burden of proving her appeal was timely filed and requested dismissal of her case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 29, 1993, the AJ issued his decision, dismissing Hamilton's appeal for untimeliness. The AJ ruled that Hamilton had not proved when she received the FAA's decision and that it was "reasonable to presume" that appellant received it on June 26, 1993, five days after the <span class="Italic">date</span> of the decision. Under this rationale, her appeal filed on August 13, 1993, was late and he dismissed her case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon receiving the above ruling, Hamilton promptly sought to obtain a copy of the postal form from the post office showing when she signed for the copy of the FAA's decision. The post office supplied a copy showing her receipt on July 26, 1993, not June 26, 1993. She then submitted the postal form and requested the AJ to review the evidence and reinstate the appeal, arguing that the Agency had failed to act in good faith in seeking dismissal when it had the original receipt and knew, or should have known, her appeal was timely. The submission was docketed as a petition for review by the full Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FAA opposed further review on the ground that the petition did not satisfy the criteria for full board review under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115(c). Particularly, the applicable regulation provides for review where</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;New and material evidence is available that, despite due diligence, was not available when the record closed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FAA argued that the postal receipt was not new evidence within the meaning of the regulation, that it had not acted in bad faith because it was not required to respond or furnish evidence on timeliness, and that if Hamilton had needed more time to obtain the document to submit it to the AJ, she should have requested an extension of time. Also, she could have requested the postal receipt from the FAA and did not. Thus, the FAA argued, Hamilton did not exercise due diligence. The FAA never furnished the original postal receipt which it had or should have had in its file.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The full Board denied the petition for failure to meet the standard of new evidence required for its review, and this appeal followed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Merits</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having concluded that the Board may <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> raise the issue of timeliness, we, nevertheless, conclude that the Board erred in a rush to judgment against Hamilton. Upon review of the record, we conclude the procedures followed by the AJ failed to afford Hamilton a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only opportunity given Hamilton (denominated "appellant" before the Board) to establish timeliness was in response to the Acknowledgement Order ["the Order"] . That Order is directed to both parties and contained six pages of general instructions, together with six pages of enclosures. The Order provided information on the appellant's right to a hearing if requested; directed appellant to submit evidence and argument within 15 days to prove that the appeal was within the Board's jurisdiction and timely filed; directed the filing of an enclosed "Designation of Representative" form; ordered good faith negotiations for settlement and discussed procedures to enforce any agreement reached; explained and set out discovery procedures; explained the appellant's right to reply to agency motions; gave instructions on the size of paper to be used, the need for certificates on any submissions, calculations of filing dates and extensions of time; and incorporated by reference the Board's regulations in 5 CFR Parts 1201 and 1209 (not enclosed). The Agency was ordered to submit material set out in a schedule and other information required by 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.25 within 20 days of the date of the Order; to designate a representative; and to negotiate with appellant in order to define the issues, agree to stipulations, and pursue settlement of the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Order is a formidable document to digest, particularly as some of the stock paragraphs may be inapplicable. For example, there was no basis for raising a question respecting the Board's jurisdiction in this case, an issue on which the AJ ordered evidence and argument. The part of the Order related to timeliness reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">You must file an appeal with the Board within 20 days of your receipt of the agency's final decision on your discrimination complaint. 5 CFR 1201.154(b)(1). The date your appeal is postmarked is ordinarily considered the date of filing. If you personally deliver your appeal to the regional office, the date of filing is the date of receipt. If you file by facsimile, the date of filing is the date of the facsimile. Because your appeal appears to have been filed after the time limit, it may be untimely filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">You have the burden of proof on the issue of timeliness. Accordingly, I <span class="Italic">ORDER</span> you to <span class="Italic">file</span> evidence and argument showing that your appeal was timely filed or that good cause existed for the delay. Your submission must be filed within 15 days of the date of this Order. The agency may file a response on this issue within 25 days of the date of this Order. Unless I notify you to the contrary, the record on this issue will close on that date. No evidence or argument on the timeliness issue filed after the close of record will be accepted unless you show that it is new and material evidence that was unavailable before the record closed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As indicated, Hamilton timely responded to the Order with evidence showing when she filed her appeal. Given the AJ's extended explanation of what constituted the <span class="Italic">date of filing</span>, a person carefully reading the Order could reasonably conclude that the AJ was unable to determine the filing date of Hamilton's appeal. Instead of issuing another Order clarifying the ambiguity, the AJ immediately dismissed the appeal stating:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Appellant subsequently submitted documentation establishing that she filed her appeal on August 13, 1993, but she did not address her receipt of the agency's June 21, 1993, decision.[1] The Board has held that in the absence of evidence to the contrary it will presume that a document was mailed five days prior to its receipt<span class="Italic">. See Adamov v. United States Marine Corps</span>, 41 MSPB 275, 278 (1989). Here, because there is no other evidence, I find it reasonable to presume that appellant received the agency's June 21, 1993, decision on June 26, 1993. In this regard it is relevant to note that the agency's decision was sent to the same address that appellant has used in the present appeal. To be timely, appellant's appeal should therefore have been filed by July 16, 1993. The appeal eventually filed on August 13, 1993, was almost one month late.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">[1]&#x2003;In a September 21, 1993, submission the agency asserted that appellant had not met her burden on the issue of timeliness and requested that her appeal be dismissed. The agency's submission was untimely, however, and will not be considered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This ruling was error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, we reject the FAA's argument that it had no obligation to come forward with relevant evidence in its possession. While we conclude that the MSPB may place the burden of proof of timeliness on the employee, the agency may not excuse its withholding of evidence on that ground. The agency may not sit by concealing evidence that would change the result in a case. We disapprove of such gamesmanship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, before undertaking the draconian action of dismissing an appeal on a finding of untimeliness, the AJ must have sufficient evidence which at least facially establishes that fact. The AJ in this case had evidence only of the filing date, not the date of receipt which started the period running. Before dismissal, the AJ could and should have asked <span class="Italic">both</span> parties for such evidence. Further the AJ must then inform the parties of the dates on which the AJ intends to rely to support the dismissal. Only by knowing those dates before a final order is issued can an appellant make a meaningful response by way of either challenging the dates or showing good cause for the period of delay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant cannot be expected to fight a fog of generality. Here, it was not until the AJ's Order entering dismissal that the appellant could know that the AJ simply presumed the appealed decision was received by the employee five days after the date it bears. We reject the AJ's reliance on a double-barreled presumption: first, that a decision is mailed on the date it was signed and, second, that it was received by the employee within five days. Appellant then was cut off from attacking the AJ's presumption because the AJ had closed the record. Dismissal because of failure to anticipate with exactitude the problems and solutions in the mind of the AJ is not the process which is due an appellant. The AJ should have at least afforded Hamilton a further opportunity to reply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As indicated, the Order underlying the dismissal covered numerous subjects. That the Order was not <span class="Italic">fully</span> answered is insufficient grounds for dismissal where it is apparent that the appellant was making a good faith effort to comply and pursue her appeal. In <span class="Italic">Mendoza v. MSPB</span>, 966 F.2d 650, 653 (Fed. Cir. 1992) <span class="Italic">(in</span> <span class="Italic">banc)</span>, we upheld a dismissal for untimely filing, but it is significant that, in <span class="Italic">Mendoza</span>, the AJ had issued a second "show cause" order <span class="Italic">limited</span> to the issue of timeliness which specifically warned the appellant that her appeal would be dismissed unless she established timeliness, an order which was ignored. Dismissal was not upheld merely because of the broadly framed Acknowledgement Order. A "one-strike-and-you're-out" rule based on the Acknowledgement Order alone can only be characterized as arbitrary in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_929"></span>Here we do not have a case where the appellant ignored orders from the Board or an AJ. That the Board is entitled to maintain orderly procedures is clearly necessary for proper adjudication. As held in <span class="Italic">Mendoza</span>, 966 F.2d at 653:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A petitioner who ignores an order of the Administrative Judge does so at his or her peril. Litigants before the Board, whether rich or poor, whether resident abroad or in the United States, are obligated to respect the Board, its procedures, including deadlines, and the orders of the Board's judges. The doors of the tribunal are open to all claimants but only on the same terms. This is the essence of due process and equal treatment under the law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Failure to respond to an order of the Board may result in dismissal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cheguina v. MSPB</span>, 69 F.3d 1143 (Fed. Cir. 1995). In this case, however, Hamilton timely replied to the Order, albeit not in a manner which resolved the AJ's problem. Thus, Hamilton is not guilty of ignoring or disregarding a Board order or failing to prosecute, conduct for which sanctions may be imposed under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.43</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">CONCLUSION</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the regulations of the Board, the period for filing the appeal in this case began to run when the appealed decision was <span class="Italic">received.</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154. Hamilton has proffered uncontroverted evidence that she received the appealed decision on July 26, 1993. Thus, her appeal on August 13, 1993, fully met the regulation.[9] As held in <span class="Italic">Saddler v. MSPB</span>, 68 F.3d 1357 (Fed. Cir. 1995), the Board is guilty of arbitrary and capricious action in dismissing the case of an appellant who has met the requirements of the regulation in filing his or her appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;The government argues that the case should be remanded for consideration of whether Hamilton delayed unreasonably in picking up the certified mail. Under current regulations, Hamilton's appeal was timely. As held in <span class="Italic">Saddler v. MSPB</span>, 68 F.3d 1357 (Fed. Cir. 1995), whether delay was caused by the appellant's negligence is immaterial given the language of the regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The final decision of the Board is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings directed to the merits of Hamilton's removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board adopted <span class="Italic">Hamilton's</span> reasoning, <span class="Italic">Williams v. EEOC</span>, 75 MSPR 144, 148 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon reflection, however, we have concluded that <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span> represents good policy, and that it should govern this case. In <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span> the court made two major statements: Before dismissing an appeal, an administrative judge should inform an appellant of the date that a document triggering the running of the appeal period will be presumed to have been received, in the absence of direct evidence; and both parties should be ordered to produce whatever evidence they possess on timeliness. Without deciding whether either of these statements may have been <span class="Italic">dictum</span> (again, the court was presented with evidence showing that the appeal had been timely filed), we agree with and adopt both statements as standard procedure for all cases.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The responsibility of an agency to provide to the Board evidence relating to the timeliness of a mixed-case appeal was emphasized, <span class="Italic">Ray v. SBA</span>, DC-0752-13-0424-I-1 (NP 5/19/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the agency's concealment of the existence of the FAD is unacceptable. The agency representative does not dispute that she knew of the FAD at the time she filed the motion to dismiss the appeal as untimely. Rather, the agency asserts that the appellant is bound by the facts set forth in her appeal, given the appellant's failure to timely respond to the agency's motion and the administrative judge's timeliness order. If the agency had either informed the administrative judge of the FAD or provided the agency file, rather than seeking the stay from submitting its file, the administrative judge would have ruled differently with respect to the timeliness of this appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b)(1). By failing to divulge material facts concerning the FAD, the agency misled the Board. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel v. Filiberti</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 37, 39, <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 577 (1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Again, the duty of both parties to supply evidence concerning timeliness of an appeal was stressed in a mixed case, <span class="Italic">Davis v. USPS,</span> SF-0353-15-0068-I-1 (NP 7/29/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In determining whether the appellant filed her appeal late, the administrative judge relied entirely on the presumption that the appellant's representative received the FAD 5 days after the agency purportedly mailed it on February 1, 2011. However, we find no evidence in the record proving that the agency actually mailed the FAD to the appellant's representative on February 1, 2011. This lack of evidence is significant considering that the agency in this case is the United States Postal Service, the FAD was not accompanied by certification that a named individual mailed the document to the appellant's representative on February 1, 2011, and he claims to have no recollection of receiving the FAD. <span class="Italic">See Butler v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 112, &#x00B6; 10 (2013). Moreover, in the acknowledgment order, the administrative judge should have ordered <span class="Italic">both</span> parties to provide evidence and argument concerning the actual receipt date of the FAD or issued a show cause order limited to timeliness and obtained additional evidence from both parties to resolve the ambiguity regarding the actual receipt date. <span class="Italic">See Hamilton v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 75 F.3d 639, 646-47 (Fed. Cir. 1996). The Board will not simply assume that the agency mailed the FAD to the appellant and her representative on February 1, 2011, and that he received it 5 days later, because there is no specific evidence that <span class="Italic">either</span> action actually occurred. <span class="Italic">See Butler</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 112, &#x00B6; 10....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Coleman v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 88 MSPR 266, 268 &#x00B6; 6 (2001) ("Both parties, however, are obligated to produce whatever evidence they possess on timeliness, and the AJ should have ordered them to file all of the evidence that was in their possession concerning timeliness."); <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 354, 356 (1998) (Board states that it does not approve of "gamesmanship," citing <span class="Italic">Williams</span>); <span class="Italic">Highley v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 63, 65 (1998) (following <span class="Italic">Williams</span>; the case was remanded for a hearing on timeliness if factual disputes existed regarding the delivery of the Board appeal form); <span class="Italic">McVicker v. SSA</span>, 77 MSPR 324, 331 (1997) ("When timeliness is an issue, both parties should be ordered to produce whatever evidence they possess on that issue"; "[t]he agency cannot resort to 'gamesmanship' by failing to produce such evidence."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Montalvo v. USPS</span>, 91 MSPR 671, 674-75 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 11 (2002) (when mixed case provisions are implicated on an appellant's Appeal Form, albeit ambiguously, the AJ should ask both parties to submit evidence concerning timeliness before dismissing the appeal as untimely; the agency should not sit by concealing evidence that would change the result of the case).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hamilton, supra,</span> was distinguished in a Federal Circuit case essentially determining that an AJ properly places the burden of proof on the appellant with respect to timeliness, and the notice to the appellant from the AJ can be fairly general. <span class="Italic">Hubbard v. MSPB</span>, 605 F.3d 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2010). [Refer to <span class="Italic">Hubbard</span> earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-09-050.html#sec2-49">Judge's Responsibility to Provide Notice Concerning a Timeliness Issue</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to a mixed case, not only must the AJ ensure that when there is a question concerning the timeliness of an appeal the appellant knows the issues requiring a response, but the AJ must also develop the factual information presented and make factual findings on the issues determinative of the timeliness of the appeal, <span class="Italic">Whittington v. MSPB</span>, 80 F.3d 471, 475 (Fed. Cir. 1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Determining whether a mixed case appeal was timely filed requires the Board to make an initial factual finding whether the employee has filed a formal EEO complaint. However, the Board's decision is silent regarding the filing of a formal EEO complaint notwithstanding Ms. Whittington's marking "yes" in response to entry 32(b) of the Appeal Form that inquires whether she has "filed a formal discrimination complaint with [her] agency or any other agency." However, Ms. Whittington's Appeal Form does not unequivocally demonstrate she filed a formal complaint with VA because her response to questions 32(c) and 32(d) indicate she filed her complaint with EEOC, not VA, on November 5, 1993. For example, Ms. Whittington may not have filed a formal complaint, but simply mischaracterized a direct appeal to EEOC as a "formal discrimination complaint with [her] agency or <span class="Italic">any other agency</span>." Ms. Whittington also submits evidence on this appeal indicating she filed a formal EEO complaint with VA on November 11, 1993. Whether this or other evidence of a formal complaint was properly before the Board and, if so, when and where the complaint was filed is unclear because the Board is silent on this issue in both rendering its decision and acting as respondent on appeal. <span class="Italic">See, Hamilton v. MSPB</span>, 75 F.3d 639, 642 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (The Board is the respondent on an appeal of its dismissing a complaint as untimely filed). The Board's silence on this issue is quite disconcerting because Ms. Whittington's responses on the Appeal Form should have spurred the Board to further inquiry. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span>, 75 F.3d at 646 ("Before dismissal, the [Board] could and should have asked both parties for such evidence [relevant to the filing period]. We recently stated in <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span> that, "before undertaking the draconian action of dismissing an appeal on a finding of untimeliness, the [Board] must have sufficient evidence which at least facially establishes that fact." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Similarly, the Board should not have dismissed Ms. Whittington's appeal as untimely without addressing the pertinent mixed case provisions that are implicated, albeit ambiguously, on the face of Ms. Whittington's Appeal Form.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"[W]hen mixed case provisions are implicated on the face of an appellant's Appeal Form, albeit ambiguously, the administrative judge should address the issue by asking both parties to submit evidence relevant to the timeliness of the appeal before dismissing it as untimely filed." <span class="Italic">Montalvo v. USPS</span>, 91 MSPR 671, 675 &#x00B6; 11 (2002) (remanding to consider evidence of timeliness submitted with the appellant's PFR, known to the agency, when the agency created the problem by filing a motion to dismiss asserting that the appeal was untimely filed).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ should attempt to ensure that the appellant receives notice of a show cause order directing a response to a timeliness objection or issue, but the AJ's certificate of service will ordinarily prove proper service of the order, <span class="Italic">Blue v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 370, 374 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the presumption of due delivery and receipt is generally referred to as being applicable where there is direct evidence showing <span id="Page_930"></span>that a document was properly addressed, "stamped," and mailed. <span class="Italic">Shavers v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 187, 190 (1992); <span class="Italic">Pfaff</span>, 25 MSPR at 636; <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, 789 F.2d 1540, 1542 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ("a letter which is properly sealed, stamped, addressed, and deposited in the United States mails is presumed to reach the addressee and be received by him in due course of the mails"); <span class="Italic">Raphel</span>, 50 MSPR at 618 (the presumption of due receipt applies to "properly mailed" letters and notices). Thus, it may be arguable that the presumption does not apply here because the certificate of service indicates only that the document was properly addressed and "sent by regular mail," without specifying that postage was prepaid. We find, however, that a statement in a certificate of service that a document was mailed implicitly subsumes statements that the necessary steps were taken to effect the mailing, such as that the document was properly sealed, that appropriate postage was affixed or otherwise prepaid, and that the document was then deposited in the United States mails, even though it does not necessarily subsume a statement that the mailing was correctly addressed to a particular person and place. We therefore find that the lack of specific language regarding postage, in the certificate of service, does not preclude our applying the presumption.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note that lesser evidence is required to <span class="Italic">raise</span> a presumption of due delivery and receipt than is required to <span class="Italic">overcome</span> that or a similar presumption, such as a presumption that the date of mailing was the postmark date. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Pogue v. OPM</span>, 41 MSPR 693, 697 (1989) (direct evidence of appropriate mailing raises a rebuttable presumption of receipt), <span class="Italic">and</span> <span class="Italic">Pfaff</span>, 25 MSPR at 636 (a certificate of service may raise a rebuttable presumption of due delivery and receipt), <span class="Italic">with Raphel</span>, 50 MSPR at 618 (a credible and unrebutted sworn statement or affidavit is generally required to overcome a rebuttable presumption of receipt).</p>
