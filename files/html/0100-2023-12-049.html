<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-49"><span class="space">b.</span> Ineffective Counsel</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pro se</span> status of an appellant is not a basis for granting a PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Reed v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, PH-0752-10-0074-I-2 (NP 1/7/2011) ("Regarding the appellant's assertion about her inability to afford representation, we find that her lack of representation does not provide a basis for granting review."). Incompetence of one's counsel is not a basis for obtaining Board review. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sparks v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 62 MSPR 369, 371 (1994). Nor is it a basis for reopening that the appellant was incompetently represented by counsel or a union representative at the level of the regional office. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wilson v. USPS</span>, 14 MSPR 129, 130 (1982); <span class="Italic">Gibson v. USPS</span>, 14 MSPR 151, 152 (1982) (same result). <span class="Italic">Crabb v. USPS</span>, CH-0752-15-0173-I-1 (NP 9/14/2015), offered no relief based on claimed ineffective union representation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we are not persuaded by the appellant's arguments regarding ineffective representation by his union. The Board has long held that an appellant is responsible for the failings of his chosen representative. <span class="Italic">Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 667, 670 (1981). The appellant designated the union as his representative in his initial appeal form. He asserts on review that he voluntarily participated with the union in his appeal through receipt of the administrative judge's orders and participation in a conference call. Accordingly, we find that the appellant's assertions concerning the union's ineffective representation do not provide a basis for disturbing the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Hoback <span id="Page_1636"></span>v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 425, &#x00B6; 14 (2000) (finding that the appellants were responsible for any lack of documentary evidence submitted below on the issues of jurisdiction and timeliness, despite their arguments that any lack of evidence was the fault of their chosen representatives); <span class="Italic">see also Echols v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 11 M.S.P.R. 404, 406 (1982) (rejecting the appellant's assertions regarding the union's ineffective representation where the appellant acknowledged on review that he was aware of a representation problem with his union but failed to raise it below). Finally, although the appellant generally asserts that we should grant his petition in "the interests of justice," we decline to do so because he has not shown any legal error in the initial decision, <span class="Italic">see Weaver v. Department of the Navy</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 129, 134 (1980), <span class="Italic">review denied</span>, 669 F.2d 613 (9th Cir. 1982) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>), and his arguments on review provide no other basis for granting his petition.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pitts v. Shinseki</span>, 700 F.3d 1279, 1283-86 (Fed. Cir. 2012), involving an appeal from the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, considered claimed ineffective assistance of counsel:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established that, as a general matter, the constitutional right to counsel--and thus the constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel--does not attach in civil cases that do not involve the potential deprivation of a liberty interest.[2] In <span class="Italic">Lariscey v. United States</span>, 861 F.2d 1267, 1270 (Fed. Cir. 1988), this court stated that in civil proceedings, "the right to counsel is highly circumscribed, and has been authorized in exceedingly restricted circumstances." The court explained that in civil cases, a constitutional right to counsel exists, if at all, only when an indigent party "may lose his/her personal freedom if the action is lost." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Lassiter v. Dep't of Soc. Servs</span>., 452 U.S. 18, 26-27 (1981) ("[W]e...draw from [the Court's precedents] the presumption that an indigent litigant has a right to appointed counsel only when, if he loses, he may be deprived of his physical liberty."); <span class="Italic">see also Arnesen v. Principi</span>, 300 F.3d 1353, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (generally there is no right to appointed counsel for indigent civil litigants absent a potential loss of personal freedom if the action is lost).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The right to effective assistance of counsel has long been recognized in criminal proceedings, where it is grounded in the Sixth Amendment. <span class="Italic">See Strickland v. Washington</span>, 466 U.S. 668, 685-86 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the government is not constitutionally required to furnish counsel in particular proceedings, errors by private counsel are not imputed to the government. <span class="Italic">See Coleman v. Thompson</span>, 501 U.S. 722, 752-54 (1991). The client "cannot claim constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel in such proceedings"; rather, because the attorney performs in a private capacity as the client's agent, and not as a state actor, the client must "bear the risk of attorney error." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 752-53 (citation and quotation marks omitted). <span class="Italic">See also Wainwright v. Torna</span>, 455 U.S. 586, 587-88 (1982) ("Since respondent had no constitutional right to counsel, he could not be deprived of the effective assistance of counsel...."); <span class="Italic">Link v. Wabash R.R. Co</span>., 370 U.S. 626, 633-34 (1962) (When a party in a civil case voluntarily chooses his attorney as his representative, "he cannot...avoid the consequences of the acts or omissions of this freely selected agent. Any other notion would be wholly inconsistent with our system of representative litigation, in which each party is deemed bound by the acts of his lawyer-agent.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although claimants seeking federal benefits normally enjoy the right to retain counsel, whether by statute, regulation, or practice, that right does not alter the general rule that retained counsel's error is imputed to the client. This court addressed, and rejected, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in an appeal from the Merit Systems Protection Board in <span class="Italic">Bowen v. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 769 F.2d 753, 755 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The appellants in that case, federal employees who had been removed from their jobs, argued that their counsel had been ineffective in representing them before the Board, in violation of their statutory rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(3). This court rejected their claim on the ground that "[t]here is no statutory or regulatory requirement that representation be 'effective'" and that the appellants were chargeable with the acts or omissions of their chosen counsel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The same rule applies to other types of civil litigation, in both private cases and suits against the government. <span class="Italic">See Nelson v. Boeing Co</span>., 446 F.3d 1118, 1119 (10th Cir. 2006) ("The general rule in civil cases is that the ineffective assistance of counsel is not a basis for appeal or retrial. ...If a client's chosen counsel performs below professionally acceptable standards, with adverse effects on the client's case, the client's remedy is not reversal, but rather a legal malpractice lawsuit against the deficient attorney."); <span class="Italic">Slavin v. Comm'r</span>, 932 F.2d 598, 601 (7th Cir. 1991) ("There is no principle of effective assistance of counsel in civil cases. Shortcomings by counsel may be addressed in malpractice actions; they do not authorize the loser to litigate from scratch against the original adversary."); <span class="Italic">Nicholson v. Rushen</span>, 767 F.2d 1426, 1427 (9th Cir. 1985) ("Generally, a plaintiff in a civil case has no right to effective assistance of counsel. ...This rule is based on the presumption that, unless the indigent litigant may lose his physical liberty if he loses the litigation, there is generally no right to counsel in a civil case."); <span class="Italic">Watson v. Moss</span>, 619 F.2d 775, 776 (8th Cir. 1980) ("There is no constitutional or statutory right for an indigent to have counsel appointed in a civil case. ...It of course follows there is no constitutional or statutory right to effective assistance of counsel in a civil case.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even in benefits proceedings in which courts have recognized a due process right to have the assistance of retained counsel during the proceedings, it does not necessarily follow that the party has a constitutional right to effective assistance on the part of that chosen counsel. <span class="Italic">See Mekdeci v. Merrell Nat'l Labs</span>., 711 F.2d 1510, 1522-23 &#x0026; n.19 (11th Cir. 1983) (right to retain counsel does not "encompass any assurance that the counsel retained will be effective"). In <span class="Italic">Goldberg v. Kelly</span>, 397 U.S. 254 (1970), the Supreme Court held that a claimant who was at risk of losing child welfare benefits must be allowed to retain an attorney for the termination proceedings. The Court was careful to add, however, that the claimant was not entitled to have counsel appointed, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 270-71, and it did not recognize a right to effective assistance in proceedings for welfare benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Pitts acknowledges that the doctrine of ineffective assistance of counsel is generally not recognized in civil cases. However, he relies on a line of immigration decisions in which a number of courts of appeals have held that the Due Process Clause provides some level of protection against ineffective assistance of counsel in removal (i.e., deportation) proceedings, even though the alien is not constitutionally entitled to the appointment of counsel in such proceedings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Contreras v. Att'y Gen</span>., 665 F.3d 578, 584 (3d Cir. 2012); <span class="Italic">Nehad v. Mukasey</span>, 535 F.3d 962, 967 (9th Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">Zeru v. Gonzalez</span>, 503 F.3d 59, 72 (1st Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">Tang v. Ashcroft,</span> 354 F.3d 1192, 1196 (10th Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">United States v. Perez</span>, 330 F.3d 97, 101 (2d Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Huicochea-Gomez v. INS,</span> 237 F.3d 696, 699 (6th Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno</span>, 178 F.3d 1139, 1146 (11th Cir. 1999). Several courts of appeals have taken a contrary view, holding that where there is no constitutional right to the appointment of counsel a party may not obtain relief because of inadequacies in the performance of his chosen counsel, even in immigration cases. <span class="Italic">See Rafiyev v. Mukasey</span>, 536 F.3d 853, 861 (8th Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">Afanwi v. Mukasey</span>, 526 F.3d 788, 796-99 (4th Cir. 2008), <span class="Italic">vacated and remanded</span>, 130 S. Ct. 350 (2009); <span class="Italic">Magala v. Gonzales</span>, 434 F.3d 523, 525 (7th Cir. 2005). However, even assuming the position taken by the majority of circuits on that issue is correct, the rationale of those cases does not extend to veterans' benefits claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Removal proceedings implicate an individual's liberty; they are not confined to affecting only property interests. The Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Bridges v. Wixon</span>, 326 U.S. 135, 154 (1945), explained that in deportation cases, "the liberty of an individual is at stake" because deportation this land of freedom." Following <span class="Italic">Bridges</span>, courts that have recognized a right to effective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings have found that right to be grounded in the substantial liberty interest that is at stake. <span class="Italic">See Fadiga v. Att'y Gen</span>., 488 F.3d 142, 157 &#x0026; n.23 (3d Cir. 2007) ("the liberty of an individual is at stake in deportation proceedings"); <span class="Italic">Saakian v. INS</span>, 252 F.3d 21, 24 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting <span class="Italic">Bridges</span>); <span class="Italic">Huicochea-Gomez v. INS</span>, 237 F.3d at 699 (aliens claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must "explain how their liberty interests have been violated"); <span class="Italic">Iavorski v. INS</span>, 232 F.3d 124, 128 (2d Cir. 2000) (quoting <span class="Italic">Bridges</span>); <span class="Italic">Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno</span>, 178 F.3d at 1146 (deportation proceeding implicates an alien's liberty interest); <span class="Italic">see also Nelson v. Boeing Co</span>., 446 F.3d at 1120 (citing <span class="Italic">Mejia Rodriguez</span>); <span class="Italic">Nicholson v. Rushen</span>, 767 F.2d at 1427 (noting the presumption that absent a risk of loss of liberty, due process does not give rise to a right to the effective assistance of counsel). The line of cases involving the removal of aliens is therefore readily distinguishable from cases involving social security benefits, welfare benefits, and federal employment, where no such liberty interest is implicated and where the courts, accordingly, have not recognized a constitutional right to either the appointment of counsel or the effective assistance of counsel.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The Supreme Court has not resolved the conflict over whether there is a right to the effective assistance of retained counsel in immigration removal cases, and it is open to question whether the right to effective assistance of counsel attaches in civil cases whenever a liberty interest is at stake. <span class="Italic">See Stroe v. INS</span>, 256 F.3d 498, 500 (7th Cir. 2001) (as a general rule there is no right to effective assistance of counsel in civil cases "even when the proceeding though nominally civil involves liberty or even life, as in a capital habeas corpus case"). Because there is no liberty interest at stake in this case, we need not decide whether, or to what extent, the right to effective assistance of counsel applies in civil cases in which some liberty interest is implicated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Pitts argues that the interests at stake in a veteran's disability benefits claim are sufficiently important to the claimant that such cases should be treated like removal proceedings, and not like other civil cases involving only property interests. Without denigrating the importance of benefits to claimants in the veterans' benefits system, we are not persuaded that such benefits are categorically different from, for example, social security <span id="Page_1637"></span>disability payments, welfare assistance, or other benefit programs as to which the courts have never recognized a right to the effective assistance of counsel as a component of due process, either in the agency proceedings themselves or, as in this case, in judicial review of the agency decisions. Indeed, the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Walters v. National Ass'n of Radiation Survivors</span>, 473 U.S. 305 (1985), stated that veterans have a "property interest in the continued receipt of Government benefits" and that "the benefits at stake in VA proceedings, which are not granted on the basis of need, are more akin to the Social Security benefits involved in <span class="Italic">Mathews</span> [<span class="Italic">v. Eldridge</span>, 424 U.S. 319 (1976)] than they are to the welfare payments on which the recipients in <span class="Italic">Goldberg</span> [<span class="Italic">v. Kelly</span>, 397 U.S. 254 (1970)] depended for their daily subsistence." 473 U.S. at 332-33. And even though the Court in <span class="Italic">Walters</span> characterized <span class="Italic">Goldberg</span> as presenting a more compelling case of need than is generally present in cases involving veterans' benefits, the Court, as noted, held that even in the <span class="Italic">Goldberg</span> setting, a claimant is not entitled to have counsel appointed, 397 U.S. at 270-71, and it did not recognize any constitutionally based claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we hold that the right to the effective assistance of counsel does not apply to proceedings before the CAVC. In determining the scope of the constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel in civil cases, the courts have consistently held that where only property interests are at stake, there is no due process right to the effective assistance of counsel, regardless of how unique or important the property rights in question may be. Proceedings in veterans' benefits cases are of course important to the claimants, but they are directed at the adjudication of property claims, not liberty interests. Based on that distinction, and the long line of precedents refusing to extend the constitutional right to counsel to benefits proceedings of that type, we reject Mr. Pitts's contention that he is entitled to relief on appeal based on what he characterizes as ineffective assistance by his lawyer while representing him before the CAVC.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to application of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, if the first Board disposition is <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> as to the second appeal, the bar is not avoided by an allegation of inadequate representation in the first case. <span class="Italic">Grande v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 47 MSPR 403, 405-06 (1991). <span class="Italic">Pro se</span> status does not defeat collateral estoppel. <span class="Italic">Jackson v.
