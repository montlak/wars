<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Botello v. DOJ</span>, 76 MSPR 117, 123-24 (1997), stated as to USERRA claims concerning the failure to secure appointment to an executive agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Under the statute, a person may submit an appeal against a federal executive agency alleging discrimination on the basis of prior military service directly to the Board, or he may submit such an appeal to the Board after he has filed a complaint with the Secretary of Labor, and proceedings there are exhausted. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 USC 4324(b)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McAfee v. SSA</span>, 88 MSPR 4, 8-10 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-16 (2001), elaborated on USERRA nonappointment claims:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under USERRA, the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal of "any person" alleging discrimination in federal employment on account of prior military service<span class="Italic">. See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303(4)(A)(ii), 4311(a), 4324(b); <span class="Italic">Petersen v. Department of the Interior</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 227, 231-40 (1996). USERRA applies to employment with the federal government, <span class="Italic">Petersen</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 232, and states that "[a] person who...has performed...service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment...on the basis of that...performance of service." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a); <span class="Italic">see Duncan v. United States Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 86, 90 (1997). Under the statute, a person may submit an appeal against a federal executive agency alleging discrimination on the basis of prior military service directly to Board, or he may submit such an appeal to the Board after he has filed a complaint with DoL, and proceedings there are exhausted<span class="Italic">. See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b). Unlike VEOA, USERRA does not impose a time limit for filing an action before the Board<span class="Italic">. See Watkins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 141, 116-8 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant stated in his petition for appeal that he was claiming "discrimination based on disparate treatment...[and] disparate impact," and that the agency had not met its affirmative action obligations with respect to disabled veterans such as himself. He further stated that he would present "a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate treatment discrimination" by the agency's Denver office based on his status as a disabled veteran and as a male. He further alleged that he "was treated differently than other applicants" for the Attorney Advisor positions he unsuccessfully sought, and that the agency's explanation of its reasons for denying his request to be reassigned from Salt Lake City to Denver (made to an equal employment opportunity counselor) were an "obvious pretext to discrimination." Reading his petition for appeal as a whole, and bearing in mind the principle that "a claim of discrimination under USERRA should be broadly and liberally construed in determining whether it is nonfrivolous," <span class="Italic">Perkins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 545, 15 (2000), we hold that the AJ erred in concluding that jurisdiction did not lie under USERRA without first allowing the appellant to develop his allegations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Admittedly the appellant did not expressly invoke USERRA in his petition for appeal, but he was not required to do so<span class="Italic">. See Martir v. Department of the Navy</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 421, 16 (1999). Furthermore, some of the appellant's claims clearly fall outside USERRA's coverage. For example, USERRA does not allow the Board to adjudicate the appellant's sex discrimination claim<span class="Italic">. See Bodus v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 508 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-17 (1999).... [W]e have no grounds to conclude that USERRA permits us to consider the appellant's claim that the agency did not comply, with its Disabled Veterans Affirmative Action Program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Still, the appellant alleged more than just a violation of veterans' preference rules, as found by the AJ. In particular, his claim that the agency discriminated against him because he is a disabled veteran is cognizable under USERRA<span class="Italic">. See Jasper v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 367, 369 (1997). Accordingly, the appeal must be remanded to allow the appellant to develop that claim.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We acknowledge that the appellant's claim that the agency discriminated against him is weakened by the fact that the agency selected him for an Attorney Advisor position twice, once for a position in Denver and once for a position in Salt Lake City. Nonetheless, the Board's assessment of the relative weakness of allegations initially made in a USERRA claim is not a basis for dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. See Duncan</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 92. Furthermore, although the AJ was correct that USERRA does not authorize the Board to adjudicate a claim of discrimination based on disability alone, <span class="Italic">McBride v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 411, 415 (1998), we interpret the appellant's petition for appeal as alleging that the agency discriminated against him based on his status as a disabled veteran.</p>

Office of Personnel Management</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 7 (2002). USERRA, however, provides that a person who performs or has performed uniformed military service "shall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment" because of his military service. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a); <span class="Italic">McAfee v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">A claim under USERRA should be broadly and liberally construed in determining whether it is nonfrivolous. <span class="Italic">Tindall v. Department of the Army</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 230, &#x00B6; 6 (1999). The weakness of the assertions in support of the claim is not a basis to dismiss the USERRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> "Rather, if the appellant fails to develop his contentions, his USERRA claim should be denied on its merits." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that the appellant performed duty in the uniformed service. Additionally, USERRA encompasses the denial of initial employment based upon an individual's military service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the appellant continues to argue that his military service prevented him from applying for the position at an earlier time, we agree with the administrative judge that this assertion does not establish USERRA jurisdiction. With respect to this claim, the appellant did not allege that the <span class="Italic">agency</span> took or failed to take any action based upon his military status or obligations. <span class="Italic">See Lazard v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 337, &#x00B6; 5 (2003). Rather, he contended that <span class="Italic">he</span> could not apply sooner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the appellant also alleged that he believed it was possible that his military status was a factor in the agency's decision not to proceed with his application. With respect to that allegation, the appellant has satisfied USERRA's jurisdictional requirements. <span class="Italic">See Duncan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 86, 92 (1997) (the Board had jurisdiction over the appellant's claim that the agency refused to employ him due to his prior military service), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Fox v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 381 (2001). Accordingly, the USERRA appeal should not have been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, and remand is appropriate. <span class="Italic">Duncan</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 94-95 (remanding a USERRA appeal for further development of the record and adjudication on the merits where the administrative judge had improperly dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because jurisdiction has been established, on remand, the appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that his military status was at least a motivating or substantial factor in the agency's decision to deny the appellant initial employment. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The appellant may meet this burden by using direct or indirect evidence. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1014. Discriminatory motivation under USERRA may be reasonably inferred from such circumstantial evidence as temporal proximity between the appellant's military activity and the adverse employment action, "inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer, an employer's expressed hostility towards members protected by the statute together with knowledge of the [individual's] military activity, and disparate treatment of certain [individuals] compared to other [individuals] with similar work records or offenses." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> If the appellant meets his burden, the burden shifts to the agency to prove that legitimate reasons, standing alone, would have induced it to take the same action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant has not established that his military status was a motivating or substantial factor for the agency's failure to hire him. Nevertheless, because the administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, the record was not sufficiently developed for the Board to determine whether the appellant would be able to do so.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Williams v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 2008 MSPB 92 &#x00B6; 7 (2008) (applicant for position: "[t]he weakness of the assertions in support of the claim is not a basis to dismiss the USERRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction"). <span class="Italic">But see Ward v. FCC</span>, 58 Fed. Appx. 517, 520 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP) (affirming rejection of a conclusory claim that the appellant's status as a veteran was a motivating or a substantial factor in the agency's discretionary decision to fill a position through merit promotion rather than through a competitive procedure that would have permitted consideration of the appellant).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant must be qualified for the position sought to prevail in a USERRA discrimination appeal, <span class="Italic">Jolley v. DHUD</span>, AT-3330-17-0060-I-1 (NP 5/20/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[E]ven if the appellant did establish Board jurisdiction, he failed to prove that his military service was a substantial or motivating factor in his <span id="Page_530"></span>nonselection because he did not dispute the agency's evidence that he failed in his application to include evidence that he possessed specific, specialized experience overseeing disaster preparedness and recovery as required by the vacancy announcements and that, as a result, he was deemed not qualified for the position. <span class="Italic">Heckman v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Both appellants relied on circumstantial evidence to establish discrimination. The administrative judge in Fahrenbacher's appeal determined that he had not established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. We need not determine whether the appellants established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination based on prior military service because, based on the fully developed record in these appeals, we find that they did not carry their ultimate burden of proving that the agency failed to select them on the basis of their prior military service. 38 USC &#x00A7; 4311(a); <span class="Italic">cf. Jackson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 79 MSPR 46, 50-54 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In explaining its reasons for not placing the appellants in the primary group of applicants, all of whom had OGC experience, the agency placed great importance on that experience, although competition was not limited to OGC employees and the vacancy announcement did not state that OGC experience was a requirement. The position at the NTC was to be the only OGC attorney position at that location and for that reason the agency wanted an individual who was familiar with OGC procedures. As it turned out, all of the applicants in the primary group were current OGC attorneys and the applications of the applicants in the secondary group received no further consideration. Looking at the evidence in these appeals generally, we note here that two of the primary group applicants were veterans of the Navy JAG Corps. Additionally, we note that Densmore was a former Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) and was a reserve officer in the Army JAG Corps as of the date of the Sheehan hearing. He testified that he had selected veterans to fill OGC positions in the past. Phelps also testified that he served in the military and that OGC employed numerous attorneys with prior military service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish discrimination, the appellants must show that they were treated more harshly than non-veterans. The fact that they were not treated better than non-veterans does not show discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants argued that the agency's proffered reason was pretextual because their experience was the equivalent of or better than that of the candidate selected. They argue that their lengthy legal careers with the military were not afforded the proper weight under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 302.302(d). However, there is no evidence in the record to show that their experience was not considered or that the number of years of experience of any candidate was a factor in making the selection. According to Densmore's testimony, he was looking for extensive experience in the areas of law required by the position. The fact that, for example, an applicant had 20 years of experience in health care law, expertise not necessary for the position, did not make him more qualified than an applicant with 3 years of relevant procurement law experience.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we must analyze the requirements of the position, as applied to the relative qualifications of Vlahos and the two appellants. We note here that the relevant evidence is the information that the agency's decision makers had before them when they chose Vlahos. Any further explanation of their qualifications that was not readily discernible to Densmore and Miron from their applications is not relevant. We further note that our task is not to determine who among the applicants we would have selected as best qualified, but only whether the appellants' veterans status was a motivating factor in the agency's decision not to select them. <span class="Italic">See Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 259, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed.2d 207 (1981). Both appellants have impressive resumes, including their lengthy service as Staff Judge Advocates (SJA) and LL.M. degrees in health care law. However, the issue is whether, in view of their qualifications as set forth in their applications, the agency's reasons for not selecting them are pretextual and the real reason is their prior military service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the position description for the GS-14 position, the incumbent must be qualified to provide legal assistance and advice on business, commercial, administrative, and environmental law, and civilian personnel and fiscal policy matters; review decisions of the Board, the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and draft appellate briefs for filing in these fora; advise on procurement matters; provide liaison with local, state, and federal environmental agencies and defend the agency in environmental actions; provide legal advice in regard to government ethics laws and regulations, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), and Privacy Act matters; be responsible for litigation in various fora; and manage the OGC at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center. The position description further indicates that the position requires extensive knowledge of relevant law and extensive experience representing the government before various administrative and judicial fora, particularly with regard to civilian personnel and acquisition matters. Experience dealing with top management officials in understanding management problems and in presenting solutions and knowledge of the functions, relationships, and methods of operation of the agency and the military departments are required.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Vlahos's qualifications</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The individual selected for the position, Georgia Vlahos, was a GS-13 attorney with the OGC component at the Great Lakes Public Works Center located adjacent to the NTC. Vlahos's immediate supervisor at the Public Works Center was Tim Hyland, whose supervisor was Densmore. Thus, in addition to her application and writing sample, Densmore had direct personal knowledge of her duties and the level of her performance in that position. She stated on her SF-171 that, as Associate Counsel at the Public Works Center, she reviewed construction, architect-engineer, and facilities support solicitations for form and legal sufficiency, defended the agency in bid protests before the General Accounting Office (GAO), assisted in defending and settling claims before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals, defended the agency in EEOC proceedings, and advised on civilian personnel, environmental, procurement, fiscal, FOIA, and Privacy Act issues. She served in that capacity for approximately 2 1/2 years before being selected for the position at issue here. Prior to that, she practiced in the private sector where she participated in general civil litigation and real estate transactions. Her writing sample was a letter written in response to a request from the GAO for a report on a bid protest involving the Naval Facilities Engineering Command.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Appellant Fahrenbacher's qualifications</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant Fahrenbacher submitted a copy of the package that he sent to the agency to apply for the position, including a cover letter, his SF-171 application, his resume, and a writing sample. This is the material that Densmore and Miron considered when they placed him in the secondary group. They did not interview the members of the secondary group. According to his SF-171, after he retired from the Navy in 1995, he became a GS-12 Attorney-Advisor with the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA), responsible for medical malpractice claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act, representing DVA before the Board and the EEOC, providing written legal opinions on a wide range of health law issues, and drafting internal operating policies for department use. Prior to his retirement from the military, he was the Director of Legal Services at the Great Lakes Naval Hospital from 1991 to 1995, the sole legal advisor to the Commanding officer on hospital law, medicare/medicaid reimbursements, contracts, employment law, medical staff issues, administrative law, military and civilian criminal law, medical malpractice and tort law, Medical Care Recovery Act and "affirmative claims, JCAH accreditation and general civil law." From 1975 until 1991, he served in the JAG Corps and as a military judge. According to his descriptions of his various responsibilities during that service, he had experience with military criminal law, Federal Tort Claims Act litigation, and health care law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Densmore testified that OGC experience was a significant factor in his decision, even though competition was not limited to current OGC employees. The position required knowledge of the full range of OGC responsibilities and the incumbent would be the sole OGC attorney at NTC. His review of appellant Fahrenbacher's application showed that the bulk of his experience was in health law and military justice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that Densmore's assessment of appellant Fahrenbacher's application does not show that his reasons for not placing Fahrenbacher in the primary group of applicants or selecting him were pretextual. We note that the relatively brief cover letter contained two typographical errors. The appellant stated that he had diverse legal experience in the areas of "MSPD" law and "invironmental" law, two of the areas of legal experience the vacancy announcement sought. Such errors, while minor, <span id="Page_531"></span>do not contribute to a positive first impression. The application did not indicate the depth and range of experience that Densmore sought. We note that Fahrenbacher's resume emphasizes his experience in criminal law by underlining. Although appellant Fahrenbacher indicated in his application materials that he had experience in representing DVA before the Board and the EEOC in his position as GS-12 attorney, he had been in that position only about 1 year when he applied for the Navy Counsel to the Commander position and had other responsibilities not relevant to the GS-14 position at issue here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant Fahrenbacher indicated in his resume that he possessed "in-depth knowledge of...environmental law" but none of his descriptions of the duties of his positions refer to any environmental law function. He does not otherwise identify the source of his indepth knowledge. His resume and application do not reflect any particular expertise in legal ethics, FOIA, or Privacy Act issues. While he stated that he reviewed all contracts at the Great Lakes Naval Hospital, he does not indicate that such contracts required extensive expertise in applying the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Act or the Federal Acquisitions Regulations and in representing the agency in bid protests or contract litigation. Similarly, his description of his experience at the Great Lakes Naval Hospital does not indicate that he has in-depth knowledge of commercial or business law. His application does not indicate that he had any experience drafting pleadings for court or experience in court other than courts martial. We note that, although the SF-171 form advises applicants to write the approximate percentage of time spent performing each duty, the appellant did not do so. His description of his duties before his assignment to the Great Lakes Naval Hospital does not include any reference to the relevant areas of law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant provided the agency with a writing sample to aid in the evaluation of his qualifications for the position. The writing sample is a paper in the form of a law review article entitled "Discrimination Against Foreign Medical Graduates." The article discusses briefly the application of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and describes even more briefly the procedure applicable to employees of the private sector under Federal discrimination statutes. While the article is a good example of his legal writing ability, little of the information in the article is relevant to Federal personnel law and the submission does not otherwise demonstrate expertise in a relevant field of law. In contrast, Vlahos's writing sample demonstrated not only her writing ability but also her ability to analyze the legal issues that she would face in the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on all of the above, we find that appellant Fahrenbacher has not shown that the agency's reason for not selecting him was based on his prior military service. 38 USC &#x00A7; 4311(a). Most of his experience was in health law and military criminal practice, which are outside the responsibilities of the position. He did not demonstrate extensive expertise in business law, environmental law, procurement, government ethics, FOIA and Privacy Act, and preparation of appellate pleadings. The evidence shows that more likely than not, the agency's stated reason was the real reason. Moreover, appellant Fahrenbacher has not shown that his prior military service was the real reason that he was not placed in the primary group of applicants and selected for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Appellant Sheehan's qualifications</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant Sheehan also submitted an SF-171, a resume, and writing samples to the agency in response to the vacancy announcement. Appellant Sheehan is also a retired SJA. According to his SF-171 and resume, since his retirement, he has worked for the state of Wisconsin, Bureau of Health Care Financing, as Chief, Medical Consultant and Audit Section, on matters related to Medicare and Medicaid. His last assignment as an SJA was to the NTC, where, according to his SF-171, he advised the Commander on diverse matters, including "contracts, claims, investigations, litigation, labor relations, occupational safety, equal opportunity, ethics, environmental matters, and regulatory interpretation and compliance." Before that, and after he completed an LL.M. degree program in Health Law, he was responsible for advising various agency components on health law issues. In the early part of his career as an SJA, he represented both sides in criminal matters, conducted administrative hearings, and represented respondents before administrative discharge and disability boards. His writing sample consists of letters written to Medicare or Medicaid benefits claimants, their representatives, a member of the Wisconsin legislature, and a member of Congress, and a letter of reference for a co-worker. Appellant Sheehan also included with his application a page from a fitness evaluation report, with no date or attribution, which describes his duties as participating in numerous courts martial, responsibility for the NTC Hotline, advising and assisting on environmental issues and contract issues, and various other responsibilities not here relevant. Sheehan did not indicate on his SF-171 the percentage of time he spent on any particular area of law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Densmore testified that he did not select appellant Sheehan for the best qualified list because his SF-171 was handwritten and sloppy, his writing samples were not legal writings, and he had not been employed as an attorney since his retirement from the Navy in July 1993, over 3 years prior to the posting of the vacancy announcement. Densmore further stated that he had limited personal knowledge of the work that Sheehan did in NTC, but believed that he worked on matters involving the Uniform Code of Military Justice. According to Densmore, the duties of the SJA and the OGC attorney were distinctly separate. Densmore also considered that Sheehan's area of specialization was health care law, an area not generally within the purview of OGC. Densmore also stated that the position required knowledge of procurement regulations and procedures, that he himself provided support in these areas for NTC, that therefore appellant Sheehan had not, and that he did not demonstrate knowledge in that area. Densmore also stated that Sheehan's assertion that he had responsibility for the Inspector General program at NTC did not indicate knowledge of procurement law because Densmore believed that that function was performed by the acquisition specialists in a Procurement Management Review. Nor did Sheehan's internal review or audit review function indicate to Densmore that Sheehan was knowledgeable about procurement issues because such responsibility would not generally involve expertise in the Federal Acquisition Act. Furthermore, Densmore testified that he himself provided support to NTC for contract and acquisition work. As for Sheehan's expertise in environmental law, according to Densmore, the OGC Counsel at the adjacent Public Works Center provided any necessary advice on environmental law issues to NTC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that Sheehan has not shown that the agency's reasons for not placing him in the primary group of applicants and selecting him were pretextual. His description of his duties did not indicate to Densmore that he had the level of expertise in procurement and environmental law that the position required. Densmore's opinion was necessarily influenced by his personal knowledge of the functions of the Public Works Center attorney in relation to NTC and the fact that he himself provided support to NTC in contract and acquisition matters. Further, Sheehan's writing samples did not provide Densmore with additional information about the extent of Sheehan's expertise in relevant areas of the law. Densmore's conclusions drawn from Sheehan's application are borne out by Sheehan's testimony. When asked about specific responsibilities, he acknowledged that he did not review contract claims or perform a high volume of contract administrative work. He had no Federal court experience while at NTC and no appearances before the Board or EEOC. He did not deal with bid protests before the Comptroller General or participate in hearings before the Board of Contract Appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although his resume indicates experience at NTC in labor relations, he did not indicate any experience with the FLRA. The administrative judge stated that Sheehan had been involved in the resolution of "sensitive sexual harassment, misconduct, fraternization, and other personnel cases." That language comes from the fitness evaluation report which indicates that those matters involved military personnel. As such, the fitness evaluation report does not demonstrate expertise in the procedural requirements of actions before the Board or the EEOC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reiterate that our function here is not to determine whether the agency chose the best applicant or whether we would have chosen Vlahos over appellant Sheehan. We only address the issue of whether Sheehan has proven that the agency discriminated against him on the basis of his prior military experience. The administrative judge found that the evidence, as evaluated by him, showed that such discrimination occurred. For the reasons stated above, we disagree with his analysis of the evidence and his conclusion. While appellant Sheehan possesses impressive qualifications, he did not show that he performed the full range of legal duties in the NTC while he served there as an SJA. Nor did he otherwise demonstrate that Densmore's evaluation of his application was affected by his veterans status.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed, requiring that the employee show by preponderant evidence that the employee's military service was "a substantial or motivating factor" in the challenged employment action, subject to the employer's opportunity to show by preponderant evidence that the employer would have taken the same action anyway, for a valid reason. Under <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009, 1012-15 (Fed. Cir. 2001), analysis based on circumstantial evidence includes "a variety of factors, including proximity in time between the employee's military activity and the adverse employment action, inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer, an employer's expressed hostility toward members protected by the statute together with knowledge of the employee's military activity, and disparate treatment of certain employees compared to other employees with similar work records or offenses":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The USERRA was enacted in congressional response to the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Monroe v. Standard Oil Co.</span>, 452 U.S. 549 (1981), wherein the Court held that the USERRA's antecedent, the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, "was enacted for the significant but limited purpose of protecting the employee-reservist against discriminations...motivated solely by reserve status." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 559. The Court concluded that liability for violation of the statute could not be <span id="Page_532"></span>found unless the employee's reserve status was the sole motivation for the discriminatory conduct. The 1994 enactment broadened the statute by providing that a violation occurs when a person's military service is a "motivating factor" in the discriminatory action, even if not the sole factor. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(c)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The 1994 enactment also confirmed "that the standard of proof in a discrimination or retaliation case is the so-called 'but-for' test and that the burden of proof is on the employer, once [the employee's] case is established," the legislative history citing the procedures and allocation of burdens of proof for actions under the National Labor Relations Act as discussed by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Bd. v. Transportation Management Corp.</span>, 462 U.S. 393, 401 (1983) (modified by <span class="Italic">Office of Workers' Compensation v. Greenwich Collieries</span>, 512 U.S. 267 (1994)). H.R. Rep. No. 65, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 24 (1994), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1994 USCCAN at 2457; S. Rep. No. 158, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 45 (1994); <span class="Italic">see also Gummo</span>, 75 F.3d at 105-06 (discussing legislative history); <span class="Italic">Peterson</span>, 71 MSPR at 239-240 (same). Thus the USERRA provides that even if prohibited discrimination was a factor, the employer does not violate the statute if "the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of [military status]." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(c)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Precedent interpreting and applying the USERRA is sparse. Those courts that have applied it, as well as the MSPB, have implemented the legislative intent to adopt the <span class="Italic">Transportation Management</span> evidentiary scheme for cases arising under the National Labor Relations Act.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The procedures established by precedent require an employee making a USERRA claim of discrimination to bear the initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee's military service was "a substantial or motivating factor" in the adverse employment action.[3] <span class="Italic">See Transportation Management</span>, 462 U.S. at 400-01.

Corp.,</span> 134 F.3d 1307, 1314 (7th Cir. 1998) (explaining that <span class="Italic">Greenwich Collieries</span> makes clear that <span class="Italic">Wright</span> Line "analysis does not simply require...a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. [The employee] must establish that [discriminatory] animus was a motivating factor in the decision."); <span class="Italic">Southwest Merchandising Corp. v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The factual question of discriminatory motivation or intent may be proven by either direct or circumstantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See FPC Holdings, Inc</span>., 64 F.3d at 492 ("Motive may be demonstrated by circumstantial as well as direct evidence and is a factual issue which the expertise of the Board [NLRB] is peculiarly suited to determine."); <span class="Italic">Matson Terminals</span>, 115 F.3d at 303-04; <span class="Italic">see also Kumferman v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 785 F.2d 286, 290 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (intent is a question of fact to be found by the MSPB). Circumstantial evidence will often be a factor in these cases, for discrimination is seldom open or notorious. Discriminatory motivation under the USERRA may be reasonably inferred from a variety of factors, including proximity in time between the employee's military activity and the adverse employment action, inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer, an employer's expressed hostility towards members protected by the statute together with knowledge of the employee's military activity, and disparate treatment of certain employees compared to other employees with similar work records or offenses. <span class="Italic">Cf. W.F. Bolin Co. v. Nat'l Labor Relations Bd.</span>, 70 F.3d 863, 871 (6th Cir. 1995). In determining whether the employee has proven that his protected status was part of the motivation for the agency's conduct, all record evidence may be considered, including the agency's explanation for the actions taken.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the employee has met this burden, the burden shifts to the employer to prove the affirmative defense that legitimate reasons, standing alone, would have induced the employer to take the same adverse action. <span class="Italic">Transportation Management</span>, 462 U.S. at 400; <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span>, 429 U.S. at 285-86. This applies to both so-called "dual motive" cases (in which the agency defends on the ground that, even if an invalid reason played a part in the adverse action, the same action would have been taken in the absence of the invalid reason) and so-called "pretext" cases (in which the agency defends on the ground that it acted only for a valid reason). <span class="Italic">See Holo-Krome</span>, 954 F.2d at 110-11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The procedural framework and evidentiary burdens set out in &#x00A7; 4311, as explained in <span class="Italic">Transportation Management</span> for NLRB rulings, are different from those in discrimination cases under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-2(a)(1), as described in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), and subsequent decisions. <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, while allocating the burden of production of evidence, does not shift the burden of persuasion to the employer. <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Labor Relations Bd. v. Weiss Memorial Hospital</span>, 172 F.3d 432, 442 (7th Cir. 1999) (contrasting <span class="Italic">Wright Line</span> with "the shifting burdens of production under the ubiquitous <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis, which is merely a method for ordering the proof"); <span class="Italic">Walker v. Mortham</span>, 158 F.3d 1177, 1184-85 n.10 (11th Cir. 1998), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 528 U.S. 809 (1999) (distinguishing the employer's burden to prove its affirmative defense under the NLRA from the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas prima facie</span> case, which shifts the burden of production but not the risk of nonpersuasion).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus in USERRA actions there must be an initial showing by the employee that military status was at least a motivating or substantial factor in the agency action, upon which the agency must prove, by a preponderance of evidence, that the action would have been taken despite the protected status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants claim that the MSPB erred in not applying the criteria outlined in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> and recently clarified in <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc.</span>, 530 U.S. 133, 120 S. Ct. 2097 (2000). We do not agree. As discussed above, the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> criteria differ from the statutory burdens set out in the USERRA and the National Labor Relations Act. Although there may be some overlap in proof of discrimination claims under either framework, the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Reeves</span> expressly deals with the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework, and does not require any change in the standard codified in the USERRA and explained in <span class="Italic">Transportation Management. See Reeves</span>, 530 U.S. at 142, 120 S. Ct. at 2105 ("Because the parties do not dispute the issue, we shall assume, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework is fully applicable here.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial burden on the appellants was to establish that their military service was a motivating factor in their non-selection. In Mr. Sheehan's case the administrative judge, hearing witnesses and making credibility determinations, found that this initial burden was met, and that the agency did not establish that it would have taken the same non-selection action absent Mr. Sheehan's military service. In Mr. Fahrenbacher's case the administrative judge found that this initial burden was not met. Reviewing these two decisions, the full Board held that the appellants "did not carry their ultimate burden of proving that the agency failed to select them on the basis of their prior military service." The Board thus sustained the administrative judge's decision in Mr. Fahrenbacher's case, and reversed the administrative judge in Mr. Sheehan's case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board stated that its task was to determine "whether the appellants' veterans status was a motivating factor in the agency's decision not to select them." That is, "whether, in view of their qualifications as set forth in their application, the agency's reasons for not selecting them are pretextual and the real reason is their prior military service." Although the MSPB did not separate the discrimination determination into two discrete parts, for the first of which the complainant bears the burden of proof, and for the second of which the employer bears the burden of proof, its decision as a whole followed the strictures of the framework developed by the NLRB and the Court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB, after reviewing the qualifications of both of the appellants as well as the person actually selected for the position, found that "the appellants did not establish that they were not selected for the GS-14 Counsel to the Commander position because of discrimination based on their military service." In their appellate briefs, both Mr. Fahrenbacher and Mr. Sheehan principally argue that the inferior qualifications of the person selected for the position of itself establishes that they were discriminated against. The Board correctly held that the claimants must show evidence of discrimination other than the fact of non-selection and membership in the protected class. <span class="Italic">Cf. Nat'l Labor Relations Bd. v. Fluor-Daniel, Inc.</span>, 161 F.3d 953, 967 (6th Cir. 1998) (refusing to incorporate the Title VII <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> into refusal-to-hire discrimination cases arising under the NLRA).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_533"></span>The Board considered the evidence of record including the appellants' qualifications, the qualifications of the employee actually selected, and other evidence including the fact that two of the five finalists for the position (appellants were not in this group) had prior military service. On the record presented, we agree that the appellants did not meet their burden of proving that their prior military status was a motivating factor in the agency's decision not to select them. On this basis, the decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Broaden v. Dept. of Transp</span>., <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20211117169">___Fed. Appx.___</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP), concluded that the agency fairly considered appellant's military experience and did not discriminate against him by reason of past military service when it did not select him for an air traffic controller position because he lacked the experience required for the job:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner, Michael Broaden, an Air Force veteran, appearing <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, appeals a final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board denying corrective action with respect to his unsuccessful application for employment as an Air Traffic Control Specialist with the Federal Aviation Administration. Because the MSPB's decision was supported by substantial evidence, and was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, we affirm.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA affords various protections to current and former military service members with respect to their employment, and prohibits employers from discriminating against their current or prospective employees because of their military service. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a) provides in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A person who is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, or obligation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The individual making a USERRA discrimination claim bears the initial burden of showing, by preponderant evidence, the individual's military service was "a substantial or motivating factor" in the adverse employment action. <span class="Italic">McMillan v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 812 F.3d 1364, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2016); 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(c)(1). If the employee makes the requisite showing, the employer has the opportunity to come forward with evidence to show, by preponderant evidence, the employer would have taken the adverse action anyway, for a valid reason. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Military service is a motivating factor for an adverse employment action if the employer "relied on, took into account, considered, or conditioned its decision" on the employee's military service. <span class="Italic">McMillan</span>, 812 F.3d at 1372 (quoting <span class="Italic">Erickson v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 571 F.3d 1364, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2009)). Because employers rarely concede an improper motivation for their employment actions, employees may satisfy their burden to establish that their military service or obligation was a motive in the challenged action by submitting evidence from which such a motive may be fairly inferred. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This analysis requires investigating the <span class="Italic">Sheehan factors</span>: (a) proximity in time between the employee's military activity and the adverse employment action; (b) inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer; (c) an employer's expressed hostility towards members protected by the statute together with knowledge of the employee's military activity; and (d) disparate treatment of certain employees compared to other employees with similar work records or offenses. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009, 1014 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Broaden contends that the MSPB's decision must be set aside because "the Board's wrongful decision follows from a record that contains no evidence on which its decision could be made." We disagree. For example, the ALJ credited the testimony of Meister and Still in finding that Mr. Broaden's military service was not considered in his employment decision, that there are material differences between the type of experience obtained by Mr. Broaden and the responsibilities of the advertised position, and that individuals within the FAA with similar experience to Mr. Broaden would also not qualify for the position. As to the <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span> factors, the ALJ found that (1) the timing did not suggest discrimination because it was 17 years from the time of Mr. Broaden's service to the time of the non-selection, (2) that there were no material discrepancies in testimony that suggested discrimination, and (3) there was no evidence of expressed hostility towards military members. On appeal, Mr. Broaden does not point to a single finding that was not supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we determine that the Board determination finding that Mr. Broaden did not satisfy his initial burden to show that his military service was a motivating factor in the FAA's decision not to hire him as an Air Traffic Control Specialist (MSS-1, Level 12), Support Specialist is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Broaden also contends that the MSPB's decision must be set aside because the FAA failed to recognize and credit his professional experiences and certifications simply because they were with the Air Force, and not the FAA. Mr. Broaden contends that the position requirements set forth in the advertisement were discriminatory in that they define experience in terms that discriminate against veterans in favor of individuals who gained flight-related experience with the FAA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, agencies have broad discretion to define their own needs. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Savantage Fin. Servs., Inc. v. United States</span>, 595 F.3d 1282, 1286 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (holding that determining an agency's minimum needs "is a matter within the broad discretion of agency officials...and is not for [the] court to second guess" (citations omitted and alterations in the original)). Appellant is correct, however, that all employers, including agencies, should carefully evaluate whether any employment requirements are discriminatory against veterans. See 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, we conclude that the ALJ's finding that the requirements of the advertised position are not discriminatory against veterans is supported by substantial evidence. For example, Still testified that non-veterans with similar flight-related experience with the FAA also do not meet the requirements for the advertised position. Still also testified that the requirements of the advertised position are reasonable and related to the duties of the position, independent of whether previous flight traffic experience was civilian or military.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Broaden's witnesses tried to establish that Mr. Broaden's experience was equivalent to the experience required for the relevant position. The ALJ, however, found that Still's testimony was far more authoritative and persuasive. We lack authority to re-evaluate these credibility determinations that are not inherently improbable or discredited by undisputed fact. <span class="Italic">Pope v. United States Postal Serv</span>., 114 F.3d 1144, 1149 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (citations omitted). Thus, we conclude that the MSPB determination that the qualifications of the advertised position were not discriminatory in nature is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Remanding to the Board for analysis of evidence excluded by the AJ that may have been significant in determining whether military reserve status influenced nonselection for a position, the Federal Circuit observed in <span class="Italic">Sharpe v. DOJ</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/17-2356.Opinion.3-1-2019.pdf"><span class="blue">916 F.3d 1376, 1380-81</span></a> (Fed. Cir. 2019):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Sharpe alleges that his non-selection for promotion to a GS-14 position resulted from SAIC Sherman's hostility towards reservists. He argues that because SAIC Sherman was hostile towards reservists, he never recommended Mr. Sharpe as his first-ranked agent; and because Mr. Sharpe was never first ranked, he was never selected by the Career Board for promotion. The Tomaski email and SAIC Sherman's testimony are relevant to this allegation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ASAIC Tomaski sent the Tomaski email to Mr. Sorrells, copying SAIC Sherman, within days of Mr. Sorrells' USERRA complaint. It had the subject line "You are a coward..." and stated, in full, "I do not know how to phrase it any other way. Do NOT ever contact me again." Mr. Sorrells, like Mr. Sharpe, was a reservist working in the SDFD under SAIC Sherman. ASAIC Tomaski reported directly to SAIC Sherman.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Had the Tomaski email been admitted, and had Mr. Sharpe been permitted to question SAIC Sherman about it, Mr. Sharpe could have explored whether SAIC Sherman is hostile towards reservists. He could have asked SAIC Sherman, for example, whether he understood the email to refer to Mr. Sorrells' USERRA claim, what his reaction was to the sentiments expressed by ASAIC Tomaski, what action (if any) he took in response, or whether ASAIC Tomaski had ever copied SAIC Sherman on similar emails. Through the Tomaski email and SAIC Sherman's testimony, Mr. Sharpe could have explored whether SAIC Sherman is hostile towards reservists. By excluding this evidence, the MSPB cut off that exploration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize, as the MSPB observed, that the Tomaski email "didn't even reference Mr. Sharpe." But it <span class="Italic">does</span> reference Mr. Sorrells, an agent who, like Mr. Sharpe, worked in the SDFD under SAIC Sherman; like Mr. Sharpe, was a reservist; and, like Mr. Sharpe, filed a USERRA claim naming SAIC Sherman. <span class="Italic">Sorrells</span>, SF-4324-15-0584-I-2, at *2-3, 44. The MSPB "consider[ed] whether there was hostility by Sherman <span class="Italic">towards...others' military or USERRA activity</span>." (emphasis added). Evidence of the Tomaski email and of Mr. Sherman's response to it is relevant to SAIC Sherman's potential hostility towards others' military or USERRA activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"[D]iscrimination is seldom open or notorious," <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1014, and "employers rarely concede an improper motivation for their employment actions," <span class="Italic">McMillan v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 812 F.3d 1364, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2016). Rather, discrimination tends to be "inferred" from evidence of "hostility" or "disparate treatment of certain employees compared to other employees with similar work records or offenses." <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1014. Because Mr. Sharpe sought to introduce the Tomaski email and question SAIC Sherman about it to support an inference that his non-selections resulted from SAIC Sherman's hostility towards reservists, the MSPB abused its discretion in excluding it as irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we will not disturb the MSPB's evidentiary ruling unless its abuse of discretion "is clear and is harmful," meaning it "could have affected the outcome of the case," <span class="Italic">Curtin</span>, 846 F.2d at 1378-79, we determine the MSPB's exclusion of the Tomaski email and SAIC Sherman's testimony <span id="Page_534"></span>was. <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span> requires Mr. Sharpe "bear the initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that [his] military service was 'a substantial or motivating factor' in the adverse employment action." 240 F.3d at 1013. It is clear Mr. Sharpe proffered the Tomaski email and sought SAIC Sherman's testimony in an effort to meet this burden, and by excluding the Tomaski email and SAIC Sherman's testimony the MSPB harmed Mr. Sharpe's attempt to do so. Because the Tomaski email and SAIC Sherman's testimony thus "could have affected the outcome of the case," they should have been admitted. <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1370 (finding "harmful error" and a "substantial effect on the outcome of the case" where the MSPB excluded relevant evidence on an issue for which the appellant bore the burden of proof).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">As the AJ observed, Johnson demonstrated no proximity in time between his military discharge in 1987 and his application for employment with the agency in 2003. Nor did he demonstrate any inconsistencies between the agency's proffered reasons for not selecting him and the agency's actions. Moreover, although the agency had knowledge of Johnson's military service, there is no indication that the agency treated applicants disparately or expressed hostility toward veterans. On the contrary, the evidence shows that the agency routinely employed veterans and, in testimony presented by Johnson himself, that the agency interviewed only veterans for a vacant health aid position. Also, Johnson presented no evidence to show that the positions for which he applied were ever filled, and an agency staffing specialist testified that there were no vacancies for those positions at the time of Johnson's application. Thus, substantial evidence supports the AJ's finding that the agency did not act with discriminatory intent. We therefore conclude that the AJ correctly determined that Johnson failed to meet his burden of showing by preponderant evidence that his military service was a substantial or motivating factor in the agency's failure to hire him.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another example of analysis of a nonselection claim is <span class="Italic">Dean v. CPSC</span>, 301 Fed. Appx. 977, 978-79 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to prevail on his claim of discrimination under USERRA, Dean must show by a preponderance of the evidence that his prior military service or his status as a former military service member was a substantial or motivating factor in the CPSC's decision not to select him for the position. The Board concluded that Dean had failed to discharge this burden. First, the Board found that the 28 and 6-year periods of time which had passed between Dean's active and inactive military services, respectively, and his application to the CPSC were "too remote to suggest that his former status as a[ ] ...military service member played any role in the [CPSC's] decision not to select him." Second, the Board found that even though he was not ultimately selected, the CPSC's actions of forwarding his name for further consideration as a qualified candidate on both the competitive and merit promotion hiring certificates suggested that his former military service was not a substantial or motivating factor in his non-selection, and was inconsistent with his claim that he was discriminated against on the basis of his status as a veteran. Finally, the Board found no evidence indicative of general hostility by the CPSC toward former military service members.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Dean makes a number of allegations related to his contention that the CPSC's actions illustrate a pattern of discrimination against veterans, including that "[t]he CPSC ha[s] not hired or interviewed a veteran since before 2003 for a Product Safety Investigator job" and that the Board "[i]gnored prohibited personnel practices by agency officials." Dean has not, however, substantiated these allegations with record facts. Moreover, Dean has failed to demonstrate error in the Board's determination that his status as a veteran was not a substantial or motivating factor in the CPSC's determination not to select him for the position of Product Safety Investigator.</p>

DOJ</span>, 89 MSPR 285, 291-92 &#x00B6; 15 (2001), although the decision did not elaborate on how analysis of the significance of military status could exclude consideration of, for example, relative qualifications of the competitors for a position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, appeals or complaints under USERRA, like appeals or complaints filed under the individual right of action (IRA) provisions of the Whistleblower Protection Act, 5 C.F.R. Part 1209, differ from appeals that otherwise fall under the Board's appellate jurisdiction. That is so because the person filing the appeal has alleged that, based on his status, an agency has violated a specific law designed to protect him, and not that he was the subject of a particular action. The Board has held that its authority with regard to IRA appellants does not extend beyond whistleblower issues, does not allow for a decision on the merits of the underlying personnel action except to the extent necessary to address the appellant's whistleblower claims, and does not include a review of other claims of prohibited discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Marren v. Department of Justice</span>, 51 MSPR 632, 637-40 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 980 F.2d 745 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). Similarly, the Board has held, and we reaffirm today, that its authority with regard to USERRA complaints or appeals does not extend beyond the complained-of discrimination because of military status, does not allow for a decision on the merits of the underlying matter except to the extent necessary to address the appellant's military status discrimination claims, and thus does not include a review of other claims of prohibited discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Metzenbaum</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 700 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-6; <span class="Italic">Bodus</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 508 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-17; <span class="Italic">see also Fahrenbacher v.

The terminology used simply does not, nor can it, render these matters subject to the statutory provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701 and 7702 when the USERRA statute itself does not so indicate. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v.

The merits of the underlying action in the instant case, i.e., the appellant's non-selection for promotion, are not appealable to the Board; rather, USERRA only provides the Board with the authority to determine whether the appellant's military service was a motivating factor in the agency's decision. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Metzenbaum v.

<p class="Body-Text">An appellant was entitled to a hearing based on allegations that he was released from a term appointment and that he was not converted to a permanent position because of his military service, <span class="Italic">see Williams v. Dept. of Army</span>, 109 MSPR 206, 208-09 &#x00B6; 5, 2008 MSPB 138 (2008), but, to present a meritorious USERRA nonselection claim, the appellant should demonstrate an application for a position. The Federal Circuit rejected, on the facts of the case, that an application was not necessary because the application would have been a futile act. <span class="Italic">Jolley v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserted that the agency violated USERRA when it withdrew a tentative job offer of a Veterans Recruitment Act (VRA) appointment <span id="Page_535"></span>to a GS-7 Equal Opportunity Assistant (EOA) position, a noncompetitive appointment that would have entitled him to benefits and to conversion to the competitive service after serving for two years, and changed the offer to a temporary appointment not to exceed one year.

Here, the agency used an authorized method, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 316.402(b)(2) to give the appellant a temporary limited appointment. Appointments under this regulatory provision are not VRA appointments, although they are limited to the grade levels authorized for VRA appointments, and thus do not lead to career conditional appointments. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 316.402(b)(2).

Unlike <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, where nonveterans were selected for positions without examination over a veteran who had been qualified for that position through the examination process, here the appellant did not compete with non-veterans. Also, the appellant failed to present any evidence that a veteran was disadvantaged because the agency announced the vacancies on Facebook.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appears to allege that he should have received a VRA appointment. As the administrative judge explained, the agency incorrectly informed the appellant that he was offered a VRA appointment with benefits, and only shortly before he reported for duty, informed him that he was offered a temporary limited appointment without benefits. Even if the appellant met the VRA special hiring authority criteria, there was nothing improper in the agency's use of another authorized method, &#x00A7; 316.402(b)(2), to fill the EOA position. <span class="Italic">See Joseph</span>, 505 F.3d at 1383-1384.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency violates USERRA and the Board remedy is an order directing the applicant's consideration for a position, further review to the Federal Circuit is premature until the agency takes or fails to take action that would lead to enforcement proceedings and a reviewable Board order concerning further entitlements. <span class="Italic">See Tully v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board lacks jurisdiction of a USERRA nonselection claim by an employee of a state national guard unit, since the employer is considered a state entity beyond the Board's enforcement authority, <span class="Italic">Stoglin v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an appeal with the Board, under both USERRA and the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA), regarding his nonselection for the GS-12 position of Equal Employment Manager with the Hawaii Air National Guard (Vacancy Announcement No. FS-406716-SK11)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the appellant applied for employment with the Hawaii Air National Guard and the position for which he applied was advertised as a nondual status position. The employment of such nondual status employees is authorized by 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 10217(a), and the incumbents are civilian employees. 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 10217(a). Although they are employees of the Department of Defense, and thus considered federal employees for most purposes, National Guard civilian technicians are considered state employees for USERRA purposes. Title 38, United States Code, section 4303(4)(B), which is part of the statutory section containing definitions applicable to USERRA, specifically states that, "[i]n the case of a National Guard technician employed under section 709 of title 32, the term 'employer' means the adjutant general of the State in which the technician is employed." Likewise, the Department of Labor's regulations implementing USERRA state that "[a] National Guard civilian technician is considered a State employee for USERRA purposes, although he or she is considered a Federal employee for most other purposes." 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1002.306. The Department of Labor's regulations go on to explain that, "[a]n action brought against a State Adjutant General, as an employer of a civilian National Guard technician, is considered an action against a State for purposes of determining which court has jurisdiction," and that an action under USERRA against a state "may be brought in a State court of competent jurisdiction according to the laws of the State." 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1002.305(b), (d). We therefore conclude that the appellant's USERRA claim against the Hawaii Air National Guard is not properly before the Board and we dismiss it for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed, <span class="Italic">Stoglin v. MSPB</span>, 640 Fed. Appx. 864, 867-68 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board did not err in its determination that it lacked jurisdiction to hear Mr. Stoglin's USERRA claims. As explained by the Board, the USERRA explicitly states "'[i]n the case of a National Guard technician employed under section 709 of [T]itle 32 [of the United States Code], the term 'employer' means the adjutant general of the State in which the technician is employed.'" <span class="Italic">Stoglin</span>, 2015 WL 4166462 at *2 (first alteration in original) (quoting 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(4)(B)). In Mr. Stoglin's case, the position he applied for with the HANG was announced "under the authority set forth in 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709," thus, the "employer" was the State Adjutant General of Hawaii. Resp't's App. 33; <span class="Italic">see also id.</span> at 11 (discussing the job announcement submitted with Mr. Stoglin's Petition for Appeal to the Board).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court has previously stated the procedure for "'[e]nforcement of [USERRA] rights with respect to a State or private employer' is set out in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4323, which provides for district court jurisdiction over actions against a state commenced by the United States, and state court jurisdiction over actions against a state commenced by a person." <span class="Italic">Asatov v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 595 Fed. Appx. 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (unpublished) (alterations in original).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Mr. Stoglin's claim is against the State Adjutant General of Hawaii, as the employer of civilian National Guard technicians, he must seek resolution of his claim in Hawaii state court. <span class="Italic">See Asatov</span>, 595 Fed.
