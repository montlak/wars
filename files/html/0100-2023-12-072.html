<p class="Body-Text">Practical considerations involving the timing of reopening petitions aside, there may also be some jurisdictional limitations on reopening. Once an appellant petitions the Federal Circuit for review of his case, the Board loses jurisdiction, following that filing, to decide the appellant's requests to the Board for reopening and reconsideration. <span class="Italic">Flescher v. USPS</span>, 34 MSPR 643, 644 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Sanders v. United States</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___, n.* (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP) ("The filing of an appeal ordinarily 'confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the [trial] court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.' <span class="Italic">Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co</span>., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (1982)."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Gregory v. USPS</span>, 91 MSPR 52, 55 &#x00B6; 6 (2002) (where an appeal is pending before the Federal Circuit, the Board lacks jurisdiction to act on a request for reconsideration; a request for a stay pending a ruling on reconsideration is mooted by the Board's dismissal of the request from consideration). <span class="Italic">But cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Evans v. OPM</span>, 85 MSPR 36, 38 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6 (1999) (appellant loses the right to Board review if judicial review is sought before the PFR is filed with the Board; judicial review sought after the PFR is filed does not divest the Board of its PFR jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board suggested that as long as the case is not pending with the court, prior affirmation by the court of the Board's decision would not preclude the Board from considering whether newly discovered evidence showed that the agency perpetrated a fraud on the Board.<span class="Italic"> Anderson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 46 MSPR 341, 349 (1990). <span class="Italic">Anthony v. OPM</span>, 70 MSPR 214, 218 (1996), made more explicit the Board's authority to reopen an appeal following, but not during, Federal Circuit review:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may reopen a closed appeal even after the Federal Circuit has issued a decision reviewing the Board's final decision in that appeal. <span class="Italic">See Vesser v. OPM</span>, 67 MSPR 239, 242, 244, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 73 F.3d 381 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). Although the pendency of an appeal to the Federal Circuit deprives the Board of jurisdiction to consider a request for reconsideration, such a request can be considered following the court's decision on appeal. <span class="Italic">See Anderson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 46 MSPR 341, 350-51 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 949 F.2d 404 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table). The Federal Circuit's mandate in an appeal from a Board decision relates only to the record and to issues that were before the court<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. Thus, the court's affirmance of the Board's decision does not preclude the Board from considering newly-discovered evidence showing that the agency perpetrated a fraud upon the Board, or from reopening or reconsidering the case. <span class="Italic">Id....</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant appealed the Board's final decision to the Federal Circuit on July 15, 1994, before he filed his request to reopen. Thus, the Board did not have jurisdiction to consider his request when it was filed, and his motion for a stay of reconsideration was therefore moot. <span class="Italic">See Anderson</span>, 46 MSPR at 350-51. However, the court issued its mandate on August 18, 1995. Therefore, the Board may now consider the appellant's request to reopen. <span class="Italic">See Vesser</span>, 67 MSPR at 244; <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, 46 MSPR at 350-51.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 100 MSPR 415 (2005) (Board may reopen and reconsider an appeal following a final decision, even when a court has affirmed that decision, but the authority is limited to matters not before the court when it issued its decision); <span class="Italic">Lugo v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 96 MSPR 95, 97-98 &#x00B6; 6 (2004) ("The Board has the authority to reopen and reconsider an appeal in which it has rendered a final decision, even after a proceeding for judicial review has been concluded, but this authority is limited to matters that were not before the court at the time it issued its decision in the case.... The Board, however, will exercise its discretion to reopen only in unusual or extraordinary circumstances, such as an intervening event that directly bears on the result or the discovery of misrepresentation or fraud after the issuance of the initial decision."); <span class="Italic">Moss v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 82 MSPR 309, 312 &#x00B6; 8 (1999) (reaffirming that the Board may reopen a closed appeal after the Federal Circuit issued a decision reviewing the Board's final decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Coley v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 112 MSPR 645, 646-49 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-9, 2009 MSPB 222 (2009), determined that if a mixed case is taken from a final Board decision into district court, the Board lacks jurisdiction to reopen the case to consider new and material evidence while the case is pending in district court:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant on October 29, 2007. The appellant filed a Board appeal, raising claims of discrimination and retaliation for protected equal employment opportunity activity. On July 5, 2008, the administrative judge issued an initial decision affirming the appellant's removal. The administrative judge accurately notified the appellant of her various options for seeking review of the initial decision, including <span id="Page_1659"></span>the various procedures and time limits for doing so. She informed the appellant of how to seek review with the Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the appropriate United States district court, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant chose not to file a petition for review with the Board, and instead allowed the initial decision to become final. Pursuant to the administrative judge's instructions, the appellant filed a timely petition with the EEOC, requesting review of the Board's findings on her discrimination and reprisal claims. The EEOC issued a decision concurring with the Board's decision. <span class="Italic">Coley v. Peters</span>, EEOC Petition No. 0320080108, 2008 WL 4773218. Pursuant to the appeal rights notice in the EEOC decision, the appellant filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, requesting review of the Board's decision in its entirety. The agency has made an uncontested assertion that the district court case is still pending.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 20, 2009, the appellant filed a document with the Board, requesting review of the initial decision based on alleged new and material evidence. The appellant filed a motion and supporting affidavit for the Board to waive its petition for review filing deadline. The agency has filed a response, arguing, among other things, that the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider the appellant's filings because she has chosen an alternative avenue for review of the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the following reasons, the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider the appellant's attempted petition for review. The instant appeal is similar to <span class="Italic">Williams v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 967 F.2d 577 (Fed. Cir. 1992). In <span class="Italic">Williams,</span> the appellant filed a Board appeal of his removal and raised a discrimination claim. 967 F.2d at 578. The administrative judge affirmed the appellant's removal, and the appellant allowed the initial decision to become final. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The appellant petitioned the EEOC for review, and the EEOC concurred with the Board's decision. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The appellant then filed a civil action in federal district court, which the court dismissed as untimely. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The appellant then submitted another filing to the Board, which the Board treated as an untimely petition for review of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Board dismissed the petition as untimely filed with no good cause shown for the delay. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The appellant then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court affirmed the dismissal, but on other grounds. It found that when the initial decision became final and the appellant petitioned the EEOC for review, the appellant had no further right to petition for review with the Board. At that point, the appellant's attempts to show good cause for the "untimeliness" of his filing were irrelevant. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 578-79. The court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[W]hen the Board received [the appellant's] document...it was not a petition for review of an initial decision, untimely or otherwise. It instead requested review of a final Board decision on which all permissible appeals had already been exhausted. The Board properly dismissed this petition, but on the wrong grounds. The Board simply lacked jurisdiction to reopen a final and fully adjudicated decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 579 (citation omitted). The Board is bound to follow this precedential Federal Circuit decision. <span class="Italic">See Schibik v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 591, &#x00B6; 8 (2005); <span class="Italic">see also Lynch v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. 447, 448-50 (1994) (following the court's holding in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> under similar circumstances). Although the alleged new and material evidence that the appellant submits on review might have provided a basis for the Board to waive its petition for review filing deadline if the appellant had not sought review in another forum, <span class="Italic">see Bruton v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 271, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-12 (2008), the appellant's actions of seeking review in another forum preclude the Board from considering the evidence at this time, <span class="Italic">see Williams,</span> 967 F.2d at 578-79; <span class="Italic">Lynch,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. at 448-50.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board is a creature of statute, and its jurisdiction is strictly limited to that provided by law, rule, or regulation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1204(a)(1), 7701(a); <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 421 F.3d 1336, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Congress has provided various avenues through which an appellant may seek review of an administrative judge's initial decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701(e)(1), 7702(b), 7703(a)-(b). In this case, the appellant was fully informed of her options for seeking review, and she selected the option provided in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(b), i.e., filing a petition with the EEOC. At that point, the appellant chose to forego her opportunity to seek Board review in favor of a different forum, and the Board was divested of jurisdiction over the matter. <span class="Italic">See Williams,</span> 967 F.2d at 578; <span class="Italic">Lynch,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. at 449.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also decline to consider the appellant's submission as a request to reopen. Although the Board has some limited authority to reopen and reconsider appeals in which a reviewing court has issued a final decision, <span class="Italic">see Mitchell v. Department of Commerce,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 415, &#x00B6; 9 (2005), <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 175 Fed. Appx. 340 (Fed. Cir. 2006), there is no indication that the district court has issued a final decision here, <span class="Italic">see Anderson v. Department of Transportation,</span> 46 M.S.P.R. 341, 350 n.29 (1990) (the pendency of judicial review deprives the Board of jurisdiction to consider a request for reopening; such a request must await the court's decision on review), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 949 F.2d 404 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the Board lacks the authority to consider the appellant's August 20, 2009 filings either as a petition for review or as a request to reopen and reconsider the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">With some judicial encouragement, the Board used the reopening procedure to restart the period for judicial review. This occurred in <span class="Italic">Oxman v. OPM</span>, 31 MSPR 333, 334 (1986). The Board apparently issued an incorrect notice of appeal rights directing the appellant to a district court for judicial review. Without explaining much about the nature of the case, the Board noted that the district court determined that it lacked jurisdiction, but the Board bowed to the court's suggestion that the Board reopen the case for the limited purpose of issuing another final decision with a proper statement of judicial review rights. The Board reopened its decision to provide a judicially reviewable decision with a notice of the appellant's right to judicial review from the Federal Circuit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board essentially reopened an appeal when a district court had jurisdiction over a case that would otherwise be barred from reconsideration by <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> and had directed, for equitable reasons--mental incapacity--that the Board determine an aspect of a case--the availability of disability retirement--not earlier considered. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Stadler v. GSA</span>, 47 MSPR 699, 699-700 (1991). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "; refer in Chapter 17 to "Effect of District Court Review."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gallegos v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 78 MSPR 626, 628 (1998), explained the situation that arose when the appellant filed a timely petition for review in court and an untimely PFR with the Board, and when, as a result, the court dismissed his judicial petition after learning of the PFR pending with the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has withdrawn his petition for judicial review. He did so in response to a notice from the Clerk of the Court, which advised him that he could not pursue actions before the court and the Board simultaneously, and further advised him to withdraw either his petition for judicial review or his petition for Board review. The notice also provided: "If you withdraw your petition for review in this court at this time, you may later seek review in this court of the Board's final order if that order is adverse to you." The court's notice was engendered by a letter from the Clerk of the Board, which informed the court that the appellant had filed a petition for review with the Board, and that his case "is still pending before the Board for final adjudication."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The notice from the Clerk of the Court and the letter from the Clerk of the Board both appear to be based on the mistaken assumption that the appellant had a right to Board review. The notice from the Clerk of the Court did not acknowledge that the appellant had <span class="Italic">already received</span> a "final order" reviewable in court under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(a). This is understandable, since the letter from the Clerk of the Board to the Clerk of the Court did not acknowledge that the appellant had <span class="Italic">already received</span> a "final adjudication"; indeed, the letter implied precisely the opposite. If the appellant again seeks judicial review of the September 4, 1997 decision, the court could dismiss his petition as untimely filed. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1) (a petition for judicial review of a Board decision must be filed within 30 days of the date the Board decision becomes final).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a timely petition for judicial review, and withdrew it only after a sequence of misleading official communications. To ensure that he is not left without a forum to review the September 4, 1997 decision of the administrative judge, we reopen the appeal and undertake such review. The decisions in <span class="Italic">Gamalog</span> and <span class="Italic">Del</span> <span class="Italic">Marcelle</span> are no impediment to our reopening this appeal. In <span class="Italic">Gamalog</span> and <span class="Italic">Del Marcelle,</span> the Board held that it "lack[ed] jurisdiction to review" decisions of administrative judges that had already been subject to judicial review and had been affirmed on the merits. 66 MSPR at 316, 59 MSPR at 253. In this case, by contrast, the court's dismissal of the appellant's petition for judicial review was not a decision on the merits; the court did not affirm the administrative judge's decision. In sum, although the appellant lost his right of Board review of the administrative judge's decision, we have not lost our discretionary authority to review that decision through our power to reopen. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1)(B); <span class="Italic">Guenther v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 68 MSPR 667, 670 (1995) ("[b]ased on unusual equitable or legal circumstances," the Board may reopen an appeal on its own motion and reconsider a final decision).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon reopening, and after full consideration of the arguments raised in the appellant's petition for Board review, we AFFIRM the September 4, 1997 initial decision without modification.</p>
