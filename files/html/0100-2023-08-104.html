<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-103"><span class="space">d.</span> Relation to Suitability Determination</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board ensures an AJ properly addresses a claim of improper termination resulting from preemployment conditions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Minhas v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 6 MSPR 390, 391 (1981) (remanded when the AJ incorrectly assessed the case under postappointment standards). But an appellant cannot add to Board jurisdiction when challenging a probationary removal by incorrectly characterizing the case as a suitability determination made by or under delegated authority from OPM, <span class="Italic">Munson v. DOJ</span>, 55 MSPR 246, 251-52 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is empowered to instruct an agency to separate an individual when OPM determines that the individual is not suitable for federal service. 5 CFR 731.201. Any individual, including a probationer, may appeal his or her separation to the Board if the separation was ordered by OPM following such a suitability disqualification determination. <span class="Italic">Ward v. Department of Navy</span>, 44 MSPR 493, 497-98 (1990) (relying on 5 CFR 731.401(b)). In her petition for appeal, the appellant alleged that she was challenging a suitability disqualification determination and cited 5 CFR Part 731. The administrative judge therefore should have addressed whether the Board had jurisdiction under 5 CFR 731.401(b)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_149"></span>The record shows that the appellant's removal was initiated by the employing agency. There is no indication that OPM ordered the appellant's removal following a suitability determination pursuant to 5 CFR Part 731. To the contrary, the notice of proposed termination explicitly stated that the Warden would decide whether the appellant was to be terminated, and all indications are that the Warden, not OPM, had the final say in whether the appellant would be retained. Although the Warden relied in part on information gathered by OPM during a background investigation, the removal decision was based on the Warden's judgment that the appellant's having falsified information in a pre-employment interview "destroyed [her] credibility and effectiveness" as a correctional officer. Thus, the appellant may not appeal her separation to the Board under 5 CFR 731.401(b).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That an agency uses suitability language in a probationer's termination based on preemployment conditions does not convert the action to a suitability determination by OPM subject to an MSPB suitability appeal, <span class="Italic">Alvarez v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 298 Fed. Appx. 965, 968-69 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to her second appeal, Ms. Alvarez argues that the agency did not terminate her employment under the authority of section 315.805 of the OPM regulations, but instead acted pursuant to an adverse suitability determination under part 731 of the OPM regulations. Because an employee in the competitive service who is terminated as a result of being found unsuitable for employment in a suitability determination may appeal that determination to the Board, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501 (2007), Ms. Alvarez contends that the Board had jurisdiction over her appeal on that ground.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Alvarez does not dispute the agency's authority to terminate probationary employees for conditions arising before appointment. The OPM regulations make clear that a suitability determination under part 731 is distinct from an agency action under part 315, and part 731 specifically provides that "[w]here behavior covered by this part may also form the basis for a part 752 [adverse actions for non-probationary employees] or 315 action, agencies may use part 315 or 752, as appropriate, instead of this part." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(d) (2007). Ms. Alvarez argues that the agency conducted what she terms a "constructive suitability determination." Contrary to Ms. Alvarez's argument, the administrative judge found that the IRS had terminated Ms. Alvarez's employment under the authority of section 315.805 of the OPM regulations for conditions arising before appointment, and that the agency did not conduct a "constructive" suitability determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Alvarez bolsters her argument that the agency's action was a constructive suitability determination by pointing to a provision of the Internal Revenue Manual that states "an investigation that yields adverse or derogatory information about an applicant or an employee requires a suitability determination." Internal Revenue Manual &#x00A7; 6.731.1.5. She suggests that the Manual provision required that the agency conduct a suitability determination in her case and thus supports her contention that the agency did just that.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not find the Manual provision persuasive on this issue. The provision in question is located in a portion of the Manual that deals specifically with suitability determinations; it indicates that if an investigation yields adverse information about an employee or applicant, a suitability determination should be conducted. The provision does not, however, have the effect of depriving the agency of its authority under the OPM regulations to terminate probationary employees for conditions arising prior to employment, and there is no indication that it was intended to narrow the agency's options in such cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To determine whether the agency's action in this case was a suitability determination, the administrative judge weighed the evidence on both sides. In favor of Ms. Alvarez's argument, the administrative judge recognized that the form authorizing her background investigation referred to "Part 731," and that her termination notice used the words "not suitable." The administrative judge acknowledged that those references "could be deemed to implicate" section 731. On the other hand, the administrative judge noted that "[a]ll of the agency officials who testified stated that the decision to terminate the appellant was not a suitability determination," and that a supervisor testified that "her decision to terminate the appellant was primarily based on the appellant's prior conduct during her employment with the State of Maine." The administrative judge also relied on the language of the actual request that Ms. Alvarez be terminated and the proposed termination notice itself. The request that she be terminated referred to "ERG 315.804," and the notice stated, "[t]his is a notice of proposed termination issued in accordance with Part 315.805 of the Office of Personnel Management regulations." On balance, the administrative judge decided that the evidence established that the agency terminated Ms. Alvarez under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315 and thus that the Board lacked jurisdiction to review the agency's decision as a suitability determination. We uphold that finding as supported by substantial evidence and therefore sustain the Board's ruling dismissing Ms. Alvarez's "suitability determination" appeal.</p>

VA</span>, 101 MSPR 207, 209-11 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-10, 2006 MSPB 36 (2006), the Board adjudicates the case as a probationary termination, not a suitability termination, if the agency does not have delegated OPM authority to initiate a suitability action and the agency acts under its own authority:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A probationary employee in the competitive service who has not completed one year of current continuous service has no statutory right of appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A); <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Such an employee has a regulatory right of appeal to the Board, however, if he makes a nonfrivolous allegation that he was terminated due to discrimination based on marital status or for partisan political reasons, or because of conditions arising before appointment to the position in question. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 315.805-.806.

<p class="Block-Quote1">A probationary employee in the competitive service who has not completed one year of current continuous service at the time of his termination also has a regulatory right of appeal to the Board if he was terminated as a result of a suitability disqualification or a debarment action taken by Office of Personnel Management (OPM) based on evidence of material, <span id="Page_150"></span>intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.103, 731.105(c). OPM retains jurisdiction in all competitive service cases involving evidence of material, intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over an appeal from a negative suitability determination on that basis when the determination was made by an employing agency without delegated authority from OPM. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103; <span class="Italic">Brady v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency learned of the appellant's alleged omission of two criminal convictions on his pre-employment Form 306 from OPM's Office of Federal Investigations (OFI). An agency employee, Susan Harris, stated that an employee of the OPM OFI telephoned her and informed her that "[the appellant] ha[d], as many as three arrests and convictions, which he failed to disclose on his Optional Form 306." Harris stated further that "OPM concluded their call to me by indicating that they were intending, in the next few days, to send a communication to [the appellant] regarding his suitability for continued Federal employment." Harris also stated that, in a subsequent telephone conversation with Kim Cook, who was on staff with OPM's OFI, Harris learned that, according to OFI's most recent record, "there are two arrests and convictions regarding [the appellant] which he was required to list on his OF-306.... There is apparently a third possible criminal incident...[that] should have been stated on [the appellant's] OF-306.... However, this cannot be corroborated until...the next few days or so."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record below therefore indicated OPM's involvement in the situation. Based on OPM's interest in the appellant's suitability for Federal employment, we find that the appellant's omission that formed the basis of the agency's termination action is an intentional false statement or deception in appointment that could form the basis of a negative suitability determination.[*] Thus, the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal unless the agency establishes that it had prior approval from OPM to take action under its own authority at part 315. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Department of the Navy</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 355, &#x00B6; 7 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*] We note that, at this stage of the appeal, the assertions concerning the appellant's alleged criminal record and arrest history are merely allegations. We make no finding in this Opinion and Order as to whether the appellant actually had the criminal record identified by the OPM OFI or whether he omitted to report a criminal record on his OF-306.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an affidavit provided for the record in this appeal, the agency's Facilities Program Manager, Pat Landon, avers that OPM had advised his office that it was initiating action to remove the appellant from Federal employment for suitability reasons. He avers further that he has been "provided absolutely no information by...the USOPM, or the Center's HRMS Office, that indicates or suggests, in any way, that my decision to terminate the Appellant was inappropriate in any fashion." We find that OPM's silence is insufficient to show that it delegated authority to the agency to take action against the appellant under its own authority at part 315.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not issue a jurisdictional order allowing the parties to file evidence and argument on the jurisdictional question of whether OPM delegated authority to the agency to terminate the appellant during his probationary period under part 315 for a material intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment, and the record is not sufficiently developed to allow the Board to make that determination. Accordingly, we remand this case to the administrative judge to issue such a jurisdictional order and to allow the parties to develop the record on this jurisdictional question.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board set forth the background of this case in <span class="Italic">Wiley v.

The AJ found that the appellant had made a written reply during the notice period and failed to make a non-frivolous allegation that the agency did not follow the procedures for terminating a probationary employee for pre-employment reasons.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board stated that the agency had learned of the appellant's alleged omissions on his Form 306 from OPM, who informed the agency that OPM was intending to contact the appellant regarding his suitability for continued Federal employment.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the AJ found that the agency did not take a negative suitability action against the appellant; rather, it cited 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805 as its authority to remove him during his probationary period. Specifically, she found no persuasive evidence that OPM authorized the agency to take a negative suitability action against the appellant. She thus found that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's removal as a negative suitability action. In contrast, she found that the agency did have OPM approval to take action against the appellant under 5 C.F.R. part 315. She cited a March 30, 2006 OPM letter submitted by the agency on remand to support her finding. She concluded, however, that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's removal during his probationary period under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reopen this appeal because we find that the AJ erred in determining that OPM had delegated authority to the agency to take action against the appellant under 5 C.F.R. part 315. In remanding this case, the Board acknowledged that the agency submitted an affidavit from Facilities Program Manager Pat Landon averring that OPM had "provided absolutely <span class="Italic">no</span> information...that indicates or suggests, in any way, that my decision to terminate the Appellant was inappropriate in any fashion." <span class="Italic">Wiley</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 207, &#x00B6; 9.

<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's March 30, 2006 letter, submitted on remand, stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">OPM retains jurisdiction in competitive service cases involving evidence of material, intentional falsification. By regulation, agencies are required to refer these cases to OPM for adjudication, or contact OPM for <span class="Italic">prior</span> approval if the agency wants to take an action under its own authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM further stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[G]enerally, if an agency has an immediate need to remove a probationary employee, we will not require that they continue to employ that person while we propose our action and make a final suitability determination.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, contrary to the AJ's finding, OPM did not state that it "most likely" approved the agency's action in this case; rather, it stated that it "most likely would have" approved the action under similar facts. Indeed, OPM admitted in the letter that the agency did not inform it of the appellant's May 14, 2004 termination until June 8, 2004.<span class="Italic"></span> Thus, the evidence does not show that the agency received the required approval from OPM prior to terminating the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103(a); <span class="Italic">Wiley</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 207, &#x00B6; 6. Therefore, the AJ should have dismissed this appeal for lack of Board jurisdiction because the agency did not have delegated authority from OPM to take action against the appellant under its own authority at 5 C.F.R. part 315. <span class="Italic">See Wiley</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 207, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not agree with the concurring opinion that there was no need for the agency to obtain OPM's prior approval before it decided to terminate the appellant's probationary appointment on the ground that he had omitted two criminal convictions on a pre-employment questionnaire. As noted earlier, the governing regulation expressly provides that--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">OPM retains jurisdiction [to take a suitability action under Part 731] in all competitive service cases involving evidence of material, intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment. <span class="Italic">Agencies must refer these cases to OPM for adjudication, or contact OPM for prior approval if the agency wants to take action under its own authority (5 CFR Part 315 or 5 CFR Part 752)</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103(a) (emphasis supplied).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The concurring opinion excuses the agency's failure to obtain OPM's prior approval for terminating the appellant's appointment under Part 315 on two apparent grounds. First, according to the concurring opinion, the governing regulations are "somewhat confusing." We disagree. The plain meaning of section 731.103(a) is clear: An agency's authority to terminate a probationer under Part 315 for alleged "material, intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment" is conditioned on the agency's obtaining OPM's prior approval. Likewise, OPM's regulations expressly provide that an agency's authority to take a suitability action against an "appointee" (i.e., an individual in the first year of a "subject to investigation appointment," <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101), is "subject to the agency limitations prescribed in &#x00A7; 731.103." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.105. The concurring opinion makes the italicized portion of section 731.103 quoted above meaningless, contrary to the basic principle of regulatory construction that no part of a regulation should be interpreted so as to make it nugatory or superfluous. <span class="Italic">See Holley v. United States</span>, 124 F.3d 1462, 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (no part of statute should be rendered meaningless); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Campbell</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 170, 180 (1993) (canons of statutory construction generally apply to the interpretation of regulations).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The concurring opinion also points to OPM's recent publication of proposed regulations that would remove the "prior approval" requirement as evidence that OPM acknowledges and seeks to address the confusion in its regulations. The Board cannot lawfully apply these potential changes to OPM's regulations in this case because the revisions are merely <span class="Italic">proposed</span>. Indeed, the proposed regulations contain a "Savings Provision" which states that the new rules would not apply to any administrative proceeding pending on the date the proposed regulations are made final. 72 Fed. Reg. 2203, 2209 (daily ed. Jan. 18, 2007) (proposed 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.601).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's previous, unanimous decision in this case remanded the appeal for an express finding on the question of whether the agency obtained OPM's prior approval under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103(a) to terminate the <span id="Page_151"></span>appellant's probationary appointment. <span class="Italic">Wiley</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 207, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 11. OPM cannot alter the Board's analysis of a pending case by announcing an intention to revise the controlling regulation for future cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Corbett v. DHHS</span>, 7 MSPR 431, 434-36, 7 MSPB 302 (1981), the AJ decided that it was irrational to provide applicants who were deemed unsuitable for federal employment greater substantive review of determinations concerning their qualifications than that received by probationers who were terminated for preemployment reasons. The Board disagreed: the Board could not create its own jurisdiction even if OPM inadequately addressed the equities of probationers' appeals. [Refer to this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-390.html#sec1-383">Suitability Determination</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency with delegated authority from OPM removes an individual who happens to be a probationer on suitability grounds, the case is no longer a probationary termination. The employee may appeal the adverse suitability termination, <span class="Italic">LaPre v. DOJ</span>, 62 MSPR 329, 334-36 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant correctly asserts that the administrative judge improperly rejected his allegation that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal under 5 CFR 731.103(d). It is true, as noted by the administrative judge, that the Board stated in <span class="Italic">McChesney v. Department of Justice</span>, 55 MSPR 512, 516 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 5 F.3d 1503 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table), that the appellant in that appeal had not offered any evidence to show that his termination resulted from an unsuitability determination by OPM or by the agency pursuant to OPM's instructions, and that he therefore failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction. Under 5 CFR 731.508, the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal of a probationary employee who is separated as a result of a suitability disqualification or debarment action taken by OPM or by the employing agency pursuant to OPM's instructions. However, the Board specifically noted in <span class="Italic">McChesney</span> that OPM's regulations also provide that any appointee who is found unsuitable by any agency having delegated authority from OPM may appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See McChesney</span>, 55 MSPR at 515; 5 CFR 731.103(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 CFR 731.103(d), "[a]ny applicant, eligible, or appointee who is found unsuitable by any agency having delegated authority from OPM under this part for any reason named in &#x00A7; 731.202 may appeal to the [Board] under the Board's regulations." There is no question in this appeal that the agency had delegated authority from OPM. Moreover, misconduct in prior employment that would have a bearing on efficient service in the position in question, such as that alleged in the agency's proposal and removal notices, may be a basis for finding an individual unsuitable under 5 CFR 731.202<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR 731.202(b)(1). The appellant's allegation that the agency separated him based on a negative suitability determination, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of Board jurisdiction over his appeal. Thus, the appellant made a nonfrivolous claim that the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In dismissing the appeal for lack of Board jurisdiction, the administrative judge found that the SF-50 submitted by the agency that documented the purported legal authority for the agency's action as 5 CFR 315.805 "would control absent contrary proof." Although the administrative judge properly considered the SF-50, that evidence constituted mere factual contradiction of the appellant's nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction. Accordingly, the administrative judge erred when, without affording the appellant a jurisdictional hearing, she weighed the evidence and resolved the conflicting factual assertions by deeming the agency's evidence to be dispositive<span class="Italic">. See Dumas</span>, 789 F.2d at 893-94; <span class="Italic">Ferdon</span>, 60 MSPR at 330.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Although the agency asserts that the FPM permits it to take suitability disqualification actions against probationary employees pursuant to 5 CFR part 315, the Board has held that the FPM constitutes OPM's guidance to agencies regarding OPM's interpretation of statutes and regulations.... The FPM provision relied upon by the agency was written in 1988, when agencies did not have delegated authority by OPM's regulations to take suitability actions on their own.... OPM's regulations were changed in 1991 to reflect that delegation.... Thus, there is no reason to defer to OPM's interpretation of the prior regulation, as set forth in the FPM, because OPM has not interpreted the current regulation.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board generally looks to the totality of the circumstances to determine the nature of an employee's separation from employment. <span class="Italic">See Fox v. Department of the Army</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 22 (2014). The Board has found, moreover, that the mere fact that an agency informs an appellant of a right of appeal to the Board does not confer jurisdiction on the Board. <span class="Italic">See Poole v. Department of the Army</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 516, &#x00B6; 20 (2012). Here, the record reflects that OPM informed the Navy in February 2014, that it was assuming jurisdiction and responsibility for adjudicating the appellant's suitability for employment, and it issued the appellant notice in March 2014, that it was proposing to direct his removal based upon a negative suitability determination. OPM, moreover, issued a written decision on July 21, 2014, outlining the grounds for directing the appellant's removal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 20-23.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only countervailing evidence in the record suggesting some other reason for removing the appellant is the Navy's August 7th decision letter, which is captioned "Notification of Discharge from Appointment During Probationary Period," and which contains an explanation of appeal rights to the Board for probationary employees seeking to challenge their termination on the limited grounds available to probationers under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 315.805-806. <span class="Italic">Walker v. Department of the Army</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 391, &#x00B6; 5 (2013) (outlining the limited grounds considered in a probationary termination appeal).

The substance of the Navy's decision letter, moreover, reflects that, although the appellant was being removed during his probationary period, his removal was the result of a negative suitability determination rendered by OPM. Additionally, the Navy received OPM's letter directing the appellant's removal the day before it issued its August 7th decision letter, thus strongly suggesting that the Navy issued its letter in response to OPM's directive. Finally, although not dispositive, the Navy issued a Standard Form 50 (SF-50) on August 8, 2014, effecting the appellant's removal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.201, thus also suggesting that his removal was the result of OPM's negative suitability determination, and not based on its own suitability conclusion.[3] <span class="Italic">Scott v.

Dept. of Navy</span>, 44 MSPR 493, 498 (1990), restated the necessity to extend the regulatory protections (including a hearing) to a probationer facing removal as a result of an OPM suitability determination. If OPM rescinds its suitability determination and the agency continues with the removal, the removal of the probationer may be set aside for harmful error:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Harmful error is defined by 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.4(r)] as "[e]rror by the agency in the application of its procedures that is likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error." As noted above, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.401(b)(2) requires an agency to either suspend an employee or retain him on active duty pending the adjudication of the employee's appeal of his OPM-directed separation. Here, OPM rescinded the appellant's negative suitability determination on April 5, 1989, while the Board's adjudication of his separate appeal in that matter was pending. If the agency had complied with the provisions of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.401, therefore, it likely would not have proceeded with the appellant's separation. Even absent the requirements of section 731.401, the agency should not have proceeded with the separation action after the sole basis for discharging the appellant had been eliminated. Accordingly, we conclude that the agency's failure to comply with the regulatory requirements of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.401 constituted harmful error requiring the reversal of the appellant's separation<span class="Italic">. See Baracco v. Department of Transportation,</span> 15 MSPR 112, 123 (1983) (reversal of an action is warranted where procedural error, whether regulatory or statutory, likely had a harmful effect upon the outcome of the case before the agency), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 735 F.2d 488 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied sub nom. Schapansky v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Transportation,</span> 469 U.S. 1018, 105 S. Ct. 432, 83 L. Ed.2d 358 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McClain v. OPM</span>, 76 MSPR 230, 242 (1997) ("We note that the appellant cited regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806 regarding the termination of employees during their probationary period. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, OPM directed the appellant's employing agency to separate him under 5 C.F.R. part 731. Such an action is specifically excluded from coverage of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 315.804-.806. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.303(c)."); <span class="Italic">McChesney v. DOJ</span>, 55 MSPR 512, 515 (1992) ("Notwithstanding the appellant's status as a probationary employee, the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal if he was terminated as a result of a suitability disqualification <span id="Page_152"></span>or a debarment action taken by OPM or by the agency pursuant to OPM's instructions.... OPM may in its discretion delegate to the heads of agencies authority for adjudicating suitability in 'cases involving applicants and eligibles for, and appointees to, competitive service positions' in an agency. 5 CFR 731.103(b)."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Herndon v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 97 MSPR 609, 613-14 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14 (2004) (although the Board could have had jurisdiction over a probationer's termination if that termination were a suitability determination appealable to the Board under 5 CFR Part 731, the appellant's resignation prior to the termination divested the Board of possible jurisdiction over the appeal).

<p class="Body-Text">Even if OPM initiates no action against an employee for reasons related to suitability, and if the agency does not seek to remove the appellant during probation, the agency may still take action against the employee for preappointment reasons; however, the agency's action is then adjudicated under the "efficiency of the service" standard. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dew v. Halaby</span>, 317 F.2d 582, 584 (D.C. Cir. 1963). [Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-094.html#sec8-94">Lack of Suitability for Continued Employment</a>."]</p>
