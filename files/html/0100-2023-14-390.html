<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-391"><span class="space">7.</span> Protection Against Involuntary Reassignments</h4>
<p class="noindent">There may be circumstances involving directed reassignments that employees seek to either avoid entirely or mitigate as to personal impact. <span class="Italic">NTEU and NRC</span>, 47 FLRA 370, 387 (1993), determined to be partially negotiable protections established in Proposal 6:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[1]&#x2003;In the event that the NRC determines that a resident inspector must be reassigned to another location for reasons related to loss of objectivity, the NRC will provide a "list of vacant sites for which the employee is qualified." [2] From these vacant sites, the inspector shall be allowed to submit his/her top three (3) choices for reassignment.[3] The NRC shall reassign the inspector to one of his/her top three (3) choices if at all possible.[4] If the NRC determines it cannot grant one of the inspector's top three (3) choices, it shall document the reasons why.[5] Absent just cause, the inspector will be permitted to select two additional choices from the above referenced "list." [6] The final reassignment decision will be made from among the employees['] selections off of the "list of vacant sites."</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NRC</span> pronounced negotiable those protections that minimized the impact of but that did not preclude a reassignment, 47 FLRA at 389-96:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">First, Second, Fourth and Fifth Sentences</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 6 establishes procedures that the Agency will observe in reassigning to another work site employees whose objectivity has been questioned.&#x2003;The first, second, fourth, and fifth sentences of Proposal 6 merely prescribe certain steps that management will take to afford inspectors an opportunity to indicate to management their preferences for reassignment. These sentences, respectively, would only: (1) require the Agency, when it decides that an inspector must be reassigned to another location based on a loss-of-objectivity determination, to provide the inspector with a list of vacant sites for which the employee is qualified; (2) permit the inspector to submit his or her top three choices for reassignment to the Agency; (3) require the Agency, if it cannot grant one of the inspector's three choices, to provide an explanation; and (4) permit the inspector, should the Agency reject the three choices, to select two additional choices from the list of vacant sites, absent just cause by the Agency for denying the request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These portions of the proposal do not require the assignment of inspectors to positions at work sites chosen by the inspectors.&#x2003;Rather, they simply establish procedures that allow an affected inspector a chance to review a list of vacancies compiled by the Agency for which management has determined that the employee is qualified, and to inform the Agency of the vacancies on the list where he or she prefers to be reassigned. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, International Council of U.S. Marshals Service Locals and Department of Justice, U.S. Marshals Service</span>, 4 FLRA 384, 389-90 (1980) (proposal establishing procedures for the consideration of employees for lateral transfer or reassignment constituted negotiable procedures under section 7106(b)(2) of the Statute). Under the first, second, fourth and fifth sentences of the proposal, after management has provided inspectors with the opportunity to designate the work sites to which they wish to be reassigned, the Agency would still have the discretion to assign the inspector to a position, and to work at any work site. That is, under these sentences, management could assign an inspector to work sites other than those on the list of vacancies. Consequently, we conclude that the first, second, fourth, and fifth sentences of Proposal 6 do not directly interfere with management's right to assign employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute. We find that those sentences constitute negotiable procedures under section 7106(b)(2) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Third Sentence</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals which impose substantive conditions on management's rights directly interfere with management's exercise of those rights. Specifically, proposals that condition the exercise of a management right on whether the exercise of the right is "possible" directly interfere with that right.... The third sentence of Proposal 6 requires the Agency to reassign a resident inspector to one of his or her top three choices, "if at all possible." As worded, the third sentence of Proposal 6 obligates management to assign a resident inspector to one of the employee's three choices, if it could do so, and as such, dictates to management, in some situations, the positions and the work to which management can reassign an inspector. By so dictating, the proposal imposes a substantive condition on management's exercise of its rights to assign employees and assign work and, thus, directly interferes with management's rights under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the third sentence of Proposal 6 directly interferes with management's right to assign employees and assign work, it is negotiable only if it is an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section <span id="page_907"></span>7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Applying the analytical framework established in <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, we find that the third sentence is an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Specifically, we find that it is reasonably foreseeable that the employees to whom the proposal applies are employees who would be adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">Office of the Chief Counsel, IRS</span>, 960 F.2d at 1071. The Union explains that the proposal is intended as an arrangement for resident inspectors who are subject to reassignment based on an Agency determination that the inspector has lost the requisite objectivity to perform his or her duties at the current work site. The Union asserts that the proposal affords unit inspectors who are adversely affected by management's decision to reassign them input into where they will be relocated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, consistent with the Union's statements, that the employees to whom the third sentence of Proposal 6 would apply are inspectors who, it is reasonably foreseeable, would be adversely affected by management's decision, based on an evaluation of the objectivity with which they have performed their duties, to reassign them to another work site. We also find that the third sentence is designed to benefit those inspectors by allowing them an opportunity to provide input into where they will be relocated. The third sentence of Proposal 6 would ameliorate the adverse effect of the reassignment on inspectors' professional and personal lives by requiring management, if at all possible, to reassign the inspectors to one of their three choices. Specifically, the proposal allows the inspector to attempt to affect the Agency's decision and, thus, possibly avoid assignment to an undesirable work site. Accordingly, for the reasons stated in connection with our analysis of Proposal 5, we find that the third sentence of Proposal 6 constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by management's exercise of its rights to direct employees and assign work, under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute, through the evaluation of employees' performance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the burden imposed by the proposal on the exercise of management's rights, we note that although the third sentence obligates the Agency to reassign an inspector to a work site among those which the inspector has designated, if it is possible to do so, the judgment as to the availability of the position and the qualifications of inspectors needed to perform the work of the position is reserved to management. In this regard, we note the Union's explanation that under the proposal management would create the list of vacant sites for which the Agency has determined that an inspector is qualified. The Union's explanation is consistent with the wording of the proposal. Consequently, we will adopt that interpretation for purposes of this decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Interpreted in this manner, we find that the work sites designated by an inspector would come from a list of vacancies for which management has determined the inspector is qualified. That is, the list of vacant sites from which an inspector designates his or her three choices reflects management's determination as to the availability of positions and the qualifications of inspectors needed to perform the work of those positions. Thus, the burden imposed by the third sentence on management's rights is reduced because, at the point that the inspector is allowed to designate three work sites, management already has determined appropriate vacancies for which the inspector is qualified.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the sentence would not impose on management an absolute requirement that it reassign the inspector to one of the work sites which the inspector has designated. That is, in situations where it may not be possible to assign an inspector to one of his or her designated choices because the employee has specialized skills that are needed elsewhere, including sites that are not on the list prepared by management, management would not be obligated to reassign the inspector to one of those designated choices. For example, in a case where an inspector has designated his or her three choices and prior to management acting on these choices an emergency situation arises at a work site not on the list prepared by management which management determines requires that inspector's specialized skills, management could determine that it was not at all possible to reassign the inspector to his or her designated choices. Also, if management determines after having examined the inspector's three choices that for mission-related reasons the employee's skills were more suited for a work site not included in the employee's three choices, management could determine that it was not at all possible to reassign the employee to those three choices. Thus, if management demonstrates that it is not possible to reassign the inspector to one of the three designated work sites, management would not be obligated to do so....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, by requiring the Agency, if it is at all possible, to reassign a resident inspector to one of the designated work sites, the third sentence of Proposal 6 affords a substantial benefit to affected inspectors. The reassignment of an inspector based on a determination of loss of objectivity affects not only the inspector, but also that inspector's family.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The inspector would be uprooted by the reassignment and would incur the disruption and hardships associated with moving in such circumstances.&#x2003;By requiring the Agency, if at all possible, to reassign the inspector to one of the work sites designated by the inspector, the third sentence would benefit the inspector by giving him or her significant input into where he or she will be relocated. In this manner, the third sentence would benefit employees by possibly avoiding their assignment to undesirable work sites and thereby reducing the disruption and hardships associated with such an involuntary move.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Balancing the competing interests of the inspectors and the Agency, we conclude that the benefit to inspectors afforded by the proposal outweighs the burden placed by the proposal on the Agency. Consequently, we find that the third sentence of Proposal 6 does not excessively interfere with management's rights and is a negotiable appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Sixth Sentence</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The sixth sentence would require the Agency to reassign the inspector to one of the five work sites designated by that inspector, under the second and fourth sentences, from among the list of vacant sites. Because the sixth sentence requires the Agency to assign the inspector to one of the five sites selected by that inspector from the list of vacant sites, the sentence limits the positions to which an inspector can be reassigned to those at the five work sites designated by the inspector and requires management to assign the inspector to a position at one of the five work sites. Thus, if management determined that the inspector's particular qualifications and skills were needed to perform the duties of a position at a work site not listed as one of the inspector's five choices, management could not assign the inspector to that position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals that limit the positions to which management can reassign an employee to those chosen by an employee directly interfere with management's right to assign employees.... [B]y limiting management to reassigning the inspector to positions and to duties only at the five work sites selected by the inspector, the sixth sentence of the proposal directly interferes with management's right to assign employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We turn next to the Union's contention that the proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Applying the analytical framework established by <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, we find that the proposal does not constitute an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the purposes of this decision, we will assume, without deciding, that the proposal constitutes an arrangement....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After balancing the competing interests of the employees and the Agency, we conclude that the sixth sentence would excessively interfere with the exercise of management's rights to assign employees and assign work. The sixth sentence of Proposal 6 restricts the positions to which the Agency could assign the inspector to those located at only the five vacant sites designated by the inspector. Thus, the Agency could not assign the inspector to perform the work of positions at work sites which the inspector has not designated. If, for example, the Agency decided that the inspector was most qualified to work at a particular plant and that it needed to assign the inspector to perform the work of a position located at a particular plant that was not designated by the inspector, the sixth sentence would prevent the Agency from doing so. Therefore, the sixth sentence would seriously impair the Agency's ability to manage its work force and determine the sites at which Agency personnel are needed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the sixth sentence is different from the third sentence of Proposal 6.&#x2003;The third sentence of Proposal 6, unlike the sixth sentence, would not impose on management an absolute requirement that it reassign the inspector to one of the work sites designated by the inspector. Rather, under the third sentence, if management demonstrates that it is not at all possible to reassign the employee to one of the work sites designated by the inspector, management would not be obligated to do so. Thus, under the third sentence, if management concludes that it is not at all possible to reassign an inspector to one of the three locations chosen by the inspector because that inspector has skills that are needed at a different location, the Agency would not be obligated to reassign the inspector. The sixth sentence does not allow management any discretion. The sixth sentence would obligate management to reassign an inspector to one of the five work sites designated by that inspector regardless of whether management demonstrated that it would not be at all possible to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that a reassignment under the circumstances of this proposal would disrupt the lives of the inspector and his or her family.&#x2003;The sixth sentence of Proposal 6 benefits inspectors by giving them some control over where they are reassigned. The sixth sentence would ameliorate the adverse affect of the reassignment, which resulted from <span id="page_908"></span>a determination of loss of objectivity, on those inspectors' professional and personal lives by requiring management to reassign the inspectors to one of five work sites designated by the inspectors. We find, however, that the benefit to inspectors of limiting the work sites to which they can be reassigned does not outweigh the burden imposed on management's ability to use inspectors' skills where they are needed. Consequently, we find that the sixth sentence of Proposal 6 excessively interferes with management's rights to assign employees and assign work. We conclude, therefore, that this sentence is not an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
