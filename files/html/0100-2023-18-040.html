<h3 class="h3" id="sec11-41"><span class="space">A.</span> BASIC RIGHTS</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 7513 sets up reply rights for covered employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Cause and procedure</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, an agency may take an action covered by this subchapter against an employee only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;An employee against whom an action is proposed is entitled to--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;at least 30 days' advance written notice, unless there is reasonable cause to believe the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed, stating the specific reasons for the proposed action;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;a reasonable time, but not less than 7 days, to answer orally and in writing and to furnish affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of the answer;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;be represented by an attorney or other representative; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)&#x2003;a written decision and the specific reasons therefor at the earliest practicable date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;An agency may provide, by regulation, for a hearing which may be in lieu of or in addition to the opportunity to answer provided under subsection (b)(2) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;An employee against whom an action is taken under this section is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under section 7701 of this title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;Copies of the notice of proposed action, the answer of the employee when written, a summary thereof when made orally, the notice of decision and reasons therefor, and any order effecting an action covered by this subchapter, together with any supporting material, shall be maintained by the agency and shall be furnished to the Board upon its request and to the employee affected upon the employee's request.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM regulations implement the statute, 5 CFR 752.404 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Procedures</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Statutory entitlements.</span> An employee against whom action is proposed under this subpart is entitled to the procedures provided in 5 U.S.C. 7513(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Notice of proposed action.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;An employee against whom an action is proposed is entitled to at least 30 days' advance written notice unless there is an exception pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. The notice must state the specific reason(s) for the proposed action and inform the employee of his or her right to review the material which is relied on to support the reasons for action given in the notice. The notice must further include detailed information with respect to any right to appeal the action pursuant to section 1097(b)(2)(A) of Public Law 115--91, the forums in which the employee may file an appeal, and any limitations on the rights of the employee that would apply because of the forum in which the employee decides to file.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;When some but not all employees in a given competitive level are being furloughed, the notice of proposed action must state the basis for selecting a particular employee for furlough, as well as the reasons for the furlough.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Under ordinary circumstances, an employee whose removal or suspension, including indefinite suspension, has been proposed will remain in a duty status in his or her regular position during the advance notice period. In those rare circumstances where the agency determines that the employee's continued presence in the workplace during the notice period may pose a threat to the employee or others, result in loss of or damage to Government property, or otherwise jeopardize legitimate Government interests, the agency may elect one or a combination of the following alternatives:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;Assigning the employee to duties where he or she is no longer a threat to safety, the agency mission, or to Government property;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;Allowing the employee to take leave, or carrying him or her in an appropriate leave status (annual, sick, leave without pay, or absence without leave) if the employee has absented himself or herself from the worksite without requesting leave;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iii)&#x2003;Curtailing the notice period when the agency can invoke the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iv)&#x2003;Placing the employee in a paid, nonduty status for such time as is necessary to effect the action. After publication of regulations for 5 U.S.C. 6329b, and the subsequent agency implementation period in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6329b, an agency may place the employee in a notice leave status when applicable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Employee's answer.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;An employee may answer orally and in writing except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The agency must give the employee a reasonable amount of official time to review the material relied on to support its proposed action, to prepare an answer orally and in writing, and to secure affidavits, if the employee is in an active duty status. The agency may require the employee to furnish any answer to the proposed action, and affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of the answer, within such time as would be reasonable, but not less than 7 days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The agency will designate an official to hear the employee's oral answer who has authority either to make or recommend a final decision on the proposed adverse action. The right to answer orally in person does not include the right to a formal hearing with examination of witnesses unless the agency provides for such hearing in its regulations. Under 5 U.S.C. 7513(c), the agency may, in its regulations, provide a hearing in place of or in addition to the opportunity for written and oral answer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;If the employee wishes the agency to consider any medical condition which may contribute to a conduct, performance, or leave problem, the employee must be given a reasonable time to furnish medical documentation (as defined in &#x00A7; 339.104 of this chapter) of the condition. Whenever possible, the employee will supply such documentation within the time limits allowed for an answer.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Section 7513(b) of title 5, U.S. Code, authorizes an exception to the 30 days' advance written notice when the agency has reasonable cause to believe that the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed and is proposing a removal or suspension, including indefinite suspension. This notice exception is commonly referred to as the "crime provision." This provision may be invoked even in the absence of judicial action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The advance written notice and opportunity to answer are not required for furlough without pay due to unforeseeable circumstances, such as sudden breakdowns in equipment, acts of God, or sudden emergencies requiring immediate curtailment of activities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Representation.</span> Section 7513(b)(3) of title 5, U.S. Code, provides that an employee covered by this part is entitled to be represented by an attorney or other representative. An agency may disallow as an employee's representative an individual whose activities as representative would cause a conflict of interest or position, or an employee of the agency whose release from his or official position would give rise to unreasonable costs or whose priority work assignments preclude his or her release.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;Agency review of medical information. When medical information is supplied by the employee pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the agency may, if authorized, require a medical examination under the criteria of &#x00A7; 339.301 of this chapter, or otherwise, at its option, offer a medical examination in accordance with the criteria of &#x00A7; 339.302 of this chapter. If the employee has the requisite years of service under the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees' Retirement System, <span id="Page_3167"></span>the agency must provide information concerning disability retirement. The agency must be aware of the affirmative obligations of the provisions of 29 CFR 1614.203, which require reasonable accommodation of a qualified individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(g)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Agency decision</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;In arriving at this decision, the agency will consider only the reasons specified in the notice of proposed action and any answer of the employee or his or her representative, or both, made to a designated official and any medical documentation reviewed under paragraph (f) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The notice must specify in writing the reasons for the decision and advise the employee of any appeal or grievance rights under &#x00A7; 752.405 of this part. The agency must deliver the notice of decision to the employee on or before the effective date of the action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(h)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Applications for disability retirement.</span> Section 831.1204(e) of this chapter provides that an employee's application for disability retirement need not preclude or delay any other appropriate personnel action.

<p class="Body-Text">The basic statutory elements of the adverse action process under the Reform Act--principally the right to be informed of charges, the right to reply to those charges, and the right to a post-termination hearing--were determined to be constitutionally firm in <span class="Italic">DeSarno v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 761 F.2d 657, 660 (Fed. Cir. 1985), in turn relying on a 1985 Supreme Court decision involving a municipal employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Educ. v. Loudermill</span>, 105 S. Ct. 1487 (1985), the Court set forth the process due a public employee before removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The essential requirements of due process...are notice and an opportunity to respond. The opportunity to present reasons, either in person or in writing, why proposed action should not be taken is a fundamental due process requirement.... The tenured public employee is entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story.... To require more than this prior to termination would intrude to an unwarranted extent on the government's interest in quickly removing an unsatisfactory employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Due process requirements are met by notice of charges and an adequate opportunity to respond. There is no requirement that an employee must also be given notice of all of the consequences that will flow from his removal, such as loss of retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">Harris v. OPM</span>, 273 Fed. Appx. 932, 936 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Shelton v. EEOC</span>, 357 F. Supp. 3 (W.D.

<p class="Body-Text">Through 1991, it was harmful error to separate an employee without the procedural protections due him under 5 USC 7513. <span class="Italic">Kerr v. Nat'l Endowment for Arts,</span> 5 MSPR 260, 262, 5 MSPB 299 (1981). Even a probationer had some procedural rights: if an employee was removed without basic procedural protections, e.g., notice and an opportunity to respond to a probationary termination based on preappointment conditions, the removal would be reversed despite agency contentions that it would have terminated the appellant even if she had been afforded those rights. An agency action appealable to the Board could not be sustained based on how the agency might have acted had it followed proper procedures. <span class="Italic">Padilla v. EEOC</span>, 18 MSPR 121, 126-27 (1983) (citing <span class="Italic">Horne v. MSPB</span>, 684 F.2d 155, 157-58 (D.C. Cir. 1982)); <span class="Italic">Baracco v.

<p class="Body-Text">Before 1991, the Board's analysis of the impact of errors in the reply process <span id="Page_3168"></span>followed statutory procedures. The explanation provided in <span class="Italic">Baracco v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 15 MSPR 112, 123 n.9 (1983), was typical:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recognized, however, that an agency's complete failure to provide any of the procedural protections of 5 USC 7513 in effecting an adverse action constitutes harmful error. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 5 MSPB 299 (1981); <span class="Italic">Morrow v. Department of the Army</span>, 4 MSPB 494, 497 (1980); <span class="Italic">White v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 4 MSPB 11, 13 (1980). This is because an agency's total failure to follow any of the procedures of section 7513 impairs an employee's ability to defend against an adverse action and otherwise affects the outcome before the agency. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Horne v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 684 F.2d 155 (D.C. Cir. 1982); and <span class="Italic">Wright v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 11 MSPB 167 (1982) (an agency's reduction-in-force (RIF) action may not be affirmed based on how the agency might have acted had it followed proper RIF procedures, and the agency's actions in demoting the employees without following any formal RIF procedures was improper and reversible).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1991, the Board shifted to a constitutional analysis. In <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 672, 681, 685 (1991), the Board reformed its thinking on procedural due process, concluding that if a tenured employee is fired as a probationer, minimal due process has been provided to the employee as long as the employee has notice of the charges and an opportunity to respond. The employee must then show that he was harmed by the failure to receive reply rights statutorily granted to a tenured employee. The Board continued, however, to adhere to the notion that a removal is void if at least minimal due process is not provided to the employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A competitive service employee who has completed his probationary period, like the appellant in the instant appeal, has a constitutionally protected property interest in his employment.... When such an employee is being deprived of a constitutionally protected property interest, the right to minimum due process is "absolute" in the sense that it does not depend on the merits of his claim.... Thus, we conclude that an appealable agency action taken without affording an appellant prior notice of the charges, an explanation of the agency's evidence, and an opportunity to respond, must be reversed because such action violates his constitutional right to minimum due process....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[<span class="Italic">Stephen</span> is examined in Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-106.html#sec1-105">Harmful Error Analysis: Lack of Proper Advance Notice, Other Procedural Error</a>" involving termination of probationers.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Greene v. DHHS</span>, 48 MSPR 161, 166 (1991), the agency recorded the appellant's separation by retirement after refusing to permit the employee to withdraw that retirement. The action, treated as a constructive removal, was reversed for lack of constitutional due process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Stephen</span>, the Board relied on the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532 (1985), to find that if an agency fails to provide prior notice of the charges against the appellant, an explanation of its evidence, and an opportunity to respond, its action must be reversed because it violates the employee's right to minimum due process.... However, if the agency's action satisfies the minimum due process requirements and is lawful in its entirety, the Board will then analyze any failure by the agency to provide the required procedures under the harmful procedural error standard....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, because the agency separated the appellant from his position on the basis of his application for disability retirement, it did not afford him any notice, explanation, or opportunity to respond to its action against him. Accordingly, in light of our decision in <span class="Italic">Stephen</span>, we find that the appellant's removal must be reversed for denial of due process.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Redus v. USPS</span>, 88 MSPR 193, 199 &#x00B6; 17 (2001), reaffirmed the right to minimal due process as a constitutional right, reversed a removal when notice and an opportunity to refute charges were not provided:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the agency effected the appellant's removal without affording her the required statutory procedural protections of prior notice, an explanation of the agency's evidence, and an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">See Strope,</span> 71 MSPR at 439; 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b). Accordingly, the removal abridges the appellant's constitutional right to minimum due process and must be reversed. <span class="Italic">See Stephen v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 47 MSPR 672, 680-81 (1991) (an appealable agency action, taken without affording the appellant with prior notice of the charges, an explanation of the agency's evidence, and an opportunity to respond, must be reversed because such action violates his constitutional right to minimum due process).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Strope v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 429, 439 (1996) (removal was reversed for a lack of due process when the agency acted without providing the required statutory procedural protections of prior notice, an explanation of the agency's evidence, and an opportunity to respond). The <span class="Italic">Stephen</span> analysis is applied to other types of adverse actions. A noticeless suspension will be set aside for lack of constitutional due process. One day of advance notice of an indefinite suspension, with no opportunity to reply, was inadequate process; the indefinite suspension was reversed. <span class="Italic">Perrin v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 117, 119 (1991); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 51 MSPR 542, 546 (1991) (enforced leave without adequate notice was improper for lack of constitutional due process; characterization by the AJ of agency procedures as harmful error was technically incorrect but not determinative). Still, there may be a problem regarding what constitutes an action appealable to the Board. If the agency characterizes a period of absence as AWOL instead of as a suspension, the Board may decline jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McNeil v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 12, 14-15 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although an individual may qualify as an employee by reason of length of service, if separation from federal service results from a nonappealable action, e.g., the expiration of a term appointment, there is no due process right to a proposal and an opportunity to respond to the action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Joseph v.
