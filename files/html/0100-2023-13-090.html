<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-90"><span class="space">a.</span> Leave Status Voluntarily Assumed; Failure to Provide Medical Documentation, Perform Available Work</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pittman, supra,</span> was distinguished from the situation of an employee who could perform light duty but declined to do so, and who was then told to clock out by his supervisor for the alleged failure to work. The Federal Circuit explained the distinction between involuntarily and voluntarily assumed leave status, <span class="Italic">Holloway v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/19931212993f2d21911150">993 F.2d 219</a>, 221-22 (Fed. Cir. 1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">... As this court has held, the dispositive inquiry in determining whether there has been a "suspension" for purposes of this section is whether the employee's absence from the agency was voluntary or involuntary. <span class="Italic">Perez v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 931 F.2d 853, 855 (Fed. Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Pittman v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 832 F.2d 598, 600 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Pittman</span>, the question was whether an agency's decision to place on "enforced leave"--suspension of more than 14 days without pay and duties--an employee with an acknowledged physical incapacity was within the jurisdiction of the MSPB to review. The agency's action was premised on the employee's inability to perform any of the then available work assignments. The argument was that the suspension was not "disciplinary" in the same way an agency response to psychological difficulty would be, and therefore was not within the terms of the statute providing for review of suspensions "for disciplinary reasons." 5 USC 7501(2). This court rejected the distinction and held the suspension reviewable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Perez</span>, the employee took sick leave and requested an indefinite extension of his sick leave due to physical problems. The agency requested further justification for the request, and, after not receiving it, instructed the employee to return to work or he would be placed on absent without leave (AWOL) status. After no response was received by the date indicated, the agency placed the employee on AWOL status. When the employee later challenged this action before the MSPB, the Board held it was without jurisdiction over the claim. We affirmed: "where an employee has voluntarily absented himself from work, placement in a non-pay or AWOL status, even for longer than 14 days, is not a constructive suspension or other agency action appealable to the MSPB." <span class="Italic">Perez</span>, 931 F.2d at 855.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Holloway appears to argue that he did not voluntarily absent himself because the agency did not give him a work assignment consistent with his physical needs, needs he showed to exist by medical opinion. Presumably this brings him within the scope of <span class="Italic">Pittman</span>, rather than <span class="Italic">Perez</span>. We think not. The agency considered Mr. Holloway's medical opinion, and concluded it was insufficient to establish his claimed need. The MSPB found no error in the agency's action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ specifically found that Mr. Holloway's period of absence was due to his unjustifiable failure to perform his assigned duties. According to the AJ, the agency had given Mr. Holloway a limited assignment, mail sorting or "casing," consistent with a job-related back injury he had suffered in 1988, the agency had never denied Mr. Holloway work pursuant to this assignment, Mr. Holloway acknowledged he was physically able to perform such work, and Mr. Holloway had been ordered to leave the premises and placed on nonduty, nonpay status on July 3, 1991 only after he had refused to perform his duties pursuant to this limited assignment. Thus, according to the AJ, the period of unemployment was voluntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ further found that Mr. Holloway's proffered excuse for his failure to perform his assigned duties--the agency's failure to provide him with an even more limited assignment or light duty due to the medical condition, carpal tunnel syndrome, he was allegedly suffering from--was unpersuasive. The AJ noted that Mr. Holloway did not even request a more limited assignment until <span class="Italic">after</span> July 3, 1991, that this request, once tendered, was denied, and that the denial was justifiable insofar as the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) had previously denied Mr. Holloway's request for workers' compensation benefits due to carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, in support of his position that his absence from work was justifiable, Mr. Holloway points to a medical opinion dated November 7, 1991 he obtained which recommended that his assignment be further limited due to carpal tunnel syndrome. However, there is no evidence the agency ever adopted or approved of this opinion. In fact, a medical opinion dated December 4, 1991 solicited by the agency apparently in response to the November 7, 1991 opinion obtained by Mr. Holloway simply recommended that Mr. Holloway "should continue on restrictions at work." This reference is apparently to the limited assignment of mail sorting Mr. Holloway had already been given.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Holloway also points to the agency's certification on November 15, 1991 that Mr. Holloway was available to "return to light duty." Mr. Holloway appears to be arguing that the agency, in taking such action, tacitly agreed to provide him with a more limited assignment. However, other evidence of record, including a request by Mr. Holloway's superior which apparently prompted the agency's action, supports a contrary view, <span class="Italic">viz.</span>, that the agency, in taking such action, was simply indicating that Mr. Holloway would not be available in the foreseeable future to return to work <span class="Italic">without duty restrictions</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But if an employee voluntarily undertakes leave status by reason of a medical condition and then presents himself as ready to return to work with a physician's clearance in hand, the employer risks an enforced leave claim if it does not accept the employee back at the workplace, <span class="Italic">Phillips v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant requested advanced sick leave on January 11, 2007. There is no indication in the record that the agency took any action to cause the appellant to make that request. We therefore find that the appellant initiated his absence beginning on January 12, 2007. An initially voluntary absence can subsequently become involuntary, however, and vice versa. <span class="Italic">See Lewis v.

The appellant submitted documentation from his doctor clearing him to return to work on January 29, 2007, but the agency did not permit him to do so (affidavit of the appellant). We therefore find that, as of January 29, 2007, the appellant's absence became involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Justice v. Department of the Navy,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 379, &#x00B6; 13 (2001) (an appellant's absence, which was initially voluntary, became involuntary when he reported for duty with a doctor's note clearing him for full duty and the agency refused to allow him to return to work).

<p class="Body-Text">If the employee takes sick leave but fails to provide adequate medical justification, the employer may place the employee on AWOL, and that does not become a constructive suspension, <span class="Italic">Perez v. MSPB</span>, 931 F.2d 853, 855 (Fed. Cir. 1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 5 defines "suspension" as "the placing of an employee, for disciplinary reasons, in a temporary status without duties and pay." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7501(2). Our cases have also recognized, however, that certain personnel actions, though not termed "suspensions," may remove an employee's duties and cause a loss of pay, thus producing the same effects as actual suspensions. Such "constructive suspensions" are within the jurisdiction of the MSPB. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Pittman v. Merit Systems Protection Bd.,</span> 832 F.2d 598 (Fed. Cir. 1987), we held that the Army's placement of an employee on "enforced leave" due to his medical condition, which prevented him from performing in any available position, constituted a suspension of more than 14 days and that the MSPB therefore had jurisdiction. Perez argues that <span class="Italic">Pittman</span> controls this case. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Perez, unlike the petitioner in <span class="Italic">Pittman,</span> was never placed on an <span class="Italic">enforced</span> leave of absence. Rather, the Army transferred him from sick leave to AWOL status because he failed to comply in a timely fashion with repeated instructions to return to work or submit additional documentation and because his documentation was unsatisfactory. It was his choice, not the agency's, to remain away from work. We hold that in a situation such as this, where an employee has voluntarily absented himself from work, placement in a non-pay or AWOL status, even for longer than 14 days, is not a constructive suspension or other agency action appealable to the MSPB.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Our holding is thus consistent with <span class="Italic">Bucci v. Department of Education,</span> 36 M.S.P.R. 489 (1988), which was relied on by the Board in its decision in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bucci v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Trobovic v. MSPB</span>, 232 Fed. Appx. 958, 962-63 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), summarized decisions involving the situation of the employee who initiates absence because of illness or injury, exhausts his leave balances, is placed on AWOL, and is then told that he must present adequate medical documentation to return to work. <span class="Italic">Trobovic</span> determined that the employer does not constructively suspend the employee by maintaining the employee on AWOL while the employer evaluates the employee's medical documentation, if the delay involved is reasonable:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Mr. Trobovic argues that he was absent from his job when he was placed in AWOL status because of a traumatic injury that kept him from working. In <span class="Italic">Pittman v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 832 F.2d 598 (Fed. Cir. 1987), we held that the Board had jurisdiction to review an agency's decision to place an employee in nonpay, nonduty status because that action was taken on account of the employee's physical incapacity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 600. The Board, however, argues that the present case is more accurately compared to <span class="Italic">Perez v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 931 F.2d 853 (Fed. Cir. 1991). There, we explained that <span class="Italic">Pittman</span> is limited to situations in which the agency acknowledges the employee's physical inability to work; in such a case, the denial of pay and duties is not deemed to be result of the employee's voluntary conduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 855. In <span class="Italic">Perez,</span> by contrast, the agency placed an absentee employee on nonpay, nonduty status because the employee did not provide satisfactory medical documentation of his inability to work. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 854. We held that on those facts the suspension of pay was due to the employee's choice not to either return to work or furnish sufficient medical documentation excusing his absence. Accordingly, we found that there was no constructive suspension and no basis for the Board to review the suspension of pay. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 855.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our holding in <span class="Italic">Perez</span> covered even the period during which the agency was evaluating the employee's medical documentation. 931 F.2d at 854. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Holloway v. United States Postal Service,</span> we applied <span class="Italic">Perez</span> to the 27-day-plus period during which the agency was considering the employee's submitted medical opinion documenting his incapacity. 993 F.2d 219, 221-22 (Fed. Cir. 1993). As we noted in <span class="Italic">Holloway,</span> however, the Board found the agency's ultimate rejection of the employee's medical documentation to be without error. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 221. And in <span class="Italic">Perez,</span> we simply stated that the employee's medical documentation of his incapacity to work "was unsatisfactory," apparently reciting the agency's unchallenged conclusion to that effect. 931 F.2d at 855.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Mr. Trobovic alleges two facts that would distinguish his case from <span class="Italic">Perez</span> and <span class="Italic">Holloway.</span> First, he alleges that the GSA's rejection of his medical documentation of his inability to work was erroneous because he had provided "sufficient medical documentation to justify being placed in an approved leave status." But unlike the relatively straightforward question whether Mr. Trobovic was denied access to his workplace during normal working hours, the question whether the GSA erred in finding insufficient Mr. Trobovic's medical evidence of his inability to work is an ultimate fact requiring complex subsidiary factfinding. We therefore agree with the administrative judge that Mr. Trobovic's conclusory allegation of GSA error, without more, cannot be deemed nonfrivolous. Thus, the administrative judge properly dismissed that allegation as a basis for establishing the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Cf. Briscoe v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 55 F.3d 1571, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1995) ("Although an appellant need not prove her entire case before she is entitled to a hearing, the board may request sufficient evidence to determine if, in the first instance, there is any support for what otherwise might be bald allegations.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, Mr. Trobovic alleges that the GSA deliberately failed to consider his medical documentation for 71 days. It may be that an agency can constructively suspend an employee on nonpay, nonduty status by failing to evaluate the employee's medical documentation of his inability to work if the period of delay is so lengthy as to show a deliberate delay. We hold, however, that the alleged 71-day delay in this case does not rise to that level. The administrative judge did not err in dismissing this allegation as a basis for establishing the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed its result on a petition for reconsideration based on an OWCP determination that the appellant suffered a compensable injury. The evidence before the agency at the time of the constructive suspension, not the later OWCP determination, controlled, <span class="Italic">Trobovic v. MSPB</span>, 233 Fed. Appx. 992, 993 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for rehearing, Mr. Trobovic informs us that on December 7, 2005, the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs determined that Mr. Trobovic was compensably injured. That information was not before the Board when it closed the record. But even assuming that Mr. Trobovic's representation is accurate and that it is open for us to consider, it does not establish that the GSA involuntarily suspended Mr. Trobovic by placing him on nonpay status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Holloway v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 993 F.2d 219, 221-22 (Fed. Cir. 1993), and <span class="Italic">Perez v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 931 F.2d 853, 854 (Fed. Cir. 1991), we held that a government agency does not involuntarily suspend an absentee employee by placing the employee on nonpay status pending satisfactory medical documentation of his inability to work. For purposes of that rule, the agency must be reasonable in finding the employee's medical documentation to be unconvincing. But an agency may reasonably reach that conclusion even if another governmental body, such as the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, finds the same medical documentation sufficient to warrant compensation. Mr. Trobovic's allegations before the Board and his doctor's report contain only general, conclusory statements about Mr. Trobovic's injury and the resulting limitations on his ability to perform his duties. The GSA did not act unreasonably in refusing to find that medical documentation sufficient to excuse Mr. Trobovic's absence from work. The rule of <span class="Italic">Holloway</span> and <span class="Italic">Perez</span> thus applies.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Vickers v. Powell</span>, 493 F.3d 186, 192-93 (D.C.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ross v. USPS</span>, 353 Fed. Appx. 441, 444-45 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP), reviewed the jurisdictional analysis of the employee who leaves work of his or her own initiative because of a medical condition and then is unable or unwilling to return to work with a job modification offered by the employer pending receipt of medical documentation from the employee concerning his fitness for regular duty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Placing an employee on enforced leave without pay for greater than fourteen days, even if not termed a "suspension," may constitute a constructive suspension that allows the employee to appeal to the MSPB under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(2) and 7513(d). <span class="Italic">Perez v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 931 F.2d 853 (Fed. Cir. 1991). "Suspension" is defined as "the placing of an employee, for disciplinary reasons, in a temporary status without duties and pay." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7501(2). An employee who voluntarily absents himself from the workplace, however, even due to a valid medical consideration, is not constructively suspended because the leave is not enforced. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 855. In short, for a constructive suspension, an employee must show by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she was "ready, willing, and able to work" but was not permitted to do so. <span class="Italic">Adams v. Dep't of Transp.,</span> 735 F.2d 488, 492 (Fed. Cir. 1984); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Ross asserts that the Board's ruling is not supported by substantial evidence because "[t]he record contains post-suspension medical evidence from my current treating physician, reaffirming a prior medical opinion that I was medically able to perform my limited duty assignment." The record indeed reflects that, on October 24, 2007, Dr. Nolan indicated that Mr. Ross could perform work with restrictions. The record also shows that just a week later, on November 1, 2007, the USPS extended to Mr. Ross a limited duty job offer that he did not accept. Further, in December 2007, Dr. Nolan determined that Mr. Ross was not even capable of returning to a modified work status; he indicated for several months thereafter that Mr. Ross was "totally temporarily disabled," while also noting that Mr. Ross stated he was unable to return to work. In sum, Mr. Ross was offered a limited duty job assignment, but did not accept the assignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Ross also asserts that, after the August 13, 2007, meeting with Mr. O'Quinn, he was not given a "reasonable time to obtain" the medical documentation for his alleged work-related injury. First, the record demonstrates that the USPS ultimately gave Mr. Ross greater than two months to provide medical documentation supporting limited duty work assignments. Indeed, the USPS offered Mr. Ross a limited duty work assignment that he refused. Moreover, in the interim, the USPS also offered Mr. Ross light duty work that he also declined.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts show that Mr. Ross was given reasonable opportunities to show that he was entitled to a limited duty job offer. Indeed, he received such an offer, but he refused it allegedly due to his inability to perform. In sum, Mr. Ross voluntarily declined to work. Accordingly, the Board correctly found no constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">See Adams</span>, 735 F.2d at 492 (Constructive suspension requires that the employee show by a preponderance of the evidence that he was "ready, willing, and able to work.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the USPS did not constructively suspend Mr. Ross, the Board did not have jurisdiction to entertain his appeal. This court has found on other occasions that no constructive suspension exists when an absentee employee is placed in a non-pay status by an agency, pending receipt of satisfactory medical documentation regarding his or her ability to work. <span class="Italic">Holloway v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 993 F.2d 219, 221-22 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Perez,</span> 931 F.2d at 854-55.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brosovic v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 99-3267), reiterated the theme that an employee who voluntarily initiates an absence for medical reasons and then does not respond to an agency's requests for medical documentation or return to work is not the victim of a constructive adverse action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2068"></span>Under the controlling law and regulations, if the agency placed the appellant on enforced leave for more than 14 days, then this action is tantamount to an adverse action and appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Pittman v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 832 F.2d 598, 599-600 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.3 (a)(1). However, where absence is not enforced, but voluntary on the part of the employee, then her placement in a non-duty status is not an adverse action, and the Board lacks jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Perez v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 931 F.2d 853, 855 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Therefore, the pivotal question in determining whether an adverse action was taken against the appellant depends on who initiated the absence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that Brosovic has been in a non-duty, non-pay status since April 14, 1998, and that she has made no effort to return to her current work location. Furthermore, it is undisputed that Brosovic voluntarily took leave by submitting her leave request on April 14, 1998.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Perez</span>, Perez requested sick leave, for an indefinite period of time on January 8, 1990, for evaluation of arthritis. His request was initially approved, but on January 24, 1990, his immediate supervisor wrote to Perez questioning the justification for the indefinite sick leave and requesting that he either return to work and have his physician provide additional information so that special accommodations could be made for him, or, if he could not work at all, provide medical documentation of his doctor's diagnosis and prognosis. On March 14, 1990, the Army sent Perez another request for medical documentation, warning that if he did not respond within 15 days, his status would be changed from sick leave to AWOL and on April 2, after no information had been received, the Army placed Perez in AWOL status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit held in <span class="Italic">Perez</span> that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Perez, unlike the petitioner in <span class="Italic">Pittman</span>, was never placed on an <span class="Italic">enforced</span> leave of absence. Rather, the Army transferred him from sick leave to AWOL status because he failed to comply in a timely fashion with repeated instructions to return to work or submit additional documentation and because his documentation was unsatisfactory. It was his choice, not the agency's, to remain away from work. We hold that in a situation such as this, where an employee has voluntarily absented himself from work, placement in a non-pay or AWOL status, even for longer than 14 days, is not a constructive suspension or other agency action appealable to the MSPB.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's failure to complete the interactive process associated with an accommodation that could have returned her to work status left the agency without liability for an alleged suspension in <span class="italic">Sanchez-Alicea v. VA</span>, NY-0752-14-0197-I-1 (NP 11/18/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although various fact patterns may give rise to an appealable constructive removal or suspension, all such claims are premised on the proposition that an absence that appears to be voluntary actually is not. <span class="italic">Thomas v. Department of the Navy</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 628, &#x00B6; 12 (2016); <span class="italic">Rosario-Fabregas v.

To demonstrate that an absence from work was not voluntary, and is instead an actionable constructive suspension, an appellant must show that: (1) she lacked a meaningful choice in the matter; and (2) it was the agency's wrongful actions that deprived her of that choice. <span class="italic">E.g., Romero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 606, &#x00B6; 8 (2014). Assuming that the jurisdictional requirements of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 are otherwise met, proof of these two things is sufficient to establish Board jurisdiction. <span class="italic">Rosario-Fabregas</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="italic">Romero</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 606, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9. Our reviewing court has endorsed this approach. <span class="italic">Rosario-Fabregas</span>, 833 F.3d at 1346-47.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that the appellant lacked a meaningful choice with regard to her absence, satisfying the first prong of the analysis. <span class="italic">See e.g., Romero</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 606, &#x00B6; 9 (finding that once an employee is released to work with medical restrictions, an agency's decision not to return that employee to work deprives the employee of a meaningful choice in the matter); <span class="italic">Bean v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 8 (2013). The FMLA certification form that the appellant submitted released her to work with restrictions, and the agency did not return her. Nevertheless, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to establish the second prong of the analysis, i.e., that any wrongful action by the agency deprived her of that choice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The key to the second prong of this analysis is whether the agency acted improperly in refusing to allow the appellant to return to work. <span class="italic">Romero</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 606, &#x00B6; 8; Bean, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 13. The administrative judge found that despite the limited interactive process provided by the agency, the appellant's failure to appear for her scheduled meeting with the accommodation coordinator cut the interactive process short and precluded the exploration of any possible accommodation. The appellant argues on review that her failure to participate in the interactive process is not equivalent to a voluntary decision not to come to work. We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's failure to engage in the interactive process was ultimately the cause of her absence and not any improper agency action. <span class="italic">See Rosario-Fabregas</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-19. The appellant bears the burden of proving that an accommodation she seeks is reasonable. <span class="italic">Clemens v. Department of the Army</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 17 (2014). The appellant's refusal to meet with the reasonable accommodation coordinator was obstructive, not interactive. Both parties, including the appellant, are expected to engage in this interactive process in good faith. <span class="italic">See, e.g., Rehling v. City of Chicago</span>, 207 F.3d 1009, 1015-16 (7th Cir. 2000); <span class="italic">see also Simpson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 346, &#x00B6; 18 (2010) (finding that the appellant did not prove the denial of reasonable accommodation when he was unresponsive to the agency's good faith attempts to engage in the interactive process); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(3) (to determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation, an agency may need to "initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of the accommodation") (emphasis added). Thus, even assuming that the appellant is a qualified individual with a disability, her refusal to engage in the interactive process prevented the agency from identifying a reasonable accommodation. <span class="italic">Id.</span>; <span class="italic">see Miller v. Department of the Army</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-21 (2014) (finding an appellant frustrated the agency's reasonable accommodation efforts).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with the administrative judge that the section of the appellant's collective bargaining agreement (CBA) requiring the agency to make serious efforts to assign an employee to temporary light-duty work did not apply in the appellant's circumstances because OWCP denied her claim. On review, the appellant contends that the CBA section does not require that an OWCP claim be approved before the agency may determine if a temporary accommodation can be made. This argument conflates the agency's obligation to provide light duty with the interactive process designed to determine a reasonable accommodation. The record reflects that the agency did not condition its participation in the interactive process on the success of the appellant's OWCP claim, but instead, that the agency referred the appellant to the reasonable accommodation coordinator after OWCP denied her claim. The agency's action was appropriate under the circumstances. Moreover, in light of the appellant's failure to keep or reschedule her appointment with the reasonable accommodation coordinator, the agency did not act improperly in failing to provide her light duty. <span class="italic">See Rosario-Fabregas</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-19 (considering the appellant's failure to engage in the interactive process, the agency did not act improperly in refusing to place the appellant back in a duty status).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, the appellant claims that the agency failed to follow its procedures and issue a written acknowledgment of her request for reasonable accommodation, and reiterates her contention that this was harmful error. Harmful error under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A) cannot be presumed; an agency error is harmful only if the record shows that the procedural error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 681, 685 (1991). Nothing in the record indicates that the appellant would have shown up for her February 14, 2014 appointment with the reasonable accommodation coordinator, or that she would have attempted to reschedule the appointment, if the agency had issued the written acknowledgment. Thus, we find that the appellant has failed to show that the agency would have provided her with light duty in the absence of the purported error.</p>

Constructive suspension claims may arise in two situations: When an agency places an employee on enforced leave pending an inquiry into his ability to perform; or when an employee who is absent from work for medical reasons asks to return to work with altered duties, and the agency denies the request. <span class="Italic">McFadden v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 18 &#x00B6; 9 (1999). The dispositive issue in determining whether a <span id="Page_2069"></span>suspension occurred is who initiated the absence. <span class="Italic">Alston v. Social Security Administration</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 252 &#x00B6; 11 (2003). If the appellant initiated the absence, then it is not a constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. An appellant who asserts a constructive suspension claim bears the burden of establishing that his absence was involuntary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant testified that, when he began working as a carrier in 1986, he was able to perform all the duties of the position, including the requirements for lifting and for casing mail. He developed carpal tunnel syndrome in 1997, and he worked in the carrier craft on a limited-duty basis from 1997 until 2001. In June 2001, he had surgery for shoulder tendonitis, and he returned to work as a carrier in a limited-duty status that September. His duties included delivering express mail and clerk craft duties. In December 2001, the agency offered the appellant, who was at that time a PS-06 carrier, a PS-05 clerk position. The appellant refused the clerk position and continued his modified carrier duties. The appellant admitted that, prior to December 2001, he had rejected several other job offers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In February 2002, the appellant was called into a supervisor's office where three agency managers and a union representative were present. The agency again presented the December 2001 offer to the appellant. Although the appellant was working at the time, he was informed that there was no work available. John Knapp, an agency manager, told the appellant that he was instructed to walk the appellant off the premises if he refused the offer. When the appellant refused to accept the offer, he was escorted from the premises and told not to return until the matter was resolved. Neither the December 2001 offer nor the February 2002 offer informed the appellant of his appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Knapp testified that there was no work available for the appellant, despite the fact that he had been working for nearly one year following his shoulder surgery, because he complained that his limited-duty work with labels and stamping return-to-sender mail violated his repetitive motion restrictions. Knapp explained that the appellant could not work as a carrier, as he could not carry a bag due to his shoulder tendonitis. There was no 100% mounted carrier position available, and the appellant was unable to case mail and to load his mail onto the truck, as is required of all carriers, even those on mounted routes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that this action constituted a constructive suspension that is appealable to the Board. He then reversed the constructive suspension, as the agency failed to provide due process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argued before the administrative judge that this case is analogous to <span class="Italic">Moon v. Department of the Army</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 412, 419-20 (1994), where the Board rejected an appellant's argument that the agency initiated the leave and declined to find a constructive suspension. There, the agency issued a letter informing the appellant that it would not be feasible for her to continue in her light-duty status and offering a choice between either returning to her regular position or requesting leave and/or applying for Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) benefits. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 419. The Board emphasized that the crux of the matter was whether the agency's letter terminating the light-duty assignment instructed the appellant to cease reporting to work. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board determined that the letter did not deny the appellant the right to return to duty. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board further reasoned that such a choice of unpleasant alternatives did not render involuntary her decision not to return to her regular position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 419-20. The administrative judge, however, relied upon <span class="Italic">Lewis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 254 (1999), in determining that the appellant was constructively suspended. In <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, the Board concluded that the appellant had raised allegations of a constructive suspension where he alleged that he was given conflicting advice as to whether he needed to be cleared by the medical unit before reporting to work and the medical unit prevented him from returning to work without clearance. 82 M.S.P.R. 254 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant complained that some of his limited-duty tasks violated his repetitive motion restrictions, and he could not work as a carrier on a mounted route. The agency offered him a distribution clerk position that it believed to be within his physical limitations and which was later determined by OWCP to be an appropriate offer. When the agency presented the offer, it indicated that, should the appellant refuse the offer, it had no other work for him within his restrictions. The agency offered the appellant the options of accepting the offer, accepting the offer under protest, or refusing the offer. In addition, Knapp testified that the written offer informed the appellant that he had time to peruse the offer and return it, and the written copy of the December 2001 job offer provided the appellant with ten days to respond to the offer. The appellant could have opted to take this time to consider the offer. Finally, in a March 5, 2002 letter, the agency informed him that the offer remained open. The appellant placed himself out of work when he declined the distribution clerk position. The agency did not instruct the appellant to cease reporting for work, and his choice between unpleasant alternatives did not render his refusal of the offer involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Moon</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. at 419-20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We acknowledge that an agency supervisor did escort the appellant from the premises and instruct him not to return until the matter was resolved. In this instance, however, the appellant was escorted from the worksite and given this instruction only after he refused a position that was appropriate to his physical limitations. We also note that this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Dize v. Department of the Army</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 635, 639 (1997), where the Board found that the appellant had made a non-frivolous allegation that the agency initiated the absence. There, the agency informed the appellant that it was unable to continue to accommodate her neck injury with light-duty assignments because light-duty work was no longer available. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 637. The appellant there, however, alleged that she was "fully able to work" and that she reported to work and requested to be placed on duty, only to be told that no work was available. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 639. The appellant here has made no such allegations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A constructive suspension may also occur where an employee requests work within his medical restrictions and the agency is bound by policy, regulation, or contractual provision to offer available work to the employee but fails to do so. <span class="Italic">Baker v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 680, 693 (1996). Here, &#x00A7; 546.142 of the Employee and Labor Relations Manual (ELM) requires the agency to "make every effort toward assigning the employee to limited duty consistent with the employee's medically defined work limitation tolerance." If the agency is unable to assign work within the employee's craft within his regular work facility, it may assign other work. If we were to assume <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the ELM reflects agency policy and that the appellant requested work within his medical restrictions, the agency did offer the work that was available within the appellant's physical limitations. The appellant complained that the work he was doing at the time the agency offered the clerk position violated his repetitive motion restrictions. The evidence showed that a mounted carrier position was not available and, even if it was, the appellant was unable to perform the duties of the position. Knapp testified that the position offered to the appellant was the only work available within the appellant's restrictions. The agency complied with the ELM's policy by offering the appellant clerk craft work that was within his physical abilities. Thus, even under this alternative, there was no constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">See Okleson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 415, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17 (2001).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal, the Federal Circuit affirmed that rejection of work by an employee who cannot perform his regular duties, leading to a nonpay status, was insufficient to constitute enforced leave or a constructive suspension, <span class="Italic">Reed v. USPS</span>, 198 Fed. Appx. 966, 967-69 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When Mr. Reed began working as a letter carrier in 1986, he was capable of performing all the duties of the position, including the requirements of lifting and casing mail. He developed carpal tunnel syndrome in 1997, and he thereafter worked as a limited-duty status carrier from 1997 until 2001. In June 2001, he had surgery for shoulder tendonitis and returned to work as a carrier in limited-duty status in September 2001. In that status, he delivered express mail and performed clerk craft duties. In December 2001, the agency offered Mr. Reed, then a PS-06 carrier, a PS-05 clerk position. Mr. Reed declined the offer, and continued his limited-duty assignments. Those assignments included working with labels and stamping return-to-sender mail. Mr. Reed complained to the agency that the movements necessary to complete those tasks violated his repetitive motion restrictions. As a result of Mr. Reed's complaint, the agency concluded that there was no work available for Mr. Reed as a PS-06 Letter Carrier. Consequently, in February 2002, the agency summoned Mr. Reed to a supervisor's office where he was informed that the agency had no work available for him as a letter carrier. The agency again offered Mr. Reed the PS-05 clerk position, which it believed to be within the physical limitations that Mr. Reed could endure. Mr. Reed was told that he must leave the premises if he refused the offer, and when he did refuse the offer, he was escorted off the premises. Mr. Reed applied for and received compensation benefits under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, which is administered by the Department of Labor's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs ("OWCP").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In June 2003, the agency again offered a PS-05 clerk position, which Mr. Reed accepted. He returned to work in September 2003, and his compensation benefits terminated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board held that the Administrative Judge erred in ruling that Mr. Reed had been involuntarily suspended from February 2002 until September 2003 and involuntarily demoted to the PS-05 position in September 2003.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the issue of involuntary suspension, the Board correctly noted that the dispositive issue in determining if the suspension was involuntary is who initiated the absence. <span class="Italic">Perez v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 931 F.2d 853, 855 (Fed. Cir. 1991) ("It was his choice, not the agency's, to remain away from work."). Upon review of the evidence, the Board concluded that, even though Mr. Reed was escorted off the premises in February 2002, such was the result of his refusal to accept the only job available to him in the agency. The Board held that the agency had not <span id="Page_2070"></span>instructed Mr. Reed not to report for work. To the contrary, the agency notified Mr. Reed by letter on March 5, 2002, that the clerk position offer was still open should Mr. Reed wish to accept the offer and return to work. As Mr. Reed had himself contended that the physical burdens of the carrier job excluded him from it, the Board held that the agency had offered Mr. Reed a job it felt he could perform. Mr. Reed was found by the Board to have placed himself out of work by declining the clerk position. Consequently, the Board held that Mr. Reed, not the agency, had initiated Mr. Reed's absence from work. As such, his absence from work from February 2002 until September 2003 did not constitute a constructive suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also rejected the Administrative Judge's analysis of the involuntary demotion issue. The Administrative Judge concluded that the wrongful (to the Administrative Judge) suspension placed the agency in such a position of power over Mr. Reed that he had no realistic alternative but to accept the demotion to the PS-05 position. The Board, having rejected the Administrative Judge's premise, concluded that Mr. Reed voluntarily accepted the lower grade position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction over Mr. Reed's appeal depended upon whether Mr. Reed's contentions of constructive suspension and involuntary demotion had merit. When the Board rejected those contentions, it found itself without jurisdiction to address Mr. Reed's cross-petition for review of the discrimination issues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Reed timely sought review in this court of the Board's final decision dismissing his appeal. He now challenges the Board's decision on the suspension and demotion issues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We must affirm the final decision of the Board unless we determine that it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c) (2000). Further, where the Board's decision rests on findings of fact, we must sustain its fact-findings if supported by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts demonstrate, by more than substantial evidence, that Mr. Reed declared himself unfit for the PS-06 letter carrier position and that the agency had no work available for him in that status. The agency offered him a suitable alternative, less attractive to be sure, which he rejected. During his entire period of suspension, he received compensation from OWCP. Mr. Reed's options were few: he could return to work in a lower grade position and forfeit OWCP compensation, or he could remain in non-pay suspension status. The Board's finding that Mr. Reed absented himself from work, rather than being pushed into absence by the agency, is supported by substantial evidence. That finding underlies the Board's conclusion that his suspension was not constructively caused by the agency. We see no error in the Board's conclusion that Mr. Reed failed to show a constructive suspension by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence is also substantial supporting the Board's conclusion that Mr. Reed voluntarily accepted the PS-05 position to which he returned in September 2003. His claim to a forced demotion was correctly rejected by the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we affirm the Board's final decision on the suspension and demotion issues, the Board was correct in determining that it lacked jurisdiction to address Mr. Reed's cross-petition for review of the discrimination issues on which the Administrative Judge ruled adversely to Mr. Reed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A challenge to a constructive suspension arose during the air traffic controllers strike after a controller indicated his readiness to return to work, was informed that he could not do so, and was not paid for the period of time that he was off-duty through the effective date of his removal. The issue was whether he was suspended without procedural protections during the period when he had indicated he was ready to return to work but was precluded from doing so. The Board concluded that for an individual who has been placed in nonpay status because of participation in a strike to prove a suspension within the jurisdiction of the Board, the employee must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that he contacted an agency official with decision-making authority, in person or otherwise, to communicate unequivocally his availability and his desire to return to duty. This would establish that the appellant was ready, able, and willing to return to work. If the employee was still prevented from returning, the agency action placing him in a nonpay status was disciplinary. <span class="Italic">Martel v. FAA</span>, 15 MSPR 141, 149-50 (1983). In reviewing the Board's determination that he had not been suspended, the court in <span class="Italic">Martel v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 735 F.2d 504 (Fed. Cir. 1984), determined that under 5 USC 7501(2), at least two matters must be considered in determining whether a suspension exists: (1) the agency must have placed the employee in the suspended status, without duties and pay, against his will (i.e., the agency's action must be adverse); and (2) the agency must have so acted for disciplinary reasons. The first requirement would be met by a demonstration that the employee unequivocally communicated to the agency his readiness, willingness, and ability to work. Because the precondition, the unequivocal communication, did not occur in the <span class="Italic">Martel</span> facts, no constructive suspension occurred. The same result was reached in <span class="Italic">Acosta v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 18 MSPR 270, 271-72 (1983).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee who entered a settlement agreement that placed the employee in leave status through a defined date pending an OPM annuity determination did not suffer enforced leave when OPM did not approve the retirement by the expected date, the LWOP status continued as OPM continued its consideration, and when the Board, construing the agreement, determined the parties never intended that the appellant would return to work. <span class="Italic">King v. VA</span>, CH-0752-13-0535-I-1 (NP 6/16/2014). If an employee applies for retirement based on misleading information from his employer and the employee is placed on leave for the period beginning with his separation from the service until the restoration to service that follows disapproval of the retirement application, the leave status may constitute a constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">Chichowski v. FEMA,</span> 72 MSPR 474, 475-79 (1996). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-13-095.html#sec6-94">Employee AWOL</a>."]</p>
