<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-119"><span class="space">a.</span> Due Process: Separation of Officials Denying Access and Deciding Suspension; Change in Basis for Clearance Suspension</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">In the year from the spring of 2012 through the fall of 2013, due process issues involved in indefinite suspensions tied to clearance suspensions reached their zenith at the MSPB, and their nadir before the Federal Circuit. The ascent and descent of the decisional roller coaster is described in the decisions that follow.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some preliminary explanation of the due process issue is in order. Agencies compartmentalize, or separate, clearance review and line management. The clearance adjudication or security office, however it is titled, is organizationally walled off from the rest of the agency so that its decisions on clearances are made without regard to the wishes or influences of line managers who may desire to retain or terminate an employee whose conduct, medical issues, or life conditions jeopardize a clearance required to perform the job. If the clearance office decides to suspend a clearance pending investigation of a security problem, the employee whose clearance is required to perform a job can no longer be left in the job. The agency has the choice of reassigning or detailing the employee to a job or duties not requiring a clearance or indefinitely suspending the employee pending the outcome of the clearance inquiry by the clearance office. The clearance office has its internal adjudication review procedures for clearance issues. Management has its adverse action processes for imposing an indefinite suspension. But management cannot direct the clearance office to drop a clearance suspension. The deciding official, confronted with the suspension of an employee's clearance, cannot direct restoration of the clearance. The manager is left with the decision to indefinitely suspend, detail or reassign the employee pending the outcome of the clearance office review. The employee, during the reply to the indefinite suspension, urges upon the deciding official all sorts of good reasons why the clearance should not have been suspended, but the deciding official cannot alter the clearance status. The employee can present the same evidence and argument to the clearance office concerning his worthiness for a clearance, but the clearance office need not act with any particular dispatch and it will not direct the result to be reached by the management official responsible for deciding whether to indefinitely suspend the employee. The result is that the reply may be of little practical value when an indefinite suspension is proposed as a result of a clearance suspension, although the employee can request a detail or reassignment, or retention on administrative leave, or some other measure short of an indefinite suspension, pending the clearance determination. The split in the functions of determining clearance worthiness and indefinite suspensions led to the litigation in 2012 and 2013 concerning due process.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On April 27, 2012, <span class="Italic">McGriff v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 118 MSPR 89, 104 &#x00B6; 33, 2012 MSPB 62 (2012), determined that due process requires the opportunity to make an effective reply to an indefinite suspensions removal. Due process cannot be readily provided, without some safeguards, if the deciding official on the indefinite suspension cannot control the outcome of the underlying denial of access to classified information when the access determination is controlled by an official who is not part of the suspension decisional process. The safeguards were recited:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]t is especially important in circumstances such as are present here that the deciding official have authority to change the outcome of a proposed indefinite suspension where the employee did not have a meaningful opportunity to respond to the reasons for the suspension of the security clearance in the earlier access determination. Otherwise, an indefinite suspension would become the automatic penalty based on a security clearance determination, even though the security clearance determination lacked any procedural due process protection at the time the indefinite suspension was taken...</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">McGriff</span>, before the indefinite suspension could be imposed, the employee should have the opportunity to respond to the underlying clearance suspension, assuming that the deciding official cannot alter the clearance status or provide some protection to the employee through a reassignment or administrative leave, 118 MSPR 92-106 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-37:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant served as an Information Technology Specialist with the agency's Naval Network Warfare Command. He was required to maintain a security clearance at the Secret level as a condition of employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 28, 2009, the appellant's Commander issued him three notices. The first notice, signed by Terry L. Smith "by direction," stated that, in accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, Chapter 10, the appellant's access to classified material was suspended until further notice or adjudication by the Navy's Central Adjudication Facility (DONCAF) based on "recent and continual conduct that involve[d] questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations." A Security Access Eligibility Report (SAER) to DONCAF's Director and signed by Chief of Staff M. L. Anderson described those charges in more detail. The SAER stated that the agency had investigated and disciplined the appellant with a letter of reprimand for his inability to comply with directions and for overstating his employee status; and described both his involvement with a company owned and operated by his wife, which created a conflict of interest with his official duties, and his failure to follow instructions prohibiting him from using government resources to further his wife's business.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second notice, signed by Anderson, stated that the appellant was being placed on administrative leave because his position required him to have access to classified material, his access had been temporarily suspended, and there was no position to which he could be reassigned or detailed that did not require access to sensitive information. The third notice, also signed by Anderson, proposed the appellant's indefinite suspension pending final adjudication of his security clearance eligibility by DONCAF, noted that attached documents advised him of the temporary suspension of his security clearance, and provided him with an opportunity to respond to this proposal to Deputy Commander Terry A. Halvorsen.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his May 28, 2009 response to the agency's indefinite suspension proposal, the appellant asserted that the action was taken without <span id="Page_2148"></span>any due process, noting that DONCAF had not issued a letter of intent regarding his security clearance and that he had not had any opportunity to address DONCAF's allegations or concerns. He also asserted that the SAER lacked required specificity regarding his alleged involvement in his wife's company, and he requested additional information regarding the basis of the agency's allegations. He contended that he is "entitled to have a meaningful opportunity to respond and attempt to influence the actions of the decisionmaker," and that he did not have that opportunity currently.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 29, 2009, Halvorsen issued a decision indefinitely suspending the appellant effective July 30, 2009. Halvorsen cited SECNAV Instruction M-5510.30 as stating that, once a command has suspended an individual's access to classified information, DONCAF removes eligibility and the command cannot reinstate access until DONCAF adjudicates the issue. He cited a declaration from the agency's Office of Civilian Human Resources Director as stating that the agency's official policy was not to provide a reassignment following the loss of clearance or suspension of access to classified information. Citing a July 8, 2009 Inspector General (IG) Report, Halvorsen stated that it supported a finding that the appellant was conducting work for his wife's firm on government time using government resources and noted that it had been forwarded to DONCAF. On September 11, 2009, DONCAF informed the appellant of both its preliminary decision to revoke his security clearance and his right to respond to this preliminary determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 27, 2009, prior to DONCAF's preliminary decision to revoke his security clearance, the appellant filed an appeal asserting that the agency denied him due process in indefinitely suspending him. He contended that the agency failed to provide him with sufficient notice of the allegations against him to enable him to present a meaningful response and that the action was unwarranted. He requested an in-person hearing.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant was entitled to constitutional due process when the agency indefinitely suspended him from federal employment based on a suspension of access to classified information.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recognized that, under certain circumstances, an agency may indefinitely suspend an employee based upon the suspension of access to classified information, or pending its investigation regarding that access, where the access is a condition of employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gonzalez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6; 13 (2010); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Navy</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 680, 682, 689, <span class="Italic">aff'd as modified on recons.</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 607 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 978 F.2d 1223 (Fed. Cir. 1992). On appeal of such an action, the Board lacks the authority to review the merits of the agency's decision to suspend an employee's access to classified material. <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 527-32. The Board may review, however, whether the agency provided the employee with the procedural protections set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 in taking an adverse action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 530; <span class="Italic">see also Cheney v. Department of Justice</span>, 479 F.3d 1343, 1344-45 (Fed. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">King v. Alston</span>, 75 F.3d 657, 661-63 (Fed. Cir. 1996). The Board may also determine whether the agency committed harmful error in failing to follow its applicable regulations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Romero v. Department of Defense</span>, 527 F.3d 1324, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to reviewing whether an agency provided an employee with statutory and regulatory protections in indefinitely suspending him based on a security clearance matter, the Board may also determine whether the agency afforded him due process with respect to his constitutionally-protected property interest in his employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Johnson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 487, 490-91 (1994); <span class="Italic">Kriner v. Department of the Navy</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 526, 531-35 (1994). In <span class="Italic">Kriner</span>, the Board stated that when a suspension is based on restriction of the employee's security access, the agency is required to provide the employee a meaningful opportunity to respond to the reasons for the suspension by ensuring that, <span class="Italic">either in the advance notice of that action or in the earlier access determination</span>, the employee has been notified of the cause that led to the access determination. 61 M.S.P.R. at 533; <span class="Italic">see also Byerline v. Department of the Navy,</span> 62 M.S.P.R. 279, 283 (1994). An indefinite suspension based upon a negative security clearance determination thus illustrates the tension between ensuring that an agency does not violate an employee's constitutional due process rights in effecting the indefinite suspension and following the <span class="Italic">Egan</span> prescript against reviewing the substance of the underlying security clearance determination. Because some precedent appears inconsistent regarding the parameters and analytical framework of constitutional due process for indefinite suspensions based upon negative security clearance determinations, we now address what due process requires under those circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985), the Court held that an agency's failure to provide a tenured public employee with notice and an opportunity to present a response, either in person or in writing, <span class="Italic">prior</span> to removing him or her is a violation of the employee's constitutional right to due process of law<span class="Italic">.</span> The Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672 (1991), applied <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> to cases arising under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75. The Board found that, under <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, an agency's failure to provide a non-probationary federal employee with prior notice and an opportunity to respond to an adverse action that deprives the employee of his property right in his employment is a violation of constitutional due process of law. <span class="Italic">Stephen</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. at 680. The Board stated that when the agency deprives the employee of a constitutionally-protected property interest, the right to due process is "absolute" in the sense that it does not depend on the merits of the employee's claim. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 681.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. Homar</span>, 520 U.S. 924 (1997), the Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether a tenured public employee who was suspended from employment was entitled to constitutional due process. The Court assumed, without deciding, that the suspension infringed a protected property interest and summarized <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>'s procedural due process requirements as comprising notice and a meaningful opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 929. While acknowledging that a suspension does implicate the constitutional due process right to notice and opportunity to respond, the Court went on to explain that due process in this context may not necessarily encompass a right to have such notice and opportunity <span class="Italic">prior</span> to the deprivation as required in a removal action under <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> It explained that because due process relates to time, place and circumstances, its parameters in any given case will be a function of the demands of the particular situation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 930. In order to determine what process is due, the Court balanced the following three factors: (1) The private interest affected by the official action; (2) The risk of erroneous deprivation of the interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and (3) The government's interest. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 931-32 (quoting <span class="Italic">Mathews v. Eldridge,</span> 424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976))<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, <span class="Italic">Stephen</span>, <span class="Italic">Kriner</span> and <span class="Italic">Homar</span>, we find that the appellant was entitled to constitutional due process, i.e., notice and a meaningful opportunity to respond, upon being indefinitely suspended based on the agency's security clearance decision. We therefore consider the <span class="Italic">Homar</span> factors in order to determine whether the timing, place and circumstance of the procedures used in this case afforded the appellant his right to due process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Concerning the first factor, the record indicates that the appellant was ultimately suspended for approximately 10 months, from July 29, 2009, until May 17, 2010. We recognize that such a deprivation of the appellant's property interest is significant. However, the appellant in this instance was, in fact, afforded notice and an opportunity to respond to the reasons for the revocation of his security clearance <span class="Italic">prior</span> to the imposition of the suspension based on that revocation. As such, despite the ultimately prolonged nature of the suspension at issue here, we cannot conclude that the "timing" of the notice and opportunity to respond rendered the process afforded him constitutionally defective.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the third factor, the agency undoubtedly has a compelling interest in withholding national security information from unauthorized persons. <span class="Italic">See Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 527. Thus, this factor arguably weighs in favor of the government's authority to take immediate action without providing the appellant with notice and opportunity to respond prior to suspending him. However, again, given that the agency did, in fact, provide the appellant with prior notice and an opportunity to respond in this case, its interest as a factor relative to the timing of the process afforded the appellant is somewhat inconsequential to the ultimate issue as to whether the appellant received the process due him under the Constitution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In discussing the second factor in <span class="Italic">Homar</span>, i.e., the risk of erroneous deprivation of the property interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards, the Court focused on the need to ensure that the procedures used provide adequate assurance that the agency had reasonable grounds to support the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 933-934. Here, based on the totality of the evidence, we find that the agency did have reasonable grounds to support the suspension. Specifically, on March 5, 2009, it received an IG hotline complaint that the appellant was involved in a private business owned by his spouse, NetAnalysis Consulting LLC, and had attempted to secure government contracts for the business using his government e-mail account and official time. The subsequent Report of Investigation concerning that IG complaint indicated that the investigation substantiated allegations of conflict of interest, misuse of government equipment, conflicting outside employment and activities, misuse of official time, and misuse of subordinate's time. In a June 3, 2009 memorandum, Capt. Purnell of the agency's Judge Advocate concluded that the IG's investigation and report were legally sufficient and substantiated the appellant's violation of various laws and regulations. Conversely, DONCAF had neither fully investigated, nor finally decided, whether it would permanently revoke the appellant's security clearance when the agency indefinitely suspended him. In addition, DONCAF conditionally reinstated the appellant's security clearance, thus <span id="Page_2149"></span>suggesting, at least in retrospect, that the Command may not have had a strong interest in suspending his security clearance. Even so, overall, we conclude that the agency did have reasonable grounds to support the appellant's suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we reject the appellant's assertion that the agency failed to provide him with the specific reasons for the action before he responded to the proposal notice, thereby denying him a meaningful opportunity to respond. To the contrary, we find that the notice of proposed indefinite suspension, coupled with the notice of temporary suspension of the appellant's security clearance, gave the appellant sufficient information to enable him to respond to the agency's proposed indefinite suspension. Specifically, the proposal notice references the SAER and the appellant admits receiving that report before the time for responding to the indefinite suspension proposal notice had elapsed. As previously noted, the SAER contained sufficient detail about the reasons the agency temporarily suspended the appellant's security clearance, i.e., his recent discipline for his inability to comply with directions and for overstating his employee status, and his involvement with his wife's company despite instructions prohibiting him from using government resources to further that business.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, a significant question exists as to whether the appellant had a meaningful opportunity to respond to the proposed indefinite suspension such that the procedures that were used posed a risk of erroneous deprivation of the appellant's property interest. <span class="Italic">See Homar,</span> 520 U.S. at 933-34; <span class="Italic">Mathews,</span> 424 U.S. at 335. Providing an appellant with a reasonable opportunity to reply that satisfies constitutional due process requires more than mere notice; the reply opportunity may not be an empty formality, and the reply or deciding official should have authority to take or recommend agency action based upon the reply. <span class="Italic">See Swindell v. Veterans Administration</span>, 12 M.S.P.R. 148, 150-51 (1982). Although <span class="Italic">Swindell</span> technically addressed rights under the applicable statutory, regulatory, and Federal Personnel Manual provisions, it stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[The Office of Personnel Management's] guidance material summarizes the court cases on point. We have reviewed this guidance and the leading court cases and find that the [Office of Personnel Management's] guidance material generally comports with what the judicial decisions deem to be the requirements of due process in connection with an oral reply. Namely, a fair conference with an agency official who is authorized to decide or recommend a decision. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ricucci v. United States</span>, 425 F.2d 1252, 192 Ct. Cl. 1 (1970).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">12 M.S.P.R. at 150 n.1. In other words, the agency does not afford an individual with a meaningful opportunity to respond by merely providing an empty process for presenting his defense against the agency's adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Mathews</span>, 424 U.S. at 333 (stating that the fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard "at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner"); <span class="Italic">see also Noe v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. 86, 88-89 (1985). Indeed, it is especially important in circumstances such as are present here that the deciding official have authority to change the outcome of a proposed indefinite suspension where the employee did not have a meaningful opportunity to respond to the reasons for the suspension of the security clearance in the earlier access determination. Otherwise, an indefinite suspension would become the automatic penalty based on a security clearance determination, even though the security clearance determination lacked any procedural due process protection at the time the indefinite suspension was taken.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the record suggests that the deciding official lacked authority to change the Command's initial determination to suspend the appellant's security clearance or to reassign him. Specifically, the deciding official stated that the agency regulations required a Command to report any questionable or unfavorable information concerning an individual to DONCAF, and that, once a Command suspends an individual's access to classified information, DONCAF removes eligibility, and the Command cannot reinstate access until DONCAF adjudicates the issue. The deciding official further stated that the official policy of the agency was not to provide reassignment following the suspension of access to classified information. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also</span> IAF, Tab 5, Subtab 4Q (Declaration from the agency's Office of Civilian Human Resources Director stating that the agency's official policy is that reassignment following the loss of clearance or the suspension of access to classified information is neither mandatory nor desirable and that the agency has never issued and has no plans to issue regulations that would require activities to consider reassignment following the loss of a security clearance or the suspension of access to classified information).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unfortunately, the record does not establish whether the deciding official in fact possessed the authority to reinstate the appellant's access to classified information, or reassign him to a position not requiring access to classified information, regardless of what the appellant said in his reply to the proposal to indefinitely suspend him. Moreover, although unclear, it appears that the deciding official also could not place the appellant on administrative leave. A reply procedure that compromises a deciding official's authority or objectivity can constitute a constitutional due process violation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (stating that actions that compromise the deciding official's objectivity in the reply process can constitute violations of constitutional due process); <span class="Italic">cf. Holley v. Department of the Navy</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 300, 304-05 (1994) (the appellant was afforded a meaningful opportunity to reply to a proposed indefinite suspension where the deciding official had authority to suspend the appellant's access to classified information).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not grant the appellant an evidentiary hearing, and the record in this case is incomplete as to the deciding official's authority <span class="Italic">vis-&#x00E0;-vis</span> the appellant's indefinite suspension. We therefore find that further adjudication is warranted. If the deciding official lacked the authority to do anything but affirm the indefinite suspension, the procedures used in effecting the appellant's indefinite suspension sufficiently ran the risk of an erroneous deprivation of his property interest in employment such as to find that the agency violated his right to constitutional due process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant is also entitled to a determination on whether the agency committed harmful error when it indefinitely suspended him from federal employment based on a suspension of access to classified information.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(c)(2)(A), the Board will not sustain an adverse action if the appellant shows harmful error in the application of the agency's procedures in arriving at the decision under appeal. Therefore, even when an appellant fails to establish a violation of constitutional due process, he may still show that the agency committed harmful error in failing to follow the required statutory procedures or the agency's own regulations. <span class="Italic">See Romero,</span> 527 F.3d at 1329. In <span class="Italic">Romero,</span> the court acknowledged that the Board may not review the substance of a security clearance revocation decision and found that the Board did not err in finding that the agency had complied with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 in removing Romero after it revoked his security clearance. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1329. It vacated the Board's decision and remanded, however, because the Board did not address whether Romero had shown that the agency committed harmful error in failing to follow its own procedures when revoking his Secret security clearance. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1325-26, 1329-30. The court found that <span class="Italic">Egan</span> did not preclude the Board from reviewing whether the agency complied with its own regulations and procedures.[9] <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1329. In addition, the court found that the Supreme Court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Service v. Dulles,</span> 354 U.S. 363 (1957) and <span class="Italic">Vitarelli v. Seaton,</span> 359 U.S. 535 (1959) also make clear that federal employees may challenge an agency's compliance with its regulations governing revocation of security clearances. The court further noted that nothing in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> overruled these cases. <span class="Italic">Romero,</span> 527 F.3d at 1329.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;In its subsequent decision, the court found that Romero had not met his burden in establishing that the agency had failed to follow its own regulations for revoking his Secret security clearance. Therefore, the court did not reach the issue of whether any procedural deficiency resulted in harmful error. <span class="Italic">See Romero v. Department of Defense</span>, 658 F.3d 1372, 1373, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, on remand, if the appellant fails to establish a violation of constitutional due process, he may also attempt to show that the agency failed to follow its procedures in suspending his security clearance and that any failure to do so resulted in harmful error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McGriff</span> was called into question by <span class="Italic">Hornseth v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/18-1188.Opinion.2-27-2019.pdf">916 F.3d 1369</a> (Fed. Cir. 2019), <span class="Italic">post,</span> determining that a due process deprivation does not occur only because a deciding official has no alternative but to indefinitely suspend an employee whose clearance is suspended and the clearance is required for the position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Issued the same day as <span class="Italic">McGriff</span> was <span class="Italic">Buelna v. DHS</span>, 118 MSPR 115, 120-23 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-19, 2012 MSPB 63 (2012) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Buelna v.

Buelna, a Federal Air Marshall was required to hold a top secret clearance. On February 20, 2009, the Office of Security issued him a memo: a suspension of access to classified information based on derogatory information developed through investigations involving fraudulent claims. On March 3, 2009, Buelna was issued a proposed indefinite suspension based on the suspension of the clearance and the ongoing investigation into the alleged misconduct. The deciding official, Mr. Patton, was an official working in an agency unit other than the organization that issued the clearance suspension. The Board noted that the case was covered by provisions of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act applied to TSA personnel, meaning that Chapter 75 did not apply. The agency internal directive on discipline contained provisions similar to the requirements of 5 USC 7513(b). The agency agreed that it was required to apply constitutional due process protections under its internal management directive.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following the factual summary in <span class="Italic">Buelna,</span> the Board went on to recognize <span class="Italic">McGriff</span> as providing controlling guidance and proceeded to the analysis of <span id="Page_2150"></span>Mr. Buelna's appeal, and as in <span class="Italic">McGriff,</span> the Board remanded the case for the parties to develop evidence on whether the proposing official in the indefinite suspension had the authority to substantively alter the underlying clearance suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with our holding in <span class="Italic">McGriff</span>, we find that the appellant was entitled to constitutional due process, i.e., notice and a meaningful <span id="Page_2151"></span>opportunity to respond, upon being indefinitely suspended based on the agency's security clearance decision. We therefore consider the <span class="Italic">Homar</span> factors in order to determine whether the timing, place and circumstance of the procedures used in this case afforded the appellant his right to due process. Concerning the first factor, the record indicates that the appellant was ultimately suspended for approximately 21/2 years. We find that such a length of time represents a significant deprivation of the appellant's property interest.[5] However, here, as in <span class="Italic">McGriff,</span> the appellant was, in fact, afforded notice and an opportunity to respond to the reasons for the revocation of his security clearance <span class="Italic">prior</span> to the imposition of the suspension based on that revocation. As such, despite the prolonged nature of the suspension at issue here, we cannot conclude that the "timing" of the notice and opportunity to respond rendered the process afforded him constitutionally defective.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The record does not reveal whether the agency's regulations regarding indefinite suspensions required it to reimburse the appellant for lost pay should the agency ultimately rule in the appellant's favor. We find that this matter may be relevant to the first or second <span class="Italic">Homar</span> factors. 520 U.S. at 932.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the third factor, the agency undoubtedly has a compelling interest in withholding national security information from unauthorized persons. <span class="Italic">See Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 527. Thus, this factor arguably weighs in favor of the government's authority to take immediate action without providing the appellant with notice and opportunity to respond prior to suspending him. However, again, given that the agency did, in fact, provide the appellant with prior notice and an opportunity to respond in this case, its interest as a factor relative to the timing of the process afforded the appellant is somewhat inconsequential to the ultimate issue as to whether the appellant received the process due him under the Constitution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In discussing the second factor in <span class="Italic">Homar</span>, i.e., the risk of erroneous deprivation of the property interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards, the Court focused on the need to ensure that the procedures used provide adequate assurance that the agency had reasonable grounds to support the adverse action. 520 U.S. at 933-934. Here, based on the totality of the evidence, we find that the agency did have reasonable grounds to support the suspension. Specifically, as previously indicated, the February 20, 2009 memorandum to the appellant suspending his security clearance stated that the suspension was "based on derogatory information developed from U.S. Army and DHS/IG concerning fraudulent claims which raises questions about your honesty, integrity, trustworthiness and ability to protect[ ] national security information." The March 3, 2009 notice proposed the appellant's indefinite suspension based on two charges: (1) Suspension of Top Secret Security Clearance and (2) Investigation into Misconduct. The specification underlying the first charge was almost identical to the stated basis for suspending the appellant's security clearance, adding that the fraudulent claims related "to time and attendance and travel vouchers pertaining to military duty and FAM employment." The specification underlying the second charge stated that DHS/OIG was conducting an investigation into "alleged false or inaccurate time and attendance records submitted by you relating to your FAM employment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we find that the notice suspending the appellant's security clearance, coupled with the notice proposing his indefinite suspension, did not deny him a meaningful opportunity to respond by failing to provide him with the specific reasons for the action before he responded to the proposal notice. As set forth above, the notices informed the appellant of the basis for the action. The appellant responded to Patton that the military investigation into his time and attendance records as a Reserve Officer was only a "Commander's Inquiry" and did not warrant discipline, thus showing that he understood the accusations against him, <span class="Italic">see Alvarado v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 389, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-15 (2004). Therefore, the agency provided the appellant with adequate notice of the reason for his security clearance suspension before the agency subjected him to an adverse action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., King v. Alston</span>, 75 F.3d 657, 662 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (finding that the agency provided the employee with sufficient information to make an informed reply when it notified him that his security clearance was being suspended because of "a potential medical condition" and then informed him that he was being indefinitely suspended from duty based on the suspension of his security clearance); <span class="Italic">cf. Cheney</span>, 479 F.3d at 1353 (finding that the employee was not provided with the opportunity to make a meaningful response to the notice of proposed suspension from duty where the limited information provided put him in the position where he had to guess at the reasons for his security clearance suspension).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unfortunately, as in <span class="Italic">McGriff</span>, the record lacks sufficient information for us to make a determination concerning other issues affecting the second <span class="Italic">Homar</span> factor. In spite of our findings in &#x00B6; 15 above, a question still exists as to whether the appellant had a meaningful opportunity to respond to the proposed indefinite suspension. It appears that, although the Personnel Security Division stated that the appellant could contact a Personnel Security Specialist if he had further questions regarding the action, it suspended his security clearance with no advance notice or opportunity to respond to the merits of the action. Further, it appears that Patton had very limited authority to affect the outcome of the proposed indefinite suspension. The parties stipulated that the appellant's indefinite suspension was based on "the suspension of his top secret security clearance and the investigation into his misconduct, not on the underlying merits or factual predicate for the suspension or the investigation." In his decision sustaining the indefinite suspension, Patton stated that any review of the decision to suspend the appellant's security clearance "rests exclusively with the Personnel Security Division," and that the "process to appeal their decision concerning your security clearance is separate and distinct from the process to reply to the proposal to suspend you indefinitely." The decision did not address the appellant's request to remain on administrative leave status pending the resolution of the security clearance matter.<span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the evidence does not indicate that Patton had authority to consider the merits of the appellant's security clearance suspension when determining the propriety of the indefinite suspension. In addition, it appears that he did not have authority to take other remedial action, including temporarily reassigning the appellant to a position that did not require a Top Secret security clearance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A reply procedure that compromises a deciding official's authority or objectivity can constitute a constitutional due process violation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (stating that actions that compromise the deciding official's objectivity in the reply process can constitute violations of constitutional due process); <span class="Italic">cf. Holley v.

Therefore, under the circumstances of this case, a question exists regarding whether the agency afforded the appellant a meaningful opportunity to reply to the reason for the suspension of his security clearance before suspending him from his position, or whether instead the agency merely provided him with an empty formality.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">As also explained in McGriff, 2012 MSPB 62, the Board will apply its traditional standards in analyzing whether the agency committed harmful error.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also found in <span class="Italic">McGriff</span> that, even if an agency did not violate an employee's right to minimum due process, the employee may still show that the agency committed harmful error in failing to follow statutory provisions or its own regulations. We noted that the employee bears the burden of proving harmful error. <span class="Italic">McGriff,</span> 2012 MSPB 62, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 37-39. <span class="Italic">McGriff</span> addressed an employee's statutory rights under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, <span class="Italic">id.,</span> and, as discussed above, that statutory provision does not directly apply here. But as also discussed above, the same general principles apply in analyzing whether employees have been denied rights under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 and in analyzing whether they have been denied rights under the agency's directives. Therefore, the Board will apply the same general principles in determining whether the appellant established that the agency committed harmful error by failing to follow its management directive.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For the subsequent developments, refer to <span class="Italic">Buelna v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/BUELNA_ALEXANDER_DA_0752_09_0404_B_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1047534.pdf">121 MSPR 262</a>, 2014 MSPB 45 (2014), <span class="Italic">post</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Next in the series of decisions issued on April 27, 2012, was <span class="Italic">Gaitan v. DHS</span>, 118 MSPR 180, 185-91 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-26, 2012 MSPB 71 (2012) (replacing 2012 MSPB 67). On October 22, 2009, Mr. Gaitan, another Air Marshal, received from the personnel security division a determination to revoke his access to classified information as well as an immediate suspension of his clearance. On October 28, Gaitan received a proposed indefinite suspension and a suspension decision from his line management. The problems arose from investigations into an alleged insurance fraud scheme and some other circumstances. Mr. Gaitan was on administrative leave for about eight months prior to the indefinite suspension. The Board went on to summarize the <span class="Italic">McGriff</span> analysis and turned to the specifics of Gaitan's case, finding due process adequate for Gaitan because, although the deciding official in the indefinite suspension could not determine the course of the clearance, the revocation determination allowed for a reply within the approximate timeframe of the indefinite suspension proposal, meaning that Gaitan had a meaningful opportunity to respond to the basis for the clearance action leading to the indefinite suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with our holding in <span class="Italic">McGriff;</span> we find that the appellant was entitled to constitutional due process, i.e., notice and a meaningful opportunity to respond, upon being indefinitely suspended based on the agency's security clearance decision. We therefore consider the <span class="Italic">Homar</span> factors in order to determine whether the timing, place, and circumstances of the procedures used in this case afforded the appellant his right to due process. Concerning the first factor, we find that the appellant's indefinite suspension represents a significant deprivation of the appellant's property interest. However, here, as in<span class="Italic"> McGriff;</span> the appellant was, in fact, afforded notice and an opportunity to respond to the reasons for the revocation of his security clearance prior to the imposition of the suspension based on that revocation. Thus we cannot conclude that the "timing" of the notice and opportunity to respond rendered the process afforded him constitutionally defective.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the third factor, the agency undoubtedly has a compelling interest in withholding national security information from unauthorized persons. <span class="Italic">See Egan,</span> 484 U.S. at 527. Thus, this factor arguably weighs in favor of the government's authority to take immediate action without providing the appellant with notice and opportunity to respond prior to suspending him. However, again, given that the agency did, in fact, provide the appellant with prior notice and an opportunity to respond in this case, its interest as a factor relative to the timing of the process afforded the appellant is somewhat inconsequential to the ultimate issue of whether the appellant received the process due him under the Constitution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In discussing the second factor in <span class="Italic">Homar,</span> i.e., the risk of erroneous deprivation of the property interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards, the Court focused on the need to ensure that the procedures used provide adequate assurance that the agency had reasonable grounds to support the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Homar,</span> 520 U.S. at 933-34. Here, based on the totality of the evidence, we find that the agency did have reasonable grounds to support the suspension. Specifically, the October 22, 2009 Notice of Determination to Revoke Access to Classified Information stated that it was taken in accordance with Exec. Order No. 12,968 and its Adjudicative Guidelines. It stated that it was "based on information contained in a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) Report of Investigation (ROI), 106-TSA-HOU-17157, dated March 26, 2009, in which you were alleged to be involved in an insurance fraud scheme." It stated that, in addition, "we considered details of your August 10, 2008 arrest for DWI, contained in the <span id="Page_2152"></span>Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Office of Inspection (OI) ROI #I080351." It described the Adjudicative Guidelines, specifically Guideline E, Personal Conduct, Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The October 22, 2009 Notice further cited four "issues" underlying its determination. Under the first, it stated that the DHS OIG had initiated an investigation after receiving information from the United States Attorney's Office regarding the appellant's alleged involvement in an insurance fraud scheme. It specified that a former FAM alleged that the appellant arranged for the FAM's vehicle to be stolen so that the FAM could obtain insurance proceeds, that the FAM reported that the appellant bragged that he had collected money from his insurance company after staging the theft of his own vehicle, and that further investigation disclosed that the appellant received an insurance payment for his stolen vehicle. The notice also stated that the appellant denied any involvement in the thefts in a 2006 sworn statement but that a 2008 polygraph examination by the Federal Bureau of Investigation concluded that he was deceptive. Under the other three issues, it specified that the appellant was involved in an August 10, 2008 altercation that resulted in his DWI arrest; that he refused to take a breathalyzer test; that he identified himself as a federal law enforcement officer and asked the arresting officer to let him go; and that he subsequently pleaded nolo contendere and was found guilty of DWI.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The October 28, 2009 notice proposing the appellant's indefinite suspension referred back to the October 22, 2009 determination. It stated that the October 22, 2009 Notice was based on "personal conduct, alcohol consumption and criminal conduct," and included "allegations regarding your involvement in an insurance fraud scheme." It further specified that the Notice was based upon an August 10, 2008 incident in which the appellant was involved in a verbal altercation that resulted in his arrest, during which he failed to submit to a breathalyzer test and made comments that created the appearance that he was attempting to use his position to avoid arrest.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the appellant's main argument is that the agency should not have indefinitely suspended him until it made a final determination on his security clearance, and that his right to challenge the permanent revocation of his security clearance before the agency's security office was irrelevant because the basis for his indefinite suspension was the suspension of his security clearance. However, as discussed in <span class="Italic">McGriff;</span> 2012 MSPB 62, both the Board and our reviewing court have held that an agency may indefinitely suspend an employee pending a determination on the security clearance issue. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 24; <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Gonzalez v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6; 13 (2010); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Navy,</span> 48 M.S.P.R. 680, 689, <span class="Italic">aff'd as modified on recons.,</span> 51 M.S.P.R. 607 (1991),<span class="Italic"> aff'd,</span> 978 F.2d 1223 (Fed. Cir. 1992). We also note that the appellant has not contested the agency's evidence that he was placed on administrative leave on April 17, 2009. Thus, he was apparently on administrative leave for approximately 8 months before the agency effected his indefinite suspension on December 18, 2009.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we find that the notice suspending the appellant's security clearance, coupled with the notice proposing his indefinite suspension, did not deny the appellant a meaningful opportunity to respond by failing to provide him with the specific reasons for the action before he responded to the proposal notice. As set forth above, the notices specifically informed the appellant of the bases for the actions. This information suffices to provide adequate notice. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., King v. Alston,</span> 75 F.3d 657, 662 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (finding that the agency provided the employee with sufficient information to make an informed reply when it notified him that his security clearance was being suspended because of "a potential medical condition"); <span class="Italic">cf. Cheney v. Department of Justice,</span> 479 F.3d 1343, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (finding that the employee was not provided with the opportunity to make a meaningful response to the notice of proposed suspension from duty where the limited information he was provided put him in the position where he had to guess at the reasons for his security clearance suspension). Indeed, the appellant conceded that he was afforded notice of the underlying charges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the record indicates that the appellant had an opportunity to respond to the Personnel Security Division's determination to revoke his access to classified information before his indefinite suspension was effected. Specifically, the October 22, 2009 Notice stated that it was not a final decision and that the appellant had a right to respond to the determination. It informed the appellant that he could reply to the Chief Security Officer (CSO) in writing or in person within 30 days of receipt of the letter and that he could request an extension of time. It further informed him that he could request documents, records, and reports upon which the action was based. It also stated that, if the CSO decided to uphold the determination, the appellant would have the opportunity to appeal the decision to the DHS Security Appeals Panel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency issued the notice of proposed indefinite suspension 6 days after the Personnel Security Division issued the Notice of Determination to Revoke Access to Classified Information, the appellant requested and received a 10-day extension to submit his reply to the notice of proposed indefinite suspension and submitted a reply on November 16, 2009. Moreover, the agency did not indefinitely suspend the appellant until December 18, 2009, and, as previously noted, the appellant has not disputed that he was on administrative leave until that time. Thus, the appellant had the 30 days to respond provided in the October 22, 2009 notice before he was indefinitely suspended. Although he suggested that he was denied an opportunity to be heard on, and provided evidence concerning, the security clearance matter, he did not specifically assert that he attempted to obtain any information from the agency or explain why he did not challenge the revocation during this time. Therefore, we are not persuaded by the appellant's argument that he was denied due process when the agency effected his indefinite suspension prior to a final determination on his security clearance. <span class="Italic">Cf. Henton v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 572, &#x00B6; 13 (2006) (finding that the agency did not deny the appellant due process, even though it did not issue a notice proposing his removal before issuing its decision to remove him, noting that he was well aware of the basis for the removal, the agency afforded him an opportunity to file a grievance before the effective date of the removal, the notice informed him that he had a right to file a Board appeal of his removal, and that such pre- and post-removal procedures were all the minimum due process required by <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill,</span> 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further asserts that he was unable to argue the merits of the security clearance suspension in the indefinite suspension proceedings because Baylor had no authority to entertain such arguments. We acknowledge Baylor's statements that he based the indefinite suspension on the appellant's security clearance suspension. We note, though, that Baylor also referred to the misconduct underlying the suspension of the security clearance. He further stated that the appellant offered him no evidence to consider and specified that the appellant did not submit evidence that warranted mitigating the proposed action. Moreover, the agency claims that Baylor had the authority to impose any other penalty deemed appropriate, citing MD No. 1100.75-3, which states that an indefinite suspension <span class="Italic">may</span> be imposed when an employee's security clearance has been suspended, denied or revoked, and a security clearance is a condition of employment or is otherwise required for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, even if the record does not show that Baylor had authority to change the outcome of the indefinite suspension, as explained above, the appellant could have requested an opportunity to respond to the security clearance determination before his indefinite suspension was effected. Indeed, Baylor referred to the detailed explanation provided <span id="Page_2153"></span>by the Personnel Security Division in the October 22, 2009 Notice and stated that that notice provided the appellant with a point of contact in the Office of Security to assist with questions about his rights and the appeal process related to his security clearance suspension. The appellant has not asserted, and we find no indication, that the CSO lacked authority to change the outcome of the security clearance determination. Due process requires only that the appellant receive a meaningful opportunity to respond to someone with authority to change the outcome of the security clearance determination in either the security clearance proceeding or the adverse action proceeding. That is so because an employee lacks a property interest in access to classified information and therefore the suspension or revocation of a security clearance does not implicate constitutional procedural due process concerns. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Robinson v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 498 F.3d 1361, 1364-65 (Fed. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">Hesse v. Department of State,</span> 217 F.3d 1372, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the appellant's opportunity to respond to the security clearance determination <span class="Italic">before</span> he was indefinitely suspended weighs in favor of upholding the suspension. In that regard, this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">McGriff;</span> where the record did not clearly indicate that the appellant was provided with an opportunity to contest the security clearance determination before the agency imposed his indefinite suspension and it was unclear whether the deciding official on the indefinite suspension had authority to change the outcome of that adverse action.<span class="Italic"> McGriff,</span> 2012 MSPB 62, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 33-35; <span class="Italic">see Satterfield v. Department of the Navy,</span> 58 M.S.P.R. 152, 157-58 (1993) (Parks, concurring) (finding that the agency afforded the appellant the requisite due process, even though it proposed his indefinite suspension based only on its Central Adjudication Facility's pending determination on his security clearance, where the Central Adjudication Facility notified the appellant of the specific reasons for suspending his security access and the agency did not indefinitely suspend him until nearly 3 months after the notification);<span class="Italic"> accord Alexander v. Department of the Navy,</span> 58 M.S.P.R. 147, 151-52 (1993) (Parks, concurring).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has similarly not shown that the agency's action should be reversed because of harmful error. As a general matter, the Board has found that compliance with 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 procedural requirements satisfies minimum due process requirements. <span class="Italic">See Markland v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 349, 357 (1997), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 140 F.3d 1031 (Fed. Cir. 1998). As previously discussed, the directive at issue here requires similar procedures to chapter 75. Absent a specific allegation that the agency committed harmful error by violating one of its regulations, therefore, the appellant has shown no other basis for reversing his indefinite suspension. In that regard, we note the agency's statement that it does not have a policy that allows an individual whose security clearance has been suspended to work in another position that does not require a clearance. The appellant has not contested that statement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant has not challenged and we discern no reason to disturb the administrative judge's findings that the appellant's indefinite suspension included an ascertainable end, the agency established a nexus, and an indefinite suspension was reasonable. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the initial decision as MODIFIED by this Opinion and Order.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Moving along in the tetralogy, we turn to the Board decision of April 27, 2012, in the appeal of <span class="Italic">Gargiulo v. DHS</span>, 118 MSPR 137, 2012 MSPB 64 (2012)--a case that wound up in the Federal Circuit, <span class="Italic">Gargiulo v. DHS</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/12-3157.Opinion.8-14-2013.1.PDF">727 F.3d 1181</a> (Fed. Cir. 2013), <span class="Italic">post</span>, undoing the Board's careful work. Mr. Gargiulo, another Air Marshal, was informed by the personnel security division of TSA on August 1, 2008, that his clearance was suspended with the intent to revoke his access to classified information. The August 1 clearance suspension and notice of intent to revoke provided a right of reply to a chief security officer, Mr. Allison, within 30 days from receipt of that decision. The consequential proposed indefinite suspension was issued by a line manager on August 28, 2009. From the Board's analysis, when Gargiulo received the proposed indefinite suspension, he still had the opportunity to request an extension of time to respond to the notice of intended revocation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Gargiulo,</span> the Board recited <span class="Italic">McGriff,</span> noted the peculiarities, as it had in <span class="Italic">Gaitan</span> and <span class="Italic">Buelna,</span> of the DHS personnel system, and considered whether Gargiulo had a meaningful reply opportunity and found that he did, as in the <span class="Italic">Gaitan</span> appeal, based principally on the opportunity to reply to the notice of intent to revoke prior to the effectuation of the indefinite suspension, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 145-48 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-23:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we find that the agency did not deny the appellant due process by failing to provide him with the August 1, 2008 decision to suspend his security clearance before issuing him the August 28, 2008 notice proposing his suspension. As discussed above, the August 1, 2008 decision was attached to the notice of proposed suspension and provided the appellant with the specific reasons for the security clearance suspension. We also note that the notice of proposed indefinite suspension, besides referring to the ROI, provided the appellant with an opportunity to review the material relied on to support the reason for the proposed action. The record does not show that the appellant asked to review the ROI and was denied that opportunity. Thus, we discern no error in the administrative judge's finding that the notice of proposed indefinite suspension, coupled with the notice of the suspension of his security clearance, gave the appellant enough information to enable him to respond meaningfully to the agency's proposed indefinite suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the August 1, 2008 decision afforded the appellant the right to respond in writing, orally, or both to Chief Security Officer Roderick Allison within 30 calendar days of receipt of the decision, and the right to request an extension of time to respond. Thus, when the appellant received the decision with the August 28, 2008 proposed indefinite suspension, he still had an opportunity to request an extension of time to respond to it. He has not explained why he did not respond or request an extension to respond. Indeed, after receiving a substantial extension to respond to the proposed indefinite suspension, the appellant's attorney responded in writing on October 15, 2008, waiving his right to reply orally. Although the appellant's attorney continued to argue that he was effectively out of time to respond to the August 1, 2008 decision by the time he received it, he again did not assert that he requested an extension of time to respond. Specifically, the appellant has not explained why he did not attempt to challenge the suspension of his security clearance between his receipt of the August 1, 2008 decision and his February 2009 indefinite suspension. Thus, we are not persuaded that the appellant was denied due process as a result of the delayed receipt of the notice of the decision to suspend his security clearance. <span class="Italic">Cf. Henton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 572, &#x00B6; 13 (2006) (finding that the agency did not deny the appellant due process, even though it did not issue a notice proposing his removal before issuing its decision to remove him, noting that he was well aware of the basis for the removal, the agency afforded him an opportunity to file a grievance before the effective date of the removal, the notice informed him that he had a right to file a Board appeal of his removal, and that such pre- and post-removal procedures satisfied the requirements of due process under <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that he was denied due process because he was unable to argue the merits of the security clearance suspension in the indefinite suspension proceedings because Donzanti had no authority to entertain such arguments. To begin with, we note that Donzanti stated that the suspension would remain in effect pending resolution of the revocation of the appellant's clearance <span class="Italic">or until there was evidence sufficient to either return the appellant to duty or take administrative action against him</span>. Further, the agency claims that Donzanti had the authority to impose any other penalty deemed appropriate, citing MD No. 1100.75-3, which states that an indefinite suspension <span class="Italic">may</span> be imposed when an employee's security clearance has been suspended, denied or revoked, and a security clearance is a condition of employment or is otherwise required for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, even if the record does not show that Donzanti had authority to change the outcome of the indefinite suspension, as explained above, the appellant could have requested an opportunity to respond to the security clearance determination before his indefinite suspension was effected. The appellant has not asserted, and we find no indication, that Allison lacked authority to change the outcome of the security clearance determination. Due process requires only that the appellant receive a meaningful opportunity to respond to someone with authority to change the outcome of the security clearance determination in either the security clearance proceeding or in the adverse action proceeding. That is so because an employee lacks a property interest in access to classified information, and, therefore, the suspension or revocation of a security clearance, in and of itself, does not implicate constitutional procedural due process concerns. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Robinson v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 498 F.3d 1361, 1364-65 (Fed. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">Hesse v. Department of State</span>, 217 F.3d 1372, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the appellant's opportunity to respond to the security clearance determination <span class="Italic">before</span> he was indefinitely suspended weighs in favor of upholding the suspension. In that regard, this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">McGriff</span> because the record there did not clearly indicate that the appellant was provided with an opportunity to contest the security clearance determination before the agency imposed his indefinite suspension and it was unclear whether the deciding official on the indefinite suspension had authority to change the outcome of that adverse action. <span class="Italic">McGriff</span>, 2012 MSPB 62, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 45-47; <span class="Italic">see Satterfield v.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2154"></span>The Board also found in <span class="Italic">McGriff</span> that, even if an agency did not violate an employee's right to minimum due process, the employee may still show that the agency committed harmful error in failing to follow statutory provisions or its own regulations.

But as also discussed above, the same general principles apply in analyzing whether employees have been denied rights under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 and in analyzing whether they have been denied rights under the agency's directives. Therefore, the Board will apply the same general principles in determining whether the appellant established that the agency committed harmful error by failing to follow its management directive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The agency afforded the appellant minimum due process under the</span> Homar <span class="Italic">balancing test, and the appellant failed to establish harmful error</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not shown that the agency's action should be reversed because of harmful error. The appellant has not contested the administrative judge's finding that his harmful error allegation was essentially the same as his due process violation allegation discussed above. As a general matter, the Board has found that compliance with 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 procedural requirements satisfies minimum due process requirements. <span class="Italic">See Markland v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 349, 357 (1997), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 140 F.3d 1031 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Byerline v.

Absent a specific allegation that the agency committed harmful error by violating one of its regulations, therefore, the appellant has shown no other basis for reversing his indefinite suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the result in <span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span> was affirmed by the Federal Circuit, the court jettisoned the Board's constitutional due process approach to indefinite suspensions based on clearance suspensions, leaving intact the adverse action protections granted by statute but declining to extend due process considerations to the clearance suspension or revocation process, <span class="Italic">Gargiulo v. DHS</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/12-3157.Opinion.8-14-2013.1.PDF">727 F.3d 1181</a>, 1184-87 (Fed. Cir. 2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Gargiulo bases his appeal to this court entirely on the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. In particular, he argues that the agency deprived him of constitutional due process by not timely providing him with documentary materials that the agency had relied upon in deciding to suspend his security clearance. He complains that although he was given notice of the reasons for the suspension of his security clearance as early as August 2008, he was not provided with copies of the documentary materials the agency relied on in making that decision until May 2009, three months after he was suspended from his position. The delay in producing those materials, he contends, meant that he was denied a meaningful opportunity to contest his suspension, either before or promptly after it became effective in February 2009.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), held that that "no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," which "requires an affirmative act of discretion on the part of the granting official." Based on <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, our cases have consistently held that employees do "not have a liberty or property interest in access to classified information, and the termination of that access therefore [does] not implicate any due process concerns." <span class="Italic">Jones v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Gargiulo argues that the property interest he enjoys in his employment gives him a constitutional right to procedures enabling him to challenge the suspension of his security clearance that was the basis for his indefinite suspension from his Federal Air Marshal position. This court has repeatedly held, however, that the Board's review of an adverse action resulting from the suspension of a security clearance is limited to "whether a <span id="Page_2155"></span>security clearance was denied, whether the security clearance was a requirement of the appellant's position, and whether the procedures set forth in section 7513 were followed." <span class="Italic">Hesse</span>, 217 F.3d at 1376; <span class="Italic">see Cheney v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 479 F.3d 1343, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (noting, in the context of a pending security clearance determination, that the steps in <span class="Italic">Hesse</span> are "[a]ll the Board and this court may do"); <span class="Italic">Lyles v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 864 F.2d 1581, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1989) ("After determining that [Section 7513] procedures were followed, the only other inquiry the Board may make is whether the employee's position was classified as sensitive and whether he was discharged for failure to maintain the required security clearance.").[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Because Mr. Gargiulo raises only a constitutional due process claim before this court, we need not consider whether the agency followed procedures required by statute or regulation. As a general matter, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b) provides employees facing an adverse action with (1) "at least 30 days' advance written notice"; (2) "a reasonable time, but not less than 7 days, to answer orally and in writing and to furnish affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of the answer"; (3) a right to representation; and (4) "a written decision and the specific reasons therefor at the earliest practicable date." The administrative judge noted that TSA employees such as Mr. Gargiulo are subject to the Federal Aviation Administration's personnel management system, and not the statutory protections of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b). <span class="Italic">See</span> 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 114, 40122. As the administrative judge explained, the agency's personnel policies offer procedural safeguards similar to those provided by section 7513. The administrative judge ruled that the agency's procedures did not violate its personnel rules, and Mr. Gargiulo has not contested that finding on appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Gargiulo's complaint that he was denied a meaningful opportunity to respond to the agency's decision to suspend his security clearance therefore misses the mark. Because Mr. Gargiulo had no due process rights with respect to the procedures used to determine whether to suspend or revoke his security clearance, he had no constitutional right to receive the documentary evidence underlying the security clearance suspension before his indefinite suspension from employment took effect. He had due process rights with respect to his indefinite suspension, but they did not include the right to contest the merits of the decision to suspend his security clearance. <span class="Italic">See Cheney</span>, 479 F.3d at 1352 ("Neither the Board nor this court may review the underlying merits of an agency's decision to suspend a security clearance."); <span class="Italic">Drumheller v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 49 F.3d 1566, 1571 (Fed. Cir. 1995).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Because Mr. Gargiulo's complaint is limited to what he considers an untimely opportunity to challenge the suspension and proposed revocation of his security clearance, we need not address what process would be required if he were claiming entitlement to other relief, such as assignment to a non-sensitive position within his agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case and in the companion <span class="Italic">McGriff</span> case, the Board held that although it may not review the merits of an agency's decision to suspend an employee's access to classified material, it can review (1) whether the agency provided the employee with the procedural protections set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b) in taking an adverse action and (2) whether the agency afforded the employee constitutionally guaranteed due process with respect to that action. After balancing what it perceived to be the competing interests in this case, the Board concluded that while Mr. Gargiulo's suspension for nine months pending the final decision revoking his security clearance may have represented a significant deprivation of his property interest in his job, that interest was outweighed by competing factors: the agency's compelling interest in withholding national security information from unauthorized persons, and the reasonable grounds that the agency had for denying a security clearance to Mr. Gargiulo.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court has held that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b) "entitles an employee to notice of the reasons for the suspension of his access to classified information when that is the reason for placing the employee on enforced leave pending a decision on the employee's security clearance." <span class="Italic">King v. Alston</span>, 75 F.3d 657, 661 (Fed. Cir. 1996). The statutory notice "provides the employee with an adequate opportunity to make a meaningful reply to the agency before being placed on enforced leave." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 662; <span class="Italic">see also Cheney</span>, 479 F.3d at 1352. That right, however, is statutory, not constitutional. The Board's characterization of that right as a constitutional guarantee that the Board may delineate and enforce is contrary to this court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Hesse</span>, <span class="Italic">Robinson</span>, and <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, in which we held that employees do not have constitutional due process rights in connection with security clearance determinations. As this court observed in <span class="Italic">Hesse</span>, all the Board and this court may do in the context of an adverse action stemming from a security clearance suspension is to "determine whether a security clearance was denied, whether the security clearance was a requirement of the appellant's position, and whether the procedures set forth in section 7513 were followed." 217 F.3d at 1376.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In applying its due process analysis, the Board went further than that. It held, as a matter of constitutional due process, that Mr. Gargiulo was entitled to notice of the reasons for the suspension of his security clearance and an opportunity to make a meaningful response regarding those reasons to someone in the agency with the authority to affect that decision. While this court's cases hold that section 7513 grants those rights to certain employees, we have not held that those rights are guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the Board cited the "need to ensure that the procedures used provide adequate assurance that the agency had reasonable grounds to support the adverse action." And in this case it concluded, based on "the totality of the evidence," that "the agency did have reasonable grounds to support the suspension," and that the decision to revoke Mr. Gargiulo's security clearance was "not baseless or unwarranted." 118 M.S.P.R. at 144. While the Board disclaimed any intention to review the merits of the security clearance suspension, the sole ground for the decision to suspend Mr. Gargiulo from his position was the suspension of his security clearance. The Board's conclusion that there were reasonable grounds to support the adverse action therefore necessarily reflected its view that the agency's security clearance decision was reasonable, based on what the Board referred to as "the totality of the evidence." In addressing the merits of the security clearance determination in that manner, the Board exceeded its authority in adverse decision cases that are based on the suspension or revocation of an employee's security clearance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we affirm the Board's decision upholding Mr. Gargiulo's indefinite suspension. However, we agree with the Department of Homeland Security that the Board erred by holding that due process provides an employee with procedural rights in connection with a security clearance determination and justifies an inquiry into whether the agency had reasonable grounds for suspending or revoking the employee's security clearance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Relying on <span class="italic">Gargiulo, Lloyd v. Dept. of Army</span>, DE-0752-16-0247-I-1 (NP 8/2/2022), determined that the appellant had sufficient information to challenge his indefinite suspension based on a clearance suspension and suffered neither a due process deprivation nor harmful error:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision, the administrative judge stated that the minimal due process to be afforded the appellant here included sufficient notice of the reasons for the suspension of his access to classified information and the opportunity to make an informed reply. Our reviewing court, however, has clarified the Board's line of cases on which the administrative judge relied, finding that, because an employee has no property interest in a security clearance, an agency is not obliged as a matter of constitutional due process to notify the employee of the specific reasons for the suspension of his clearance. <span class="italic">Gargiulo v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 727 F.3d 1181, 1185-86 (Fed. Cir. 2013); <span class="italic">see Buelna v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 25 (2014). Rather, for purposes of due process, it is sufficient for an agency to inform the employee that his position required a security clearance and that he can no longer hold his position once he lost his clearance. <span class="italic">Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 25. Here, the agency provided the appellant with this information, and we find no due process violation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Separate from constitutional due process, the Board will reverse an indefinite suspension based on the suspension of a security clearance if an appellant is able to prove harmful procedural error. <span class="italic">Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 33; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(1). To do so, an appellant must prove that the agency committed an error in the application of its procedures that is likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="italic">Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 33; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(r). The appellant argued below that the agency committed harmful procedural error when it failed to follow Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R and Department of the Army Regulation 380-67. The administrative judge found that the appellant failed to prove this claim, the appellant does not challenge this finding on review, and we discern no basis to disturb it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, pursuant to the statutory requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(e), an employee facing an adverse action must be notified of the specific reasons for a proposed adverse action. <span class="italic">Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 25. In the context of an indefinite suspension based on the suspension of a security clearance, section 7513 requires that the appellant be provided sufficient information to make an informed reply, including a statement of the reasons for the clearance suspension. <span class="italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 34.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency's proposal to indefinitely suspend the appellant informed him that his access to classified information was suspended "due to the circumstances from the on-going [sic] G32 investigation into the allegations of the improper storage and control of classified material." Despite the appellant's claims to the contrary, we find that the agency provided him with sufficient information to make an informed reply to the proposed indefinite suspension, including the reasons for the clearance suspension, and that the requirements of section 7513 were satisfied. <span class="italic">See King v. Alston</span>, 75 F.3d 657, 662 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (finding that the agency provided an employee with sufficient information to make an informed reply when it notified him that his security clearance was being suspended because of "a potential medical condition" and then informed him that he was being indefinitely suspended from duty based on the suspension of his security clearance); <span class="italic">Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 34 (finding that the notice suspending an appellant's security clearance, coupled with the notice proposing his indefinite suspension, adequately informed him of the basis for the suspension of his security clearance, i.e., alleged fraudulent claims); <span class="italic">cf. Cheney v. Department of Justice</span>, 479 F.3d 1343, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (finding that an employee was not provided with the opportunity to make a meaningful response to the notice of proposed suspension when he had to guess at the reasons for his security clearance suspension).</p>

DOD</span>, PH-0752-20-0350-I-1 (NP 4/1/2022) ("The appellant notes his inability to obtain documents referenced in the Statement of Reasons (SOR) for the preliminary revocation of his eligibility for access to classified information, but he had no due process rights with respect to the procedures used to preliminarily revoke his access eligibility, and therefore had no right to receive the evidence underlying the SOR prior to his indefinite suspension. <span class="italic">Gargiulo v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As to issues (1) and (2), the parties have stipulated that the appellant's position required a security clearance and that his clearance was suspended. The agency's first charge is therefore sustained. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.63. However, because the exhaustive list of issues to be adjudicated did not include the merits of the agency's second charge, i.e., the continuing OIG investigation, and the parties did not object to the summary, we conclude that the agency does not intend to rely on that charge, and must establish that its action was warranted based on the first charge alone.[4] In that regard, the administrative judge correctly noted that an indefinite suspension based on the suspension of a required security clearance promotes the efficiency of the service, <span class="Italic">see Jones v. Department of the Navy</span>, 978 F.2d 1223, 1226-27 (Fed. Cir. 1992), and also is expressly authorized under the TSA personnel system, <span class="Italic">see</span> MD 1100.75-3 Handbook (2009), &#x00A7; J(1)(d). As to issue (4), the appellant has not contested the administrative judge's finding that the indefinite suspension had a condition subsequent that would bring it to an end, and we discern no error in his finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Because the merits of the second charge are not before us, we do not decide whether the holding of <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23-25 (2010), applies to indefinite suspensions taken under the TSA personnel system.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The outcome of this case therefore turns on the appellant's claims that the agency violated his due process rights and/or committed harmful error in indefinitely suspending him. It appears that in framing issue (3), the administrative judge initially conflated the question of whether the agency denied the appellant due process with the question of whether it committed harmful error. The appellant raised both issues, however, and we identified both for consideration on remand. <span class="Italic">Buelna</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 115, &#x00B6; 20. No other issues remain to be adjudicated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant was entitled to due process concerning the indefinite suspension.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While it is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance or access to classified information, a tenured federal employee nonetheless has a property interest in continued employment. <span class="Italic">King v. Alston</span>, 75 F.3d 657, 661 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Typically, this is so because the statutory federal employment scheme provides that the agency may take an adverse action against the employee only for unacceptable performance, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303, or for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513. <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 1999). In this case, the adverse action on appeal is governed not by statute, but rather by the TSA's personnel management system, in particular, the provisions of MD 1100.75-3 and the accompanying Handbook. <span class="Italic">Buelna</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 115, &#x00B6; 8. However, MD 1100.75-3 similarly provides that a tenured TSA employee may only be suspended, removed, or demoted for unacceptable performance or for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 9. Accordingly, we reaffirm that the appellant's indefinite suspension deprived him of a property interest cognizable under the Fifth Amendment, and that the agency was required to provide him due process in connection with that action. <span class="Italic">Buelna</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 115, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">see Gargiulo</span>, 727 F.3d at 1185 (acknowledging that the petitioner, a FAM who was indefinitely suspended under the TSA personnel management system based on the suspension of his security clearance, had due process rights regarding his indefinite suspension); <span class="Italic">Kriner v. Department of the Navy</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 526, 532 (1994) ("It was the agency's deprivation of the appellant's property interest in his employment--his suspension from his job--which triggered the application of due process.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2156"></span><span class="Italic">The Board has authority to review whether the agency provided the appellant due process in indefinitely suspending him.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 530-31 (1988), the Supreme Court held that in an appeal of an adverse action under chapter 75 based on the denial or revocation of a required security clearance, the Board may not review the merits of the underlying clearance determination, but may review, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, whether the position required a security clearance, whether the clearance was denied or revoked, and whether the agency complied with the procedural requirements of &#x00A7; 7513.[5] The holding of <span class="Italic">Egan</span> has since been applied to indefinite suspensions based on the suspension of a security clearance. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Cheney v. Department of Justice</span>, 479 F.3d 1343, 1351-52 (2007). <span class="Italic">Egan</span> also controls where, as here, the adverse action is taken under the TSA personnel system. <span class="Italic">See Gargiulo,</span> 727 F.3d at 1186. In such cases, the procedural requirements of section 7513 are not directly applicable; however, the Board has authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A) to review the agency's compliance with its own procedures, which include the similar provisions of MD 1100.75-3. <span class="Italic">See Romero v. Department of Defense</span>, 527 F.3d 1324, 1328-29 (Fed. Cir. 2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The Court further stated that in such cases the Board may review "whether transfer to a nonsensitive position was feasible." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, the Federal Circuit has since clarified that such review is appropriate only where a statute or regulation provides the employee a substantive right to such reassignment. <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 864 F.2d 1579, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court did not have occasion in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> to decide if the Board was authorized to consider a claim that an agency denied due process in taking an adverse action based on a security clearance determination. We have long held, however, that the Board is authorized to review such claims. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., McGriff</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 89, &#x00B6; 25; <span class="Italic">Kriner</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 532-33. The Federal Circuit also has implicitly recognized that due process claims are reviewable in this context. <span class="Italic">See Hesse v. Department of State</span>, 217 F.3d 1372, 1381-82 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (finding that the agency did not deny the petitioner due process regarding an indefinite suspension based on the suspension of a security clearance). This result is not contrary to <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, because review of the due process protections afforded does not require the Board to second guess security determinations committed to agency discretion. <span class="Italic">Weissberger v. U.S. Information Agency</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 370, 374 (1988).[6] We therefore reaffirm our authority to determine whether an agency afforded an appellant due process in taking an adverse action based on a security clearance determination. For the reasons discussed below, however, we must reconsider the question of what due process requires in such a case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Indeed, we need not consider any factual issues that are not also involved in determining an agency's compliance with the procedures set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513, a matter which lies squarely within our review authority under <span class="Italic">Egan</span>. Whether an agency provided due process is in certain respects a distinct inquiry, in that the requirements of constitutional due process are not conditioned on statutory procedures, and furthermore are not subject to the harmful error test. <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1375, 1377. Nonetheless, section 7513 has been drafted so that its procedural protections include, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the due process rights independently guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution, such as notice and a meaningful opportunity to respond to the proposed action. <span class="Italic">Chavies v. Department of the Navy</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 81, &#x00B6; 10 (2006). The same is true of the similar provisions of MD 1100.75-3. <span class="Italic">See Buelna</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 115, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">In determining the general requirements of due process concerning an indefinite suspension based on the suspension of a security clearance, the Board will apply the</span> Mathews<span class="Italic"> factors.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Due process requires, at a minimum, that an employee being deprived of his property interest be given "the opportunity to be heard 'at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.'" <span class="Italic">Mathews</span>, 424 U.S. at 333 (quoting <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. Manzo</span>, 380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965)). However, due process "is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 334 (quoting <span class="Italic">Morrissey v. Brewer</span>, 408 U.S. 471, 481 (1972)). As previously stated, to determine the specific dictates of due process, we consider: (1) the private interest affected by the official action; (2) the risk of erroneous deprivation of the interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and (3) the government's interest. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 335.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These considerations are not limited in their application to indefinite suspension actions, such as the one at issue in <span class="Italic">Homar</span>, but apply generally to the deprivation of any property interest. For example, in <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532 (1985), issued more than a decade before <span class="Italic">Homar</span>, the Supreme Court relied on the <span class="Italic">Mathews</span> factors in determining what process was due a public employee who, under state law, could be removed only for cause. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 538-39, 542-45. After considering the factors in turn, the Court concluded that a tenured government employee is entitled to "notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story" prior to the deprivation of his property right to continued employment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 546-48. We have since applied the holding of <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> to removals of federal employees. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Alford v. Department of Defense</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 556, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 6 (2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find occasion here to conduct a new <span class="Italic">Mathews</span> factors analysis. We do so in part because, as the Court noted in <span class="Italic">Homar</span>, it cannot be assumed that in all cases <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> will apply in full to the temporary deprivation of a suspension without pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> 520 U.S. at 929-32. More to the point, our recent analysis of the <span class="Italic">Mathews</span> factors in <span class="Italic">McGriff</span> and related decisions, including our previous decision in this case, requires clarification.[7] As with <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> and its progeny, our conclusions here may be applied to similar appeals without reiterating the <span class="Italic">Mathews</span> analysis in each case.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In considering the first <span class="Italic">Mathews</span> factor, i.e., the private interest affected by the action, we must consider the length and finality of the deprivation. <span class="Italic">Homar</span>, 520 U.S. at 932. Here, as in <span class="Italic">Homar</span>, the appellant has suffered only a temporary suspension, rather than a permanent deprivation of his property interest in continued employment. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> In drawing that distinction, the Court paid no particular attention to the precise duration of the suspension, <span class="Italic">see id</span>., and we need not do so here. For purposes of the <span class="Italic">Mathews</span> analysis, it is sufficient to observe that, while a suspension is a temporary deprivation, it is nonetheless "likely to cut off subsistence income and to prevent one from obtaining other gainful employment," and has "great practical impact" on the employee. <span class="Italic">Engdahl v. Department of the Navy</span>, 900 F.2d 1572, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the third <span class="Italic">Mathews</span> factor, the government has a compelling interest in withholding national security information from unauthorized persons. <span class="Italic">Buelna</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 115, &#x00B6; 13 (citing <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 527). It is true the hazard may be temporarily avoided by keeping the employee in a paid non-duty status. <span class="Italic">See Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 544-45. However, the government's interest in the efficiency of the service is sufficiently strong to permit an indefinite suspension without pay pending completion of the security clearance adjudication. <span class="Italic">See Jones</span>, 978 F.2d at 1226.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In considering the second and decisive <span class="Italic">Mathews</span> factor, our focus is on the need to ensure that the procedures used provide adequate assurance that the agency had reasonable grounds to support the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Buelna</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 115, &#x00B6; 14 (citing <span class="Italic">Homar</span>, 520 U.S. at 933-34); <span class="Italic">see Fuentes v. Shevin</span>, 407 U.S. 67, 80-81 (1972) (the purpose of the right to be heard is not only to provide "abstract fair play," but also "to minimize substantively unfair or mistaken deprivations of property").[8] Because the appellant was afforded an opportunity to respond to the proposed action prior to being suspended, it is clear the hearing occurred at a "meaningful time" for these purposes, <span class="Italic">see Mathews</span>, 424 U.S. at 333, and we need not decide whether a postdeprivation hearing might have satisfied the requirements of due process. However, it remains to be determined whether the appellant was heard in a "meaningful manner" that provided sufficient protection against an erroneous deprivation of his property interest. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 333, 335.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Our inquiry here is limited to the procedures used in the adverse action proceedings, and does not extend to the merits of the underlying clearance suspension. <span class="Italic">See Gargiulo</span>, 727 F.2d at 1186-87.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the Court in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> considered the second <span class="Italic">Mathews</span> factor, it explained that for the purpose of reaching an accurate decision, the opportunity to respond to a proposed removal is important for two reasons. <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 542-46. First, an adverse action will often involve factual disputes and consideration of the employee's response may clarify such disputes. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1376. Second, "[e]ven where the facts are clear, the appropriateness or necessity of the [penalty] may not be," and in such cases the employee must receive a "meaningful opportunity to invoke the discretion of the decision maker." <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 543. Thus, "the employee's response is essential not only to the issue of whether the allegations are true, but also with regard to whether the level of penalty to be imposed is appropriate." <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1376. Although the appellant in this case was not removed, we find the same considerations described in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> are present in determining <span id="Page_2157"></span>whether he received an adequate opportunity to contest his proposed suspension. We address them in turn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">For purposes of responding to the charge, due process does not require an opportunity to contest the merits of the clearance suspension.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the facts underlying the agency's charge, it is well established that the suspension of a security clearance, pending a final decision on whether to revoke or restore it, may serve as a basis for imposing an indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, 978 F.2d at 1226-27; <span class="Italic">see also</span> MD 1100.75-3 Handbook (2009), &#x00A7; J(1)(d). This is so even where, as in <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, the agency ultimately determines that the facts warrant restoration of the clearance. <span class="Italic">See</span> 978 F.2d at 1224, 1227. Consequently, where an agency proposes to indefinitely suspend an employee based on the suspension of his security clearance, the only relevant factual disputes that could be raised regarding the charge are whether the position required a security clearance and whether the clearance was suspended. Indeed, the parties have stipulated that the appellant's indefinite suspension was based on the suspension of his clearance, not the merits or factual predicate of the clearance suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has previously held that in an indefinite suspension action based on the suspension of a security clearance, due process requires that the employee be provided an opportunity to contest the underlying security determination. <span class="Italic">Gaitan</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 180, &#x00B6; 23 (due process requires only that the appellant receive a meaningful opportunity to respond to someone with authority to change the outcome of the security clearance determination in either the security clearance proceeding or the adverse action proceeding); <span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 137, &#x00B6; 20 (same). That holding was incorrect because an employee has no property interest in a security clearance. <span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span>, 727 F.3d at 1185. Failure to provide an opportunity to contest a clearance suspension prior to placement in a nonpay status may constitute harmful error, if such a procedure is required under an agency's own regulations concerning adverse actions based on personnel security determinations. <span class="Italic">See Ulep v. Department of the Army</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6; 5 (2014). It does not, however, constitute a due process violation, because the merits of the agency's charge do not hinge on any factual disputes concerning the merits of the clearance suspension.[9]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;We further note that in cases where the employee does receive an opportunity to contest the clearance determination prior to the adverse action proceedings, that opportunity alone is insufficient to satisfy due process with respect to the proposed adverse action. <span class="Italic">Contra Gaitan</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 180, &#x00B6; 23; <span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 137, &#x00B6; 20. Due process requires that the employee have the "opportunity to present reasons, either in person or in writing, why <span class="Italic">proposed action</span> should not be taken." <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 546 (emphasis added). In an adverse action, there is no "proposed action" for due process purposes until the agency issues its proposal notice. <span class="Italic">Hodges v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 591, &#x00B6; 6 (2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">For purposes of responding to the charge, constitutional due process does not require notice of the factual basis for the clearance suspension.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Constitutional due process does not necessarily require that the employee be notified of the factual basis underlying the security clearance suspension. <span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span>, 727 F.3d at 1186; <span class="Italic">contra Hinton v. Department of the Navy</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 692, 695-96 (1994). Such notice is required under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513, which provides that an employee facing an adverse action be notified of the specific reasons for the proposed action. <span class="Italic">See Cheney</span>, 479 F.3d at 1352 (the employee must be given enough information to enable him to make a meaningful reply); <span class="Italic">King</span>, 75 F.3d at 661-62; <span class="Italic">see also</span> MD 1100.75-3 Handbook (2009), &#x00A7; I(2)(a)(i) (requiring that the notice of proposed adverse action include "[t]he charge(s) and specification(s) for each charge, including a description of the evidence that supports the charge(s)"). However, as the court explained in <span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span>, the right to such notice is not constitutional, but statutory, or in this case, a matter of agency policy. 717 F.3d at 1186. Hence, as to the charge, the agency was not obliged as a matter of constitutional due process to notify the appellant of the specific reasons for the suspension of his security clearance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Rather, it was sufficient for the agency to inform the appellant that his position required a security clearance, and that he could no longer hold his position once he had lost his clearance. <span class="Italic">See Hesse</span>, 217 F.3d at 1381-82. The appellant received adequate notice of these essential facts, and there is no indication that he would have been denied the chance to contest those facts had he been so inclined.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">If there are viable alternatives to indefinite suspension, due process requires that the employee be afforded an opportunity to invoke the discretion of a deciding official with authority to select such alternatives.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the penalty, the appellant has argued that he was denied a meaningful opportunity to persuade the deciding official to take an action other than the proposed indefinite suspension. In <span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span>, our reviewing court declined to address what due process would be required had the petitioner in that case claimed entitlement to a penalty other than suspension without pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> 727 F.3d at 1185 n.4. Because the appellant in this case has asserted that the agency denied him due process concerning the penalty imposed, that question is now before us.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Court recognized in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, the right to invoke the deciding official's discretion exists only "in such cases" where there is doubt as to the appropriateness or necessity of the penalty. 470 U.S. at 543. For example, there is no due process right "to insist on a hearing in order to argue that the decisionmaker should be lenient and depart from legal requirements." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 543 n.8 (citing <span class="Italic">Dixon v. Love</span>, 431 U.S. 105, 114 (1977)); <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Delong v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 264 F.3d 1334, 1342-43 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (where the petitioner's criminal record required her removal pursuant to 25 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3207, due process did not require that she be afforded a hearing on the issue of her fitness for service in a covered position). Due process does not demand that the deciding official consider alternatives that are prohibited, impracticable, or outside management's purview.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, to the extent there may have existed viable alternatives to suspension without pay, e.g., placement on administrative leave, the appellant had a due process right to invoke the discretion of a deciding official with authority to select such alternatives. <span class="Italic">See Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 543. Here, the deciding official declared under penalty of perjury that he had authority under the agency's discipline procedures to choose alternatives to the proposed indefinite suspension, including the appellant's requested outcome of continued placement on administrative leave. The appellant has not rebutted that evidence, and we conclude that he was afforded an opportunity to invoke the discretion of a deciding official with authority to change the outcome of the proposed action to the extent that may have been feasible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Due process requires notice of the facts underlying the clearance suspension to the extent those facts are considered in determining the penalty.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that he was nonetheless denied a meaningful opportunity to invoke the deciding official's discretion because he was not provided with all of the information on which the deciding official relied in deciding to indefinitely suspend him. In particular, he cites the deciding official's declaration that he "considered the facts regarding [the appellant's] alleged fraudulent time and attendance reports in reaching [the] decision to indefinitely suspend [the appellant]." Based on that statement, the appellant concludes that the deciding official "apparently" considered evidence regarding the alleged fraudulent claims beyond what he was provided in the proposal notice and the notice of his clearance suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To enjoy the right to be heard, an individual must first be notified. <span class="Italic">Fuentes</span>, 407 U.S. at 80 (citing <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. Hale</span>, 68 U.S. 223, 1 Wall. 223, 233 (1863)); <span class="Italic">see Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 546 ("The essential requirements of due process...are notice and an opportunity to respond."). In Stone, 179 F.3d at 1376, our reviewing court held that introduction of new and material information to the deciding official through <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications undermines the due process guarantee of notice and an opportunity to respond because the employee is no longer on notice of all the reasons for the action and/or the evidence relied upon by the agency. In determining if an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication introduces new and material information, the Board considers, among other factors, whether: (1) the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication merely introduces cumulative information or new information; (2) the employee knew of the error and had a chance to respond to it; and (3) the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1377. Ultimately, the inquiry is whether the deciding official's consideration of the additional material was so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee could fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property absent an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Concerning the charge, any additional information the deciding official may have considered could not have been new and material because the only information material to the charge was that the appellant's position required a security clearance and that his clearance was suspended. For purposes of the Stone analysis, however, there is no basis for distinguishing between those <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications relating to the charge and those relating to the penalty. <span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274, 1280 (Fed. Cir. 2011). As the court explained in <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, "if <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications influence a deciding official's penalty determination, contributing to the enhancement of the penalty...the communications impact the employee's property interest in continued employment no less than if they relate to the underlying charge." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. To the extent the deciding official's penalty determination was influenced by the factual basis for the underlying security clearance determination, the appellant was entitled to notice of the information on which he relied, even if due process would not have required such notice regarding the charge alone.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not shown, however, that his due process rights were compromised by <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications. First, it is unclear that any <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication in fact took place. The deciding official's statement that he "considered the facts regarding [the appellant's] alleged fraudulent time and attendance reports" is vague, and could refer <span id="Page_2158"></span>to nothing more than the fact that PSD cited those alleged fraudulent reports as a basis for suspending the appellant's security clearance. That information had already been provided to the appellant in the proposal notice. Moreover, even if the deciding official did consider additional information concerning those reports, beyond what was included in the proposal notice, the appellant has not established that the information considered was new and material. Accordingly, we find the appellant has not shown that he was denied a meaningful opportunity to invoke the deciding official's discretion regarding the penalty determination. In sum, we conclude that the appellant has not shown that he was denied due process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant did not establish that the agency committed harmful error.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To prove harmful procedural error, an appellant must prove that the agency committed an error in the application of its procedures that is likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)]. The relevant procedures in this case are set forth in the MD 1100.75-3 Handbook, which provides, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that an employee facing an adverse action receive written notice stating the charges and specifications and a description of the evidence that supports the charge. MD 1100.75-3 Handbook (2009), &#x00A7; I(2)(a)(i). The directive further provides that the employee is entitled to see the materials relied upon to support each charge and specification. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00A7; I(2)(a)(x). In addition, the employee must be provided an opportunity to respond orally and in writing to a deciding official who will consider the replies and decide the outcome based on all of the evidence of record and the applicable <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00A7; I(2)(c). The appellant asserts that the agency violated its procedures because the decision to indefinitely suspend him was based on information that the agency failed to disclose, and that the agency failed to provide him a meaningful opportunity to address the underlying accusations before indefinitely suspending him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an agency indefinitely suspends an employee under chapter 75 based on the suspension of a security clearance, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 requires that the appellant be provided sufficient information to make an informed reply, including a statement of the reasons for the clearance suspension. <span class="Italic">See Cheney</span>, 479 F.3d at 1352-53; <span class="Italic">Alston</span>, 75 F.3d at 662. The same general principles apply in determining whether the agency committed harmful error concerning the similar notice requirement of MD 1100.75-3. <span class="Italic">See Buelna</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 115, &#x00B6; 19. Here, the notice suspending the appellant's security clearance, coupled with the notice proposing his indefinite suspension, informed him of the basis for the suspension of his security clearance, i.e., the alleged fraudulent claims. We find this was sufficient information to allow for an informed response, as required under agency procedures. <span class="Italic">See Alston</span>, 75 F.3d at 662 (finding that the agency provided the employee with sufficient information to make an informed reply when it notified him that his security clearance was being suspended because of "a potential medical condition" and then informed him that he was being indefinitely suspended from duty based on the suspension of his security clearance); <span class="Italic">cf. Cheney</span>, 479 F.3d at 1353 (finding that the employee was not provided with the opportunity to make a meaningful response to the notice of proposed suspension where he had to guess at the reasons for his security clearance suspension).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, as mentioned above, the appellant has not shown by preponderant evidence that the agency failed to provide any additional evidence on which the deciding official relied. Moreover, assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the agency did commit procedural error in that regard, the appellant has not shown that the agency was likely to have reached a different decision in the absence of that error. Finally, as discussed above, the appellant was provided the opportunity to respond orally and in writing to a deciding official with authority to decide the outcome of the proposed indefinite suspension. We therefore affirm the administrative judge's finding that the appellant failed to establish harmful error. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the administrative judge's determination to sustain the appellant's indefinite suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Vice Chairman Wagner concurred in <span class="Italic">Buelna</span>, troubled not by the result but by the Board majority's reasoning--in her estimation, too complex, yet insufficiently encompassing of due process protections as to notice of the reasons for a clearance suspension and the opportunity to respond:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I agree with the majority's description of the background and issues to be decided in this case (Majority Opinion, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-12) and their findings that: the appellant was entitled to due process concerning his indefinite suspension (<span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 13); the Board has authority to review whether the agency provided the appellant due process in indefinitely suspending him (<span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15); due process required that the deciding official have the authority to select alternative penalties other than suspension without pay (<span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 28); due process required notice of the facts underlying the clearance suspension to the extent that those facts were considered in determining the penalty (<span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 29-32); and, the appellant did not establish that the agency committed harmful error (<span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 33-35). Furthermore, I conclude, as does the majority, that the agency did not violate the appellant's due process rights in indefinitely suspending him based upon the suspension of his security clearance. However, I fundamentally disagree with my colleagues as to their delineation of the process to which the appellant was entitled under the Fifth Amendment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Gargiulo v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 727 F.3d 1181, 1185 (Fed. Cir. 2013), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recognized that the appellant, a Federal Air Marshal, "had due process rights with respect to his indefinite suspension." It did not, however, define what those rights entailed. Rather, the court noted that, under <span class="Italic">Egan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), the Board's review of an adverse action based on a security clearance revocation is limited to whether a security clearance was denied and was a requirement of the position and whether the 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 procedures were followed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1186. It thereafter found that the Board erred in holding</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">as a matter of constitutional due process, that Mr. Gargiulo was entitled to notice of the reasons for the suspension of his security clearance and an opportunity to make a meaningful response regarding those reasons to someone in the agency with the authority to affect that decision. While this court's cases hold that section 7513 grants those rights...we have not held that those rights are guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1186. Thus, the question remains as to what exactly the constitutional right to due process ensures when a tenured federal employee is deprived of a property interest in that employment based upon security clearance determinations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before reaching that question, however, I note my agreement with the majority that we should clarify our recent decisions involving indefinite suspensions based on a suspension of a security clearance. In <span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span>, the Federal Circuit found that the Board reached the merits of the underlying security clearance action in its analysis of the appellant's due process claim and, thereby, exceeded its authority. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1187. Our discussion of due process in <span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span>, and in our prior decision in this appeal, was originally articulated in <span class="Italic">McGriff v. Department of the Navy</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 89 (2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">McGriff</span>, the Board cited <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. Homar</span>, 520 U.S. 924 (1997), which analyzed the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Mathews v. Eldridge</span>, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), to determine what constitutional process is due a public employee suspended from employment. 118 M.S.P.R. 89, &#x00B6; 27. While not erroneous, that analysis was unnecessary for two reasons. First, in <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532 (1985), the U.S. Supreme Court had already distilled the Mathews factors to arrive at the fundamental contours of due process, i.e., notice and meaningful opportunity to respond, when a public employee is deprived of a property interest in employment.[*] Moreover, the Board long ago applied <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> in cases involving indefinite suspension from employment based on a suspension of access to security areas or information. <span class="Italic">See Byerline v. Department of the Navy</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 279, 283 (1994). Second, we ostensibly cited <span class="Italic">Homar</span> for the proposition that constitutional due process may not, in every circumstance, require predeprivation notice and opportunity to respond. 118 M.S.P.R. 89, &#x00B6; 27; <span class="Italic">Kriner v. Department of the Navy</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 526, 531 (1994). However, the process afforded Mr. McGriff occurred prior to his indefinite suspension, thus, making its timing irrelevant to the question of whether it satisfied the constitutional requirements under <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;For this reason, I believe that the majority's discussion (Majority Opinion, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-22) of <span class="Italic">Mathews v. Eldridge</span>, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), and particularly, its application of the <span class="Italic">Mathews</span> factors to define what constitutional process is due under these circumstances to be unnecessary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Beyond being unnecessary, our discussion of the second <span class="Italic">Homar</span> factor also unfortunately suggested that the Board was engaged in a review of the merits of the agency's security clearance determination. I believe that <span class="Italic">Homar</span> was not essential to the resolution of the appellant's due process claim and our discussion of it in our prior decisions here and elsewhere risks perpetuating the misapprehension that the Board lacks a proper understanding of our authority in reviewing adverse actions based on security clearance determinations. Therefore, I would modify our prior decisions only to eliminate the discussion of <span class="Italic">Homar</span> and <span class="Italic">Matthews</span> altogether and to examine the appellants' due process claims solely under <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">King v. Alston</span>, 75 F.3d 657, 659 (Fed. Cir. 1996), the Federal Circuit reviewed a Board decision finding that the agency violated constitutional due process in placing the appellant on enforced leave after suspending his access to classified information. The court recognized that, while no one has a right to a security clearance or access to classified information, an employee as defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7501 "has a property right in his continued employment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 661 (citing <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>). It thereafter affirmed that such employees "cannot be deprived of that interest without the procedural protections provided by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)." It went on to hold that "section 7513(b) entitles an employee to notice of the reasons for the suspension of his access to classified information when that is the <span id="Page_2159"></span>reason for placing the employee on enforced leave pending a decision on the employee's security clearance. Such notice provides the employee with an adequate opportunity to make a meaningful reply to the agency before being placed on enforced leave." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 661-62. It further held that "[m]erely providing the employee with information that his access to classified information is being suspended, without more, does not provide the employee with sufficient information to make an informed reply to the agency before being placed on enforced leave." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 662.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span>, the court expressly recognized that the appellant had due process rights with respect to his indefinite suspension. 727 F.3d at 1185. At the same time, it found that the Board erred in holding that the appellant was entitled as a matter of constitutional due process to notice of the reasons for the suspension of his security clearance and an opportunity to make a meaningful response regarding those reasons to someone in the agency with the authority to affect that decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1186. This designation of error seems to me to be at odds with <span class="Italic">King v. Alston</span>, which plainly, albeit tacitly, equated the constitutional due process afforded a federal employee facing deprivation of his property interest in continued employment with the right to notice and opportunity to respond under section 7513(b). Moreover, the court's insistence in <span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span> that the rights "to notice of the reasons for the suspension of his security clearance and an opportunity to make a meaningful response regarding those reasons to someone in the agency with the authority to affect that decision" derive solely from 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b) seems to imply that these rights do not also comprise the elements of constitutional due process. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1186. If constitutional due process demands something less than what the statute compels in these cases, then how does one define it consistent with <span class="Italic">Loudermill's</span> dictate for notice and <span class="Italic">meaningful</span> opportunity to respond? The court has left this question unanswered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I disagree with the majority's answer--that it is sufficient for due process in this context "for the agency to inform the appellant that his position required a security clearance, and that he could no longer hold his position once he lost his clearance"--because it renders the process utterly void of meaning and is contrary to <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>. It also inexplicably departs from longstanding Board precedent. In <span class="Italic">Kriner</span>, the Board held that "[w]hen a suspension is based on restriction of the employee's security access, the agency is required to provide the employee a meaningful opportunity to respond to the reasons for the suspension by ensuring that either in the advance notice of that action, or in the earlier access determination, the employee has been notified of the cause that led to the access determination." 61 M.S.P.R. at 533. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Byerline</span>, the Board concluded that "where an indefinite suspension is based on the revocation of access to security areas or information, the agency must provide the appellant with a meaningful opportunity to respond to the reasons for the indefinite suspension <span class="Italic">by ensuring that either in the advance notice of that action, or in the earlier access determination, he has been notified of the cause that led to the access determination</span>." 62 M.S.P.R. at 283 (emphasis added). The Board went on to say that "only in this manner does the agency assure that the appellant is afforded meaningful due process with respect to his constitutionally protected property interest in his employment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Alston</span>, the court recognized that when an adverse action is based upon the suspension of a security clearance, merely providing the employee with notice of the clearance action, without more, does not "provide the employee with sufficient information to make an informed reply to the agency" as to the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 662.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The majority cites <span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span> in finding that the agency "was not obliged as a matter of constitutional due process to notify the appellant of the specific reasons for the suspension of his security clearance." Majority Opinion, &#x00B6; 25. I do not believe that <span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span> compels that conclusion. Rather, the court objected to the characterization of the statutory rights to notice and opportunity to respond as a constitutional guarantee that the Board "may delineate and enforce" as contrary to precedent holding that there are no due process rights attaching to security clearance determinations. 727 F.3d at 1186. However, its criticism is essentially premised on the notion that, by recognizing the constitutional dimension of these rights, the Board improperly presumed the authority to review the merits of the security clearance decision in derogation of <span class="Italic">Egan</span>. However, in <span class="Italic">Alston</span>, the court reviewed a similar claim by the Office of Personnel Management that, by recognizing the appellant's right to notice of the reasons for the security clearance action, the court and the Board were reviewing the merits of the agency's decision to suspend his clearance or to review the procedures used in denying such access. 75 F.3d at 662. As the court explained, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> "does not foreclose board review of the procedures used by the agency" in effecting the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 662-63. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Kriner</span>, the Board fully reconciled the limitations on its review under <span class="Italic">Egan</span> with the constitutional due process demands of <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In security clearance cases, the Board's authority to determine whether the agency has provided minimum due process is made clear when the Supreme Court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> and <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> are read together, as they must be. The right to a full, evidentiary post-termination hearing recognized by <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> does not confer a right to merits review by the Board in these cases because under <span class="Italic">Egan</span> the commitment by law of security clearance determinations to the discretion of the employing agency precludes review by an outside body like the Board. However, nothing in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> excused the employing agency from providing the employee the pre-termination opportunity to be heard which <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> requires, and as, as noted above, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> recognized the Board's authority to review whether the agency has done so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Review by the Board of the agency's procedures in a case such as this one does not require the Board to inquire into substantive matters of national security or to second-guess the agency's judgment concerning whether a particular employee is fit for access to classified information. Rather, the Board need only make the kind of determinations it routinely makes: whether the agency has given the employee an opportunity to reply to its charges and whether its notice was adequate to give the employee a meaningful opportunity to respond.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">61 M.S.P.R. at 531-32.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although <span class="Italic">Alston</span> held that section 7513 provides the employee with an adequate opportunity to make a meaningful reply, it does not follow that "[t]hat right...is...not [also] constitutional." <span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span>, 727 F.3d at 1186. That is, <span class="Italic">Alston's</span> holding that the right to make a meaningful reply is embodied in section 7513 must be read consistently with <span class="Italic">Loudermill's</span> holding that the right to make a meaningful reply is guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment. If merely providing the employee with notice of the clearance action, without more, fails to provide the employee with sufficient information to make an informed reply under section 7513(b), <span class="Italic">see Alston</span>, 75 F.3d at 662, it also fails to provide the employee with sufficient information to make a meaningful reply under the Fifth Amendment, <span class="Italic">see Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 546.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I believe that the only logical conclusion that can be reached from <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> and <span class="Italic">King v. Alston</span> is that an appellant with a constitutionally-protected property interest in employment cannot be indefinitely suspended pending a security clearance determination without being afforded the due process guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment and that the essential elements of that constitutional due process are the notice and opportunity to respond described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b). I also believe that <span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span> does not expressly define constitutional due process as anything other than what the court said it was in <span class="Italic">Alston</span>. But even if it did, then I believe that the Board is obliged to follow <span class="Italic">Alston</span> pursuant to the Federal Circuit's judicial practice wherein the precedential decision of the court is the first decision that was issued unless overruled by an <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision. <span class="Italic">See Bosley v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 162 F.3d 665, 672 (Fed. Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regardless of my disagreement with the majority on these issues, I concur with the decision to sustain the appellant's indefinite suspension because I believe the record shows that the agency provided the appellant with notice and opportunity to respond to the proposed indefinite suspension by providing him with the specific basis for the suspension of his security clearance and by delegating the proposed action to a deciding official with the authority to change the outcome of a proposed indefinite suspension. Accordingly, the appellant was afforded the minimum due process required by the Constitution. <span class="Italic">McGriff</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 89, &#x00B6; 33.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit's precedential decision in <span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span> was issued on August 16, 2013, by the judicial panel of Judges Lourie, Bryson, and Taranto. About a month earlier, the court issued a nonprecedential decision in <span class="Italic">Salinas-Nix v. Dept. of Army</span>, 527 Fed. Appx. 956, 959-62 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP), through a panel of Judges Moore, Linn, and O'Malley. There the court considered constitutional due process, but found that the requirements were met on the facts before the court:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The threshold issue in this case is whether an employee is entitled to constitutional Due Process when the adverse action results from the suspension of the employee's security clearance. The Army contends that the Board erred when it afforded constitutional Due Process rights to Ms. Salinas-Nix. It argues that the Board's analysis effectively entails a review of the underlying <span class="Italic">Egan</span> prohibits. The Army contends that the Board should have considered only Ms. Salinas-Nix's statutory due process rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Army's position has merit. In order to assert a constitutional Due Process claim, an employee must have a "constitutionally protected 'property' interest" in continued employment. <span class="Italic">Homar</span>, 520 U.S. at 928. We have repeatedly held, however, that "a federal employee does not have a...property interest in access to classified information, and therefore the revocation of a security clearance does not implicate constitutional procedural due process concerns." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Robinson v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., 498 F.3d 1361, 1364-65 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 978 F.2d 1223, 1225-26 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (citation omitted)); <span class="Italic">see also Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 528 ("It should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a <span id="Page_2160"></span>security clearance."). Given our precedent, the Board's approach is open to doubt. But we do not need to resolve the issue here. Under either standard, the Army did not violate Ms. Salinas-Nix's rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Salinas-Nix argues that the Board erred in concluding that the Army followed due process when it decided to suspend her indefinitely. She contends that, when the Army interviewed her about the suspected fraud, she was not aware that she was being investigated. Ms. Salinas-Nix argues that, in any event, there is no evidence that she ever admitted any wrongdoing. Further, Ms. Salinas-Nix argues that the Army did not give her an opportunity to review some of the materials that it relied upon to prepare the Notice of Proposed Suspension (the Notice). Specifically, she contends that the Army withheld a report prepared by its Criminal Investigation Division (CID) until after her indictment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Salinas-Nix also contends that the Army violated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(g), which prohibits agencies from considering reasons for a proposed action other than those specified in the Notice. She argues that the deciding official improperly relied on information in the rescinded version of the Notice and on newspaper articles about the criminal accusations against Ms. Salinas-Nix. Ms. Salinas-Nix contends that the procedural errors were harmful and requests a new proceeding before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Salinas-Nix's arguments largely challenge the adequacy of the evidence that led to the suspension of her security clearance. But the Army is correct that these issues implicate the merits of suspending the clearance, which the Board had no power to review under <span class="Italic">Egan</span>. Because Ms. Salinas-Nix was undisputedly suspended due to a loss of the security clearance required by her position, the Board's review was limited to whether the Army afforded her the due process protections of &#x00A7; 7513(b). <span class="Italic">See Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 530; <span class="Italic">see also Hesse v. Dep't of State</span>, 217 F.3d 1372, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Like the Board, we have no authority to review the propriety of the suspension of Ms. Salinas-Nix's security clearance. Accordingly, we consider her due process arguments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The applicable statute provides that "[a]n employee against whom an action is proposed is entitled to--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;at least 30 days' advance written notice...stating the specific reasons for the proposed action;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;a reasonable time, but not less than 7 days, to answer orally and in writing and to furnish affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of the answer;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;be represented by an attorney or other representative; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;a written decision and the specific reasons therefor at the earliest practicable date."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b) (2012); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404 (2010). We have held that, in security clearance cases, "section 7513(b) entitles an employee to notice of the reasons for the suspension of his access to classified information when that is the reason for placing the employee on enforced leave." <span class="Italic">King v. Alston</span>, 75 F.3d 657, 661 (Fed. Cir. 1996). The notice must contain "sufficient detail to allow the employee to make an informed reply." <span class="Italic">Brook v. Corrado</span>, 999 F.2d 523, 526 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Army complied with &#x00A7; 7513(b). The Notice explained in detail why the Army suspended Ms. Salinas-Nix's security clearance and why the Army proposed to indefinitely suspend her from her position. For example, the Notice set forth several alleged instances of Ms. Salinas-Nix's structuring of bank deposits so as "to avoid reporting requirements." It further claimed that Ms. Salinas-Nix acknowledged engaging in this structuring and that this conduct "raises questions regarding [her] reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment." Finally, the Notice explained that Ms. Salinas-Nix's position "is one of unique responsibility to supervise and provide procurement approvals...and requires...access to classified and confidential information."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Salinas-Nix's detailed response to the Notice through her attorney reinforces the conclusion that the notice met the requirements of due process. <span class="Italic">See</span> Supp. Appendix; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(2), (3). The response reflects Ms. Salinas-Nix's clear understanding of the reasons for the proposed indefinite suspension and the options available to her. Even if Ms. Salinas-Nix is correct that the Army had more information about her financial transactions than it included in the Notice, the Army did not violate &#x00A7; 7513(b) because it adequately and timely apprised her of the reasons for the proposed action and gave her an opportunity to respond.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Army also provided an adequate and timely Notice of Decision (the Decision), as required by &#x00A7; 7513(b)(4), setting forth the reasons for the indefinite suspension. The Decision explained that a preponderance of the evidence showed that Ms. Salinas-Nix engaged in criminal structuring of bank transactions, suggesting lack of trustworthiness. The Decision further noted that Ms. Salinas-Nix had "access to classified and confidential information which might be used for improper personal gain by one who is not forthright and trustworthy." The Decision explained that these concerns led to the suspension of Ms. Salinas-Nix's security clearance and concluded that that Ms. Salinas-Nix's indefinite suspension from her position "is fully warranted based on...the security [clearance] suspension." These explanations and the documents prepared and relied upon by the CID, which were provided to Mr. Salinas-Nix, satisfy the statutory due process requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also conclude that the Army did not violate 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404. That regulation, which implements 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b), states that an agency may "consider only the reasons specified in the notice of proposed action and any answer of the employee or...her representative" in its final decision. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(g). Although Ms. Salinas-Nix faults the Army for consulting various allegedly extraneous documents and newspaper articles, she does not explain why the reasons for her indefinite suspension differ from those given in the Notice. The Army is correct that the reasons are the same--structuring of bank transactions and the resulting suspension of Ms. Salinas-Nix's security clearance. Because the Army did not violate the applicable statute and regulation, the Board's affirmance of the Army's indefinite suspension of Ms. Salinas-Nix was in accordance with law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the Board did not err in concluding that the Army afforded adequate constitutional Due Process rights to Ms. Salinas-Nix. In analyzing agency procedures for compliance with Due Process, we weigh the private interest affected by the official action; the risk of erroneous deprivation of the interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and the government's interest. <span class="Italic">See Gilbert v. Homar</span>, 520 U.S. 924, 931-32 (1997). With respect to the first <span class="Italic">Homar</span> factor, the Board explained that the procedures that Ms. Salinas-Nix received properly accounted for her significant private interest in not being suspended from her position. Because the Army provided Ms. Salinas-Nix with a detailed post-suspension notice and a meaningful opportunity to reply, we see no error in that determination. With respect to the second <span class="Italic">Homar</span> factor, the Board determined that the Army "had reasonable grounds to support the indefinite suspension action." We see no error in the Board's analysis of this factor because the Army explained that it was suspending Ms. Salinas-Nix due to loss of her security clearance, which resulted from a criminal investigation into Ms. Salinas-Nix's structuring of bank transactions. With respect to the third <span class="Italic">Homar</span> factor, the Board explained that the Army's "compelling interest in withholding national security information from unauthorized persons...arguably weighs in favor of the government's authority to take immediate action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 6-7 (citing <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 527). We agree. The compelling government interest at stake in this case reinforces the conclusion that the procedures Ms. Salinas-Nix received were constitutionally adequate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Buelna</span> and <span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span> were summarized by <span class="Italic">Putnam v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/PUTNAM_KRISTI_L_DE_0752_12_0039_I_3_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1076101.pdf">121 MSPR 532</a>, 537-39 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-10, 2014 MSPB 70 (2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Buelna</span>, the Board recently outlined the principles and standards applicable in chapter 75 appeals of adverse actions based on the suspension or revocation of a security clearance. <span class="Italic">See</span> 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-15, 23-25, 27-31. First, relying on the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span>, the Board reaffirmed that employees have a due process right in connection with an indefinite suspension or removal based upon the suspension or revocation of a security clearance and that the Board also has the authority to review whether an agency provided an employee with due process in taking such an adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-15 (citing, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, <span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span>, 727 F.3d at 1185).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, pursuant to the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span>, the Board explained that due process does not require that an employee have an opportunity to challenge the merits of the agency's security clearance suspension or revocation. <span class="Italic">Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18 n.7, 24. In reaching this conclusion, the Board further explained that, in cases where the employee <span class="Italic">does</span> receive an opportunity to contest the clearance determination prior to the adverse action proceedings, that opportunity alone is insufficient to satisfy due process concerning the proposed adverse action because due process requires that the employee have a right to respond to a proposed adverse action, which is distinct from a security clearance determination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 24 n.9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, the Board addressed an issue left open by the court in <span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span>, <span class="Italic">see</span> 727 F.3d at 1185 n.4, and it held that due process does not demand that the deciding official consider alternatives to the proposed adverse action that are prohibited, impracticable, or outside management's purview. <span class="Italic">Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 27. In reaching this conclusion, the Board explained that due process in connection with an adverse action based on the suspension or revocation of a security clearance is limited "to invok[ing] the discretion of a deciding official with authority to change the outcome of the proposed action to the extent that may have been feasible." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 28. This standard differed from the Board's earlier approach, which had held that due process required that the deciding official have the authority to change the outcome of the proposed adverse action by either reinstating the appellant's access to classified information or by reassigning her to a position not requiring such access. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Diehl v. Department of the Army</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 344, &#x00B6; 12 (2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2161"></span>Lastly, the Board expounded upon the impact of the <span class="Italic">Ward</span>/<span class="Italic">Stone</span>[2] line of authority on adverse actions based upon the suspension or revocation of a security clearance. <span class="Italic">See Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 30-31. The Board explained that the only information material to an agency's charge involving the suspension or revocation of a clearance is whether the employee's position required a security clearance and whether the clearance was suspended or revoked; the Board concluded that any additional information a deciding official may consider in connection with such a charge cannot be new and material information under <span class="Italic">Ward/Stone. Id</span>., &#x00B6; 31.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274 (Fed. Cir. 2011); <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the deciding official's penalty determination, however, the Board found that, under the <span class="Italic">Ward</span>/<span class="Italic">Stone</span> line of cases, an employee is entitled to advanced notice of all of the information a deciding official may rely on in considering the employee's proposed suspension or removal, including information concerning the extent to which "the deciding official's penalty determination [may be] influenced by the factual basis for the underlying security clearance determination." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In the event that an appellant cannot establish a <span class="Italic">Ward</span>/<span class="Italic">Stone</span> violation concerning the deciding official's penalty determination, as in all other instances involving alleged due process violations, the Board will then conduct a harmful error analysis to determine if the agency erred in the application of its procedures, and, if so, whether such an error caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 33; <span class="Italic">see Bennett v. Department of Justice</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 685, &#x00B6; 12 (2013) (under <span class="Italic">Ward</span>/<span class="Italic">Stone</span>, if no due process violation is found, then a harmful error analysis must be conducted).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McGriff</span> predictably led, prior to the Federal Circuit decision in <span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span>, to other decisions reversing indefinite suspensions based on clearance suspensions that could not be timely responded to by appellants facing deciding officials who could not influence the clearance suspensions. Typical of the cases that followed was <span class="Italic">Diehl v. Dept. of Army</span>, 118 MSPR 344, 349-50 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-14, 2012 MSPB 89 (2012), summarizing the essential <span class="Italic">McGriff</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Providing an appellant with a reasonable opportunity to reply that satisfies constitutional due process requires more than mere notice; the reply opportunity may not be an empty formality, and the deciding official should have authority to take or recommend agency action based on the reply. <span class="Italic">McGriff</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 89, &#x00B6; 33. In other words, the agency does not afford an individual with a meaningful opportunity to respond by merely providing an empty process for presenting his defense against the agency's adverse action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The deciding official must have the authority to change the outcome of the indefinite suspension action by either reinstating the appellant's access to classified information or reassigning him to a position not requiring access to classified information. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 33-36.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is especially important that the deciding official have the authority to change the outcome of a proposed indefinite suspension by either reinstating the appellant's access to classified information or reassigning him to a position not requiring access to classified information, when, as in the instant case, the employee did not have a meaningful opportunity to respond to the reasons for the suspension of the security clearance in the earlier access determination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 33. Otherwise, an indefinite suspension would become the automatic penalty based on a security clearance determination, even though the security clearance determination lacked any procedural due process protection at the time the indefinite suspension action was taken. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, the Board has held that, if the deciding official lacks the authority to do anything but affirm the indefinite suspension action, the procedures used in effecting the appellant's indefinite suspension sufficiently run the risk of an erroneous deprivation of his property interest in employment such as to find that the agency violated his right to constitutional due process. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 36.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as in <span class="Italic">McGriff</span> and <span class="Italic">Buelna</span>, the record establishes that the deciding official lacked the authority to change the outcome of the indefinite suspension action. The proposal notice expressly states that "[o]nly CCF can reinstate your access to classified material. This command and your previous command are unable to affect your access.... This command does not have the option of placing you in another position while you await adjudication of your case by CCF." In the decision notice, Bochna reiterated that only the CCF can reinstate the appellant's access to classified material. This is further corroborated by the hearing testimony of Colonel Michael Bokner, the Brigade Commander of the Army Field Services Center. Moreover, Bochna explained in the decision notice that "Comptroller General case law prohibits the agency from granting administrative leave for an indefinite amount of time while awaiting the adjudication of [the appellant's] security clearance." Based on the foregoing, we find that Bochna lacked the authority to change the outcome of the adverse action, and therefore the agency failed to afford the appellant a meaningful opportunity to respond to the proposed indefinite suspension action. Thus, we find that the agency violated the appellant's constitutional due process rights, and therefore the indefinite suspension action must be cancelled. Accordingly, we REVERSE the initial decision and DO NOT SUSTAIN the indefinite suspension action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DHS,</span> DC-0752-11-0888-I-1 (NP 8/7/2012) ("A reply procedure that compromises a deciding official's authority or objectivity can constitute a constitutional due process violation. <span class="Italic">Buelna</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 115, &#x00B6; 18; <span class="Italic">McGriff</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 89, &#x00B6; 35. Therefore, under the circumstances of this case, a question exists regarding whether the agency afforded the appellant a meaningful opportunity to reply to the reason for the suspension of his security clearance before suspending him from his position, or whether instead <span id="Page_2162"></span>the agency merely provided him with an empty formality.

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Styles v. DHS</span>, SF-0752-10-0295-I-2 (NP 10/5/2012), a TSA case involving a Federal Air Marshal, the analysis was not too clear. The Board noted that there appeared to be due process as to the clearance suspension before the indefinite suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...However, the appellant was afforded notice and an opportunity to respond to the reasons for the revocation of his security clearance prior to the imposition of the suspension based on that revocation. Therefore, despite the prolonged nature of the suspension at issue here, we cannot conclude that the "timing of the notice and opportunity to respond rendered the process afforded him constitutionally defective." <span class="Italic">See McGriff</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 89, &#x00B6; 29.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board remanded the case to determine whether the deciding official on the indefinite suspension had the authority to consider alternatives to an indefinite suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, we find that the letter notifying the appellant of the suspension of his security clearance, coupled with the notice proposing his indefinite suspension, did not deny him a meaningful opportunity to respond by failing to provide him with the specific reasons for the action before he responded to the proposal notice. <span class="Italic">See McGriff</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 89, &#x00B6; 32. As set forth above, the letter notifying the appellant of the suspension of his security clearance and the notice of proposed indefinite suspension advised the appellant of the basis for the indefinite suspension action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, "[p]roviding an appellant with a reasonable opportunity to reply that satisfies constitutional due process requires more than mere notice; the reply opportunity may not be an empty formality, and the reply or deciding official should have authority to take or recommend agency action based upon the reply." <span class="Italic">McGriff</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 89, &#x00B6; 33 (citing <span class="Italic">Swindell v. Veterans Administration</span>, 12 M.S.P.R. 148, 150-51 (1982)). We emphasized in <span class="Italic">McGriff</span> that "it is especially important in circumstances such as are present here that the deciding official have authority to change the outcome of a proposed indefinite suspension where the employee did not have a meaningful opportunity to respond to the reasons for the suspension of the security clearance in the earlier access determination." <span class="Italic">McGriff</span>, 118 MSPR 89, &#x00B6; 33.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the appellant's security clearance was suspended summarily, with no opportunity to respond to the allegations on which the suspension was based prior to its implementation. In the decision to indefinitely suspend the appellant, the deciding official stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The suspension of your security clearance is not an action that I have authority to reverse, and as long as the suspension remains in place, your continued presence in the workplace would be a burden to FAM operations. Therefore, notwithstanding your objection to the suspension of your security clearance [on the grounds that it was based on an incomplete investigation], I agree with the proposing official that suspending you from duty pending resolution of that issue is necessary to promote the efficiency of the Federal service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the deciding official stated in an affidavit submitted during the proceedings on appeal that the appellant's "failure to maintain a condition of his position was such a serious offense, there could be no mitigation." Thus, the deciding official did not have authority to determine if the suspension of the appellant's security clearance was justified and to reinstate the clearance. However, like in <span class="Italic">McGriff</span>, the current record does not establish whether the deciding official in fact possessed authority to reassign the appellant to a position not requiring a security clearance. <span class="Italic">See McGriff</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 89, &#x00B6; 35. Nor does the record establish whether the deciding official possessed authority to place the appellant on administrative leave pending a final determination with respect to his security clearance. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. A reply procedure that compromises a deciding official's authority or objectivity can constitute a constitutional due process violation. <span class="Italic">Buelna</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 115, &#x00B6; 18; <span class="Italic">McGriff</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 89, &#x00B6; 35. Therefore, under the circumstances of this case, a question exists regarding whether the agency afforded the appellant a meaningful opportunity to reply to the reason for the suspension of his security clearance before suspending him from his position, or whether instead the agency merely provided him with an empty formality. Because the record in this case is incomplete as to the deciding official's authority with respect to the appellant's indefinite suspension, we find that further adjudication is warranted. On remand, the administrative judge shall provide the parties with the opportunity to engage in further discovery and present additional argument regarding this issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hornseth v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/18-1188.Opinion.2-27-2019.pdf">916 F.3d 1369</a>, 1373-75 (Fed. Cir. 2019), involved an employee whose clearance was suspended and whose work was at a facility where every position required a clearance. The court rejected the argument, relying on <span class="Italic">McGriff</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, that Hornseth was denied due process because the deciding official lacked an alternative to the suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the government that an alternative action need not be available in a security-clearance case. It is well-settled that a government employee has no "right" to a security clearance. <span class="Italic">Dep't of Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). Although the Board does not have broad authority to review a security-clearance determination, "[a]n employee who is removed for 'cause' under &#x00A7; 7513, when his required clearance is denied, is entitled to the several procedural protections specified in that statute." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 530.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a result, we have held that review of adverse actions stemming from security clearance determinations is limited to determining (1) "whether a security clearance was denied," (2) "whether the security clearance was a requirement for appellant's position," and (3) "whether the procedures set forth in [&#x00A7;] 7513 were followed." <span class="Italic">Hesse v. Dep't of State</span>, 217 F.3d 1372, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Section 7513 thus requires the agency to provide "notice of denial or revocation [of the security clearance]; a statement of the reason(s) upon which the negative decision was based; and an opportunity to respond." <span class="Italic">Lyles v. Dep't of Army</span>, 864 F.2d 1581, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (quoting <span class="Italic">Egan v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. 509, 519 (1985), <span class="Italic">vacated</span>, 802 F.2d 1563 (Fed. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 484 U.S. 518 (1988) (alteration in original).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Those procedures were met in this case. Hornseth received notice, had an opportunity to respond and to be represented, and was provided with a written decision with reasons. Thus, he received the procedural protections provided by law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the AJ's review deviated from this framework. Specifically, the AJ concluded that an alternative position <span class="Italic">must</span> be available to comport with due process. <span class="Italic">See</span> J.A 21 ("[A] due process violation may be present when the reply process is an empty formality because the deciding official lacks the ability to take or recommend alternative agency action based on an appellant's reply (i.e., do anything but affirm the proposed action).")</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Such a conclusion is at odds with our case law, which makes clear that an employee has a right to be transferred to a nonsensitive position <span class="Italic">only</span> if that right is conferred by a statute or regulation. <span class="Italic">Lyles</span>, 864 F.2d at 1583 ("When one is hired for a position he is expected to meet the requirements of that position. If he does not, he may be dismissed unless additional rights are available from <span class="Italic">some other source</span>." (emphasis added)). Indeed, when an employee who is hired for a position requiring a security clearance fails to possess one, "not even reasonable accommodation is due," <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Def. Mapping Agency</span>, 864 F.2d 1579, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1989) ("When one who is hired for a position fails to meet the essential requirement of that position that he secure a security clearance, not even reasonable accommodation is due."), and &#x00A7; 7513 contains no obligation for the agency to transfer an employee to a nonsensitive position, even if that is possible, <span class="Italic">id</span>. If there is no alternative position authorized by statute, a deciding official is not required to create one. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, we conclude that the AJ erred in requiring the deciding official to have available an alternative position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although a deciding official need not have available an alternative penalty, the statute certainly contemplates that the deciding official have authority to act on behalf of the agency. The adverse-action procedure described in &#x00A7; 7513 is effected by the <span class="Italic">agency</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 7513(a) ("Under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, an <span class="Italic">agency</span> may take an action covered by this subchapter against an employee only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." (emphasis added)); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(g)(1) ("In arriving at its decision, the <span class="Italic">agency</span> will consider only the reasons specified in the notice of proposed action and any answer of the employee or his or her representative, or both, made to a designated official and any medical documentation reviewed under paragraph (f) of this section." (emphasis added))</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As applied in this case, the requirement that the deciding official have authority to act on behalf of the agency is clear from the Navy's own instructions regarding the adverse-decision process. U.S. Dep't of Navy, SECNAV Instruction 12752.1A (May 3, 2016) &#x00A7; 12(a)(1)(b) (stating that an employee is entitled to a "written notice," which must include "[t]he name and title of the official designated to hear an oral reply and/or receive a written reply," and requiring such designated official to "have authority to either make or recommend a final decision on the proposed action."), &#x00A7; 12(a)(2)(d) (entitling an employee to a written decision that "[i]s signed by an official in a higher level position than the official who proposed the action, unless the activity head/commander issued the advance notice, in which case the activity head/commander may issue the written decision."). Here, Combs's authority to act is undisputed. Therefore, Combs's action did not violate any applicable statute or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we conclude that the AJ erred in requiring a supervisor to have available an alternative position, we need not reach whether investigative leave would have been such an adequate alternative. Moreover, we regard this statement by the AJ of the requirement of an available position to be harmless error because Hornseth was provided with all the procedural protections provided by law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hairston v. DOD</span>, 119 MSPR 162, 169-71 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-23, 2013 MSPB 9 (2013), extended the line of indefinite suspension due process decisions to employees whose security clearance offices determine that they cannot hold noncritical sensitive positions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that the agency violated the appellant's due process rights. It reiterates that the appellant was given several layers of due process through the WHS/CAF/DOHA/CAB procedures. It further contends that no mitigation was available because the appellant failed to maintain a requirement for her position and there were no available non-sensitive positions to which she could be assigned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find the agency's argument unavailing. After the agency submitted its petition for review, the Board issued <span class="Italic">McGriff v. Department of the Navy</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 89, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24-33 (2012), and <span class="Italic">Diehl v. Department of the Army</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 344, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-14 (2012), in which the Board addressed the procedures that are due when an agency indefinitely suspends an employee based upon the suspension of access to classified information, or pending its investigation regarding that access, where the access is a condition of employment. The Board in <span class="Italic">McGriff</span> and <span class="Italic">Diehl</span> relied on the holding in <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. Homar</span>, 520 U.S. 924, 931-932 (1997), which set forth the balancing test for determining what process is constitutionally due a tenured government employee.<span class="Italic"> Diehl</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 344, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">McGriff</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 89, &#x00B6; 27. The relevant factors adopted in <span class="Italic">Homar</span> and applied in <span class="Italic">McGriff</span> and <span class="Italic">Diehl</span>, provide a framework for determining whether the timing, place, and circumstance of the procedures used in a case afforded the appellant her right to due process. <span class="Italic">Homar</span>, 530 U.S. at 930; <span class="Italic">Diehl</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 344, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">McGriff</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 89, &#x00B6; 27. The factors are: (1) the private interest affected by the official action; (2) the risk of erroneous deprivation of the interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and (3) the government's interest. <span class="Italic">Homar</span>, 530 U.S. at 931-32; <span class="Italic">Diehl</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 344, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">McGriff</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 89, &#x00B6; 27.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">McGriff</span> and <span class="Italic">Diehl</span>, the Board found that providing an appellant with a reasonable opportunity to reply that satisfies constitutional due process requires more than mere notice; the reply opportunity may not be an empty formality, and the deciding official on the indefinite suspension should have authority to take or recommend agency action based on the reply. <span class="Italic">Diehl</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 344, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">McGriff</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 89, &#x00B6; 33. In other words, the agency does not afford an individual with a meaningful opportunity to respond by merely providing an empty process for presenting his defense against the agency's adverse action. <span class="Italic">Diehl</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 344, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">McGriff</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 89, &#x00B6; 33. The deciding official must have the authority to change the outcome of the action or the agency runs the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the employee's property interest in employment such that it will have violated her right to constitutional due process.<span class="Italic"> McGriff</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 89, &#x00B6; 36.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While this case is arguably distinguishable from security clearance cases such as <span class="Italic">McGriff</span> and <span class="Italic">Diehl</span>, we discern no basis for affording an employee whose position does not require access to classified information fewer due process protections than employees whose positions do require such access. Indeed, the Court in <span class="Italic">Homar</span> applied the analytical framework set forth above in a case that did not involve access to classified information, or even a federal employee. <span class="Italic">Homar</span> at 926-27, 931-32 (applying the framework to the suspension of a tenured state police officer). Thus, we find applicable the Board's analysis in McGriff and <span class="Italic">Diehl</span>, which applied the test in <span class="Italic">Homa</span>r.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although both the appellant and the government have a significant interest in the action at issue here, we find, as we did in <span class="Italic">Diehl</span>, that the due process concerns ultimately weigh in the appellant's favor. As the administrative judge found, Willard both stated in her September 11, 2009 decision letter sustaining the appellant's indefinite suspension and testified that she had no authority to cancel or mitigate the appellant's indefinite suspension notwithstanding any response made by the appellant to the proposed indefinite suspension. Therefore, we find that the administrative judge properly reversed the appellant's indefinite suspension because the agency did not provide adequate due process. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dieh</span>l, 118 M.S.P.R. 344, &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_2163"></span>Given the Federal Circuit decision in <span class="Italic">Kaplan v. Conyers</span>, 733 F.3d 1148 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), that there is no constitutional due process required as to determinations of whether employees can hold noncritical sensitive position designations, it does not seem likely, without a reversal from the Supreme Court, that <span class="Italic">Hariston</span> will remain good law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Statutory due process, at least, requires that the employee be given the reasons underlying the clearance suspension so that those reasons may be discussed in the reply to the proposed indefinite suspension, <span class="Italic">Coghlan v. Dept. of Army</span>, AT-0752-16-0163-I-1 (NP 9/16/2016), although the reasons may be furnished indirectly through investigation reports or results that are known to the employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the context of an indefinite suspension stemming from the suspension of an employee's security clearance, an agency is not obliged as a matter of constitutional due process to notify the employee of the specific reasons for the suspension of his clearance. <span class="Italic">Buelna v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 25 (2014). For purposes of due process, it is sufficient for an agency to inform the employee that his position required a security clearance and that he can no longer hold his position once he lost his clearance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, the agency provided the appellant with this information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Separate from constitutional due process, the Board will reverse an indefinite suspension based on the suspension of a security clearance if an appellant is able to prove a harmful procedural error. <span class="Italic">Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 33; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(1). To do so, an appellant must prove that the agency committed an error in the application of its procedures that is likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 33; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(r).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the statutory requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(e), an employee facing an adverse action must be notified of the specific reasons for a proposed adverse action. <span class="Italic">Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 25. In the context of an indefinite suspension based on the suspension of a security clearance, section 7513 requires that the appellant be provided sufficient information to make an informed reply, including a statement of the reasons for the clearance suspension. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 34. Further, a provision of the applicable collective bargaining agreement requires that an employee facing formal discipline "be given, upon request, copies of all documentation pertaining to the offense in accordance with applicable law."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency's proposal to indefinitely suspend the appellant because of his clearance suspension did not include a statement of the reasons for that clearance suspension. When the appellant requested the documents supporting the proposed indefinite suspension, he reportedly received only two emails, neither of which discussed the reasons for the underlying clearance suspension. Nevertheless, we agree with the administrative judge's determination that he received adequate notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the agency notified the appellant that it was suspending his access to classified and sensitive information, it cited the AR 15-6 investigation as the basis for doing so. Subsequently, when DODCAF informed the appellant that it intended to revoke his clearance, it included a "statement of reasons," which detailed the allegations underlying the AR 15-6 investigation and report, as well as the associated security concerns. After that, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the agency provided the appellant with a copy of the agency's AR 15-6 report, with redactions for attorney work product, attorney-client communications, and personal privacy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant received all of the aforementioned information in the months leading up to the agency's proposal to indefinitely suspend him "based on [his] local suspension of access to classified and sensitive information." Under these circumstances, it is evident that the appellant had sufficient information to make an informed reply to the proposed indefinite suspension, including the reasons for the clearance suspension. Therefore, the requirements of section 7513 were satisfied, and the agency did not commit harmful error by failing to provide additional documentation. <span class="Italic">See King v. Alston</span>, 75 F.3d 657, 662 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (finding that the agency provided an employee with sufficient information to make an informed reply when it notified him that his security clearance was being suspended because of "a potential medical condition" and then informed him that he was being indefinitely suspended from duty based on the suspension of his security clearance); <span class="Italic">Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 34 (finding that the notice suspending an appellant's security clearance, coupled with the notice proposing his indefinite suspension, adequately informed him of the basis for the suspension of his security clearance, i.e., alleged fraudulent claims); <span class="Italic">cf.

Appx. 872</a>, 875-76 (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP), rejected a due process argument based on a notice of proposed indefinite suspension that was vague as to the reasons for the clearance suspension when the appellant had sufficient detail from a manager's declaration before the employee replied to the proposal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee has no right to a security clearance, and revocation of a security clearance is not, of itself, an adverse action invoking the jurisdiction of the Board. <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. Our review of an adverse action stemming from revocation of a security clearance is limited to (1) whether the security clearance was revoked; (2) whether it was a requisite of the employee's position; and (3) whether the procedures of &#x00A7; 7513 were followed. <span class="Italic">Hornseth v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 916 F.3d 1369, 1373-74 (citing <span class="Italic">Hesse v. Dep't of State</span>, 217 F.3d 1372, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2000)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In the context of an adverse action stemming from revocation or denial of a security clearance, an employee is entitled under &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1) "to notice of the reasons for the suspension of his access to classified information when that is the reason for placing the employee on enforced leave pending a decision on the employee's security clearance." <span class="Italic">King v. Alston</span>, 75 F.3d 657, 661-62 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Willingham's primary argument is that the agency failed to provide him "specific reasons" for its proposal to indefinitely suspend him in violation of &#x00A7; 7513(b). Willingham contends that, like the employee in <span class="Italic">Cheney v. Department of Justice</span>, 479 F.3d 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2007), the agency's vague articulation of his alleged offense left him to guess at what he had done wrong.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government responds that &#x00A7; 7513(b) does not entitle Willingham to "granular details" surrounding the security clearance revocation, and that Willingham's subsequent response to the proposed action, as well as another communication sent to the Chief of Naval Operations, demonstrated his awareness of the allegation against him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the government. As we stated in <span class="Italic">Cheney</span>, "the employee must be given enough information to enable him or her to make a meaningful response to the agency's proposed suspension of the security clearance." 479 F.3d at 1352. In that case, we concluded that an indefinite suspension stemming from a security clearance revocation failed to comply with &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1) because it was "based on allegations of potentially derogatory personal conduct and possible violations of law and [agency] standards of conduct," later explained in the notice of proposed indefinite suspension as a "fail[ure] to comply with security regulations" and a "demonstrated...pattern of dishonesty and/or rule violations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1352-53 (adding that the agency later alleged he inappropriately queried agency databases). On the facts of that case, it was unreasonable for the Board to have found this sufficient notice. <span class="Italic">Compare with Alston</span>, 75 F.3d at 659, 662 (similar suspension on the ground that the employee "'may suffer from a medical condition which requires further investigation'" was sufficient because the employee could focus his response on his medical status).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the reason provided in the initial notice of proposed indefinite suspension was certainly vague. Appx023 ("possible misuse[ ] of [his] position and protected information accessible to [him] [as an EEO specialist]"). But the shortcomings of the initial notice did not prejudice Willingham's ability to effectively respond because Smith's declaration provided a more detailed rationale for the suspension. Appx054 (confirming that the suspension was based on Willingham's "misuse of his public trust position to support his class complaint," not a failure to redact information in that complaint). Critically, that declaration was in Willingham's possession before he made his response to the agency, and he made effective use of it. Appx033 ("Smith has signed a declaration indicating the information in my EEO complaint was the misuse of information."); <span class="Italic">id</span>. (arguing that the recipients of his EEO class complaint already had access to the allegedly misappropriated information).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record thus amply supports an inference that, at the time Willingham responded to his proposed suspension, he was well-aware that his alleged offense consisted of misappropriating non-public information of other EEO complainants--whose information he had special access to, as an EEO specialist--and using it in his own EEO class complaint. This is sufficient notice under our precedent. <span class="Italic">See Alston</span>, 75 F.3d at 661-62. Thus, substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that Willingham received the notice he was entitled to under &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On a different aspect of due process, notice of charges leading to an indefinite suspension, <span class="Italic">Ryan v. DHS</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/14-3181.Opinion.7-9-2015.1.PDF">793 F.3d 1368</a>, 1374-75 (Fed. Cir. 2015), determined that it matters not that the bases for the clearance suspension change over time. The critical consideration is the fact of the temporary loss of that clearance, so that no new notice or reply opportunity is required should the circumstances change that underlie the initial clearance suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Ryan also objects to the revocation of her security clearance after she was acquitted of the charges that originally gave rise to the suspension of her security clearance. However, neither this court nor the MSPB may review the merits of an agency's decision to suspend or revoke a security clearance. <span class="Italic">See Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 530 ("A denial of a security clearance...is not subject to [MSPB] review."). Moreover, even if the agency's suspension of Ms. Ryan's <span id="Page_2164"></span>employment had been based on her indictment rather than on the suspension of her security clearance, acquittal of criminal charges under the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard does not require the agency to reinstate the employee. <span class="Italic">See Richardson v. U.S. Customs Serv.</span>, 47 F.3d 415, 421 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (rejecting the theory "that the grounds for suspension disappear[ ] as a result of...later acquittal").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Ms. Ryan asserts she "was not provided a new notice of the implicit change in the basis for the indefinite suspension." She explains:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The transition from clearance suspension to clearance revocation was accompanied by a notice stating the reasons for the revocation, which included the specifics of the indictment (as opposed to just the existence of the indictment, referenced in the clearance suspension), and to which was added a basis not stated in the indictment: misleading statements to an ethics officer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 54. As already noted, "[a] denial of a security clearance...is not subject to [MSPB] review." <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 530. The notice discussed in detail the bases for the clearance revocation. It did not alter the basis for suspending Ms. Ryan's employment. The suspension, as stated in the letter informing Ms. Ryan of the indefinite suspension of her employment, was "based exclusively upon the suspension of your access to classified information." It was therefore Ms. Ryan's inability to access classified information, rather than the underlying reasons for that inability, that formed the basis of the indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">See Gargiulo</span>, 727 F.3d at 1185 (An employee indefinitely suspended for failure to maintain a required security clearance "ha[s] due process rights with respect to [the] indefinite suspension, but they [do] not include the right to contest the merits of the decision to suspend [the] security clearance."). The revocation of Ms. Ryan's clearance made this inability permanent.</p>
