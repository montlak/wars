<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Harper v. VA</span>, 68 MSPR 594, 597-600 (1995), considered the significance of information from secondary sources concerning appeal rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 3, 1992, the appellant retired from the Senior Executive Service (SES) position of Director, Contract Administration Staff, and he filed a petition for appeal on December 2, 1994, alleging that his retirement had been involuntary. In response to the administrative judge's show-cause Order on timeliness, he asserted that he had told several agency officials before his retirement that he considered it to be involuntary, but that they had not informed him of possible appeal rights to the Board. Both before and after his retirement, he maintained, he had pursued the matter with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), and members of Congress, but no one had advised him of any appeal rights to the Board. He contended that only after contacting the agency's Office of Inspector General (OIG) in August 1994 was he told (in a letter from OIG dated November 15, 1994) that he could appeal an involuntary retirement to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Board's regulations, the appellant filed his appeal more than two years late. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). The issue, then, is whether he has shown good cause for his filing delay. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.22(c); <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 4 MSPB 262, 4 MSPR 180, 184 (1980). In <span class="Italic">Jones v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 306 (1994), the appellant untimely appealed his allegedly involuntary retirement, which had been effected during the agency's 1992 reorganization. The Board held that the appellant was not entitled to notice of Board appeal rights from a presumably voluntary action such as a retirement unless he placed the agency on notice that he considered the retirement involuntary, or the circumstances showed that the agency was, or reasonably should have been, aware of facts indicating that the retirement was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 309, 311-13. It determined that, because no indication had been given to the agency that the appellant considered his retirement involuntary, he was not entitled to notice of Board appeal rights when he retired or thereafter<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> at 313. The Board further found that, absent such entitlement, the appellant was required to exercise due diligence in discovering and pursuing his appeal rights but that, because he had failed to do so, good cause had not been shown for waiver of the time limit. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 313-14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the appellant here had failed to put the agency on notice that he considered his retirement involuntary, then, he would not have been entitled to notice of Board appeal rights and would have had to exercise due diligence in discovering and pursuing such rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gingrich v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 583, 586 (1995). As discussed above, however, the appellant alleged that he disclosed to agency officials his belief that his retirement was involuntary. Where an employee puts an agency on notice that he considers an action to be involuntary, it triggers a duty on the agency's part to provide the employee with Board appeal rights; as a general matter, its failure to do so will justify a waiver of the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See Gingrich</span>, 67 MSPR at 587. The employee thus is not required to show that he exercised due diligence in attempting to discover his appeal rights. Instead, the question is whether the appellant was diligent in filing an appeal alleging involuntary retirement after he learned he could do so. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 588. If the appellant's assertion is true and he did inform agency officials that he believed his retirement to be involuntary, then he exercised such diligence by filing his appeal less than one month after the agency's OIG informed him in November 1994 that he could appeal an involuntary retirement to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge apparently found, however, that the appellant knew or should have known, long before November 1994, that he could appeal his retirement to the Board. The administrative judge cited a letter from OSC to the appellant dated July 29, 1992, several months before his retirement, in which OSC stated that his impending retirement did not appear to be involuntary under the applicable criteria, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Rayfield v. Dept. of Agric.</span>, 26 MSPR 244 (1985)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notice from a source other than the agency of a general appeal right to the Board, however, does not excuse the agency's failure to inform an employee of his appeal rights, where the notice does not inform the employee of the time limit for filing an appeal to the Board and lacks other information on where and how to file such an appeal<span class="Italic">. See Gingrich</span>, 67 MSPR at 588, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Nicoletti v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 55 MSPR 557, 560 (1992). The <span class="Italic">Rayfield</span> decision does not specifically describe where, when, and how to file a Board appeal. OSC's citation of this case thus did not provide constructive notice to the appellant of an appeal right to the Board from an involuntary retirement and therefore cannot support a finding that there was no good cause for his untimely filing. <span class="Italic">See Gingrich</span>, 67 MSPR at 588.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, if the appellant did put agency officials on notice concerning the alleged involuntariness of his retirement, he exercised due diligence by filing his appeal less than one month after the agency's OIG informed him of Board appeal rights; the appellant thus would have established good cause for his untimely filing. <span class="Italic">See Gingrich</span>, 67 MSPR at 587-89. The appellant's allegation that he notified agency officials of his belief that his retirement was involuntary, however, was made for the first time only after the agency had stated that he had failed to raise such an allegation and that its officials "were unaware of Appellant's allegedly coerced retirement until his appeal." The assertions of the parties on this point are not sworn. A factual dispute therefore exists regarding whether or not the appellant actually put agency officials on notice of his belief as alleged, and the administrative judge shall resolve that dispute on remand. Because the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation raising a dispute as to a material fact affecting timeliness, he is entitled to a hearing on the issue of timeliness, if he requests one. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Peterson v. DHHS</span>, 50 MSPR 237, 243 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 976 F.2d 747 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Vaught v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 56 MSPR 554, 559 n.4 (1993), emphasized the importance of acting on information about appeal rights from an authoritative source outside the civil service system:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have held that notice from a source other than the agency of a general appeal right to the Board does not excuse an agency's failure to inform an employee of his appeal rights, where the notice lacks specific information on the requirements for filing an appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nicoletti v. Dept. <span id="Page_988"></span>of Justice</span>, 55 MSPR 557, 559 (1992). In <span class="Italic">Nicoletti</span>, however, an attorney advised the appellant informally that he might be "protected" by the Board but that more time was needed to gather additional information that would bolster his case....&#8197;Those facts are distinguishable from this appeal, where counsel for the appellants by his own admission was told by a Federal judge in a formal court proceeding that he should file an appeal with the Board....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To determine when the appellant knew of an appeal right and when, as a result of that knowledge, the appellant should have filed an appeal based upon secondary information, the AJ may require the appellant to supply information as to how the appellant learned of the appeal right, <span class="Italic">Turner v. MSPB</span>, 54 Fed. Appx. 936, 937 (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Despite the AJ's explicit instructions, Ms. Turner failed to give a time, or even a time frame, as to when she became aware of her right to appeal to the Board, making it impossible for him to assess whether she acted diligently once she became aware of her rights. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the Board abused its discretion in determining that Ms. Turner had failed to show good cause for her untimely filing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Drose v. USPS</span>, 85 MSPR 98, 102-04 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-13 (2000), the agency did not provide the appellant with the required notice of appeal rights from a removal. Appellant sought out counsel who advised courses of action other than a direct appeal to the Board. If the counsel sought out by appellant gave him incorrect advice, the errors were not chargeable to the appellant, who was entitled to proper notice of appeal rights from the agency. The Board distinguished <span class="Italic">Grady v. MSPB</span>, 736 F.2d 1505 (Fed. Cir. 1984), involving a case with no clear right to notice of appeal rights from the agency, charging the appellant with diligently proceeding with an appeal once he was made aware of the general basis of his claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Prior v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 56 MSPR 561, 570-71 (1993) (appellant was charged with knowledge, gained by counsel from court filings in the appellant's case, that a Board appeal existed and had to be exercised within a given time; <span class="Italic">Nicoletti v. DOJ</span>, 55 MSPR 557, 559 (1992), was distinguished as involving only a notice of a general appeal right to the Board from a source other than the agency).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fisher v. USPS</span>, 68 MSPR 70, 74-76 (1995), suggested that if the appellant learns of the appeal deadline before he notifies the agency that he thinks his retirement was involuntary, the Board may need to examine whether the appellant acted within the filing deadline once he learned from the other source of the appellate deadline. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Goodenough v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 123, 127, 129 (1998) (restating the requirement of notice of an appeal right and restating the principle that notice from a source other than the agency of a general Board appeal right does not excuse the agency's failure to advise the employee of an appeal right if external information does not inform the employee of when and how the appeal must be filed); <span class="Italic">Lohf v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 597, 599 (1996) ("Notice from a source other than the agency of a general appeal right to the Board does not excuse an agency's failure to inform an employee of his appeal rights where the notice does not inform the employee of the time limit for filing an appeal to the Board and lacks other information on where and how to file such an appeal"; the appeal was still dismissed as untimely because the appellant had specific information from other sources on how, when, and where to file the appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Constructive notice of appeal rights was imputed when other agency employees took appeals, and the appellant occupied space close to the other employees who were affected by the same action and consulted with the same attorney at the same time that the other employees consulted with that attorney. <span class="Italic">Lewis v. SBA</span>, 27 MSPR 331, 332 (1985) (seemingly disregarding confidentiality of communications between attorney and client and ignoring any privacy interests of those employees involved in litigation). <span class="Italic">Lewis</span> was reversed <span class="Italic">sub.</span> <span class="Italic">nom.</span> in <span class="Italic">Yuni v. MSPB</span>, 784 F.2d 381 (Fed. Cir. 1986), determining that most of the Board's factual conclusions concerning notice of appeal rights were unsupported by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">Scott v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 579, 581 (1989), later declared that knowledge of appeal rights through proximity to similarly situated employees will not be presumed. However, constructive notice can be charged against the employee who is advised by some other tribunal, e.g., a court, of his right to a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">Vaught v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 56 MSPR 554, 559 (1993) (federal judge informed the appellant during court litigation that his proper route of appeal was to the MSPB); <span class="Italic">Miyashiro v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 628, 631 (1998) (restoration appeal was untimely; the Board attributed notice of Board deadlines to the appellant based on the appellant's involvement in a prior restoration appeal prosecuted by a union representative); <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. TVA</span>, 30 MSPR 57, 59 (1986) (the appellant learned of an appeal right from the date the agency filed a motion to dismiss a case in district court).</p>
