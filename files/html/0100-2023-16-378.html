<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-378"><span class="space">c.</span> Reasonableness of Rate; Cost Basis or Market Rate</h5>
<p class="noindent">The reasonableness of the claimed hourly rate of an attorney arises in claims for fees made in both ULP cases involving the union as a successful charging party, and in some cases successfully pursued by unions before labor arbitrators. [Refer to Chapter 9, "<a href="0100-2023-17-417.html#sec9-415">Reasonable Rate; Time Reasonably Invested; Location of Counsel; Travel Time and Expenses</a>."] <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force Hq., 832d Combat Support Group, DPCE, Luke AFB and AFGE Local 1547</span>, 32 FLRA 1084, 1109-12 (1988), said of justification for billing rates:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]here an applicant for a fee award has a prior billing history, the reasonable hourly rate will be counsel's established billing rate. In this case, however, the Applicant asserts that his established billing rates were higher than the rates he billed the Union. The Applicant requests the higher figures, which he asserts were his customary or established billing rates during the relevant time periods. However, we conclude that there is insufficient evidence in the record to overcome the presumption that what the Applicant billed his client constituted his established billing rate. Thus, we remand this case to provide the Applicant an opportunity to submit additional evidence....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we discussed previously, the Supreme Court held that the first step in establishing an attorney fee award is to determine "the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate." <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 433. In <span class="Italic">Laffey</span>, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals established that the reasonable hourly rate for a fee award to a private for-profit law firm is the firm's established billing rate. <span class="Italic">Laffey</span>, 746 F.2d at 24.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Laffey</span>, the D.C. Circuit Court rejected the district court's decision to award a private firm a prevailing market rate which exceeded any hourly rate the firm had ever charged. While the court stated that the market value of attorneys' services was the key to setting a reasonable hourly rate, the court found that "[f]or private law firms, the prevailing market rate for the firm's services is presumptively found in the firm's customary billing rates<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. The D.C. Circuit...stated that "<span class="Italic">[i]</span><span class="Italic">n almost every case, the firms' established rates will provide fair compensation</span>...." (emphasis in original)<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The D.C. Circuit Court outlined a two-step approach in <span class="Italic">Laffey</span>. First, "the party seeking compensation should provide evidence of the rates charged by the firm for performing similar work in private representations."...&#8197;Second, "the court may then 'bracket' this rate by establishing that it falls within the rates charged by other firms for similar work in the same community." The D.C. Circuit...also stated that "<span class="Italic">[s]</span><span class="Italic">o long as the firm's own rate falls within the rate brackets, it is the market rate</span> for the purposes of calculating the lodestar."...&#8197;Thus, under this two-step approach the prevailing community rate may act as an external standard to verify the reasonableness of an applicant's customary billing rate....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court held in <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> "that the fee applicant bears the burden of establishing entitlement to an award and documenting the appropriate hours expended and hourly rates."...&#8197;In this case, the Applicant furnished information in his application and an accompanying affidavit. Concerning his billing rates, he stated in the affidavit that "[m]y normal rates during the...period 1984 through July charged to those who could afford to pay my full rates were at that time $100.00 per hour. From July 1984 through the end of 1984 my normal hourly rates were $125.00 per hour and since that date my normal hourly rates have been $150.00 per hour."...&#8197;The Applicant also stated that the hourly rates charged to the Union ranged from $25.00 to $65.00 less per hour than those "charged by Management Labor Relations attorneys throughout the state of Arizona."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Applicant submitted two awards. In an arbitration decision,...an arbitrator awarded the Applicant $100.00 per hour. During this period of time, the Applicant asserts that his customary billing rate was $150.00 per hour. The second award, under the EAJA, granted the Applicant $75.00 per hour for work performed prior to October 31, 1983. According to his affidavit, the Applicant billed the Union in early 1983 at the rate of $65.00 per hour for work performed on the arbitration case....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the evidence submitted by the Applicant is insufficient to overcome the presumption, established by the D.C. Circuit Court...in <span class="Italic">Laffey</span>, that the rates at which the Applicant billed the Union were, in fact, his customary hourly rates. However, in this case we state for the first time the evidentiary requirements that must be met by applicants who seek attorney fee awards....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To obtain an award at his customary billing rate, the Applicant must furnish precise information concerning his billing rates during the relevant time periods. For example, in <span class="Italic">Shirley v. OPM</span>, 36 MSPR 179 (1988), an applicant overcame the presumption that the $50.00 per hour fee contained in his agreement with the appellant was a reasonable hourly rate by furnishing five contemporaneous retainer agreements. The MSPB found that these agreements established that his customary billing rate was $100.00 per hour. Other evidence that the Applicant may submit includes awards from courts and arbitrators and fees agreed to through settlements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On remand, the Judge will determine, consistently with this decision, reasonable hourly rates for the Applicant's services during the relevant time periods. In determining a reasonable hourly rate, the Judge should disregard "abnormally high or low rates which may reflect the particularly attractive or distasteful nature of matter, extraordinary time pressures, and other extraneous considerations." <span class="Italic">Laffey</span>, 746 F.2d at 20.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="page_1652"></span>FLRA turned its attention to the issue of multipliers, <span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span>, 32 FLRA at 1112-13:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The skill, experience, and reputation of an attorney are considerations which could warrant an enhancement of the lodestar figure. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc.</span>, 488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir. 1984). However, the Supreme Court has held that a multiplier is justified only in rare and exceptional circumstances. In <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, the Court stated that considerations which might lead to an enhancement of the lodestar "usually are subsumed within the initial calculation of hours reasonably expended at a reasonable hourly rate."...&#8197;In a subsequent case, the Court denied a 50 percent upward adjustment based, among other factors, on the high quality of representation. The court noted that the quality of representation might justify an upward adjustment, but "only in the rare case where the fee applicant offers specific evidence to show that the quality of service rendered was superior to that one reasonably should expect in light of the hourly rates charged and that the success was 'exceptional.'" <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stetson</span>, 465 U.S. at 899 (1984)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of his request for a multiplier, the Applicant cited the award he received in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 495</span> as evidence of his expertise. In that case, the Authority awarded the Applicant $75.00 per hour under the EAJA; the Applicant's experience is not discussed. Thus, <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 495</span> establishes only that the Applicant has had experience in Federal-sector labor relations matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Applicant also submitted an arbitration award....&#8197;In this award, an arbitrator reviewed a union's request that a multiplier be added to the $85.00 per hour rate at which Applicant billed the union for his work in the arbitration. The arbitrator awarded attorney fees at the rate of $100.00 per hour based on the Applicant's "extensive expertise" which the arbitrator did not find reflected in the hourly rate of $85.00 which he charged the union. Although the award shows that the Applicant received a multiplier based on his expertise in one instance, this example does not justify a multiplier in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Applicant has not shown that exceptional circumstances exist which would justify an adjustment to the lodestar.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Supreme Court subsequently precluded the use of multipliers for contingent representation, and it is unlikely that multipliers or enhancers will be allowed for other factors. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">City of Burlington v. Dague</span>, 505 U.S. 557, 112 S. Ct. 2638 (1992); <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air</span>, 483 U.S. 711 (1987). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Perdue v. Kenny A.,</span> 130 S. Ct. 1662 (2010) (Supreme Court approved enhancement of hourly rate based on lawyer's quality performance in restricted circumstances; Court appeared to validate use of <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix as means for setting community standard for hourly rates of lawyers in Washington metropolitan area).</p>
<p class="noindent">As to the rate for payment of counsel who are union employees, FLRA established a rate pegged to the salary of union counsel in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Ray Brook and AFGE Local 3882</span>, 32 FLRA 20, 29 (1988), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 944 F.2d 922, 934-37 (D.C. Cir. 1991), <span class="Italic">post</span>. FLRA's position, before it was reversed in court, was:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union excepts to the Judge's recommended decision on the grounds that a fee award to a union-employed attorney should be based on the prevailing hourly market rate of legal services and that even assuming that such an award is based on a "cost-plus" formula, the Judge erred in calculating that award. With respect to the latter argument, the Union contends that: (1) the hourly salary of the union-employed attorney should be based on the number of hours per year the attorney actually worked, as opposed to the number of hours per year for which the attorney was paid; and (2) the calculation of the hourly compensation of the attorney should include the value of health care benefits, retirement contributions, and similar items.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of its argument that the award should be based on the prevailing market rate, the Union relies on <span class="Italic">Curran v. Department of Treasury</span>, 805 F.2d 1406 (9th Cir. 1986). In <span class="Italic">Curran</span> (a case involving fees for representation in MSPB proceedings), the court ruled that the use of the market rate for fee awards deposited in a separate fund or account earmarked exclusively for a union's litigation activities did not violate ethical restrictions on the unauthorized practice of law or constitute fee-splitting with a lay entity. The <span class="Italic">Curran</span> decision, however, is directly contrary to the case law of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals and the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Goodrich v. Department of the Navy</span>, 733 F.2d 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1984), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 469 U.S. 1189 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the position of the MSPB and the Federal Circuit.&#x2003;We decline to follow <span class="Italic">Curran</span> and to overturn our existing interpretation of this matter. We will continue to base fee awards to union-employed attorneys on a cost-plus formula as set forth in <span class="Italic">Health Care Financing Administration</span>, 21 FLRA 910 (1986)....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Ray Brook</span> was reviewed and the result on the rate computation was reversed in <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 944 F.2d 922, 934-37 (D.C. Cir. 1991), determining that market rates should be applied to compensate salaried union counsel when the fees were deposited into a legal services fund controlled by the union's general counsel:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the recent past, we have dealt occasionally with attorneys' fee claims by counsel for lay organizations which, like the union here, provide legal services and engage in other activities as well. We have observed that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[r]easonableness, in terms of market value of the services rendered, is the sole limit on fee awards to organizationally-hired lawyers when the fees are to be paid to the lawyers alone. The organization, whatever its character, may recoup in full the expense it incurred in supplying the services to the client. Lawyers may, if they wish, voluntarily donate some or all of their fees to charity, or even to their employers, just as they may spend their other monies as they please.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also have held that market-rate fees may be paid to legal aid offices and other public interest organizations, a position later vindicated by the Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When, however, the fees sought are to be paid directly to an organization not only furnishing legal services but also conducting other activities, ethical considerations come to the fore. To grant a market-rate fee request is to open the door to feesplitting, unauthorized law practice and organizational profiteering on the professional services of attorneys. On this account, we have ruled that the measure of the organization's recovery is its financial outlay in the legal-service venture unless there is some guarantee that the amount above the organization's actual cost will ultimately be spent in the provision of legal assistance--as, for example, by placement into a fund maintained exclusively for legal representation. This assurance puts the organization's legal-service project on a par with legal aid societies and other private nonprofit law offices, and no ethical concern arises.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If this were all, it would follow that market-rate attorneys' fees should be awarded to the union lawyers litigating here. Fees they recover are placed in the union's legal representation fund, an account totally separate from its general treasury. The fund is under the sole control of the union's general counsel, and is used solely for legal work. This arrangement is of the very sort we have approved as a bulwark against unethical practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, both MSPB and the Federal Circuit, which alone exercises jurisdiction over MSPB, have held that attorneys' fees paid to multipurpose organizations must be limited in amount to the organization's costs even though the excess would be deposited in a fund dedicated to legal assistance....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In <span class="Italic">Curran v. Department of Treasury</span>, [805 F.2d 1406 (9th Cir. 1986)], the Ninth Circuit disagreed with the course of reasoning in those tribunals, and so do we.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the first place, the notion that market-rate fee allowances to unions invariably result in above-cost benefits is dangerous. As the Ninth Circuit said in <span class="Italic">Curran</span>,</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[t]he Board's assumption that an above-cost fee award will <span class="Italic">always</span> provide an indirect economic benefit to the non-legal activities of a lay organization is incorrect. Whether or not a particular lay organization will in fact receive an indirect economic benefit for its lay activities as a result of the "freeing up" of monies it otherwise would have spent for litigation turns on many factors. Although an organization may choose to divert its original contribution of general revenues for litigation to support an expansion of its lay activity, it may choose to instead maintain its original contribution and simply add this amount to any fees awarded to the litigation fund as a means of financing greater legal activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record does not indicate what the union's policy or attitude would be if its legal representation fund were depleted. Furthermore, the effect of any fee award, large or small, is to confer a benefit; even if, as hypothesized, the union does gain indirectly from market-rate fees, so it also does from fees that are cost-limited, and the ethical considerations are precisely the same. The size of the benefit varies, of course, but its character not one whit, and it defies logic to say that in the one instance the benefit is ethically permissible but in the other it is not. And no one would argue that, in order to avoid any benefit to the union, no attorneys' fee award in its favor should ever be made, for a clearer frustration of congressional intent could hardly be imagined.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are mindful, of course, that MSPB's interpretations of its organic statute are entitled to "substantial deference," but that canon is inapplicable here. MSPB's stance on cost-based attorneys' fees for union counsel is bottomed squarely and totally on ethical grounds, not statutory text, and the same may be said about the Federal Circuit's decisions....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Like the Ninth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Curran</span>, "[w]e see no reason to place different ethical obligations upon lawyers seeking fees under the Back Pay Act...from those seeking fees under" other statutory regimes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">MSPB recognizes fully that statutory specifications of "reasonable attorney fees" normally mean market-rate fees, and awards them to litigants other than unions. But, from the very beginning, both MSPB and the Federal Circuit have read our <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> decision [<span class="Italic">NTEU v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 656 F.2d 848 (1981)] as an unqualified declaration that unions <span id="page_1653"></span>can never recoup more than their costs. On the contrary, <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> signaled the exorability of its holding when it predicted that market-rate fee awards to unions "perhaps [might] withstand criticism when the monies are directed into a fund for maintenance of a legal services program," and slightly more than a year later we made explicit in <span class="Italic">Jordan</span> [<span class="Italic">v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 691 F.2d 514 (1982)] that indeed they do. We do no more than honor <span class="Italic">Jordan</span> when today we express our wholehearted agreement with <span class="Italic">Curran</span> "that a separate operating account for legal services provides sufficient protection against the unauthorized practice of law by a lay organization," and that "[w]hen fees are paid to a separate account used solely by lawyers for litigation purposes, there simply is no fee splitting with a lay entity and no encouragement of the unauthorized practice of law," and therefore "no ethical barrier to compensation at market rate."</p>
<p class="noindent">On remand from the D.C. Circuit, FLRA awarded fees at market rates, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Ray Brook and AFGE Local 3882</span>, 46 FLRA 1002, 1005-09 (1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both the Respondent and the Union petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Ray Brook II</span> [32 FLRA 20 (1988)]. The Respondent argued, among other things, that an attorney fee award was not authorized under the Back Pay Act because Frontera did not incur fees and was not obligated to pay the Union's attorneys. The Union asserted that an attorney fee award to union-employed attorneys should be based on the prevailing market rate rather than a cost-plus formula.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the threshold issue of whether attorney fees may be awarded for representation in unfair labor practice proceedings, the court held that a union may qualify for attorney fees for representation of an aggrieved employee. Citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.807(a), the court found that "the phrase 'employee's personal representative' encompasses a union and its salaried attorney who have represented the employee." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3882</span>, 944 F.2d at 929.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the question of whether the fee award should be based on a cost-plus formula or on market rates, the court noted that the Back Pay Act provides for "reasonable" attorney fees and that this criterion is the sole limit on fee awards paid to lawyers. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 934. The court stated that "[w]e are constrained to follow our earlier decisions equating 'reasonable' with market-rate fees." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 937....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court also noted that although ethical concerns regarding the practice of law by an entity which is not a law firm are raised when organizations conduct other activities as well as furnishing legal services, market rate fees are appropriate when the organization places the fees in a legal representation fund. In this regard, the court disagreed with decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit which held that, despite the existence of legal representation funds, attorney fee awards to unions must be limited to costs to avoid allowing unions to profit from litigation and, thereby, violate ethical principles.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court found that fees received by the Union's lawyers in this case would be placed in the Union's legal representation fund, an account which is "totally separate from its general treasury," "under the sole control of the union's general counsel," and "used solely for legal work."...&#8197;The court found that the Union's fund is "the very sort we have approved as a bulwark against unethical practice." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we note that the sole issues before the court in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3882</span> were whether an award of attorney fees was appropriate when a union represented an employee in unfair labor practice proceedings which were initiated by a union and, if so, whether fees could be awarded at the market rate to union-employed attorneys. The amount of an attorney fee award was not an issue before the court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree that in these circumstances, there is "'no ethical barrier to compensation at market rate'" and that market rate is the appropriate standard to be applied under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3882</span>, 944 F.2d at 937, (quoting <span class="Italic">Curran</span>, 805 F.2d at 1409 (footnote omitted)). Accordingly, in agreement with the reasoning of the court, in this and future cases, where attorney fees are awarded under the Back Pay Act to successful employees represented by union attorneys, we will use market rate fees to calculate the payment of those attorney fees. To the extent that previous decisions applied a cost-plus formula for determining such attorney fees, those decisions will no longer be followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The remaining issue before us is to determine the appropriate market rate for fee awards to Snyder for her representation of Frontera while she was employed by the Union and to Cohen, a Union-employed attorney.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Back Pay Act requires that an award of attorney fees be reasonable.&#x2003;In order to make an attorney fee award, it is necessary to determine the number of hours reasonably expended in the litigation and whether the applicant's request for an award at a particular hourly rate is reasonable. The hours expended multiplied by the rate establish "'an objective basis on which to make an initial estimate of the value of a lawyer's services.'" <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force Headquarters, 832D Combat Support Group DPCE, Luke Air Force Base, Arizona and American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1547</span>, 32 FLRA 1084, 1100 (1988) (<span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span>) (quoting <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the market rate, the Authority has held that where an applicant for a fee award has a prior billing history, the reasonable hourly rate will be counsel's established billing rate. <span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span>, 32 FLRA at 1109. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stenson</span>, 465 U.S. 886, 895-96 n.11 (1984) ("the rates charged in private representations may afford relevant comparisons" in determining the market rate). To obtain an award at counsel's customary billing rate, the applicant must furnish precise information concerning billing rates during the relevant time periods. Contemporaneous retainer agreements are one source of this information. other evidence that the applicant may submit includes awards from courts and arbitrators and fees agreed to through settlements. <span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span>, 32 FLRA at 1111-12.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Ray Brook II</span>, the Judge found, based on the documentation submitted, that Snyder's fee request for the hours that she represented Frontera as a private practitioner was reasonably calculated at her customary hourly rate of $90. The Respondent did not object to the Judge's recommendation that this hourly rate be used, and the Authority accepted the Judge's recommendation. Consequently, we find that it is appropriate to use the same hourly rate of $90 to calculate the fee award for the hours Snyder spent as Union-employed counsel. Using that rate, we will award $4,716.00 in attorney fees to Snyder, which will be paid to the AFGE Legal Representation Fund for her representation as a Union-employed counsel. Additionally, the Judge awarded, and the Authority affirmed, that an award of $116.66 in costs was appropriate. Therefore, we will order that the Respondent pay $4,832.66 in attorney fees and costs to the AFGE Legal Representation Fund.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">Ray Brook</span>, the market rate that may be awarded will not be reduced because counsel offered their clients reduced rates; in other words, recovery of a market rate is not limited because the attorney used a customary billing rate lower than the prevailing market rate. <span class="Italic">Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 46 FLRA 1080, 1085 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent">Even with market rates determining fee awards, there must still be evidence produced to FLRA of what those rates are from year to year, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Austin Compliance Ctr. and NTEU Chap. 247</span>, 48 FLRA 1281, 1301-02 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent contends that the Judge should have awarded fees on a cost-plus rather than a market-rate basis because Wolf committed ethical misconduct during the hearing and because the Union offered insufficient proof of the market rate in Austin. The Union argues that the Judge properly found that market-rate fees should be awarded and that $150 per hour was a reasonable market rate for Austin.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where attorney fees are awarded under the Back Pay Act to successful employees represented by union attorneys, the Authority will use the market rate to calculate fees when the union places the fees in a separate legal representation fund<span class="Italic">. See Customs Service</span>, 46 FLRA at 1094-95; <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span>, 46 FLRA at 1006-07. Where a fee applicant has a prior billing history, the reasonable hourly rate will be counsel's established billing rate. "[T]he rates charged in private representations may afford relevant comparisons" in determining the market rate. <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stenson</span>, 465 U.S. 886, 895-96 n.11 (1984) (<span class="Italic">Blum</span>). In addition, to obtain an award at a customary billing rate, an applicant must furnish precise information concerning billing rates during the relevant time periods. <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, 46 FLRA at 1095; <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span>, 46 FLRA at 1008. Where the attorney involved is also an employee of a nonprofit organization, such as a union, which does not have a customary billing rate, it is necessary to consider evidence as to whether the rate requested is in line with the prevailing rate in the community during the relevant time periods. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 48 FLRA 931, 935 (1993). The fee applicant has the burden of producing "satisfactory evidence--in addition to the attorney's own affidavits--that the requested rates are in line with those prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience, and reputation." <span class="Italic">Blum</span>, 465 U.S. at 895-96 n.11.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge found, and the parties do not dispute, that the union in this case maintains a separate legal representation fund. Accordingly, consistent with <span class="Italic">Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service</span> and <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span>, we find that the Union should be awarded fees based on the market rate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Respondent's argument that fees should be awarded on a cost-plus basis because Wolf allegedly committed ethical misconduct during the hearing. As we stated previously, the Judge found, and we agree, that Wolf's conduct during the hearing was not prohibited by the Authority's Rules and Regulations and that the unfair labor practice proceeding was not the proper forum for determining whether Wolf's conduct violated the Texas Code of Professional Responsibility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1654"></span>We find, however, that the Union has not produced satisfactory evidence, within the meaning of <span class="Italic">Blum</span>, of the market rate in Austin for 1989 through 1992. Although the affidavit submitted by the Union specifies rates in the Austin community for "similar work by attorneys, law clerks and paralegals of comparable qualifications[,]" nothing in the affidavit indicates what the billing rates were during many of the particular time periods relevant to this case. We found previously that the Union is entitled to receive fees for certain services performed from at least May 30, 1989, through June 4, 1993. However, the affidavit, dated January 19, 1993, lists one set of rates and does not specify what time period, other than 1993, those rates cover. We noted above that, to obtain an award of fees at a customary billing rate, the applicant has the burden of producing satisfactory evidence of the prevailing rates and that the applicant must furnish precise information, within the meaning of <span class="Italic">Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service</span> and <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span>, concerning billing rates during the relevant time periods.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Union has failed to furnish precise information concerning billing rates in Austin, Texas for 1989 through 1992, and has thereby failed to provide satisfactory evidence of that market rate, we will remand this case to the Judge for further findings on the prevailing market rate for Austin for those years. <span class="Italic">See Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 47 FLRA at 1197-98 (the Authority remanded an attorney fee award where the award properly established the entitlement to attorney fees but failed to establish, among other things, what rate was charged).</p>
