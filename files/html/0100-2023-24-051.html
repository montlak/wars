<p class="Body-Text">The proper interpretation of a statute is a question of law resolved <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">novo</span> on appeal to the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Edenfield v. VA</span>, 54 F.4th 1357, 1360 (Fed Cir. 2022) ("The proper interpretation of an agency manual, like the interpretation of a statute or regulation, is a question of law that we consider <span class="Italic">de novo</span> on appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Welshans v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 550 F.3d 1100, 1102-03 (Fed. Cir. 2008).); <span class="Italic">James v. Tablerion</span>, 363 F.3d 1352, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2004) ("We review the Board's, and thus the arbitrator's, statutory interpretation <span class="Italic">de novo</span>."); <span class="Italic">Watson v. DOJ</span>, 64 F.3d 1524, 1528 (Fed. Cir. 1995) ("Statutory interpretation is a question of law reviewed <span class="Italic">de novo</span> on appeal."). Included in the discussion that follows are cases from both the Federal Circuit and the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agency statutory interpretation may receive judicial deference. Of significance as to judicial deference to statutory interpretation by an agency is whether that agency is entrusted by Congress with administration of the statute it interprets. <span class="Italic">Chacon v. United States</span>, 48 F.3d 508, 511 (Fed. Cir. 1995), explained the concept of deference to administrative statutory interpretation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When we consider the merits of a party's challenge to an agency's interpretation of a statute it has been charged with administering, we take our analytic framework from the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed.2d 694 (1984). In <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, the Court described the proper approach in such situations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When a court reviews an agency's construction of the statute which it administers, it is confronted with two questions. First, always, is the question whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress. If, however, the court determines Congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue, the court does not simply impose its own construction of the statute, as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation. Rather, if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 842-43, 104 S. Ct. at 2782 (footnotes omitted). Importantly, "[t]he court need not conclude that the agency construction was the only one it permissibly could have adopted" in order to be required to affirm it. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 843 n.11, 104 S. Ct. at 2782 n.11. Where, as here, "the legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit rather than explicit," we must affirm any "reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of [the] agency." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 844, 104 S. Ct. at 2782 (footnote omitted). <span class="Italic">Accord</span> <span class="Italic">Newman</span> <span class="Italic">v. Teigeler</span>, 898 F.2d 1574, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Beneficial Corp. and Subsidiaries v. United States</span>, 814 F.2d 1570, 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Miller v. OPM</span>, 903 F.3d 1274, 1281 (Fed. Cir. 2018), involving construction of law administered by OPM concerning retirement annuities:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before addressing each of the three time periods at issue, we must determine the correct construction of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(c)(2).

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pitsker</span> added, as to informal guidance from OPM, 234 F.3d at 1383:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, OPM followed the narrower definition of "proration factor" set forth in its regulations and urged this court to accord that method <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference. To the contrary, under <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutory analysis, of course, turns on the "language of the statute." <span class="Italic">Killeen</span>, 382 F.3d at 1321. In this case, the statute is abundantly clear: the proration factor must account for an employee's "total service." Neither this court, nor OPM, can ignore the word "total" in the statute. If the law included only service rendered after April 6, 1986, then the statutory language would have simply used the word "service" alone. However, by including the term "total," the law directs that the proration factor account for an employee's lifetime service, not merely service rendered after April 6, 1986.</p>

Of course due deference is to be rendered to agency determinations of fact, so long as there is substantial evidence to be found in the record as a whole. But where, as here, the review is not of a question of fact, but of a judgment as to the proper balance to be struck between conflicting interests, '(t)he deference owed to an expert tribunal cannot be allowed to slip into a judicial inertia which results in the unauthorized assumption by an agency of major policy decisions properly made by Congress.' <span class="Italic">American Ship Building Co. v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The foundation of the principle of judicial deference to the rulings of agency tribunals is that the tribunal has specialized knowledge and expertise, such that when reasoned findings are made, a reviewing court may confidently defer to the agency's application of its knowledge in its area of expertise. Reasoned findings are critical to the performance of agency functions and judicial reliance on agency competence. <span class="Italic">See Baltimore and Ohio R.R. Co. v. Aberdeen &#x0026; Rockfish R.R. Co.,</span> 393 U.S. 87, 91-92, 89 S. Ct. 280, 21 L.

United States</span>, 870 F.2d 627, 631 (Fed. Cir. 1989). OPM argues it is entitled to special deference here because the regulation is a contemporaneous interpretation of section 8341(b). However, the courts are the final authorities on statutory construction and "must reject administrative constructions... that are inconsistent with the statutory mandate or that frustrate the policy that Congress sought to implement."... &#8197;This is equally true of contemporaneous agency interpretations. <span class="Italic">Public Employees Retirement Sys. of Ohio v.

<p class="Body-Text">FDIC's interpretation of a section of its organic statute governing the process for issuance of fitness regulations for its employees was denied deference by the Board through its own statutory construction, the Board stating in <span class="Italic">Jonson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that section 1822(f)(2), and not section 1822(f)(4), empowers the FDIC to prescribe regulations concerning <span class="Italic">employee</span> conduct. This conclusion is firmly grounded upon fundamental rules of statutory construction wherein we are to "give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute, avoiding, if it may be, any construction which implies that the legislature was ignorant of the meaning of the language it employed." <span class="Italic">Montclair v. Ramsdell</span>, 107 U.S. 147, 152 (1883); <span class="Italic">see Astoria Federal Savings &#x0026; Loan Association v. Solimino</span>, 501 U.S. 104, 112 (1991) (statute should be construed "so as to avoid rendering superfluous" any of its language.) Additionally, a statute should be read as a whole and not "in a vacuum." 2A Norman J. Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction &#x00A7; 46.05, at 154, 165 (6th ed. 2000). Here, Congress enacted two sections in the same statutory provision authorizing FDIC's promulgation of regulations, the exercise of which, in one instance, but not the other, requires OGE's concurrence. Ignoring this explicit statutory distinction between the FDIC's authority to regulate the ethical conduct of its employees and to establish minimum fitness requirements obviously renders it meaningless, a result that is fundamentally incompatible with the foregoing tenets of statutory construction. Rather, we read the plain language of the statute as unambiguously reflecting congressional intent that OGE concur in the FDIC regulations governing the ethical conduct of its employees. <span class="Italic">See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc</span>., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984).[4] ...</p>

Robbins, &#x00B6; 7. However, the operative inquiry here is not the FDIC's interpretation of its regulations, but, rather, whether those regulations comport with the statute authorizing them. In this regard, we note that the issue of deference to an agency's view of its enabling statute is relevant only if the underlying statute is ambiguous or silent on the question. <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 843. However, it is axiomatic that the first question in reviewing an agency's construction of a statute is "whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 842-43. Here, we find that the statute expressly addresses the issue and is not ambiguous. Therefore, it is not necessary to reach the question of the reasonableness of the FDIC's interpretation of the statute or what weight, if any, to be given its interpretation of its regulations.</p>
