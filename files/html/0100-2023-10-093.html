<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-93"><span class="space">3.</span> Interference With Witness, Representative, Appellant</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">There are two sources of cases involving allegations of coercion of witnesses in Board proceedings. Some PFRs allege that after the issuance of an initial decision, evidence was found showing that a witness was coerced or suborned. [Those cases are mentioned in Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-12-018.html#sec5-19">Credibility Findings</a>."] If the Board finds such evidence compelling, it sends the appeal back to the AJ for evaluation of the evidence of witness tampering. There are a few decisions [discussed in Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-184.html#sec8-183">Conditional Threat</a>"] stemming from efforts by agencies to discipline individuals who, when subject to investigations by their agencies concerning their own conduct, admonish potential witnesses in a manner considered threatening by the employees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cloonan v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 1, 2-6 (1994), presents one of the few reported decisions granting a protective order:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the Board's standard for determining whether an agency has taken an action in retaliation for a protected activity other than whistleblowing, the administrative judge found that the petitioners demonstrated that the agency changed Mr. Forgie's work schedule in retaliation for testifying before the Board. The administrative judge found that Mr. Forgie engaged in a protected activity, testifying on the appellant's behalf before the Board, and that the agency official responsible for changing his schedule, Postmaster Sullivan, was aware of Mr. Forgie's protected activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge determined that the "timing of Postmaster Sullivan's actions, the persistence with which he acted, and the undisputed fact that a previous attempt to effectuate this action has been reversed" demonstrated that the schedule change had been effected in retaliation for Mr. Forgie's protected activity. The administrative judge found that agency management originally attempted to change Mr. Forgie's schedule in May, 1991, and cancelled the change after a labor-management meeting. The agency again requested a labor-management meeting on the issue on February 12, 1993, only two days after the administrative judge approved Mr. Forgie as a witness, and less than two weeks before the scheduled hearing. The meeting was held one month after the hearing and Postmaster Sullivan did not attend to explain why he requested the change. A second labor-management meeting was held on June 23, 1993, and again Postmaster Sullivan did not attend. However, the agency assigned Mr. Forgie to work on Saturdays immediately after that meeting. The union president submitted a sworn statement stating that at the June 23 meeting the union objected to the change in Mr. Forgie's schedule, and that the agency announced that it would effect the change notwithstanding the union's objection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge further found that the agency did not demonstrate that it would have taken the action even if Mr. Forgie had not testified at the hearing. The administrative judge rejected the agency's argument that it changed Mr. Forgie's schedule for legitimate reasons because it could not hire another clerk. The administrative judge noted that the documents requesting permission to hire another clerk were dated subsequent to the change in Mr. Forgie's schedule and the filing of this petition for enforcement. So finding, the administrative judge recommended that the Board find the agency in noncompliance with the protective order and enter an order enforcing the protective order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has the authority to issue orders to protect witnesses from harassment pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(e)(1)(B)(i) (Supp. IV 1992). The Board can enforce such a protective order in the same manner that it enforces other orders and decisions. 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(e)(1)(B)(ii); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.55(d) (1993). Both the appellant and the witness protected by a protective order have standing to file a petition for enforcement of the order. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.182(c) (1993).[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;A witness who seeks to enforce a protective order must file a motion to intervene in the appeal. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.182(c) (1993). Mr. O'Leary did not file a motion to intervene with his petition for enforcement. However, the appellant also filed a petition for enforcement challenging Mr. O'Leary's removal and Mr. Forgie's schedule change. Accordingly, the administrative judge properly considered the petition for enforcement without granting Mr. O'Leary intervenor status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to show that the agency retaliated against Mr. Forgie for appearing as a witness in the hearing, the appellant needed to demonstrate that: (1) Mr. Forgie engaged in a protected activity; (2) the accused official knew of the activity; (3) the adverse action under review could, under the circumstances, have been retaliatory; and (4) there was a genuine causal connection between the retaliatory motive and the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Viens-Koretko v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 53 MSPR 160, 163 (1992)[3] ; <span class="Italic">Webster v. Department of the Army,</span> 911 F.2d 679, 689 (Fed. Cir. 1990). The administrative judge applied this standard and concluded that the agency changed Mr. Forgie's schedule "in retaliation for" his testimony. The administrative judge further concluded that the agency failed to demonstrate that it would have changed Mr. Forgie's schedule even if he had not testified. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Webster,</span> 911 F.2d at 690.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Viens-Koretko,</span> the Board announced this four-part test for adjudicating an appellant's affirmative defense of prohibited personnel practice under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), which prohibits, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, taking an action because of an employee's testimony in an appeal or grievance. In <span class="Italic">Viens-Koretko,</span> the Board relied on <span class="Italic">Warren v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Army,</span> 804 F.2d 654, 656-58 (1986). Congress legislatively overruled <span class="Italic">Warren</span> in the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) insofar as it applied to an appellant's claim of prohibited personnel practice under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), i.e., taking an action because of whistleblowing disclosures. <span class="Italic">See Clark</span> <span class="Italic">v. Department of the Army,</span> 997 F.2d 1466, 1469-70 (Fed. Cir. 1993). In the WPA, Congress also amended the language of sections 2302(b)(8) and 2302(b)(9) by replacing "as a reprisal for" with "because of" in order to eliminate <span id="Page_1389"></span>the requirement that an appellant demonstrate a retaliatory motive on the part of the deciding official. <span class="Italic">See Marano v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Justice,</span> 2 F.3d 1137, 1140-41 (Fed. Cir. 1993); S. Rep. No. 413, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 16 (1988). Congress did not otherwise change the test for adjudicating allegations of prohibited personnel practice under section 2302(b)(9). Therefore, the <span class="Italic">Viens-Koretko</span> test must be revised to reflect the amendment to section 2302(b)(9) when such a claim is made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">However, this is not a claim of prohibited personnel practice under section 2302(b)(9). The protective order at issue here prohibited the agency from "taking any retaliatory action" against Mr. Forgie. The order was issued pursuant to the Board's authority to issue "any order which may be necessary to protect a witness...from harassment...." 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(e)(1)(B)(i). Accordingly, the administrative judge properly required that the appellant show a retaliatory motive in order to show that the agency violated the order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that the agency changed Mr. Forgie's schedule because of his appearance as a witness in the appellant's hearing. The agency asserts that there was no nexus between the schedule change and Mr. Forgie's testimony. Rather, the agency claims that it changed Mr. Forgie's schedule due to a staff shortage that resulted from the retirement of another clerk. The agency has submitted additional evidence in support of its argument. The appellant has not responded to the agency's submission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's exceptions to the administrative judge's findings of fact contain neither citations to the record nor persuasive argument of error. The agency's exceptions to the Recommendation amount to nothing more than a restatement of the agency's position before the administrative judge. The administrative judge considered the agency's position, evaluated the evidence, and determined that the agency changed Mr. Forgie's schedule in retaliation for his testimony. We find no basis to disturb the administrative judge's determination. <span class="Italic">See Eikenberry v. Department of the Interior</span>, 37 MSPR 438, 445 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor has the agency demonstrated that the evidence it seeks to admit was not available before the record closed below. In fact, all but one document are dated before the date of the Recommendation. The one document dated after the Recommendation does not reflect changed circumstances due to additional actions taken by the agency to comply with the protective order. Accordingly, we will not consider the agency's evidence. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 45 MSPR 560, 563 (1990); <span class="Italic">Nielson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, we hereby find the agency in NONCOMPLIANCE with the protective order prohibiting it from retaliating against Mr. Forgie for his testimony before the Board, and GRANT the petition for enforcement. We hereby ORDER the agency to restore Mr. Forgie's schedule to Saturday and Sunday as his days off. We further ORDER the agency to submit to the Clerk of the Board within 20 days of the date of this Opinion and Order proof that it has complied with the Board's decision. If the agency does not submit proof of compliance with the Board's decision, it must submit the name of the official responsible for its noncompliance. Failure to comply with the Board's decision may result in the imposition of sanctions against that official pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2), (e)(2)(A) (Supp. IV 1992) and 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.183(c) (1993).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">You may respond to the agency's evidence of compliance within 15 days of the date of service of that evidence. Any such response by Mr. Forgie must be accompanied by a motion to intervene in accordance with the Board's regulation at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.182(c). If you do not respond, the Board will assume you are satisfied and will dismiss the petition for enforcement as moot.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Applying the <span class="Italic">Cloonan</span> interference or reprisal test, <span class="Italic">Rivera-Silva v. USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 494, 495-97 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-10 (1999), provides insight into treatment of interference allegations. <span class="Italic">Rivera-Silva</span> involved a charge by a witness who complained that, after his Board testimony, his supervisor retaliated by interfering with his leave and by impeding his employee's access to a form needed to record overtime. The Board concluded that the agency corrected the problems and was in "compliance" with the AJ's recommended decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Several letter carriers who worked with the appellant, including the petitioner, testified on the appellant's behalf at the hearing in his appeal. At the appellant's request, the administrative judge granted a protective order directing the agency not to threaten or otherwise harass Mr. Lara or any other witness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner Lara subsequently filed a petition for enforcement alleging that his supervisor Efrain Sanchez was behaving towards him in an intimidating manner, verbally abusing him and making implied threats to his continued employment, with the result that he was forced to seek medical treatment and take sick leave. The agency denied the petitioner's charges generally without addressing specific allegations. The administrative judge found that the petitioner's detailed and unrebutted allegations deserved probative weight. Applying the standard set out in <span class="Italic">Cloonan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 MSPR 1, 4 (1994), the administrative judge concluded that, in view of the supervisor's awareness of the petitioner's hearing testimony and the proximity in time of the harassing conduct, there was a causal connection between the petitioner's appearance at the hearing and the harassment and that therefore the agency was in violation of the order. He recommended that the Board enforce the protective order by ordering the agency to cease harassing the petitioner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the agency failed to respond to the Recommendation, the Board directed the agency to explain the steps that it had taken to ensure that the appellant is not harassed by the supervisor in question. The agency responded that the protective order was explained to the management of the Mayaguez Post Office where the petitioner works on June 25, 1998, and that since that time the petitioner has not been subjected to intimidation, harassment or other retaliation by the agency. The agency stated that the petitioner has been a witness for the appellant on other occasions in arbitration cases without suffering any adverse consequences such as having his work responsibilities increased or his work more closely monitored than other employees. It noted that Efrain Sanchez, the official about whom petitioner complained, is no longer his immediate supervisor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner Lara in reply alleged that the agency continues to violate the protective order, complaining that his supervisor is under the control of Mr. Sanchez and that he speaks to him in an intimidating way. He identified two specific instances of allegedly harassing actions: 1) denial of his request for sick leave by Postmaster DeLeon on December 4, 1998, and 2) his supervisor's refusal to provide him with a Form 3996 when, according to petitioner, he could be disciplined for failing to file this form if he works overtime. The Board then ordered the agency to respond to the petitioner's allegations that these actions occurred and that they constituted harassment in violation of the protective order, and it notified the petitioner that he could reply to the agency's response.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency submitted a statement from Hector Herrnida, the appellant's supervisor, in which he declared that the Form 3996 has been made available to all carriers as requested on an open shelf cabinet behind his desk. With respect to the petitioner's request for sick leave on December 4, 1998, he stated that the petitioner made the request on the basis of a medical appointment that same day and that the request was denied because alternative arrangements to prevent disruption of mail delivery could not be made on such short notice. Mr. Hermida noted that agency policy requires employees to make every effort to seek advance authorization for such absences, that petitioner had been asked numerous times to present his medical appointments in advance, and that his sick leave requests were generally granted. The agency also submitted memoranda to Mayaguez Post Office employees outlining the agency's sick leave policy together with evidence that the petitioner had received notice of the policy and a copy of petitioner's leave record showing a number of authorized sick leave absences that he received.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner has filed no response to the agency's submission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record supports the finding of the administrative judge that the petitioner's supervisor retaliated against him for appearing as a witness at the appellant's hearing in violation of the protective order. The agency has not challenged the administrative judge's finding, but contends that the harassment has ceased as a result of steps that the agency has taken to end it, including removal of the offending supervisor from direct supervision of petitioner. The appellant disputes this contention and has identified two specific instances of harassment involving withholding of a form needed to comply with overtime work requirements and improper refusal of requested sick leave on a specified date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's claim that the agency has refused to provide the Form 3996 is denied by the appellant's supervisor, who states that it has been made available and where it is provided. The appellant has not replied to the supervisor's statement, nor has he contended that he has been disciplined for failing to file the form as required in connection with working overtime. The agency has offered an explanation for the denial of the appellant's sick leave request and has submitted evidence that the appellant has been granted sick leave, including unscheduled sick leave, during 1998. The appellant has neither disputed the supervisor's statement that on December 4, 1998, he requested same day sick leave for a medical appointment, nor has he offered evidence that his need for this leave could not have been anticipated. Considering the evidence as a whole, we find that the appellant has failed to show that the agency actions of which he complains constituted harassment in continued violation of the protective order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the agency is now in compliance and dismiss the petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Rivera-Silva</span> litigation resulted in other Board decisions disposing of witness interference charges. Review of one of the AJ's underlying decisions, issued in August 1998, shows the protective order was issued during the Board <span id="Page_1390"></span>hearing in June of 1997. It took the Board almost a year after the AJ's decisions to issue its orders concerning the reprisal allegations. The Board's witness protection efforts would be more effective when speedily implemented. [Refer to Chapter 16 on "<a href="0100-2023-23-150.html#sec16-148">Allegation of Reprisal, Bad Faith, Discrimination, or Harassment</a>" concerning allegations by appellants that they have suffered reprisal or harassment as a result of prevailing in Board litigation.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Heining v. GSA</span>, 61 MSPR 539, 556-57 (1994), <span class="Italic">reaff'd on reconsideration</span>, <span class="Italic">Heining v. GSA</span>, 68 MSPR 513 (1995), the Board declined to use its authority to issue protective orders to initiate investigations into alleged agency malfeasance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asks the Board to issue protective orders for witnesses and "potential" witnesses in this appeal, and she asks that the Board conduct an investigation of an alleged pattern of prohibited personnel practices by the agency. Nothing in the Board's regulations grants it the authority to conduct a wide-ranging investigation of the kind requested by the appellant. Under certain circumstances, the Board may grant an order protecting a witness or other individual from harassment, but a motion for a protective order must be made as early as possible in the proceedings and must include a concise statement of reasons for the motion and any relevant documentary evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.41(b)(14), 1201.55(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming that the motion here was timely and properly made, we deny it. The appellant's motion sets forth a long and rambling discussion of the allegedly unfair and improper manner in which agency officials have treated various agency employees. The administrative judge cautioned the appellant during the proceedings below that her appeal was not an open-ended inquiry into the working conditions and management practices within JA-4, but the appellant again asks us on cross petition for review to engage in such an inquiry. The evidence and argument submitted by the appellant, <span class="Italic">see id.</span>, thus do not furnish any clear basis upon which we can find that the employees mentioned by the appellant have suffered harassment because of their involvement or potential involvement in this appeal. We therefore deny her motion for protective orders for these individuals. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.55(d).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without mentioning regulatory authority, in <span class="Italic">Frias v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 691, 695 n.4 (1993), the Board declined to prevent an adverse action from being taken against an attorney, who was an agency employee being disciplined "for alleged misconduct during the course of his representation" of another agency employee, the appellant. The Board lacked original jurisdiction to decide the propriety of the adverse action against counsel, but that lawyer could appeal to the regional office or seek assistance from the OSCl to prevent a reprisal for the exercise of appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Garst v. Dept. of Army</span>, 60 MSPR 514, 519-20 (1994), declined a protective order sought by an appellant during the pendency of OPM's request for reconsideration of appellant's successful IRA appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(e)(1)(B)(i) (supp. IV 1992), the Board "may,...during the pendency of any proceeding before the Board, issue any order which may be necessary to protect a witness or other individual from harassment...." The purpose of this authority is to protect witnesses in order to aid the fact-finding process. Joint Explanatory Statement, 135 Cong. Rec. S2783 (Mar. 16, 1989, daily ed.). In this case, the appellant has not made out a case for a protective order. There is no claim that his current supervisors will engage in any harassment, and there is no evidence that the agency lawyers have any supervisory authority over him or have engaged in any activity other than representing the agency. The motion for a protective order, therefore, is DENIED.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Bernstein v. Dept. of Army</span>, 82 MSPR 375, 380-85 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-22 (1999), the appellant defending a performance-based demotion asserted harmful error, among other defenses, on the basis of alleged intimidating and coercive techniques used by the agency representative to obtain information against the appellant during the preappeal investigation. The AJ, crediting the allegations of coercion, sanctioned the agency by employing adverse inferences, causing the agency to lose the case and to file a PFR contesting the sanctions. In its review, the Board determined that the conduct of the agency representative occurred before the Board appeal was filed and was, therefore, beyond the sanctioning authority of the AJ. The Board remanded the appeal for a determination on the merits, following a hearing, with direction to the AJ to assess whether any inappropriate conduct by the agency representative (and the Board's majority decision implied that it saw no misconduct) interfered with the substantive rights of the appellant in a manner establishing harmful error. The Board did not explain what the substantive rights were--perhaps it was thinking of the right to a reply process that was fundamentally fair. The Board's decision, an extensive one, provides insight into how the Board approaches cases involving allegations of overzealous control of evidence or witnesses used in Board proceedings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Without deciding whether similar sanctions would ever be warranted prior to a Board hearing for a party's coercion or intimidation of prospective witnesses, we agree with the agency that the AJ abused his discretion in imposing such sanctions here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board had declined to impose sanctions where an appellant alleged that an agency official's contact with him following the issuance of the initial decision was coercive, absent a specific allegation that the agency official attempted to dissuade him from filing a petition for review or intimated adverse consequence if he did so. <span class="Italic">West v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 44 MSPR 551, 560-61 (1990). In that case, the appellant averred in an affidavit that an agency official contacted him at home following the issuance of the initial decision, discussed "end-of-service termination options," and stated that the appellant should reconsider his position concerning whether or not he intended to file a petition for review. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. He requested that sanctions be imposed on the agency for contacting him even though it knew that he had a representative. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 560. The Board declined to impose sanctions on the agency, finding that the appellant's assertions did not rise to the level of establishing intimidation on the part of the agency official<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 560-61.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board, however, has also found that evidence showing that an agency representative had implied that an employee's sick leave record would be investigated should he testify unfavorably raised the specter of intimidation of witnesses. <span class="Italic">Bowers v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 3 MSPR 562, 564-65 (1980). In that case, the appellant's representative, on the day after the Board hearing, learned of an alleged abortive attempt by the agency representative to secure an additional witness and the agency representative's alleged use of intimidation to get that witness to testify in favor of the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 563. The appellant's representative submitted an affidavit in which the coveted witness asserted that, after questioning him about the agency's case, the agency representative then questioned him about his attendance, stating that he would personally ask the witness' supervisor to look into his sick leave, and threatened to send him to an agency physician to determine if he was fit to work for the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 563-64. Although that witness did not testify at the hearing, the appellant's representative alleged that the credibility of all of the agency's witnesses was impaired. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 564-65. The Board remanded the case for a determination of whether any witness' testimony had been tainted by such misconduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 565. On remand, a second hearing was held following which the AJ determined that none of original testimony was the product of coercion. <span class="Italic">See Bowers v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 11 MSPR 395, 396-97 (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In cases where an agency has imposed an adverse action based on the charge of witness intimidation, the Board has not sustained that charge in the absence of evidence showing that the appellant suggested that an employee either not testify or not testify truthfully or that the appellant directed any personal threats to an employee or intimated that adverse consequences would befall a particular employee should testimony be unfavorable. <span class="Italic">See Alsedek v. Department of the Army</span>, 58 MSPR 229, 238-39 (1993); <span class="Italic">Garst v. Department of the Army</span>, 56 MSPR 371, 379-81 (1993), <span class="Italic">recons. granted on other grounds</span>, 60 MSPR 514 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the Board has required evidence showing that an agency official threatened an employee witness with adverse consequences, such as disciplinary action, or suggested that an employee witness either not testify or not testify truthfully before it will find that the agency official intimidated that employee witness. <span class="Italic">See Alsedek</span>, 58 MSPR at 238-39; <span class="Italic">Garst</span>, 56 MSPR at 379-81; <span class="Italic">West</span>, 44 MSPR at 560-61; <span class="Italic">Bowers</span>, 3 MSPR at 564-65.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the AJ found that the following paragraph in particular from Laycock's cover letter in the February 4, 1998 communication was intimidating <span class="Italic">per se</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">11. It is your job to cooperate with me (the agency's designated counsel) in the preparation of your testimony and to provide truthful and complete answers to my questions, and the questions of (the appellant) and the judge. This adverse action and the hearing of this appeal will be a success if every witness provides truthful and complete testimony, regardless of the decision issued by the MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that paragraph 11 conveyed "to virtually all of the parties' proposed witnesses" that the agency may "violate the law and ignore a Board final decision adverse to the agency's view of the propriety of its action."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ further found that the remaining paragraphs in the cover letter, <span id="Page_1391"></span>which set forth the agency's detailed arguments and factual assertions concerning the merits of the performance action and the appellant's affirmative defenses of harmful error and religious discrimination, communicated to the prospective witnesses the version of events that Laycock and the agency "regard[ed] as 'the truth,' and by inference, that the subject witnesses' testimony w[ould] be 'used' by the agency to prove this 'truth.'" Those remaining paragraphs read together with paragraph 11, the AJ found, communicated to the prospective witnesses that they were required to testify in concert with Laycock's and the agency's stated views and that, if they did so, the agency would prevail either because the Board would rule in its favor or, if the Board should issue a decision reversing the appellant's demotion, because the agency would ignore the Board's decision and refuse to cancel the demotion in violation of law. The threat of the latter situation, the AJ found, particularly intimidated the witnesses because it implied that the agency would not feel bound by a Board decision in any subsequent adverse action appeal brought by a witness should he or she be disciplined in retaliation for giving testimony unfavorable to the agency in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the agency that the AJ has read too much into the February 4, 1998 cover letter. A far more likely interpretation of paragraph 11 and the remaining paragraphs of Laycock's February 4, 1998 cover letter, either read together or separately, is that the agency wants the witnesses to testify truthfully and completely, i.e., honestly and openly, and that, if they do so, the agency will consider the appeal a success no matter what the outcome. These paragraphs, combined with the remainder of the documents included in the February 4, 1998 communication, fail to show that an agency official suggested that a prospective witness either not testify or not testify truthfully or directed any personal threats to a witness or intimated that adverse consequences would befall a particular witness should testimony be unfavorable. <span class="Italic">Cf. Alsedek</span>, 58 MSPR at 238-39; <span class="Italic">Garst</span>, 56 MSPR at 379-81; <span class="Italic">West</span>, 44 MSPR at 560-61; <span class="Italic">Bowers</span>, 3 MSPR at 564-65. Thus, the AJ erred in finding that the February 4, 1998 communication <span class="Italic">per se</span> intimidated the prospective witnesses and tainted their testimony irrevocably. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that, contrary to the AJ, a different result is not required by the fact that sixteen of the seventeen prospective witnesses were under the deciding official's supervision in their employment. Accordingly, we find that the AJ erred in finding, based solely on the record below, that the February 4, 1998 communication intimidated the prospective witnesses and irrevocably tainted their testimony and, consequently, he abused his discretion in imposing sanctions based on that finding. <span class="Italic">Cf. Alsedek</span>, 58 MSPR at 238-39; <span class="Italic">Garst</span>, 56 MSPR at 379-81; <span class="Italic">West</span>, 44 MSPR at 560-61; <span class="Italic">Bowers</span>, 3 MSPR at 564-65; <span class="Italic">cf. also Shepherd v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc</span>., 62 F.3d 1469, 1483-84 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (finding that no harassment of a potential witness occurred and, thus, that sanctions were not warranted where the defendant's attorney merely contacted a potential witness a year after the witness had informed the defendant that she would not cooperate and then, when the witness again refused to cooperate, the attorney pursued the matter no further); <span class="Italic">Republic of Philippines v. Westinghouse Electric Corp.</span>, 43 F.3d 65, 69-72, 80-81 (3d Cir. 1994) (sanctions warranted where the plaintiff threatened two witnesses with criminal prosecution and one witness with disciplinary action as a result of their testimony in favor of the defendant); <span class="Italic">Frumkin v. Mayo Clinic</span>, 965 F.2d 620, 626-27 (8th Cir. 1992) (district court likely would not have abused its discretion if it had dismissed the case as a sanction where the plaintiff threatened to kill the defendant's witnesses while the case was pending); <span class="Italic">but cf. Harlan v. Lewis</span>, 982 F.2d 1255, 1257-62 (8th Cir.)

Accordingly, we remand this case for further adjudication, including a hearing, on the merits of the performance action and the appellant's affirmative defenses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the AJ should evaluate each witness' credibility, considering, among other factors, whether the witness' testimony has been irrevocably tainted by an agency official's conduct, e.g., by the February 4, 1998 communication. <span class="Italic">See Bowers</span>, 3 MSPR at 565; <span class="Italic">see also Hillen v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 MSPR 453, 460 (1987) (an AJ "must be sufficiently informed of the underlying relationships, circumstances, and influences operating on the witness, so that in the light of his or her experience, he or she can determine whether a mutation in the testimony could reasonably be expected as a probable human reaction") (citations omitted); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Perna v. Electronic Data Systems, Corp</span>., 916 F. Supp. 388, 403 (D.N.J. 1995) (the appropriate sanction for the plaintiff's act of viewing and photocopying the defendant's documents without permission during the discovery period is a jury instruction making the jury aware of the plaintiff's improper conduct for their consideration on issues of credibility arising in the case). While it is true that several of the prospective witnesses submitted sworn and unsworn statements describing their reactions upon reading the February 4, 1998 communication, the AJ will be in a better position to evaluate the effect of Laycock's February 4, 1998 communication on those witnesses' testimony after holding a hearing in which he can observe the witnesses' demeanor and question them about their reactions, <span class="Italic">see Hillen</span>, 35 MSPR at 458-60. The AJ should give the appellant broad discretion to cross-examine the agency's witnesses on this issue. Further, the AJ should admonish all witnesses of their duty to testify truthfully and fully.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the AJ finds on remand that any of the witnesses' testimony has been irrevocably tainted by conduct of an agency official, the AJ should then consider whether a sanction, such as making an adverse inference that the affected witness' testimony would have been favorable to the appellant, is necessary to serve the ends of justice. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.43.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, the AJ also made an adverse inference, i.e., the second adverse inference, that interview statements, affidavits, and depositions obtained by Laycock from agency employees during the investigation of the appellant's performance were favorable to the appellant because he found that they were coerced. As the agency correctly asserts, however, the AJ did not explain the basis for this finding other than merely referring to the sworn and unsworn statements by several agency employees complaining of coercion they believed they experienced during interviews, affidavit preparation, or depositions conducted by agency counsel. The agency contests on review, as it did below, the contents of those employees' statements and argues that the second adverse inference effectively rejected any testimony by the proposing and deciding official, two prospective witnesses named by the agency who would purportedly testify in part to the absence of coercion and intimidation during the interviews, affidavit preparation, and depositions. We agree with the agency and also note that, by making this finding without hearing relevant testimony or providing further explanation and by drawing this adverse inference, the AJ summarily rejected the agency's account of Laycock's conduct without even addressing Laycock's declaration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, an AJ's sanctioning authority is limited to misconduct occurring during the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.43; <span class="Italic">cf. Chambers v. NASCO, Inc.</span>, 501 U.S. 32, 43-44, 57-58 (1991) (sanctions can be imposed for conduct before the court in the very proceeding in which sanctions are sought or for abuses of processes occurring beyond the courtroom, such as disobeying the court's orders); <span class="Italic">Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S.A.</span>, 481 U.S. 787, 798 (1987) (court's power to punish for contempt reaches conduct before the court and that beyond the court's confines, because the underlying concern that gave rise to this power was disobedience to the orders of the court, regardless of whether such disobedience interfered with the conduct of the trial, as well as the disruption of court proceedings). Here, the sanctioned conduct, i.e., Laycock's alleged coercion of the prospective witnesses during interviews, affidavit preparation, and depositions, occurred during the investigation of the appellant's performance before the agency decided to demote the appellant. Thus, this alleged coercion was beyond the AJ's sanctioning authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.43; <span class="Italic">Chambers</span>, 501 U.S. at 43-44, 57-58; <span class="Italic">Young</span>, 481 U.S. at 798. Instead, the AJ should have addressed, as the appellant argued below, whether this alleged misconduct harmed the appellant's substantive rights. <span class="Italic">See Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 672, 681, 685 (1991) (harmful error under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A) cannot be presumed; an agency error is harmful only where the record shows that the procedural error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the AJ improperly found that coercion occurred during the interviews, affidavit preparation, and depositions, and that his imposition of the second adverse inference sanction based on this finding was likewise improper. Following the hearing on remand, therefore, the AJ shall summarize the evidence, resolve issues of credibility, and make further factual findings on the issue of whether Laycock or any other agency official coerced interview statements, affidavits, and depositions from employees during the investigation of the appellant's performance and whether such coercion harmed the appellant's substantive rights. <span class="Italic">See Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 1 MSPR 587, 589 (1980); <span class="Italic">see also Stephen</span>, 47 MSPR at 681, 685; <span class="Italic">Bowers</span>, 3 MSPR at 565.</p>
