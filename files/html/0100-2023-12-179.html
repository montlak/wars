<p class="Body-Text">An appellant's confusion and lack of sophistication may be taken into account when determining whether good cause for late filing exists. The appellant must show that his confusion is related to a specific ambiguity in either the instructions he received or in a Board procedure relating to a PFR. <span class="Italic">Abney v. OPM</span>, 89 MSPR 305, 309 &#x00B6; 6 (2001); <span class="Italic">Noble v. USPS</span>, 73 MSPR 59, 63 (1997); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Stuart v. OPM</span>, 91 MSPR 206, 209 &#x00B6; 6 (2002) ("The fact that the appellant is legally unskilled does not relieve him of the responsibility for timely filing his petition for review."); <span class="Italic">Gareis v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 90 MSPR 107, 112 &#x00B6; 13 (2001) (delayed PFR: "An appellant's lack of sophistication in Board matters and a general inability to understand instructions and procedures does not establish good cause to waive the filing deadline.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Forst v. OPM</span>, 97 MSPR 142, 144-45 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2004), placed emphasis on the "specific ambiguity" factor as to an appellant who stated he was confused concerning the filing date for a PFR because of the language in the initial decision about the 60-day period for going to the court of appeals after an initial decision becomes final:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant's confusion and lack of sophistication, which contribute to a late filing, may be taken into account when determining whether good cause for a late filing exists. <span class="Italic">Noble v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 59, 63 (1997) (citing <span class="Italic">Walls v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 29 F.3d 1578, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1994)). An appellant must show, however, that such confusion is related to a specific ambiguity in either the instructions he received or in a Board procedure. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, although the appellant asserts that he mistakenly believed that he had sixty days to file an appeal with the Board, he has not identified a specific ambiguity in the initial decision warranting his mistaken belief. The initial decision, in fact, provided the appellant with the exact date on which it would become final unless he filed a petition for review with the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore find that the appellant has not established by preponderant evidence that he acted with due diligence or reasonable prudence under the circumstances of this case, or that there were circumstances beyond his control that affected his ability to comply with the time limit. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(ii) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(B)]; <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. at 184; <span class="Italic">see also Evans v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 36 &#x00B6; 9 (1999) (a mistaken filing with the Federal Circuit prior to the deadline for filing a petition for review with the Board generally does not excuse a later untimely filing with the Board); <span class="Italic">Shelton v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. 120, 121 (1984) (an employee's explanation that he misunderstood the filing deadline and believed he could file his petition for review within thirty days after the initial decision became final did not establish good cause for the delay in filing a petition for review, considering the clear notice in the initial decision and the absence of any circumstances beyond the employee's control). Factors in this case supporting a finding of good cause for the appellant's filing delay are the length of the delay and the appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status at the time of filing. These factors standing alone, however, are insufficient to establish good cause for the appellant's delay in filing a petition for review. <span class="Italic">See Simon v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 176, 181 (1994), <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 52 F.3d 343 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Counsel has an obligation to read and follow the instructions in an initial decision pertaining to PFR filing requirements. In <span class="Italic">Colon v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 514, 517 (1996), counsel's staff called the Board's regional office for instructions about where to file a PFR. The information from the regional office was then misinterpreted by counsel's staff to mean that the PFR should be filed with the clerk of the Federal Circuit. When the mistake was discovered, the PFR was refiled with the Board a couple of weeks later. The Board declined to excuse the belated PFR. Counsel should have read the filing instructions. Even assuming reasonable reliance upon somewhat ambiguous information from the Board's regional office, counsel waited too long to correct the filing error following its discovery. Chairman Erdreich filed a dissenting opinion arguing that a timely, but misdirected PFR to the Federal Circuit should have been excused in the same manner that the Board excuses a PFR similarly misfiled with OPM, OSC, or the employing agency. <span class="Italic">See Dabner v.

<p class="Body-Text">It is not just the appellant's misinterpretation, or lack of knowledge, of Board regulations that proves insufficient to support waiver of a late PFR.

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Caldwell v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 58 MSPR 54, 57 (1993), the Board refused an untimely PFR:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's claims of confusion and a lack of sophistication in legal matters also fail to establish good cause for his delay in filing.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's sworn statement alleging her confusion and lack of sophistication in legal matters is insufficient to show good cause for the 14-day delay in filing her petition for review.

The instructions in the initial decision regarding where and when to file with the Board or the Federal Circuit were clear on their face and self-explanatory. If the appellant had read and followed them, the untimely filing of the petition for review could have been avoided. It is clear from the appellant's motion, however, that he did not read the initial decision's filing instructions thoroughly. The appellant's error in reading the initial decision does not establish good cause for the untimely filing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Colon v.

<p class="Body-Text">Confusion over whether to submit a PFR or a request for an extension to file a PFR is no excuse for lateness. <span class="Italic">Donahue v. OPM</span>, 23 MSPR 46, 48 (1984).

Dept. of Army</span>, 31 MSPR 295, 296 (1986). If the initial decision does not specify a PFR deadline, the error will not excuse a late PFR if the appellant does not state that omission as his reason for late filing and if the appellant was furnished with a copy of the Board's regulations when he was issued the adverse action decision by the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Upshaw v.
