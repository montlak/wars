<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-184"><span class="space">15.</span> Department of Veterans Affairs</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">MSPB coverage of VA employees is convoluted; jurisdiction is indirectly defined. Traditionally there are two principal categories of VA employees: medical and nonmedical. VA employees holding competitive and excepted service appointments have whatever Board appeal rights that Title 5 and Title 38 confer. The situation is different for medical personnel appointed under Title 38 of the U.S. Code. We add, although not pertinent to VA physicians appointed under Title 38, that as of 2014 VA SES members are subject to special removal and transfer procedures, and to truncated MSPB review, discussed in Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-158.html#sec6-157">Senior Executive Service</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-13-162.html#sec6-161">Department of Veterans Affairs</a>."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Medical personnel include "professionals"--physicians, dentists, registered nurses, optometrists, physician assistants, and expanded-function dental auxiliaries--and "others." The professionals, appointed under 38 USC 7401(1), have their own appellate system within the VA. The "others," generally appointed under 38 USC 7401(3), include psychologists, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, practical or vocational nurses, pharmacists, and occupational therapists. VA nonmedical personnel appointed to permanent positions are hired principally under the authority of 38 USC 7408(a), allowing the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to make these appointments under "civil service laws, rules, and regulations." For a description of the various groups of medical, nonmedical, and "hybrid" employees of the VA, refer to a decision involving the negotiability of collective bargaining proposals, <span class="Italic">VA v. FLRA</span>, 9 F.3d 123 (D.C. Cir. 1993). <span class="Italic">Bridgewood v. VA</span>, 75 MSPR 480, 483-85 (1997), discusses the status of "without compensation (WOC)" training positions. Title 5 "hybrid" employees of the VA qualify for MSPB appeal rights in the same manner as other Title 5 employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marshall v. VA</span>, 106 MSPR 478, 481-82 &#x00B6; 7, 2007 MSPB 209 (2007) (removal reversed following remand and second review request, <span class="Italic">Marshall v. VA</span>, 111 MSPR 5, 2008 MSPB 249 (2008)); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Kopec v. VA</span>, PH-3330-14-0320-I-1 n.11 (NP 1/20/2016) ("As the administrative judge observed, these are not 'hybrid' positions to which many of the title 5 requirements apply. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3) (providing for certain title 5 rights for positions incorporated by reference to other statutory sections, not including section 7402(b)(13)).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 markedly changed, and diminished, civil service protections for defined VA personnel. Whether the statute precludes actions under ordinary Title 5, with their accompanying protections, remains to be seen. What retroactive effect the statute carries remains to be seen, since the Board has not been issuing decisions since 2017.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the 2017 legislation, 38 USC 714:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Employees: removal, demotion, or suspension based on performance or misconduct</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">In General</span>.--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;The Secretary may remove, demote, or suspend a covered individual who is an employee of the Department if the Secretary determines the performance or misconduct of the covered individual warrants such removal, demotion, or suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;If the Secretary so removes, demotes, or suspends such a covered individual, the Secretary may--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(A)&#x2003;remove the covered individual from the civil service (as defined in section 2101 of title 5);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(B)&#x2003;demote the covered individual by means of a reduction in grade for which the covered individual is qualified, that the Secretary determines is appropriate, and that reduces the annual rate of pay of the covered individual; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(C)&#x2003;suspend the covered individual.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sayers v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20200331098">954 F.3d 1370</a>, 1372-82 (Fed. Cir. 2020), involving removal of a chief pharmacist, answered key questions concerning the 2017 VA statute. First, the statute requires the Board to assess the reasonableness of a penalty as part of the VA decision the Board reviews. Second, the statute is not retroactive--it cannot be applied to conduct predating the statute's enactment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2017, Congress enacted the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which gave the Department of Veterans Affairs a new, streamlined authority for disciplining employees for misconduct or poor performance, and placed certain limitations on the review of those actions by the Merit Systems Protection Board. Later in 2017, the Department applied 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714,[1] which codifies the Act, to remove Dr. Jeffrey Sayers from his position as a chief pharmacist. Dr. Sayers appealed to the Board and an administrative judge affirmed his removal. He subsequently appealed to this Court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;More specifically, the Act, as codified in &#x00A7; 714, allows the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to remove an employee for inadequate performance or misconduct. &#x00A7; 714(a). Compared to pre-existing removal authority, particularly the authority provided under title 5, chapter 75, &#x00A7; 714 speeds up the removal process, &#x00A7; 714(c), lessens the VA's burden of proof at the Board from the preponderance of the evidence to substantial evidence, &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(A), (d)(3)(B), and strips the Board of its authority to mitigate the VA's imposed penalty. &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(B), (d)(3)(C).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our primary issue on appeal is whether &#x00A7; 714 can apply retroactively to conduct that took place before its enactment. To decide that issue, we must also decide the proper interpretation of the statutory limitation on the Board's review authority in &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(B) and (d)(3)(C). We ultimately hold that &#x00A7; 714, properly construed, has impermissible retroactive effect, and that Congress did not authorize the statute's retroactive application. Because we conclude that &#x00A7; 714 cannot be applied retroactively--and Dr. Sayers's conduct underlying his removal took place before its enactment--we vacate his removal and remand to the Board for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) promoted Dr. Sayers to his position as the Chief of Pharmacy Services for the Greater Los Angeles (GLA) Health Care System in 2003. In that role, Dr. Sayers managed about 175 full-time employees across five pharmacies and three opioid-treatment facilities. In June 2016, a VA site-visit team investigating GLA Health Care System practices discovered violations of VA policy in the pharmacies under Dr. Sayers's supervision. When Dr. Sayers failed to follow orders to immediately correct these violations, the VA detailed him from the Chief of Pharmacy Services position pending further review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nine months later, while Dr. Sayers remained detailed from the Chief position, the VA sent another site-visit team to review GLA pharmacy internal control systems. The review team visited four of the five GLA pharmacies, discovering violations of VA policy so numerous and concerning that the team did not even review the internal control systems. Because compliance with these policies fell within Dr. Sayers's purview as the Chief of Pharmacy Services, the GLA Chief of Staff proposed Dr. Sayers's removal under &#x00A7; 714 in September 2017. The GLA Health Care Director acted as the deciding official and sustained the charges; the VA removed Dr. Sayers effective November 7, 2017.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr.&#x2003;Sayers appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board, and the Administrative Judge affirmed his removal under &#x00A7; 714. The Administrative Judge found that substantial evidence supported eight of the nine factual specifications underlying the VA's charge that Dr. Sayers had failed to perform assigned duties. <span class="Italic">Sayers v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, No. SF-0714-18-0067-I-1, slip op. at 11 (M.S.P.B. Apr. 18, 2018) ("<span class="Italic">Board Decision</span>"). She also found that substantial evidence supported the single specification underlying the VA's charge that Dr. Sayers had failed to follow instructions. The Administrative Judge rejected Dr. Sayers's arguments that he had suffered harmful procedural error and that the removal had violated his due process rights. Finally, she declined to consider Dr. Sayers's argument that his removal constituted an unreasonable penalty under the circumstances because it was inconsistent with the VA's table of penalties and violated the VA's policy of progressive discipline. The Administrative Judge explained that under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(B), the Board "does not have the authority to mitigate the penalty prescribed by the agency." She interpreted this lack of mitigation authority to foreclose the Board from "assess[ing] the factors considered or the weight accorded any particular factor in selecting a penalty."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Dr. Sayers primarily argues that the Board erred in upholding his removal under &#x00A7; 714 because his alleged misconduct took place before its enactment.[3] He argues that the statute is silent on retroactivity, and the presumption against retroactivity should thus apply since the statute's standard of proof and limitations on penalty mitigation detrimentally affect his property right to agency employment. We agree with Dr. Sayers, and accordingly vacate the Board's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The VA argues that Mr. Sayers waived this argument by not raising it before the Board. Even if Mr. Sayers failed to preserve this argument, we believe that this issue merits exercising our discretion to resolve it on appeal. <span class="Italic">See Singleton v. Wulff</span>, 428 U.S. 106, 121 (1976). Because the retroactivity of &#x00A7; 714 raises a pure issue of law that affects many VA employees, the Board lacks a quorum to definitively decide the issue, and different administrative judges have come to different non-binding interpretations of the statute, <span class="Italic">see, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">McDonald v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, No. DE-0714-17-0409-I-1, 2018 WL 494983 (M.S.P.B. Jan. 16, 2018), the interests of justice are best served by reaching this issue. <span class="Italic">See L.E.A. Dynatech, Inc. v. Allina</span>, 49 F.3d 1527, 1531 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before proceeding to the retroactivity analysis, we first must resolve the differences between the parties regarding &#x00A7; 714's meaning and effect.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Dr. Sayers, misreading 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(a)(1), also contends that the VA impermissibly applied a "substantial evidence" standard to review the sufficiency of the charges underpinning his proposed removal. Although we agree with Dr. Sayers that nothing in the statute compels the VA to apply a substantial evidence standard for removal rather than a preponderance standard, we also agree with the government that nothing prevents the VA from doing so. Because the statute leaves the proper standard to the VA's discretion, the VA did not err by choosing substantial evidence review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress enacted the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 on June 23, 2017. Pub. L. No. 115-41, 131 Stat. 862. The Act was introduced to give the VA "the tools...to swiftly and effectively discipline employees who don't meet the standards our veterans deserve or who fail in their sacred mission to provide world-class health care and benefits to the men and women who have served" and to "provide a singular expedited procedure for all VA employees to respond and appeal to proposed removals, demotions, and suspensions for performance or misconduct." 163 Cong. Rec. H2114 (daily ed. Mar. 16, 2017) (statement of Congressman Roe). Among other provisions, the Act established 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714, <span class="Italic">see</span> Pub. L. No. 115-41, &#x00A7; 202, 131 Stat. at 869, which provides the VA with a process for removing, demoting, or suspending its employees for inadequate performance or misconduct. Section 714's process presents the VA with an expedited, less rigorous alternative to traditional civil service adverse action appeals under title 5 chapter 75 (misconduct and performance) and title 5 chapter 43 (performance). <span class="Italic">Cf. Lovshin v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 767 F.2d 826, 842-43 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (holding that the passage of chapter 43 did not foreclose removal for inadequate performance under chapter 75).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under &#x00A7; 714(a)(1), "[t]he Secretary may remove, demote, or suspend [an employee] if the Secretary determines the performance or misconduct of the [employee] warrants such removal, demotion, or suspension." "The aggregate period for notice, response, and final decision...may not exceed 15 business days[,]" and the employee must appeal the adverse action to the Board within ten business days. &#x00A7; 714(c)(1)(A), (4)(B). The appeal is subject to expedited review, and "the administrative judge shall uphold the decision of the Secretary...if the decision is supported by substantial evidence." &#x00A7; 714(d)(1)-(2)(A). "[I]f the decision of the Secretary is supported by substantial evidence, the administrative judge shall not mitigate the penalty prescribed by the Secretary." &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(B).[5] The VA argues that this provision limits the Board's review to only the facts underlying an adverse action. We disagree. Section 714 requires the Board to review the adverse action decision in full.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The same standards apply to the Board's review of the Secretary's decision if the employee appeals the administrative judge's decision to the full Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 714(d)(3)(B)-(C).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ordinary meaning of "the decision" reviewed by the Board refers to the entire decision--including the VA's choice of penalty. The "decision" referred to in &#x00A7; 714 is not merely the choice to sustain the charges against the employee. It is the decision "to remove, demote, or suspend [the] employee under subsection (a)." &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(A) ("[T]he administrative judge shall uphold the <span class="Italic">decision</span> of the Secretary <span class="Italic">to remove, demote, or suspend an employee</span> under subsection (a) if the decision is supported by substantial evidence." (emphasis added)). Subsection (a)--&#x00A7; 714(a)(1), specifically--distills the Secretary's decision to "determin[ing] [if] the performance or misconduct of the [employee] <span class="Italic">warrants such removal, demotion, or suspension</span>." &#x00A7; 714(a)(1) (emphasis added). When correctly interpreted, &#x00A7; 714 requires the Board to review whether the Secretary had substantial evidence for his decision that an employee's actions warranted the adverse action. The Board cannot meaningfully review that decision if it blinds itself to the VA's choice of action. Deciding that an employee stole a paper clip is not the same as deciding that the theft of a paper clip warranted the employee's removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An adverse action "decision" based on misconduct has meant a decision to impose a certain penalty since long before the enactment of &#x00A7; 714. <span class="Italic">See Douglas v. Veterans Admin</span>., 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 297 (M.S.P.B. 1981) ("[A]n <span id="Page_299"></span>agency's adverse action 'decision' necessarily includes selection of the particular penalty as well as the determination that some sanction was warranted."). We must presume that Congress was aware of this history when drafting the statute. <span class="Italic">Cf. Lindahl v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 470 U.S. 768, 779-83, 791, 799 (1985) (interpreting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(c), which declares that "the decisions of the Office [of Personnel Management] concerning [retiree disability and dependency] are final and conclusive and are not subject to review," and reversing this Court's <span class="Italic">en banc</span> ruling that &#x00A7; 8347 "plainly" precluded <span class="Italic">any</span> judicial review; reasoning that Congress's failure to explicitly repeal Court of Claims precedent predating &#x00A7; 8347(c) only barring review of the factual underpinnings of such decisions gives rise to a presumption that Congress intended &#x00A7; 8347 to embody that precedent). Further, Congress could have chosen other phrasing had it wanted to narrow the aspects of the adverse action decision to be reviewed: Congress has expressly contoured the nature of review in other statutes. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7292(d)(2) ("Except to the extent that an appeal [from the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims] under this chapter presents a constitutional issue, the Court of Appeals [for the Federal Circuit] may not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case."); <span class="Italic">Bernklau v. Principi</span>, 291 F.3d 795, 800 (Fed. Cir. 2002) ("Unless there is a constitutional issue presented [by the decision of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims], however, we may not review factual determinations [made by that court]." (citing &#x00A7; 7292(d)(2))).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of a clearer statement than &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(B), which prohibits the administrative judge from <span class="Italic">mitigating</span> a penalty supported by substantial evidence, we should not presume the prohibition of <span class="Italic">all review</span> of the penalty to ensure its legality. In fact, &#x00A7; 714's integration with title 5 shows that the Board must still ensure that the VA's decision accords with the law. Section 714(d)(2)(A) explicitly declares that the &#x00A7; 714 "substantial evidence" requirement for Board review overrides the "preponderance of the evidence" standard used to review adverse actions under title 5 chapter 75. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(A) (requiring that, "[n]otwithstanding section 7701(c)(1)(B) of title 5," the administrative judge must uphold the Secretary's decision if it is supported by substantial evidence); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B) ("Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the decision of the agency shall be sustained under subsection (b) only if the agency's decision...is supported by a preponderance of the evidence."). But &#x00A7; 714 notably does not override &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(C), which requires the decision to accord with the law, even if it is supported by the evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2) ("Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the agency's decision may not be sustained under subsection (b) of this section if the employee or applicant for employment...shows that the decision was not in accordance with law."). This requirement, ensuring that an adverse action accords with law, has traditionally meant reviewing the adverse action decision in its entirety, not just the factual basis for the alleged conduct. <span class="Italic">Cf. Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 297 ("[A]n adverse action may be adequately supported by evidence of record but still be arbitrary and capricious, for instance if there is no rational connection between the grounds charged and the interest assertedly served by the sanction.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">And although &#x00A7; 714 overrides "title 5 or any other provision of law" when barring <span class="Italic">mitigation</span> of the penalty, &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(B), (3)(C), reviewing the totality of the adverse action decision stands apart from mitigating an unreasonable penalty. <span class="Italic">Cf. Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 306 ("Only if the Board finds...that the agency's judgment clearly exceeded the limits of reasonableness, is it appropriate for the Board then to specify how the agency's decision should be corrected to bring the penalty within the parameters of reasonableness."). The plain meaning of &#x00A7; 714, when considered in its entirety, conveys that when determining whether "the decision" is supported by substantial evidence, the Board (or administrative judge) must necessarily consider the agency's penalty choice as part of that review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act supplies meager discussion of penalty mitigation, never directly addressing whether the Board can review the agency's penalty decision. The Senate debates show that the overall intent of the Act was to make it easier and faster for the VA to penalize employees for misconduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> 163 Cong. Rec. S3280 (daily ed. June 6, 2017) (remarks of Sen. Rubio) ("[W]hile the employee is getting due notice and the opportunity to defend themselves, it doesn't drag on forever."). Yet those debates reinforce Congress's intent to maintain due process protections for employees, including the opportunity to appeal the Secretary's removal decision. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> ("This bill will also ensure that VA employees' due process rights are respected and not infringed upon."); <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at S3276 (remarks of Sen. Nelson) ("I also believe that it is important to protect the rights of the employees who may have been wrongly terminated, especially at the lower levels, by giving them the opportunity to appeal a supervisor's decision to fire them. This bill we are going [to] pass does that."); <span class="Italic">id</span>. at S3268 (remarks of Sen. Tester) ("It does not gut due process protections. It keeps all the existing due process protections under current law. Unlike the House bill, it doesn't shorten or eliminate the appeals process for employees who are fired."). The government's reading--allowing the agency to remove an employee for the tiniest incident of misconduct so long as the agency could present substantial evidence that the trifling misconduct occurred--could "gut due process protections" in a way Congress did not intend.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further persuasive evidence of congressional intent arises from the interaction between Congress and the Board leading up to the enactment of &#x00A7; 714. Before &#x00A7; 714's passage in 2017, Congress passed a similar provision related to the removal of Senior Executive Service officials, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 713. <span class="Italic">See</span> Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014, Pub. L. No. 113-146, 128 Stat. 1754. The Board considered the 2014 Act to require it "to develop and to put into effect expedited procedures for processing appeals filed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. [&#x00A7;] 713," so the Board promulgated a regulation that eased the requirements imposed by <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>. Practices and Procedures; Appeal of Removal or Transfer of Senior Executive Service Employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs, 79 Fed. Reg. 48,941, 48,941 (Aug. 19, 2014). Even so, the regulation still allowed for review of the entire adverse action decision, including the penalty--just without penalty mitigation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1210.18(d) (2014) (allowing an employee to "establish[ ] that the imposed penalty was unreasonable under the circumstances of the case, in which case the action is reversed" but clarifying that "the administrative judge may not mitigate the Secretary's decision").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Besides the text itself and the legislative history, our reading also accords with basic precepts of administrative law and judicial review. Even if we adopted the government's construction of &#x00A7; 714, in which the Board has to treat the penalty imposed as an irrelevant distraction from its factual audit of the Board's evidence, this Court would still review the Board's decision under the familiar standard that it must "hold unlawful and set aside any agency action, findings, or conclusions found to be--(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c). It would then fall to this Court to examine whether the VA had imposed a penalty unsupported by substantial evidence or not in accordance with the law. <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, in formalizing the Board's review of adverse action penalty decisions, recognized the importance of this Court not performing such review for the first time. <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 301-02 ("To assure that its decisions meet that standard under Section 7703(c), the Board must, in addition to determining that procedural requirements have been observed, review the agency's penalty selection.... Therefore, in reviewing an agency-imposed penalty, the Board must[,] at a minimum[,] assure that the <span class="Italic">Overton Park</span> criteria for measuring arbitrariness or capriciousness have been satisfied.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our interpretation also fits with the historical practice of reviewing the penalty in adverse action decisions. <span class="Italic">Cf. Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 290 ("It cannot be doubted, and no one disputes, that the Civil Service Commission was vested with and exercised authority to mitigate penalties imposed by employing agencies." (footnote omitted)). The longstanding acceptance of penalty review, with or without mitigation authority, comes with good reason: it avoids absurd, unconstitutional results. Under the government's reading, an agency could remove an employee for an extremely trivial offense--theft of a paperclip being the example given at oral argument--so long as substantial evidence supports that the employee actually stole a paperclip. This implausible scenario becomes far more likely if the government alleges several specifications supporting a charge that merits removal, but only meets its burden of showing substantial evidence for the most minor specifications. <span class="Italic">Cf. Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 308 ("Whenever the agency's action is based on multiple charges[,] some of which are not sustained, the presiding official should consider carefully whether the sustained charges merited the penalty imposed by the agency."). Our interpretation of &#x00A7; 714 gives meaningful effect to the statutory language but avoids this absurd result where an employee with an otherwise sterling record could be removed over a trivial incident.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For its contrary interpretation, the government relies largely on this Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Lisiecki v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 769 F.2d 1558 (Fed. Cir. 1985). <span class="Italic">Lisiecki</span> dealt with the portion of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) <span class="Italic">codified at</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303, known as chapter 43, which created new procedures to discipline employees for unacceptable performance. The chapter 43 adverse actions established by the CSRA differ from chapter 75 adverse actions in several ways. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> U.S. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., <span class="Italic">Performance-Based Actions under Chapters 43 and 75 of Title 5--Similarities and Differences</span>, in <span class="Italic">Adverse Actions: A Compilation of Articles</span> 9-13 (Dec. 2016), <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/mspbsearch/viewdocs.aspx?docnumber=1361510&version=1366861">https://www.mspb.gov/mspbsearch/viewdocs.aspx?docnumber=1361510&version=1366861</a> (reporting to Congress and the President on the procedural differences between chapter 43 and chapter 75 adverse actions). Under chapter 43, the agency need not show that an adverse action stems from conduct that harms the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Lisiecki</span>, 769 F.2d at 1565. And under chapter <span id="Page_300"></span>43, the MSPB may only review the agency's decision for substantial evidence, in contrast to chapter 75's requirement that the MSPB review the agency's decision for preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(A)-(B). We held that those two differences between chapter 75 and chapter 43 adverse action procedures provided "a clear indication of congressional intent to restrict the [B]oard's authority in reviewing chapter 43 actions" and thus concluded that the Board lacks authority "to review and, where deemed appropriate, to mitigate penalties in chapter 43 cases." <span class="Italic">Lisiecki</span>, 769 F.2d at 1565, 1568. The government argues that if the Board has no authority to review a penalty under chapter 43, which is silent on the Board's mitigation powers, then the Board must also lack authority to review a penalty under &#x00A7; 714, which expressly removes its mitigation authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Different concerns governed <span class="Italic">Lisiecki</span>, however, and the reasoning behind <span class="Italic">Lisiecki</span> cannot apply given the different procedural protections in &#x00A7; 714 removals. Chapter 43 procedures expressly do not apply to &#x00A7; 714 removals. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 714(c)(3). More importantly, the reasoning undergirding <span class="Italic">Lisiecki</span> arises from the specific circumstances of chapter 43 adverse actions, which have a narrow focus not applicable to &#x00A7; 714. Chapter 43 deals exclusively with removals for inadequate performance. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(a) ("Subject to the provisions of this section, an agency may reduce in grade or remove an employee for unacceptable performance."). Section 714 allows removal for performance or <span class="Italic">misconduct</span>, traditionally governed by chapter 75. Performance adverse actions and misconduct adverse actions have rather distinct considerations. <span class="Italic">Lisiecki</span>, 769 F.2d at 1566 ("The conclusion in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> that the MSPB could mitigate penalties assessed under chapter 75 was based on considerations not anywhere present under chapter 43."). Overriding the agency's choice of penalty has a very different effect on the agency when the penalty is imposed for incompetence rather than misconduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. ("To permit the MSPB to mitigate demotion or removal would.... permit the [B]oard to require an agency to retain an incompetent worker in situations where it proposed removal."). In addition, the agency has a unique view on how its employees' incompetence impacts the agency, compared to the more generalized impact that misconduct has on an agency. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. ("Management best knows its needs and the potential of its employees to further an agency's statutory mission."). These considerations provide a key distinction from misconduct removals: if the facts supporting an employee's incompetence exist, the choice of penalty is based not on the employee's conduct, but on the agency's work requirements; Board review or mitigation of that choice does not make sense. <span class="Italic">Cf. id</span>. at 1566-67 (providing Mr. Lisiecki's removal as a concrete example of how mitigation disrupts agency function in chapter 43 removals).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Beyond these pragmatic considerations lurk constitutional concerns. Employees enjoy much greater pre-termination due process protections under chapter 43 than under &#x00A7; 714. <span class="Italic">Lisiecki</span> itself highlights the factors that distinguish chapter 43 actions from chapter 75 actions, which also provide more pre-termination due process than &#x00A7; 714 actions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1566 ("It is important not to ignore the vital distinctions between the relevant chapters of title 5."); <span class="Italic">see supra</span> note 1. Chapter 43 actions may be taken only after the employee is given notice and an opportunity to improve. <span class="Italic">Lisiecki</span>, 769 F.2d at 1561, 1566. The agency may only choose from two penalties: demotion or removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1564, 1566. And chapter 43 actions are remedial rather than punitive. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1566. These distinctions between chapter 43 performance removals and chapter 75 misconduct removals were critical to <span class="Italic">Lisiecki's</span> holding. Section 714's inclusion of misconduct removals prevents <span class="Italic">Lisiecki's</span> rationale from being meaningfully extended to &#x00A7; 714.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons, we hold that &#x00A7; 714 requires the Board to review for substantial evidence the entirety of the VA's removal decision--including the penalty--rather than merely confirming that the record contains substantial evidence that the alleged conduct leading to the adverse action actually occurred.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Since we hold that &#x00A7; 714 does not apply to Dr. Sayers because of its impermissible retroactive effect, we do not opine on the appropriate remedy in a hypothetical future case in which the Board finds a penalty unsupported by substantial evidence. It should be obvious, however, that the Board cannot revise the agency's choice of penalty to its own preferred alternative. E.g., &#x00A7; 714(d)(3)(C).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having addressed the disputed interpretation of &#x00A7; 714, we conclude that it cannot be applied to remove Dr. Sayers for the alleged misconduct without giving the statute impermissible retroactive effect. Generally, statutes apply only prospectively unless Congress expresses a "clear intent" that a provision should apply retroactively. <span class="Italic">Landgraf v. USI Film Prods</span>., 511 U.S. 244, 272-73 (1994). This default rule has certain exceptions, for example, if a statute amends only procedural rules. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 275. "The first step in the impermissible-retroactive-effect determination is to ascertain whether Congress has directed with the requisite clarity that the law be applied retrospectively." <span class="Italic">I.N.S. v. St. Cyr</span>, 533 U.S. 289, 291 (2001). Section 714 itself is silent on retroactivity. The VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act does not reveal any intent that &#x00A7; 714 apply retroactively. In fact, the Act's only references to when any of its provisions become effective relate to clawing back disciplined employees' bonuses or relocation expenses; these provisions become effective only prospectively. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 115-41, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 204-205, 131 Stat. 862, 875-77. The statute plainly lacks an "'unambiguous directive' or 'express command' that the statute is to be applied retroactively." <span class="Italic">Martin v. Hadix</span>, 527 U.S. 343, 354 (1999) (quoting <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 263, 280).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"If there is no congressional directive on the temporal reach of a statute, we determine whether the application of the statute to the conduct at issue would result in a retroactive effect." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 352. "If so, then...we presume that the statute does not apply to that conduct." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Supreme Court describes "retroactive effect" as "whether [a statute] would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed." <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 280. In other words, we make a "commonsense, functional judgment about 'whether the new [statute] attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment,'" making this judgment "informed and guided by 'familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations.'" <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 527 U.S. at 357-58 (quoting <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 270). If the statute attaches new legal consequences to events before its enactment (and is otherwise silent about its retroactivity), the statute must not apply to those prior events.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> recognized that "[t]he largest category of cases in which we have applied the presumption against statutory retroactivity has involved new provisions affecting contractual or property rights." 511 U.S. at 271. Dr. Sayers had a property right in his continued employment, <span class="Italic">see Stone v. F.D.I.C</span>., 179 F.3d 1368, 1374-75 (Fed. Cir. 1999), so &#x00A7; 714 falls within that category. By requiring the Board to apply the substantial evidence standard in reviewing the removal decision, instead of the preponderance standard normally required for misconduct removals under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c), and by preventing any mitigation of a penalty that substantial evidence supports, &#x00A7; 714 affects employees' substantive rights to relief from improper removal. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B) (setting forth the evidentiary standard for Board appeals of adverse actions not under chapter 43 to require "support[ ] by a preponderance of the evidence"), <span class="Italic">with</span> &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(A)-(B) (applying the substantial evidence standard for Board appeals of &#x00A7; 714 adverse actions).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When a statute "change[s] standards of proof and persuasion in a way favorable to a State, the statute goes beyond 'mere' procedure to affect substantive entitlement to relief." <span class="Italic">Lindh v. Murphy</span>, 521 U.S. 320, 327 (1997); <span class="Italic">see also United States v. $814,254.76 in U.S. Currency, Contents of Valley Nat. Bank Account No. 1500-8339</span>, 51 F.3d 207, 212 (9th Cir. 1995) (holding a statute that "effectively permits the Government to achieve the identical results available under the criminal forfeiture statute, but with a lower standard of proof" to have impermissible retroactive effect if applied retrospectively). And the Supreme Court has held the loss of "reasonable reliance on the continued availability of discretionary relief" akin to penalty mitigation to have an impermissible retroactive effect. <span class="Italic">St. Cyr</span>, 533 U.S. at 324-25 ("There is a clear difference, for the purposes of retroactivity analysis, between facing possible [removal] and facing certain [removal]."). The imposition of a penalty supported only by substantial evidence, instead of preponderant evidence, with no possibility of mitigation for an error in judgment by the VA, rises to the level of substantive impact. Under &#x00A7; 714, Dr. Sayers can be held responsible for alleged misconduct even if his culpability for that misconduct goes against the weight of the evidence. He can be divested of his property right in continued employment even if that consequence goes against the weight of the evidence. He then loses any possibility of the Board giving him discretionary relief from the penalty imposed for that adverse action, even if he presents compelling reasons for such mitigation. Those changes in proof, persuasion, and the availability of discretionary penalty mitigation from the prior chapter 75 standard to the current &#x00A7; 714 procedure unquestionably diminish Dr. Sayers's property right in continued employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This retroactive effect occurs despite the VA's protestation that it did not propose Dr. Sayers's removal until after the passage of &#x00A7; 714. Section 714's impermissible retroactive effect on Dr. Sayers's substantive employment right is not eliminated by the prospective application of &#x00A7; 714's <span class="Italic">procedures</span>. Dr. Sayers had a right to the substantive civil service protections from improper or unjustified removal in effect at the time of his alleged misconduct. These protections were a condition of his employment, and they remained terms of his employment until Congress altered those conditions with the passage of &#x00A7; 714--at which point, Dr. Sayers had the chance to reconsider whether he would accept those terms to govern his employment going forward.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor can we agree with the VA's assertion that finding &#x00A7; 714 impermissibly retroactive gives Dr. Sayers "a vested right to engage in poor performance and misconduct yet retain his job." Such an argument overlooks that the VA always had the ability to remove Dr. Sayers for misconduct or poor performance. Likewise, the VA's arguments ignore that allegations of <span id="Page_301"></span>defective performance or misconduct may sometimes be incorrect or pretextual, and that the system of civil service protections exists in part to prevent the loss of employment due to such faulty allegations. Dr. Sayers is entitled to the legal protections in place during the period in which the alleged misconduct occurred because Congress did not provide a clear statement that it intended to modify retroactively VA employees' rights to those protections.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Department of Veterans Affairs cannot remove Dr. Sayers under &#x00A7; 714 without the statute having impermissible retroactive effect, we vacate Dr. Sayers's removal and remand to the Merit Systems Protection Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sayers</span> led to reversal of a removal in <span class="Italic">Wilson v. VA</span>, 2022 MSPB 7, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 27-33 (2022), because 38 USC 714 was not retroactive. <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> determined that the proposal and decision did not distinguish between misconduct occurring before and after the effective date of the VA Accountability Act, June 23, 2017:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the administrative judge issued the initial decision in the instant appeal, the Federal Circuit issued its opinion in <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>, 954 F.3d 1370. In that case, the agency had removed Dr. Sayers from his Chief Pharmacist position under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 for conduct that took place before the law's enactment. <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>, 954 F.3d at 1372-73. Because Congress did not express any intent as to whether the VA Accountability Act applied to preenactment conduct, the court in <span class="Italic">Sayers</span> examined whether the Act had an impermissible retroactive effect, i.e., whether it "would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed," (quoting <span class="Italic">Landgraf v. USI Film Products</span>, 511 U.S. 244, 280 (1994)), and concluded that it did. <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>, 954 F.3d at 1380-82.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court compared 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 to the existing authorities for taking adverse actions against tenured Federal employees under chapters 43 and 75 of title 5. <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>, 954 F.3d at 1374-79. It determined that the VA Accountability Act introduced "an expedited, less rigorous alternative" to the two prior authorities, did not provide the type of procedural protections for employees as those required for chapter 43 performance-based actions, lowered the agency's burden of proof, and disallowed penalty mitigation for what would otherwise be chapter 75 actions based on conduct or performance.[8] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1374-76, 1378-79. The court held that the VA Accountability Act's lowered substantial evidence standard of proof and elimination of the Board's authority to mitigate the penalty detrimentally affected Dr. Sayers's property right to continued employment and "substantive rights to relief from improper removal." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1372 n.1, 1374, 1380-81. The court reasoned that Dr. Sayers "had a right to the substantive civil service protections from improper or unjustified removal in effect at the time of his alleged misconduct," and that those protections remained terms of his employment until Congress altered those terms when it passed the VA Accountability Act. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1381.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as in <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>, the agency demoted the appellant under the VA Accountability Act for conduct by the appellant that predated its June 23, 2017 enactment. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 115-41, 131 Stat. 862. In removing the appellant for neglect of duty, the proposing and deciding officials relied on a "steady decline" in the SPS, ending with the July 2017 site visit by NPOSP. The agency did not identify the period of this decline. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 35, 48-49, 72. However, both below and on review it relied on testimony and evidence of deficiencies by the appellant's subordinates beginning as early as December 2016.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered whether it is possible to sustain the agency's action solely based on any alleged post-June 23, 2017 neglect of duty by the appellant. In <span class="Italic">Boss v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 908 F.3d 1278, 1279, 1282-83 (Fed.

However, even assuming that we could similarly separate the specifications of the same charge using this reasoning, we find it inappropriate to do so here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, the agency's charge is based on the "steady decline" in the SPS based on errors of the appellant's subordinates over a period spanning at least 8 months. Only 1 of these months fell after the enactment of the VA Accountability Act.

Instead, the underlying alleged instances of misconduct by the appellant's subordinates "are so factually interrelated that they cannot be fairly separated." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit addressed a similar situation in <span class="Italic">Brenner v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 990 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor analysis in a VA case was touched on in <span class="Italic">Rodriguez, supra. Connor v. VA</span>, 8 F.4th 1319, 1325-27 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (Judge Newman concurring in part and dissenting in part), confirmed the requirement that VA deciding and the Board officials consider <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors (and the court concluded that responsibility was met):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government argues that because &#x00A7; 714 does not allow the Board to mitigate penalties, the VA is no longer required to consider the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors when removing, demoting, or suspending a VA employee pursuant to &#x00A7; 714; and that the Board too is not required to consider the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. In the government's view, the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors emanated from the Board's mitigation authority, and the elimination of the mitigation authority eliminated the need to apply the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in VA disciplinary actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no basis for the government's argument that the statutory ban on penalty mitigation by the Board eliminated the obligation to consider and apply the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. Before the enactment of &#x00A7; 714, the Board, and this court, had long recognized the difference between review of the penalty imposed and mitigation of the penalty. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Archuleta v. Hopper</span>, 786 F.3d 1340, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (noting Board's "jurisdiction to assess whether the penalty was appropriate" and "authority to mitigate" the penalty); <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 147 F.3d 1367, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (distinguishing between the Board's analysis of whether a penalty was justified from the subsequent decision of whether to mitigate the penalty).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Douglas</span> itself distinguished between the Board's authority to review agency actions, provided by statute, and its authority to mitigate penalties, "inherited" from its predecessor, the Civil Service Commission. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 M.S.P.B. at 316, 326; <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 323 (contrasting the Board's authority to mitigate penalties with remand "to the employing agency for selection and imposition of a new penalty"). Thus, the government is mistaken in asserting that "the Board's authority to review penalties was derived from the Board's...robust mitigation authority inherited from the [Civil Service] Commission." As this court and the Board have long understood, the Board's authority to review an agency disciplinary action, including the chosen penalty, is established by statute, viz., 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701 (and, now, &#x00A7; 714 itself); it is quite distinct from the Board's preexisting authority to mitigate an agency's penalty, which &#x00A7; 714 eliminated in VA disciplinary actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We explained in <span class="Italic">Sayers v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 954 F.3d 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2020), that while &#x00A7; 714 bars the Board from mitigating a penalty, mitigation "stands apart" from review of "the totality of the adverse <span id="Page_302"></span>action decision," which necessarily encompasses the choice of penalty in the first instance. <span class="Italic">See</span> 954 F.3d at 1376 (citing &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(B), (3)(C)). Thus, surveying the text and legislative history of &#x00A7; 714, applying "basic precepts of administrative law and judicial review," and considering "the historical practice of reviewing the penalty in adverse action decisions"--and repeatedly citing <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> with approval--we concluded that "&#x00A7; 714 requires the Board to review for substantial evidence the entirety of the VA's removal decision--including the penalty." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1375-79. We reiterated this holding in <span class="Italic">Brenner v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 990 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2021), explaining that the Board's review of a VA disciplinary action must include consideration of whether the chosen penalty is reasonable. 990 F.3d at 1323 (citing <span class="Italic">Harrington v. Dep't of Veterans Affs</span>., 981 F.3d 1356, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2020)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we affirmed the Board's authority to review penalties, as distinct from mitigation, we did not in <span class="Italic">Sayers or Brenner</span> address the continued relevance of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. We now conclude that &#x00A7; 714 did not alter preexisting law, which required the VA and the Board to apply the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors to the selection and review of penalties in VA disciplinary actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By its terms, &#x00A7; 714 provides that administrative judges and the Board "shall uphold the decision of the Secretary to remove, demote, or suspend an employee," and "shall not mitigate the penalty prescribed by the Secretary," if the Secretary's decision "is supported by substantial evidence." &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)-(3). Nowhere, however, does &#x00A7; 714--or the act in which it was created--mention the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, or suggest that the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors are excluded from the scope of review. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> &#x00A7; 714; Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017, Pub. L. No. 115-41, 131 Stat. 862. Nor does the legislative history evince any intent to displace the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in VA disciplinary actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, &#x00A7; 714 precludes the Board only from <span class="Italic">mitigating</span> the agency's chosen penalty. <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>, 954 F.3d at 1376. It does not alter the penalty review with respect to the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. Before the enactment of &#x00A7; 714, such review included an evaluation of whether the penalty was reasonable in light of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. Section 714 did not change this standard, and the VA and Board must continue to apply the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in considering the reasonableness of the penalty in VA disciplinary action cases. Absent mitigation authority, however, if the Board determines that the VA failed to consider the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors or that the chosen penalty is unreasonable, the Board must remand to the VA for a redetermination of the penalty. <span class="Italic">See Brenner</span>, 990 F.3d at 1325 (explaining that, because the Board cannot mitigate or independently set penalties, "if the [Board] concludes that the VA's removal decision is unsupported by substantial evidence, the [Board] should remand to the VA for further proceedings").</p>

Cir. 2021), determined that the deciding official in an action under 38 USC 714 must determine the disputed facts, that is, the official must decide whether to uphold charges in the proposal, based on preponderant rather than substantial evidence. Contrary internal VA guidance was incorrect. The court did not suggest how a deciding official was to meaningfully articulate, other than through incantation of a legal term, the distinction between substantial and preponderant evidence (a requirement not imposed on deciding officials in typical Chapter 75 adverse actions):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the administrative judge addressed two procedural arguments made by Mr. Rodriguez. First, Mr. Rodriguez argued that the DVA had misapplied section 714 by concluding that the statute authorized the DVA to discipline an employee as long as substantial evidence supports a finding of misconduct. While recognizing that the substantial evidence standard governs the Board's review of the DVA's actions under section 714, Mr. Rodriguez pointed out that the statute requires that the DVA itself must "determine[ ] the performance or misconduct of the covered individual warrants...removal, demotion or suspension." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(a)(1). That standard, Mr. Rodriguez argued, requires the DVA to find that the misconduct in question was proved by at least a preponderance of the evidence. The administrative judge rejected that argument and concluded instead that the DVA was entitled to apply the "substantial evidence" test in deciding to remove an employee, "the same evidentiary standard...as pertains to the Board in adjudicating such appeals."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first address Mr. Rodriguez's argument that the administrative judge misinterpreted 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 when he ruled that "substantial evidence" is the proper standard for the DVA to apply in determining whether an employee has engaged in misconduct that justifies discipline. On that issue, we agree with Mr. Rodriguez.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 714 was enacted in 2017 to provide an expedited set of procedures by which the Secretary of Veterans Affairs may remove, demote, or suspend DVA employees "if the Secretary determines the performance or misconduct of the covered individual" warrants such measures. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(a)(1); <span class="Italic">see Brenner v. Dep't of Veterans Affs</span>., 990 F.3d 1313, 1317-18 (Fed. Cir. 2021).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 714 made several changes to the procedures previously applied in disciplinary actions taken against DVA employees. First, section 714 provides for expedited review of disciplinary actions covered by the statute. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(d)(1), (d)(4). Second, it provides that on any appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, the administrative judge and the Board will review the Secretary's action under the "substantial evidence" standard; in cases covered by section 714, the DVA is not required to prove its case before the Board by a preponderance of the evidence, as is the case for employee disciplinary actions brought under chapter 75 of Title 5. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(A), (d)(3)(B), with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513, 7701(c)(1)(B).2 Third, section 714 removes from the Board's administrative judges and the Board itself the authority to mitigate the penalties imposed by the Secretary. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(B), (d)(3)(C); <span class="Italic">see Sayers v. Dep't of Veterans Affs</span>., 954 F.3d 1370, 1374-76 (Fed. Cir. 2020).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government argues that the references to "substantial evidence" in section 714 are not limited to the standard of review to be employed by administrative judges and the Board in reviewing section 714 disciplinary decisions. Instead, the government contends that the "substantial evidence" standard also defines the burden of proof for the agency to make those disciplinary decisions in the first instance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The DVA has taken that position not only in litigation, but also in its internal guidance governing employee disciplinary matters. In a publication dated June 27, 2017, the DVA stated that for actions taken under section 714, "Substantial Evidence is the Standard of Proof," and that "'Substantial Evidence' means relevant evidence that a reasonable person, considering the record as a whole, might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even though other reasonable persons might disagree, or evidence that a reasonable mind would accept as adequate to support a conclusion." DVA, Human Resources Management Letter No. 05-17-06, &#x00A7; 6.gg-hh, <span class="Italic">available at</span> <a href="https://www.afge.org/contentassets/a91c998d3be44362a75c5c67c60852f7/full-policy-document-s.-1094-implementation.pdf">https://www.afge.org/contentassets/a91c998d3be44362a75c5c67c60852f7/full-policy-document-s.-1094-implementation.pdf</a>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the deciding official, Ms. Klinker, appears to have applied the "substantial evidence" standard when resolving the disputed facts and selecting a penalty. Although she did not discuss the appropriate standard of proof in any detail, she stated that she had found that all three charges against Mr. Rodriguez "were supported by substantial evidence."[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In a vacuum, it might be possible to interpret the deciding official's statement that the charges against Mr. Rodriguez were supported by "substantial evidence" to mean, in the lay sense of that term, that the charges were supported by a great deal of evidence. The problem, however, is that the DVA has made quite clear in its Human Resources Management Letter No. 05-17-06 that it considers the proper burden of proof in section 714 cases to be "substantial evidence" and that it uses that term in its legal sense to mean evidence that a reasonable person might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. In light of that explicit endorsement of the "substantial evidence" test as the burden of proof, it would be pure speculation to suppose that the deciding official used that term in a lay sense to mean something entirely different.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge was more explicit in finding that "substantial evidence" is the appropriate standard of proof for the DVA to employ under section 714. As noted, the administrative judge observed that section 714 had changed the standard of review for administrative judges and the Board in cases covered by that statute from a preponderance of the evidence to substantial evidence. The administrative judge concluded that there was no reason to require a different standard from the agency when making its initial disciplinary determination. On appeal to this court, the government defends the administrative judge's determination that substantial evidence is the appropriate standard of proof for the DVA to apply in employee disciplinary actions instituted under section 714.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree. The references to "substantial evidence" in section 714 are all explicitly directed to the standard of review to be applied by administrative judges and the Board. Those references do not address <span id="Page_303"></span>the standard of proof to be applied by the DVA in making disciplinary determinations, nor does the remaining text of section 714 explicitly address the standard of proof in proceedings before the DVA. There is therefore no force to the government's reliance on the plain language of section 714 to support its argument that substantial evidence is the proper standard of proof for the DVA to apply in disciplinary actions governed by that statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the contrary, the language of section 714 implies that the proper standard is the preponderance of the evidence. Section 714 provides that an employee may be removed, demoted, or suspended "if the Secretary determines the performance or misconduct of the covered individual warrants" such action. In the case of a disciplinary action based on misconduct, the requirement that the Secretary "determine[ ]" that the misconduct in question warrants disciplinary action implies that the Secretary must find that it is likely, i.e., more likely than not, that the employee has engaged in the misconduct that justifies the proposed discipline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More fundamentally, the government's argument is inconsistent with the well-established distinction between a burden of proof and a standard of review. "Preponderance of the evidence" is a burden of proof, while "substantial evidence" is a standard of review. As explained by Professor Jaffe in a frequently cited article, the argument that "substantial evidence" is appropriate for use as a burden of proof "merges the function of factfinder with that of reviewing court: it argues that the factfinder is to find for the Government if he concludes that this finding should not be reversed by a court. But that is not the task of the factfinder, nor is it the attitude that he is to take toward his task." Louis L. Jaffe, <span class="Italic">Administrative Law: Burden of Proof and Scope of Review</span>, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 914, 915 (1966).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Preponderance of the evidence has long been recognized as the traditional burden of proof in civil administrative proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Herman &#x0026; MacLean v. Huddleston</span>, 459 U.S. 375, 389-90 (1983) (preponderance of the evidence is the normal burden of proof in civil proceedings); <span class="Italic">Steadman v. SEC</span>, 450 U.S. 91, 101 n.21 (1981) ("The use of the 'preponderance of evidence' standard is the traditional standard in civil and administrative proceedings." (quoting <span class="Italic">Sea Island Broad. Corp. of S.C. v. FCC</span>, 627 F.2d 240, 243 (D.C. Cir. 1980))).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Charlton v. FTC</span>, 543 F.2d 903 (D.C. Cir. 1976), the court addressed an issue similar to the one before us and held that "substantial evidence" is not the proper burden of proof in a disciplinary proceeding before an agency. In that case, the FTC had determined that the appropriate burden of proof in a disciplinary action was substantial evidence. The court firmly rejected that view. Describing substantial evidence as "a totally incorrect standard of proof in passing on Charlton's blameworthiness," the court ruled that the agency "faltered grievously" in holding that its decision on a disciplinary action could be based on substantial evidence rather than a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 906-07.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Charlton</span> court explained that on judicial review of agency action, administrative findings must be sustained when supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole, but "that rule implicates only the reviewing court; the yardstick by which the agency itself is to initially ascertain the facts is something else again....[I]n American law a preponderance of the evidence is rock bottom at the factfinding level of civil litigation. Nowhere in our jurisprudence have we discerned acceptance of a standard of proof tolerating 'something less than the weight of the evidence.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 907 (footnote omitted); <span class="Italic">see also SSIH Equip. S.A. v. U.S. Int'l Trade Comm'n</span>, 718 F.2d 365, 379-83 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (Nies, J., concurring).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In arguing that "substantial evidence" is the proper burden of proof for the DVA to apply in making disciplinary determinations in section 714 cases, the government relies on a footnote in <span class="Italic">Sayers v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 954 F.3d 1370, 1374 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2020). In that footnote we observed, correctly, that "nothing in [section 714] compels the VA to apply a substantial evidence standard for removal rather than a preponderance standard." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In <span class="Italic">dictum</span>, we then added that "nothing [in the statute] prevents the VA from doing so," and that because the statute "leaves the proper standard to the VA's discretion, the VA did not err by choosing substantial evidence review." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent the government argues that we are bound by Sayers's suggestion that the DVA is free to apply substantial evidence as the burden of proof in section 714 cases, we disagree. The footnote containing that suggestion is <span class="Italic">dictum</span>, as it was not necessary to our analysis of section 714 and our conclusion that the statute could not be applied retroactively to Dr. Sayers. <span class="Italic">See Sayers</span>, 954 F.3d at 1382.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are strong reasons that section 714 should not be interpreted to endorse the use of substantial evidence as a burden of proof. To adopt substantial evidence as the applicable burden of proof in section 714 disciplinary cases would mean that the deciding official would be required to find that the employee had engaged in the charged misconduct as long as substantial evidence supports the charge, i.e., as long as a reasonable person might accept the evidence as adequate to support that conclusion. That is to say, the deciding official could (indeed, would be required to) find against the employee with regard to the charged misconduct even though the deciding official did not personally agree with that conclusion. That scenario would be at odds with the requirement that the deciding official, as the delegee of the Secretary, "determine" that the employee engaged in the misconduct justifying discipline, as required by section 714. It would also be contrary to the traditional principle that in order for an agency to take disciplinary action against an individual based on predicate facts, it must find those facts; absent clear authority to the contrary, it is not enough for an agency to conclude merely that a reasonable person could make such a finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During oral argument, the government responded to questions on this point by saying, essentially, that it was unrealistic to suppose that a deciding official would impose punishment when the official did not conclude that it was more likely than not that the employee had committed the charged misconduct. In effect, the government argued that the distinction between the preponderance test and the substantial evidence test is inconsequential in this context.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The problem with the government's argument is that if there is no meaningful difference in practice between the preponderance test and the substantial evidence test, then there is no reason for the government to object to the use of preponderance of the evidence as the burden of proof in section 714 cases. On the other hand, if there is a meaningful difference between the two, then that difference would surface in the setting in which the deciding official did not believe the misconduct had occurred, or was unsure whether it had been proved, but believed that a reasonable person could have found that the misconduct took place. In that setting, we conclude that using substantial evidence as the burden of proof would not only violate the terms of section 714, but would be contrary to the well-established principle that preponderance of the evidence is the minimal appropriate burden of proof in administrative proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There may be exceptional circumstances in which a lower burden of proof than preponderance of the evidence could legitimately be applied. Examples might include cases in which the issue is whether a person should be given a top-secret clearance despite serious concerns about the person's background. But those circumstances would be rare and would typically require an explicit directive to use a burden of proof lower than preponderance in order to justify departing from the traditional standard. Section 714 does not present such unusual circumstances, and it does not contain any language stating explicitly, or even implicitly, that the burden of proof in disciplinary actions should be substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official in this case characterized "substantial evidence" as the applicable burden of proof. And it is clear that the administrative judge approved of the agency's use of substantial evidence as the burden of proof, because the administrative judge concluded that the level of proof required of the agency should be the same as the standard of review by the Board. We therefore reverse the administrative judge's ruling on the burden of proof issue and remand for further proceedings on that issue. Presumably those further proceedings will include requiring the DVA's deciding official to determine whether the evidence as to each of the charges against Mr. Rodriguez satisfied the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof.</p>

Because the deciding official used the incorrect standard of proof in reaching the final decision here, we vacate the Board's decision as to the underlying suspension and remand to the Board for further proceedings under the correct legal standard.

Specifically, as relevant here, section 714 provides that on appeal to the Board, "the administrative judge shall uphold" a decision by the VA "to remove, demote, or suspend an employee under subsection (a) if the decision is supported by substantial evidence," &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(A), and that the administrative judge and the Board "shall not mitigate the penalty prescribed" by the VA, &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)-(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These changes prompted litigation in our court concerning (1) whether section 714 permits the <span class="Italic">agency</span> to apply a "substantial evidence" standard of proof in making disciplinary decisions in the first instance, and (2) whether under section 714 the agency and the Board need not consider the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. In August 2021, in <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, our court answered the former question, holding that "substantial evidence may not be used as the standard of proof in disciplinary actions under section 714." 8 F.4th 1290, 1303 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Rather, under section 714, "preponderance of the evidence is the minimal appropriate burden of proof" as to whether the alleged "misconduct had occurred." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1301. Our court explained that the references to "substantial evidence" in section 714 "are all explicitly directed to the standard of review to be applied by administrative judges and the Board." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1298. Also in August 2021, in <span class="Italic">Connor v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, our court answered the latter question, holding that "[section] 714 did not alter preexisting law, which required the VA and the Board to apply the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors to the selection and review of penalties in VA disciplinary actions." 8 F.4th 1319, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2021). In other words, "the VA and Board must continue to apply the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in considering the reasonableness of the penalty." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The earliest decision of consequence from the Federal Circuit reviewing 38 USC 714 found no infirmity in the Board's decision, noting that both VA and the Board implicitly considered factors pertinent to a penalty determination (a harmless error approach), while the court implied that unbending application of a no-mitigation policy might prove of constitutional concern, but postponing treatment of that concern to another day and appeal (<span class="Italic">Sayers</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>), <span class="Italic">Mogil v. VA</span>, <span class="blue">769 Fed. Appx. 920</span>, 920-24 (Fed. Cir. 2019 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Mogil served as an engineering technician at the VA Medical Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota from 2008 to 2017. In this role, he was responsible for development, design, and implementation of VA engineering and maintenance projects, including new construction, renovation, and equipment replacement and service. Around November 2016, he began sharing an office with Tony Horacek. Their office had three light fixtures controlled by two switches. They had an ongoing dispute over whether the lights should remain on or off in their office. Mr. Mogil requested that all the lights remain on, but Mr. Horacek wanted one or two of the light fixtures off because the lights caused a glare on his computer screen and were uncomfortable on his eyes. Mr. Mogil's manager, Catherine Joyce, twice offered for him to move to a cubicle in an adjoining room, but he declined. The two initially agreed that Mr. Horacek could adjust the lights when Mr. Mogil was not in the office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Around June 2017, Mr. Mogil indicated to Mr. Horacek that he wanted all three lights on all the time, even when he left the office. On separate occasions, Mr. Mogil placed painter's tape over the light switch and welded a metal plate over the light switch to try to make sure the lights stayed on, but each time Mr. Horacek removed these items and turned the lights off when Mr. Mogil left the office. Mr. Mogil asked his supervisor multiple times to intervene, and his supervisor eventually told them to leave the lights on and get along. The day after, Mr. Mogil left the office, and when he returned he discovered that Mr. Horacek had turned the lights off. He "snapped," retrieved a hammer from the facility's electrical shop, and smashed the light switch with the hammer, which permanently disabled the lighting in his office and disrupted the lighting in nearby rooms.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Steve Challeen, Mr. Mogil's second-level supervisor, proposed removing him pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 for damaging government property. Mr. Mogil provided written and oral responses to Patrick Kelley, the Medical Director of the Medical Center and deciding official, noting the steps he took to resolve the situation prior to destroying the light switch. He also stated that he regretted his actions and apologized. The VA removed him for damaging government property.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Mogil appealed his removal to the Board. The administrative judge ("AJ") issued an initial decision affirming his removal. That decision became the final decision of the Board pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.113, and Mr. Mogil timely petitioned this court for review. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1)(A) and 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 (the "Act"), employees of the VA were removed for misconduct pursuant to the procedures specified in Chapter 75 of Title 5, which applies to federal employees generally. This appeal raises questions about how the Act impacts such removals, specifically with regard to whether the Board may review the reasonableness of the penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In general, federal employees can be removed for misconduct "only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512-13(a). On appeal to the Board, the agency's "decision" is sustained if "supported by a preponderance of the evidence." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B). The Board has held that this standard applies to the agency's burden in proving the misconduct and the agency's decision to impose the particular penalty, to the extent that decision rests upon considerations of fact. <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 296-97 (1981). In <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, the Board also held that "the appropriateness of a penalty, while depending upon resolution of questions of fact" also involves "the application of administrative judgment and discretion." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 297. The Board laid out factors for the agency to consider in determining the appropriateness of a penalty. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 305-06. While it is "the agency's exclusive domain in disciplining its employees," <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246, 1258 (Fed. Cir. 1999), the Board has "the authority to review the agency's penalty determination using the [<span class="Italic">Douglas</span>] factors," <span class="Italic">Archuleta v. Hopper</span>, 786 F.3d 1340, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2015); <span class="Italic">see also Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 306 (holding that the Board reviews whether the agency "conscientiously consider[ed] the relevant factors" and "str[uck] a responsible balance within tolerable limits of reasonableness"). The Board must sustain the agency's removal decision if it determines the agency proved by preponderant evidence that the charged conduct occurred, there is a nexus between that conduct and the efficiency of the service, and removal was reasonable in light of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. <span class="Italic">Malloy v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 578 F.3d 1351, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When reviewing a removal decision pursuant to Chapter 75 of Title 5, the Board has the authority to mitigate the selected penalty if it determines that the penalty is unreasonable. <span class="Italic">Lachance</span>, 178 F.3d at 1260. If the Board sustains all of the agency's charges, it may mitigate to the "maximum reasonable penalty" when it finds the selected penalty too severe. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If it sustains fewer than all of the charges, it may mitigate to the "maximum reasonable penalty" as long as the agency has not indicated that it desires a lesser penalty. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Act made several changes regarding actions against VA employees, including giving the VA Secretary more discretion to remove an employee, heightening the deference the Board gives to the removal decision, and removing the Board's ability to mitigate the penalty imposed when the decision is supported by substantial evidence. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714. The Secretary may remove a VA employee "if the Secretary determines the performance or misconduct of the [employee] warrants such removal...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 714(a)(1). On appeal to the Board, if the "decision" is supported by substantial evidence, "the administrative judge shall uphold" the removal decision and "shall not mitigate the penalty prescribed by the Secretary." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(A)-(B). The parties dispute the effect these changes have on the Board's ability to review a penalty's reasonableness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VA's removal decision states that a <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor analysis was not required and &#x00A7; 714 only requires that substantial evidence show that the misconduct occurred. The Board likewise held that because &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(B) eliminated the Board's ability to mitigate the penalty, "the reasonableness of the agency's imposed penalty, along with a consideration of mitigating and aggravating factors under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>...is immaterial." It concluded that because substantial evidence supports the misconduct charge, "the agency's removal penalty must be affirmed." J.A. 16 (citing 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(B)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Mogil acknowledges that &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(B) eliminated the Board's ability to mitigate the penalty if the decision is supported by substantial evidence. He argues, however, that &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(A)'s requirement that the Board determine whether "the decision of the Secretary to remove...an employee under subsection (a) is supported by substantial evidence," includes whether substantial evidence supports the reasonableness of the penalty. He argues the fact that the Board can no longer mitigate the penalty does not excuse the agency from considering the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors before arriving at a decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VA disagrees, emphasizing that the Act was intended to make it quicker and easier to remove VA employees. Under the VA's interpretation, the Board can only review whether substantial evidence supports the VA's finding that the misconduct occurred. The VA argues that because the Board can no longer mitigate the penalty and &#x00A7; 714 eliminated the efficiency-of-the-service requirement, the Board no longer reviews whether a penalty is reasonable and a <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor analysis is irrelevant. It argues that requiring a <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor analysis before removing an employee would undermine the purpose of &#x00A7; 714, which was to simplify and expedite the removal process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VA views &#x00A7; 714 as giving the Secretary essentially unfettered discretion to remove an employee for any reason, no matter how minor, provided substantial evidence shows that the employee committed the charged misconduct. If, for example, an employee was caught improperly using a paper clip purchased by the government for personal <span id="Page_305"></span>use, the Secretary could determine that conduct warrants removal, even if the employee up to that point received perfect evaluations and had a spotless disciplinary record. Under the VA's interpretation, the Board would have no authority to hold this penalty unreasonable and remand to the VA for a new penalty assessment. Such an interpretation would be a dramatic shift in how the Board reviews adverse actions against other federal employees and does not necessarily flow from the elimination of the Board's ability to mitigate a penalty. As to employees hired prior to the Act, the VA's interpretation also raises potential constitutional concerns with regard to the Takings Clause and Due Process Clause. <span class="Italic">See Stone v. Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp</span>., 179 F.3d 1368, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (holding that &#x00A7; 7513(a) created a property interest in continued employment "unless the agency could show [the employee] needed to be removed for cause or unacceptable performance"). We need not consider, however, whether the VA's interpretation is proper here because any error in interpreting &#x00A7; 714 was harmless.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that Mr. Mogil intentionally destroyed government property. He only argues on appeal that removal was unreasonable. Assuming, without deciding, that we may review the VA's penalty selection as we can the penalties imposed on federal employees generally, our review "is highly deferential," and penalties are considered reasonable unless "grossly disproportionate to the offense charged." <span class="Italic">Farrell</span>, 314 F.3d at 594 (internal quotation marks omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Webster v. Dep't of Army</span>, 911 F.2d 679, 686 (Fed. Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The removal decision adequately explains the VA's determination that removal was appropriate. It states that Mr. Mogil's position "carries great responsibility" and entrusts him "to manage millions of dollars of allocated taxpayer funds" and that his actions show he can no longer be trusted to carry out his responsibilities professionally. It states that destroying government property in response to an officemate turning the lights off "is never an acceptable response to an interpersonal disagreement." It states that the VA considered the fact that he was seeing a counselor and that he apologized and expressed remorse, but nonetheless found that removal was reasonable and warranted given the nature of the actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Board states that "the reasonableness of the agency's imposed penalty, along with a consideration of mitigating and aggravating factors" is "immaterial," it nonetheless considered such evidence in upholding the removal decision. It addresses his supervisor Ms. Joyce's testimony that she was not informed of the dispute and that she lost confidence in Mr. Mogil's ability to continue his job after his actions. It found the deciding official credibly testified that he considered the entire evidentiary file and mitigating factors before selecting the penalty of removal. It also noted that "[t]he table of penalties includes the discipline of removal for a first offense of intentional damage to government property."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Mogil argues that the agency should have been required to perform a full analysis under the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. But he fails to show how such an analysis would have changed the outcome. He argues only that the VA failed to consider the actions he took to resolve the dispute over the lights prior to destroying the light switch and the remorse he felt after doing so. He also blames his actions on a failure of his supervisor to take action. He argues that because the deciding official was not presented with these facts in the letter of proposed removal, the Board should have reassessed his removal in light of the correct facts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The removal decision contradicts his contentions. The decision notes Mr. Mogil's oral and written replies including that he asked Mr. Horacek several times to keep the lights on, that he spoke to his acting supervisor about the issue, and that he attempted to ensure the lights would remain on by putting tape over the switch and welding a metal plate over the switch. It states that this information was "carefully considered" prior to determining that removal was reasonable and warranted. And as the Board noted, the deciding official testified to the Board that he considered mitigation evidence before deciding that removal was appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have previously noted, "neither statute nor regulation <span class="Italic">requires</span> an agency to demonstrate that it considered all mitigating factors," and "[w]hether the guidelines established in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> were followed is but one factor to be noticed in our review." <span class="Italic">Nagel v. Dep't of Health and Human Servs</span>., 707 F.2d 1384, 1386-87 (Fed. Cir. 1983). We held in <span class="Italic">Nagel</span> that under the same standard of review it was not reversible error for the Board to discuss "only those factors listed in the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> case it deemed relevant." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. On appeal, Mr. Mogil has not pointed us to any <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor that the agency did not consider and that would have been relevant in selecting a penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given that Mr. Mogil acknowledges he intentionally destroyed government property and the agency's consideration of the relevant evidence before determining that removal was appropriate, we do not think the agency action here was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. We leave for another day the statutory interpretation issue with constitutional implications.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brenner v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210309172">990 F.3d 1313</a>, 1323-27 (Fed. Cir. 2021), noted that performance-based removals under 38 USC 714 do not follow the structure (required improvement period) established by Chapter 43 (discussed in Chapter 9). Following <span class="Italic">Sayers, supra, Brenner</span> determined that the statute did not apply to performance issues predating the statute and the court remanded the appeal for the Board's consideration of mitigation of the removal penalty to the extent it relied on performance issues postdating the statute:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>, we held that "[38 U.S.C.] &#x00A7; 714 requires the [MSPB] to review whether the Secretary had substantial evidence for his decision that an employee's actions warranted the adverse action." <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>, 954 F.3d. at 1375; see 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(A) ("[T]he administrative judge shall uphold the <span class="Italic">decision</span> of the Secretary <span class="Italic">to remove, demote, or suspend an employee</span> under [38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(a)] if the decision is supported by substantial evidence.") (emphases added). We explained that the MSPB "cannot meaningfully review th[e VA's] decision if it blinds itself to the VA's choice of action," as review of a "decision" encompasses not just its facts, but also the "decision to impose a certain penalty" based on those facts. <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>, 954 F.3d. at 1375 (citation omitted). We reasoned that "[i]n the absence of a clearer statement than [38 U.S.C.] &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(B), which prohibits the [MSPB] from <span class="Italic">mitigating</span> a penalty supported by substantial evidence, we should not presume the prohibition of all review of the penalty to ensure its legality." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1376 (emphases in original); <span class="Italic">see Lindahl v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 470 U.S. 768, 778 (1985) ("We have often noted that only upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence of a contrary legislative intent should the courts restrict access to judicial review." (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, the Act encompasses MSPB review of an agency's action for accordance with law, including whether the Secretary's "final decision with respect to a removal, demotion, or suspension under [38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714]" provides "specific reasons" for the chosen penalty. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(c)(2); <span class="Italic">see id</span>. &#x00A7; 714(d)(1) (providing for "[e]xpedited review" by "the administrative judge" and MSPB "under [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(1)]"); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(C) (providing that, "[n]otwithstanding" whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence, "the agency's decision may not be sustained" by the MSPB, if "the decision was not in accordance with law"). Further, the Act expressly provides that this court review the agency action for accordance with law, abuse of discretion, and arbitrary and capricious decision making. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(d)(5)(A) (providing for appeal of "a decision of the [MSPB]" to "the [U.S.] Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit pursuant to [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;] 7703"); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c) (providing that the "Federal Circuit...shall review the record and hold unlawful and set aside any agency action, findings, or conclusions found to be," <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law"). An agency abuses its discretion where, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "the decision...represents an unreasonable judgment in weighing relevant factors." <span class="Italic">Star Fruits S.N.C. v. United States</span>, 393 F.3d 1277, 1281 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">see Robinson v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 923 F.3d 1004, 1016-17 (Fed. Cir. 2019) ("We will defer to the judgment of the agency regarding the penalty unless it appears totally unwarranted in the circumstances such that it constitutes an abuse of discretion." (internal quotation marks, alterations, and citation omitted)). A decision is arbitrary and capricious where the agency fails to articulate a "rational connection between the facts found and the choice made." <span class="Italic">Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co</span>., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting <span class="Italic">Burlington Truck Lines v. United States</span>, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)). Therefore, "[t]he plain meaning of [38 U.S.C.] &#x00A7; 714, when considered in its entirety, conveys that when determining whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence, the [MSPB] (or administrative judge) must necessarily consider the agency's penalty choice as part of that review." <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>, 954 F.3d at 1376 (internal quotation marks omitted); <span class="Italic">see Harrington</span>, 981 F.3d at 1358 (similar).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, <span class="Italic">Sayers's</span> understanding of the Act is consistent with Congressional intent, balancing "the overall intent of the Act" to "make it easier and faster for the VA to penalize employees <span class="Italic">for</span> misconduct" while "maintain[ing] due process protections for employees, including the opportunity to appeal the Secretary's removal decision." <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>, 954 F.3d at 1376-77 (citing 163 CONG. REC. S3268-80 (daily ed. June 6, 2017) (remarks of Sens. Nelson, Rubio, and Tester)); <span class="Italic">see, e.g</span>., 163 CONG. REC. at S3276 (remarks of Sen. Nelson) ("I also believe that it is important to protect the rights of the employees who may have been wrongly terminated, especially at the lower levels, by giving them the opportunity to appeal a supervisor's decision to fire them. This bill we are going [to] pass does that."). <span class="Italic">Sayers</span> is also consistent with "basic precepts of administrative law and judicial review" and the "historical practice of reviewing the penalty in adverse action decisions." <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>, 954 F.3d at 1377-78. By excluding the penalty imposed from the scope of review, "an agency could remove an employee for an extremely trivial offense," <span class="Italic">e.g</span>., "theft of a paperclip," "so long as substantial evidence supports that the employee actually stole a paperclip." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1378.[6] "[A]llowing the agency to remove an employee for the tiniest incident of misconduct so long as the agency could present substantial evidence that the trifling misconduct occurred--could gut due process protections in a way Congress did not intend." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1377 (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, "[t]he longstanding <span id="Page_306"></span>acceptance of penalty review, with or without mitigation authority, comes with good reason: it avoids absurd, unconstitutional results." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1378.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;This hypothetical comes from <span class="Italic">Mogil v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 769 F. App'x 920 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Mr. Brenner was removed from his position at the VA pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714. In reviewing his appeal, the MSPB did not consider the penalty, only whether the underlying charges were supported by substantial evidence. This was not in accordance with law. Under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714, the administrative judge and MSPB must "review for substantial evidence the entirety of the VA's removal decision--including the penalty--rather than merely confirming that the record contains substantial evidence that the alleged conduct leading to the adverse action actually occurred." <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>, 954 F.3d at 1379. Because the MSPB has neither the authority to "independent[ly]...set penalties," <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246, 1248 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the Government asserts that <span class="Italic">Sayers's</span> holding concerning penalty review does not extend to Mr. Brenner's removal because, unlike the petitioner in <span class="Italic">Sayers</span> who was removed for misconduct, "[Mr. Brenner] was removed for poor performance." This argument is unpersuasive. It is without basis in the Act, which draws no distinction between the procedures and protections afforded an employee removed for poor performance, misconduct, or some unhappy combination of both. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714. In particular, it fails to acknowledge that the Act allows for the MSPB to review the VA's action for "accordance with law," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(C); <span class="Italic">see</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(d)(1), and expressly provides for Federal Circuit review of an agency's action for accordance with law, abuse of discretion, and arbitrary and capricious decision making, <span class="Italic">see</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(d)(5)(A); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c), regardless of whether the penalty is imposed for misconduct or poor performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, the Government argues that we should, instead, extend our analysis of Chapter 43 in <span class="Italic">Lisiecki</span> to Mr. Brenner's case in abrogation of <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>. Respondent's Br. 46-47; <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 45-46 (stating that while Sayers expressly "rejected the [Government's] argument that [&#x00A7;] 714(d)(2)(A)" should be "interpreted the same way that the [c]ourt interpreted similar language from Chapter 43 in <span class="Italic">Lisiecki</span>," the Government "respectfully disagree[s] with the [c]ourt's analysis in <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>"). This argument is misplaced. <span class="Italic">See Deckers Corp. v. United States</span>, 752 F.3d 949, 964 (Fed.

It is also incorrect. "Different concerns governed Lisiecki," such that "the reasoning behind <span class="Italic">Lisiecki</span> cannot apply given the different procedural protections in [38 U.S.C.] &#x00A7; 714 removals." Sayers, 954 F.3d at 1379. Specifically, "the reasoning undergirding <span class="Italic">Lisiecki</span> arises from the specific circumstances of [C]hapter 43 adverse actions," which have both "a narrow focus" and other procedural protections "not applicable to &#x00A7; 714." Id.; see id. (noting that porting <span class="Italic">Lisiecki's</span> reasoning into 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 removals presents "constitutional concerns" as Chapter 43 "provide[s] more pre-termination due process"). Accordingly, the MSPB erred when it concluded that the Act precluded, rather than required, review of the penalty the VA imposed on Mr. Brenner.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210812139">8 F.4th 1290</a>, 1305-06 (Fed. Cir. 2021), rejected a constitutional challenge to 38 USC 714:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>, we acknowledged that chapter 43 offers employees pre-termination protections, in the form of a warning and an opportunity to improve, that are not afforded under section 714. For that reason, among others, we held in <span class="Italic">Sayers</span> that section 714 requires the Board to review "the entirety of the VA's removal decision--including the penalty--rather than merely confirming that the record contains substantial evidence that the alleged conduct leading to the adverse action actually occurred." 954 F.3d at 1379. We did not, however, suggest that the Board's use of the substantial evidence standard in either chapter 43 or section 714 proceedings was constitutionally suspect. To the contrary, we concluded that Board review of section 714 penalty determinations, even under a substantial evidence standard, was sufficient to put to rest the petitioner's due process concerns regarding section 714. <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>, 954 F.3d at 1379;[8] <span class="Italic">see also Brenner</span>, 990 F.3d at 1324-25.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;The petitioner in <span class="Italic">Sayers</span> raised a due process objection to the use of substantial evidence as the standard for reviewing DVA decisions, while also objecting to the administrative judge's ruling that the Board lacked authority to review the deciding official's penalty determination. Brief of Petitioner, <span class="Italic">Sayers v. Dep't of Veterans Affs</span>., No. 18-2195, 2019 WL 1723794, at *2 (Fed. Cir. Apr. 12, 2019). The court found that permitting review of the penalty determination put to rest the constitutional concerns raised in that case; the court did not suggest that the use of the substantial evidence standard of review was problematic. <span class="Italic">See Sayers</span>, 954 F.3d at 1379.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While it is true that different procedures are used in the periods leading up to removal decisions under chapter 43 and section 714, the critical point in the removal processes in both contexts is the agency's ultimate "decision," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(b)(1)(D), or "determin[ation]," 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(a)(1), that the employee's performance or conduct is unacceptable. The Board reviews those conclusions for substantial evidence in both contexts, and we have never suggested that the post-termination procedures employed in the chapter 43 context are constitutionally suspect. Mr. Rodriguez has not pointed to any distinction between chapter 43 and section 714 that would justify reaching the conclusion that the Board's use of the substantial evidence standard in chapter 43 proceedings is permissible, but the use of the same standard in section 714 proceedings is not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, while Mr. Rodriguez makes passing assertions questioning the constitutionality of the Board's use of the substantial evidence standard in section 714 proceedings, he does not support those assertions with any analysis or citation of authority. Mr. Rodriguez's assertions, therefore, are not sufficiently developed, and we decline to address them on their merits.</p>

The result is that issues concerning competence of medical practitioners ("question of professional conduct or competence") are reviewed by other practitioners, a kind of peer review. Actions not within the purview of DABs may be grieved under VA procedures; or they may be pursued through EEO channels.

<p class="Body-Text">The Civil Service Due Process Amendments, defining an "employee" for purposes of MSPB jurisdiction, contain an exclusion. Under 5 USC 7511(b)(10), an "employee" does not include a person holding a position within the Veterans Health Administration "which has been excluded from the competitive service by or under a provision of title 38, unless such employee was appointed to such position under section 7401(3) of such title." That statute clarified the exception for VA employees: excluded are medical professionals covered by the VA's separate personnel system (i.e., those appointed under 38 USC 7306, 7401(1), 7405 and 7406), but not those appointed under 38 USC 7401(3). Employees appointed under 38 USC 7401(3) apparently derive their appeal rights under 38 USC 7403(f)(3). Other VA employees are covered unless they are excluded from the competitive service. The employees excluded from the competitive service are enumerated at 38 USC 7403(a)(2); the excluded group parallels the appointees under 38 USC 7401(1) who can appeal their cases to Disciplinary Appeals Boards. By implication, other VA employees, who generally are appointed under Title 5 provisions, are covered by the Reform Act, with the qualification that they may now be within the coverage of 38 USC 714, earlier discussed. Technical amendments made by Pub. L. 102-378 of October 2, 1992, corrected the unintended exclusion from the 1990 Due Process Amendments of approximately 155,000 employees from coverage of Chapter 75, Title 5, U.S. Code. <span class="Italic">See</span> Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">In 1993 the Board considered its jurisdiction over appeals by VA Title 38 medical residents appointed under 38 USC 7406. <span class="Italic">Swango v. VA</span>, 59 MSPR 235, 237-41 (1993), explained why the Board lacked jurisdiction over a resident's termination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency appointed the appellant to an excepted service position of "Physician/1st Yr Resident/Post Graduate Level 1" effective July 1, 1992. The Form SF-50 documenting the appointment states that the appointment is "for duration of this training unless sooner terminated." The agency terminated the appointment on December 22, 1992. The appellant filed an appeal with the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the agency appointed the appellant to his position under 38 USC 4114(b), noting only parenthetically that the provisions of 38 USC 4114(b) are now contained in 38 USC 7406. In part, we reopen this appeal to make explicit that the appellant's July 1, 1992, appointment was effected under 38 USC 7406, which was enacted on May 7, 1991, as part of the Department of Veterans Affairs Health-Care Personnel Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-40, 105 Stat. 187, 227. Thus, we will apply 38 USC 7406 and any other relevant provisions of the 1991 Act to this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Among other changes to title 38, the 1991 Act recodified section 4114(b) as section 7406. Although section 7406 contains some provisions that differ from the provisions in the superseded section 4114(b), the language relevant to this appeal did not change. Section 7406 provides, as did section 4114(b), that the agency may establish residencies and internships and "appoint qualified persons to such positions without regard to civil service or classification laws, rules, or regulations." Thus, the plain language of 38 USC 7406 states that civil service laws, rules, or regulations do not apply to a person, like the appellant, who is selected for a residency by the Department of Veterans Affairs under that provision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chan v. VA</span>, 53 MSPR 617, 620 (1992) (interpreting identical language in 38 USC 4114 (a)(1)(A) now codified at 38 USC 7405(a)). The Act further provides that to supersede, override, or modify the title 38 scheme, a provision in title 5 or other law must do so by specific reference to chapter 74 of title 38. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 USC 7425(b). Accordingly, we find that civil service rules and regulations do not apply to this appeal and that civil service laws are inapplicable except to the extent that any law specifically supersedes, overrides, or modifies a relevant provision of title 38.[3] <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alvarez v. VA</span>, 49 MSPR 682, 684-85 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The Act also states that physicians appointed under section 7306, 7401(1), 7405, or 7406 specifically are not subject to section 413 of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, subchapter II of chapter 31 of title 5, subchapter VIII of chapter 33 of title 5, subchapter V of chapter 35 of title 5, subchapter II of chapter 43 of title 5, section 4507 of title 5, subchapter VIII of chapter 53 of title 5, and subchapter V of chapter 75 of title 5. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 USC 7425.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges that his termination resulted from conditions arising before employment, and that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal under 5 CFR 316.304 and 315.804-.806. Within the limitations set forth in 5 CFR 315.806, an employee may appeal to the Board an agency's <span id="Page_308"></span>decision to terminate him under 5 CFR 315.804 or 315.805. Section 316.304 states that a term employee terminated during his one-year trial period is entitled to the procedures set forth in 5 CFR 315.804 or 315.805. Assuming that the appellant's appointment was a term appointment and that term appointees have appeal rights to the Board under 5 CFR 315.806, we find that the Board cannot exercise jurisdiction over this appeal under 5 CFR 315.806(c) because 38 USC 7406 makes plain that civil service regulations do not apply to persons occupying residencies in the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that he has appeal rights to the Board under 38 USC 7403(f)(3). Section 7403(f)(1)(A) of title 38 provides that the agency may establish qualifications for and appoint individuals to positions listed in 38 USC 7401(3). Section 7403(f)(3) further provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of title 38 or other law, matters relating to adverse actions, disciplinary actions, and grievance procedures "involving individuals appointed to such positions...shall be resolved under the provisions of title 5."[6] Because the agency did not appoint the appellant under 38 USC 7403 (f)(1)(A) to a position listed in 38 USC 7401(3), we find that 38 USC 7403(f)(3) is inapplicable to this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Section 7401(3) of chapter 38 lists clinical or counseling psychologists with certain enumerated credentials, certified or registered respiratory therapists, licensed physical therapists, licensed practical or vocational nurses, pharmacists, and occupational therapists. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 USC 7401(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that he has a right of appeal to the Board under title 5. The relevant Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulation, 5 CFR 752.401(b)(7), excludes, for purposes of chapter 75 of title 5, an employee "whose position is with...the Veterans Health Services and Research Administration" [now the Veterans Health Administration] . The appellant has not shown, as required by the 1991 Act, that any provision of chapter 75 of title 5 specifically supersedes, overrides, or modifies 38 USC 7406. Consequently, under the plain language of title 38 and the OPM regulation, we find that the appellant is excluded from coverage under chapter 75 of title 5. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Godfrey v. VA</span>, 40 MSPR 438, 441-42 (1989) (applying former version of OPM regulation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming the appellant did have an appeal right to the Board under chapter 75 of title 5, we still would lack jurisdiction because, according to the SF-50s documenting the appellant's appointment and termination, he was a nonpreference eligible in the excepted service who had not completed two years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency. Thus, he was not an "employee" for purposes of chapter 75. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts an appeal right under 5 CFR 731.103(d), which states that "[a]ny applicant, eligible, or appointee who is found unsuitable by any agency having delegated authority from OPM under this part for any reason named in 731.202" may appeal to the Board under the Board's regulations....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The OPM regulations set forth in Part 731 apply only to "determinations of suitability for employment in positions in the competitive service and for career appointments in the Senior Executive Service." 5 CFR 731.101. The regulations on suitability determinations therefore do not apply to the appellant, who occupied a position in the excepted service. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Austin v. USPS</span>, 26 MSPR 597, 599 n.2 (1985). Further, as discussed above, civil service regulations do not apply to persons occupying residencies in the Department of Veterans Affairs under 38 USC 7406. Consequently, even assuming that this appeal concerned a suitability determination of the type covered by 5 CFR 731.103(d) and that Part 731 applied to employees in the excepted service, the Board still would lack jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(10), subchapter II of chapter 75 does not apply to an employee "who holds a position within the Veterans Health Administration which has been excluded from the competitive service by or under a provision of title 38, unless such employee was appointed to such position under section 7401(3) of such title." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(10); <span class="Italic">Mfotchou v.

Office of Personnel Management</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 207, 210 (1997).

Therefore, the Board does not have jurisdiction over the appellant's appeal, and the appellant's exclusive remedy is before the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7461-64; <span class="Italic">Mfotchou</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 317, &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">see also Khan v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's allegations of discrimination. An appellant's affirmative defenses are not an independent source of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1325 (Fed.

Thus, in the absence of an appealable action, the Board does not have jurisdiction to consider the appellant's allegations that the agency terminated her as a reprisal for her Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint and discriminated against her on the basis of her race.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Union contract coverage or the assertion of a discrimination claim does not extend Board appellate coverage to otherwise excluded VA medical personnel, as <span class="Italic">Stoot v. VA,</span> DA-0752-10-0287-I-1 (NP 9/30/2010), pointed out:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An aggrieved employee, as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511, who is covered by a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) who alleges that he has been affected by discrimination prohibited under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) (e.g., discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, national origin, sex, age, equal pay, or disability) may elect to file an appeal with the Board concerning an action otherwise exclusively covered by the negotiated grievance procedures of the CBA. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d); <span class="Italic">McCann v. Department of the Navy</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 288, 294 (1993); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3(c)(1)(i). Besides the fact that the appellant did not allege that he was affected by discrimination prohibited under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1), he is not an employee as defined in &#x00A7; 7511. Section 7511(b)(10) excludes an individual, such as the appellant, "who holds a position within the Veterans Health Administration which has been excluded from the competitive service by or under a provision of title 38" from the definition of employee under &#x00A7; 7511. Thus, the appellant's union membership is not material to this case because the appellant is not an employee under chapter 75 and has no right to appeal his separation to the Board. Further, the CBA cannot provide the appellant with rights not provided by statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pichon v. VA</span>, 67 MSPR 325, 326-28 (1995), attempted to again navigate the currents of Titles 5 and 38 as the Board declined jurisdiction over an appeal by a staff nurse appointed under 38 USC 4104(1) (redesignated as 38 USC 7401(1)) but noted the availability of protection under the Whistleblower Protection Act:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the time the agency took the alleged involuntary suspension action, the appellant occupied the excepted-service position of Staff Nurse, to which the agency had appointed her under 38 USC 4104(1), which was redesignated as 38 USC 7401(1) effective May 7, 1991, pursuant to the Department of Veterans Affairs Health-Care Personnel Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-40, 105 Stat. 210. The appellant argues that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal under chapter 75 of title 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found no law, rule, or regulation granting chapter 75 appeal rights to individuals appointed under 38 USC 7401(1). The administrative judge also found that health-care professionals appointed under 38 USC 7401(1) are expressly excluded by 38 USC 7425 from coverage under subchapter V of chapter 75 of title 5. On petition for review, the appellant asserts that subchapter V of chapter 75 does not apply to this appeal. Rather, the appellant contends, as she did below, that she has appeal rights under subchapter II of chapter 75.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In pertinent part, section 7425 of title 38 states that nurses appointed <span id="Page_309"></span>under 38 USC 7401(1) are not subject to subchapter V of chapter 75. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 USC 7425(a)(8). Subchapter V of chapter 75 applies to the Senior Executive Service. The appellant has never claimed, nor does the record evidence show, that she occupied a position in the Senior Executive Service. We therefore agree with the appellant that 38 USC 7425 does not apply to this appeal. However, for the following reasons, we find that the appellant does not have appeal rights under subchapter II of chapter 75, as she contends.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As provided in 5 USC 7511(b)(10), subchapter II of chapter 75 does not apply to an individual who</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">holds a position within the Veterans Health Administration which has been excluded from the competitive service by or under a provision of title 38, unless such employee was appointed to such position under section 7401(3) of such title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was appointed to her position under 38 USC 7401(1). The statutory exception for section 7401(3) appointments is therefore inapplicable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7403(a)(1) of title 38 provides that appointments of health-care professionals appointed under chapter 74 of title 38 to whom section 7403 applies "may be made only after qualifications have been satisfactorily established in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, <span class="Italic">without regard to civil-service requirements</span>." [Emphasis added.] Section 7403(a)(2) states that section 7403 applies to, among other health-care professionals, nurses appointed under chapter 74 of title 38. The appellant was a nurse appointed under chapter 74 of title 38, therefore section 7403 applies to her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has stated that "the competitive examination is the touchstone of the competitive service," and that employees whose appointments are exempt from the condition that they pass a competitive examination are "beyond peradventure" excluded from the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See Dodd v. TVA</span>, 770 F.2d 1038, 1040 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The qualifications set forth in 38 USC 7402(b)(3) for appointment to a Nurse position do not include passage of a competitive examination; the only qualifications are that the candidate have successfully completed a course of nursing in a recognized school of nursing approved by the Secretary, and that he or she be registered as a graduate nurse in a State.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the qualifications set forth in 38 USC 7402(b)(3), we find that section 7401(1) nurses, like the appellant, are appointed without regard to civil-service requirements regarding qualifications and are thus excluded from the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See Dodd</span>, 770 F.2d at 1040. We further find that, assuming the appellant meets the definition of "employee" under 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(C), her position is excluded from coverage under subchapter II of chapter 75 by 5 USC 7511(b)(10) because her position "has been excluded from the competitive service by or under a provision of title 38." <span class="Italic">See Exum v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/EXUM_CHARLOTTE_BN_0752_94_0015_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_246173.pdf">62 MSPR 344</a>, 346 (1994) (5 USC 7511(b)(10) generally excludes those employees of the Veterans Health Administration whose positions have been excluded from the competitive service by or under a provision of title 38); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Cummings v. GSA</span>, 5 MSPB 125, 5 MSPR 47, 48-49 (1981) (the appellant had no Board appeal rights because the pertinent statute authorized the agency to appoint him "without regard to the civil service laws").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Cochran v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, 67 MSPR 167 (1995), the Board found that it could exercise jurisdiction over an individual right of action (IRA) appeal brought by an individual who was appointed to his Physician position under 38 USC 7401(1), the same appointing authority at issue in this appeal. The appellant in <span class="Italic">Cochran</span>, however, alleged that the agency retaliated against him for whistleblowing activity, and he filed an IRA appeal under the provisions of the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA), Pub. L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>, at 168-169. Under the circumstances of that case, the Board found that the relevant provisions of the WPA, in particular 5 USC 1221, were not inconsistent with the disciplinary scheme established for actions taken under 38 USC 7463. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 170-174. In contrast, the appellant here has not alleged whistleblowing activity and has not filed this appeal under the provisions of the WPA. Thus, the jurisdictional facts in <span class="Italic">Cochran</span> differ materially from the jurisdictional facts in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, and for the reasons discussed above, we find that the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal, and that the appellant has not raised nonfrivolous allegations of the Board's jurisdiction that would entitle her to a jurisdictional hearing.</p>
