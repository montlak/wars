<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-247"><span class="space">8.</span> Lack of Candor</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Webster defined "candor" as unstained purity and innocence or, as a secondary meaning, frankness. More likely than not, the Board and reviewing courts apply the secondary meaning with construing a charge that an individual's responses lacked candor. But without defining the term, the Board stated that "making statements that demonstrate a lack of candor clearly constitutes actionable misconduct." <span class="Italic">Crickard v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/CRICKARD_WESLEY_DC_0752_01_0282_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_249332.pdf">92 MSPR 625</a>, 632 &#x00B6; 18 (2002). If an <span id="Page_2775"></span>individual is charged with lack of candor in an investigation into his possible misconduct, implicit in that charge is the allegation that the appellant intentionally misrepresented the information in the investigation. To prove the charge, circumstantial evidence is used to establish intent. <span class="Italic">Boyd v. DOJ</span>, 14 MSPR 427, 429-30 (1983) (FBI special agent was removed for charges, among others, of a lack of candor in providing an explanation of his use of duty time in an agency fitness program). An employee's lack of candor directly impacts the service efficiency. <span class="Italic">Tyner v. USDA</span>, DC-0752-16-0098-I-1 (NP 9/7/2016) (relying on <span class="Italic">Ludlum v. DOJ</span>, 87 MSPR 56, 68 &#x00B6; 28 (2000), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 278 F.3d 1280 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The charge of lack of candor was defined, <span class="Italic">Acosta v. DHS,</span> AT-0752-08-0677-I-3 (NP 4/6/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lack of candor is a broader and more flexible concept than falsification, and as such, its contours and elements depend on the particular context and conduct involved. <span class="Italic">Little v. Department of Transportation</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 224, &#x00B6; 18 (2009). It may involve a failure to disclose something that, under the circumstances, should have been disclosed to make a statement accurate and complete. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see Ludlum v. Department of Justice</span>, 278 F.3d 1280, 1284 (Fed. Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Caesar v. Dept. of Commerce,</span> DC-0752-10-0394-I-1 (NP 3/2/2012) ("Lack of candor is a broader concept than falsification (which involves an affirmative misrepresentation), and it involves a failure to disclose something that, in the given circumstances, should have been disclosed to make the appellant's statement accurate and complete rather than potentially misleading. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ludlum v. Department of Justice,</span> 278 F.3d 1280, 1284 (Fed. Cir. 2002)"; "The Board has regularly held that a lack of candor, particularly when involved with other misconduct, can support removal.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Emphasizing the "flexible" nature of a charge of lack of candor, <span class="Italic">McDaniel v. DHS,</span> SF-0752-10-0681-I-1 (NP 10/21/2011), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lack of candor is a flexible charge that does not require proof of intent to deceive. <span class="Italic">Ludlum v. Department of Justice</span>, 278 F.3d 1280, 1284 (Fed. Cir. 2002). In order to prove a lack of candor charge, an agency must prove that an appellant was not fully forthcoming and candid with the agency as to all facts and information relevant to the matter at issue, whether or not such information was specifically elicited. <span class="Italic">See Ludlum v. Department of Justice</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 56, &#x00B6; 13 (2000), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 278 F.3d 1280 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The Board's reviewing court explained that a lack of candor charge may be proven by showing that the appellant failed "to disclose something that, in the circumstances, should have been disclosed in order to make the given statement accurate and complete." <span class="Italic">Ludlum</span>, 278 F.3d at 1284.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision, the administrative judge concluded that by continuing to claim during the 2009 investigation by the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility that he did not know that he had been arrested when completing the first Sherriff's application, the appellant did not respond fully and truthfully to questions that he was asked. The administrative judge noted that the appellant did not dispute that he responded with the words as charged.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the administrative judge relied on the appellant's own statements and the overwhelming evidence of record demonstrating that the appellant should have known during the course of the 2009 interview that he was arrested for a DUI in 2004, we find the administrative judge properly determined that the appellant's conduct in this regard demonstrated a lack of candor. Thus, we find the administrative judge properly sustained the agency's lack of candor charge.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge construed charge 4, attempting to deceive a supervisor, as a falsification charge. We find, however, that charge 4 is more properly construed as a lack of candor charge. While it is true that intent to deceive is a separate element of a falsification charge, "lack of candor [also] necessarily involves an element of deception," <span class="Italic">Ludlum v</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of Justice</span>, 278 F.3d 1280, 1284 (Fed. Cir. 2002), and the inclusion of the phrase "attempting to deceive" in the charging document does not necessarily mean that the appellant was being charged with falsification. Lack of candor is a "broader and more flexible concept" than falsification, and, as such, it may involve a failure to disclose something that should have been disclosed "to make the given statement accurate and complete." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The critical difference between falsification and lack of candor in this case is whether the appellant was charged with making an affirmative misrepresentation. <span class="Italic">See Rhee v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 10 (2012) (to establish falsification, an agency needs to show that the employee made an affirmative misrepresentation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant was not charged with making an affirmative misrepresentation. Rather, the specification describes the appellant's successful attempts to deceive his supervisor by covering up his arrest and the impounding of his government-owned vehicle until he returned to work, and the words "false" or "falsification" do not appear in the charge or the narrative specification. For these reasons, the agency was not required to prove an affirmative misrepresentation in order to prove its charge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The lack of candor charge encompasses at least an element of deception, rather than a mistake of fact, as <span class="Italic">Rhee v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Specifically, the agency contends that a lack of candor charge does not require proof of intent to deceive, but only proof that the appellant did not respond "fully and truthfully" to Ammari's email. We find that the administrative judge applied the correct legal standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge recognized, the Federal Circuit has stated that "[l]ack of candor and falsification are different, although related, forms of misconduct, and the latter is not a necessary element of the former." <span id="Page_2776"></span><span class="Italic">Ludlum v. Department of Justice,</span> 278 F.3d 1280, 1283-84 (Fed. Cir. 2002). To establish falsification, an agency needs to show that the employee made an affirmative misrepresentation and prove intent to deceive. Conversely, lack of candor "is a broader and more flexible concept." <span class="Italic">Ludlum,</span> 278 F.3d at 1284. "Although lack of candor necessarily involves an element of deception, 'intent to deceive' is not a separate element of that offense-as it is for 'falsification.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1284-85.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly interpreted <span class="Italic">Ludlum,</span> which expressly employs a flexible lack of candor standard that requires the agency to produce some evidence that the appellant's actions, under the circumstances, involved an "element of deception." <span class="Italic">Ludlum,</span> 278 F.3d at 1284. Here, the relevant circumstances are those set forth in the agency's specification underlying its charge, i.e., that the appellant responded to Ammari's question by answering that the MOC was on SharePoint on October 2, 2009, when she "knew...that the MOC in question was not, in fact, on SharePoint on October 2, 2009." Thus, in order to prove its charge, the administrative judge properly required the agency to establish that the appellant's response to Ammari was not merely incorrect, but that it also involved an element of deception in that, when she responded, she knew that the document in question was not, in fact, on SharePoint on October 2, 2009. <span class="Italic">See generally Otero v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 198, 202-03 (1997) (an agency need not label its charge narrowly with "magic words" for the Board to sustain it, but instead the charge must be viewed in light of the accompanying specification and circumstances, and should not be technically construed). Accordingly, the agency's contention that the administrative judge applied an incorrect legal standard lacks merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also contends that the appellant demonstrated her lack of candor in responding to Ammari by failing to ascertain the truthfulness of the statement and by failing to concede prior to her hearing testimony that her email response may have been inaccurate. It cites <span class="Italic">Bradley v. Veterans Administration,</span> 39 M.S.P.R. 598, 604 (1989), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 900 F.2d 233 (Fed. Cir. 1990), for the proposition that "the fact that employee later states the truth, and only while being investigated, does not warrant an inference that he did not intend to deceive." <span class="Italic">Bradley</span> is inapposite. In that case, the Board disagreed with the administrative judge's ultimate finding that an appellant's false statement to his supervisors was immaterial because he later gave correct information in his statement to an investigator. 39 M.S.P.R. at 604. The Board stated that "[a]n employee who knowingly gives false or inaccurate information to his supervisors strikes at the very heart of the employee-employer relationship." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Here, by contrast, the administrative judge determined that the agency failed to establish that the appellant knew that the information that she provided to Ammari was inaccurate. Although the appellant testified that it was possible that her attempt to post the document in question on SharePoint on October 2 was unsuccessful for a variety of technical reasons, she emphasized that she received no error messages and believed that she had successfully saved the MOC in SharePoint on that date. Similarly, the appellant speculated that it was possible that she changed the document name when she edited it on October 9, and that this could possibly explain why Ammari's report indicated that it was created on that date. As the administrative judge stated in the initial decision, however, the agency argued that these were merely "speculative arguments" by the appellant as to what "could have" happened, and not her specific explanation of what she believed did occur. Thus, unlike <span class="Italic">Bradley,</span> the appellant, in so testifying, was not "later stat[ing] the truth," but was merely offering possible explanations for the entry in Ammari's report indicating that "1-Detective MESA.doc" was uploaded to SharePoint for the first time on October 9.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bradley v. VA</span>, 39 MSPR 598, 604-05 n.2 (1989), may have implied that a lack of candor charge should be on a material matter:</p>

Those cases simply stand for the proposition that when an underlying misconduct charge has been proven, a concealment or lack of candor charge must also be sustained based on the appellant's failure to respond truthfully or completely when questioned about matters relative to the proven misconduct. Given our findings on the charges, the cases in fact support the conclusion of falsification. Certainly neither case says that falsification is immaterial where it is later corrected, as the administrative judge implies.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit reversed the Board in <span class="Italic">Bradley v. VA</span>, 900 F.2d 233 (Fed.

Under the Federal Circuit's <span class="Italic">Bradley</span> decision, before the employee can be disciplined, he must be on notice that the questions arise from some type of investigation; it is insufficient that the employee makes a personally misleading statement to a supervisor during conversation if the statement is designed to ensure the privacy of the employee's family life rather than to secure a benefit from the agency not otherwise obtainable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ludlum v. DOJ</span>, 278 F.3d 1280, 1283-84 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (Judge Gajarsa dissenting), relied on by decisions earlier cited in this discussion, attempted analysis of a lack of candor charge, but it was unclear whether the decision was limited to charges against FBI agents or whether the charge required an element of intentional deception. As the dissenting opinion noted, "the majority requires deception without requiring intent, even though deception by definition requires intent." The majority opined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board correctly rejected the administrative judge's apparent theory that the charge of lack of candor in this case was a charge of falsification, that to establish the latter charge the Bureau must establish that the employee had "[t]he intent to defraud or mislead the agency," and that the Bureau's proof failed because it did not establish that Ludlum "intentionally withheld the truth with intent to deceive." As the Board stated, "[a] 'lack of candor' charge may encompass a broader range of misconduct than a falsification charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lack of candor and falsification are different, although related, forms of misconduct, and the latter is not a necessary element of the former. <span class="Italic">Compare Boyd v. Department of Justice,</span> 13 MSPB 97, 14 M.S.P.R. 427 (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 727 F.2d 1117 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (Table), where the FBI charged an agent with several types of misconduct (including lack of candor) based upon responses he made during an interview, and falsification of official records (his daily attendance cards). There the Board treated these two charges as separate and distinct, and sustained the lack of candor charge but not the falsification charge. In <span class="Italic">Gootee v. Veterans Administration</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 526 (1988), the Board cited <span class="Italic">Boyd</span> as holding that "when an underlying misconduct charge has been proven, a concealment or lack of candor charge must also be sustained based on appellant's failure to respond truthfully or completely when questioned about matters relating to the proven misconduct." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 529.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Falsification involves an affirmative misrepresentation, and requires intent to deceive. <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Dep't of Transp.,</span> 782 F.2d 975, 977 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Lack of candor, however, is a broader and more flexible concept whose contours and elements depend upon the particular context and conduct involved. It may involve a failure to disclose something that, in the circumstances, should have been disclosed in order to make the given statement accurate and complete. It would be comparable to the distinction in the Federal securities laws governing securities registration statements between "an untrue statement of a material fact" and the failure "to state a material fact...necessary to make the statements therein not misleading." 15 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 77k(a) (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his testimony in this case Mr. DeFeo, the Assistant Director of the Bureau's Office of Professional Responsibility, who wrote the letter sustaining the charges against Ludlum and removing him, explained that "lack of candor is the generic term which has historically been used in FBI discipline which in its literal meaning means lack of forthrightness, lack of testifying truthfully including all the relevant circumstances. It has refinements. It can mean lying under oath in Court, lying under oath in an administrative hearing or it can be, in lesser type offense [sic], such as lying to a supervisor, not under oath, about work performance. So it can have various relations." Similarly, Mr. Figliuzzi, another Bureau official, stated that under the FBI Director's bright-line policy, "lack of candor," which includes failure "to reply fully and truthfully," and "l[ying] under oath, for example, during an administrative inquiry," would lead to dismissal from the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Bureau's regulations and instructions governing the conduct of its employees do not use the words "lack of candor." The words, however, apparently are well understood within the Bureau as a shorthand phrase for the myriad of situations that the concept covers. The standard is implicit in the statement in the Bureau's Manual of Administrative Operations and Procedures which, in Part I, Section 13, 13-4, states: "The employee must be entirely frank and cooperative in answering inquiries of an administrative nature."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dissent contends that Board precedent requires a "showing of intent <span id="Page_2777"></span>to deceive" in order to sustain a charge of lack of candor. We do not read the Board's prior decisions as announcing such a broad rule. In any event, the Board here has ruled that, in the factual circumstances of the present case, lack of candor is established by showing that the FBI agent did not "respond fully and truthfully" to the questions he was asked--a ruling with which we agree. Although lack of candor necessarily involves an element of deception, "intent to deceive" is not a separate element of that offense--as it is for "falsification."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit attempted to make matters more plain in <span class="Italic">Santana v. DHS,</span> 179 Fed. Appx. 696, 699-700 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP), interpreting a charge of lack of candor against an auditor who provided statements concerning some problematic off-duty conduct, principally involving DUI charges:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Santana was charged with (1) failure to report an arrest, (2) failure to report criminal charges, (3) failure to provide complete and accurate information during a periodic background investigation, and (4) failure to provide complete and accurate information in an IA investigation. In affirming the removal, the AJ applied the lack of candor standard established by this court in <span class="Italic">Ludlum v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 278 F.3d 1280 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Mr. Santana argues that the Board erred in determining that the charges raised against him were equivalent to the charge of lack of candor. According to Mr. Santana, the Board applied the wrong analysis; it should have considered his actions as falsifications. "Lack of candor and falsification are different, although related, forms of misconduct, and the latter is not a necessary element of the former." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1283. To establish falsification, the Agency needs to show Mr. Santana made an affirmative misrepresentation and prove intent to deceive. <span class="Italic">See Naekel v. Dep't of Trans.</span>, 782 F.2d 975, 977 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Conversely, "lack of candor is a broader and more flexible concept." <span class="Italic">Ludlum</span>, 278 F.3d at 1284. Lack of candor can involve "a failure to disclose something that, in the circumstances, should have been disclosed in order to make the given statement accurate or complete." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For support of Mr. Santana's assertion that the charges against him were similar to falsification, he cited several Board cases. <span class="Italic">See Hanker v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 159 (1997) (requiring intent in determining falsification when the appellant failed to list previous employment and falsely answered no to several questions on an employment form); <span class="Italic">Daniels v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 272 (1993) (requiring intent in determining falsification when an appellant, while filling out a form for the agency either falsely left an answer blank or wrote "N/A"); <span class="Italic">Forma v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 97, 99, 103 (1993) (requiring intent in determining falsification when the appellant falsely answered negatively to three questions posed by the agency); <span class="Italic">Box v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Though the AJ considered the assertions raised by Mr. Santana, he ultimately compared Mr. Santana's charges to that of the <span class="Italic">Ludlum</span> petitioner. In <span class="Italic">Ludlum</span>, the petitioner was initially removed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") for traveling with an unauthorized passenger in his official Bureau vehicle: his daughter, whom he had picked up at her daycare center. 278 F.3d at 1281. The petitioner, during the FBI investigation, claimed that he had not used the vehicle to pick up his daughter more than twelve times. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> As part of the interview, the FBI prepared an affidavit stating that the petitioner had only picked up his daughter three times. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The petitioner reviewed and signed the statement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In another statement made a month later, the petitioner claimed to have reviewed his records, and that he actually picked up his daughter fourteen times. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1281-82. The petitioner was given a 120 day suspension due to his lack of candor. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1283.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ludlum</span>, lack of candor was equated to lying under oath or lying to a supervisor. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1284. This court identified lack of candor as not responding fully and truthfully to questions asked by the agency. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> "Although lack of candor necessarily involves an element of deception, 'intent to deceive' is not a separate element of that offense--as it is for 'falsification.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1284-85. The AJ properly applied <span class="Italic">Ludlum</span> to the charges against Mr. Santana.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In considering the charges of failure to report an arrest and failure to report criminal charges, the AJ's decision is supported by substantial evidence. Mr. Santana stipulates that he knew he had a duty to inform either his supervisor or the IA about any arrests, detentions, or criminal charges. Therefore, his failure to disclose his 1994 arrest, 1996 arrest or his domestic abuse arrest lacked candor. Pursuant to <span class="Italic">Ludlum</span>, intent is not a required element to establish support for the charge of lack of candor.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit expanded the concept of lack of candor, characterized as making an untrue and unsupported allegation, to include submission by the appellant to other agency personnel of a memorandum containing what the court appeared to consider factually unsupported assertions of misconduct by another employee, <span class="Italic">Ryan v. DOD</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/18-1524.Opinion.2-13-2019.pdf">760 Fed. Appx. 990, 993-94</a> (Fed. Cir. 2019 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Ryan's principal argument with respect to the lack of candor charge is that neither the DO nor the AJ ever made a finding that Ryan intended to deceive the recipients of his memorandum, or that he knew his allegation was incorrect. Further, Ryan contends, our precedent confines lack of candor charges to investigations or inquiries, rather than unsupported allegations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ludlum v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 278 F.3d 1280, 1284 (Fed. Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government responds that the concept of lack of candor is defined more broadly by our case law and is not restricted, as Ryan would have it, to statements made during investigations or inquiries. In the government's view, Ryan lacked candor because he knew both that he had no evidence to support his assertion of a <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> and that he could not support his allegation that SV's evaluation was "fraudulently inflated" because he admitted that he had never read SV's Officer Performance Record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the government because our precedent, including <span class="Italic">Ludlum</span>, is clear that lack of candor is a "flexible concept whose contours and elements depend upon the particular context and conduct involved." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1284 (analogizing lack of candor to "the failure to state a material fact [in a securities registration statement]...necessary to make the statements therein not misleading" actionable under the Securities Act of 1933). Hence, we reject Ryan's argument that lack of candor can only be charged where an employee failed to be forthright in the course of an investigation or inquiry. In fact, <span class="Italic">Ludlum's</span> holding that a lack of candor may be charged where an employee fails to state a material fact necessary to make a statement not misleading is strikingly applicable to Ryan's failure to provide any evidence in support of his provocative assertion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further determine that Ryan has not shown that the AJ's finding was unsupported by substantial evidence. Ryan argues that neither the DO nor the AJ made the requisite finding of an intent to deceive, and in fact conceded that Ryan may have believed that SV received an inflated rating. But Ryan's opinions about SV's performance are ultimately beside the point. Ryan chose to assert the existence of a <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> between the sergeant and SV with-out any evidence. While Ryan now argues that his intuition as a police officer provides the requisite evidence, he did not so qualify his allegation in his memorandum. Instead, Ryan represented the alleged exchange as fact, and the AJ reasonably found that by making an allegation he knew was unsupported, Ryan intended to deceive the recipients of the memorandum. Thus, substantial evidence supports the AJ's finding that Ryan lacked candor.</p>

Here, in response to Judge Minter's questioning relating to the use of SSA official stationery, Judge Steverson stated that he thought it was fine because he was using an out-of-date SSA stationery that had since been replaced by the agency. In addition, in regards to the sexually oriented material on his computer, Judge Steverson claimed that he was either not responsible for the content or had no idea how it got on his computer. The Board found both these excuses unbelievable--rightly so. What difference would it make to the recipient of an SSA correspondence whether the stationery used was out-of-date? How would the recipient even know that it was out-of-date? Even more, Judge Steverson's claim of ignorance as to the 1000 sexually graphic files on his computer strains credulity. Significantly, agency information technology staff testified that the type of files found on Judge Steverson's personal work computer were files created by the user, which required several separate and volitional acts by him.

<p class="Body-Text">Lack of candor may be inferred through examination of responses during an investigation, as occurred in <span class="Italic">Jenkins v.

Cir. 2020 NP), determining that reliance on faulty memory would not, if contradicted by other evidence, deflect the charge:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next turn to Jenkins's challenge regarding the lack of candor charge. Jenkins makes two arguments. First, Jenkins argues that she did not lack candor when she said it was "a lie" that she constantly told Bartley that there are a lot of dumb people working in HR. And second, Jenkins argues that her denial of the validity of the text messages was truthful. We find both arguments unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For her first argument, Jenkins contends that she "reasonably concluded" that Agent Busser was asking whether she "constantly" made the exact statement: "[T]here are a lot of dumb people working in HR." We do not find such a strawman interpretation to be reasonable. One need only contrast the three text messages in which Jenkins's explicitly referred to a colleague as "dumb" or "dummy" with Jenkins's unequivocal denial to conclude that the Board had substantial evidence to affirm the lack of candor charge. That conclusion is bolstered even further by contrasting Jenkins's prolonged and persistent history of disrespectful and disparaging text messages with her disingenuous statements immediately following that unequivocal denial: "I do not think like that nor do I speak like that about people. I have the utmost respect for my colleagues and have never been disrespectful." In view of the record, it is impossible to conclude that the Agency lacked substantial evidence to find that Jenkins was less than truthful regarding the subject matter of the text messages.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Jenkins next argues that the Agency failed to meet its burden of showing that she "knowingly" gave incorrect or incomplete information about the validity of the text messages. Appellant Br. 46 (citing <span class="Italic">Fargnoli v. Dep't of Commerce</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 330, 338 &#x00B6; 17 (2016)). Jenkins contends that she had a right to resist confirming from memory the validity of quotes from messages that she had allegedly sent long before the interview, that she never denied that she sent the messages, and that her statement that she does not remember sending some of the messages remains true. We reject Jenkins's arguments because the record tells a different story. Substantial evidence demonstrates that Jenkins recalled the messages and spoke substantively about them during her interview with Agent Busser but then attempted to walk back large portions of her interview with a generic statement about her lack of memory. The fact that Jenkins did not tell an overt lie by outright claiming that she did not send the messages does not negate her lack of candor with regard to her memory of the text messages. Thus, substantial evidence supports the Board's affirmance of the Agency's lack of candor charge.</p>
