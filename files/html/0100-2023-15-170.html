<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Payne v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 419, 425 (1997), emphasized that sexual harassment, characterized as a "stupid" message by its recipient, is assessed from the perspective of the victim:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A complainant is not required...to testify in express words that she felt sexually harassed before a charge of sexual harassment will lie. <span class="Italic">See Howard v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 877 F.2d 952, 955 (Fed. Cir. 1989). In analyzing whether conduct amounts to sexual harassment, moreover, that conduct must be judged from the perspective of the victim, and it is error to analyze that conduct from the perspective of the individual who engaged in it; the administrative judge thus should not have analyzed whether the message was unwelcome or unsolicited from, the appellant's perspective. <span class="Italic">See King v. Frazier</span>, 77 F.3d 1361, 1363 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, __U.S.__, 117 S. Ct. 62, 136 L. Ed.2d 24 (1996); <span class="Italic">King v. Hillen</span>, 21 F.3d 1572, 1582-83 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hanes v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> CH-0752-15-0111-I-1 (NP 2/17/2016) (offensive remark to a coworker: "The appellant may have assumed that all relevant parties believed he was joking, but that is by no fault of the agency. In addition, as found by the deciding official and the administrative judge, the fact that the appellant persisted in his belief that "he was subjectively operating in a workplace atmosphere that allowed the type of behavior he engaged in...was part of the problem," was one of the reasons why the agency and the administrative judge properly sustained the charges and imposed the removal penalty under the circumstances."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Martin v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-1578.Opinion.4-20-2020_1572692.pdf">810 Fed. Appx. 867</a> (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP) (nexus existed concerning off-duty comments of a racial nature by the appellant to a coworker about a supervisor); <span class="Italic">Knight v. USDA,</span> SF-0752-15-0309-I-1 (NP 4/27/2016) ("Moreover, as explained above, the administrative judge in this case did not rely upon a presumption of nexus. Rather, she found that the emails and message that the appellant sent from his personal accounts adversely affected C.B.'s job performance, as well as management's trust and confidence in the appellant's ability to perform his job.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Workplace remarks were the subject of Federal Circuit commentary in <span class="Italic">Holland v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 31 F.3d 1118, 1120-22 (Fed. Cir. 1994), reversing a Board decision sustaining demotion of a warehouse worker foreman who made statements to subordinates and potential employees that he believed that women in general were incapable of performing work in the warehouse and that he would never hire a woman. At issue was whether the comments constituted discrimination. There was no proof that Holland acted on his beliefs or discriminated as to the terms or conditions of anyone's employment. The court essentially concluded that if one is charged with discrimination concerning the terms of employment, and if agency regulations did not broaden the definition of that term, then the comments made by Holland would not support a finding of discrimination because they did not affect employment conditions and did not constitute harassment. The demotion was reversed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Holland does not dispute that he made the statements he was alleged to have made, but rather contends that they do not support the agency's demotion action. As the AJ found, the particular regulations Holland was charged with violating implement in this context Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which makes it "an unlawful employment practice for an employer...to <span class="Italic">discriminate</span> against any individual with respect to his <span class="Italic">compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment</span>, because of such individual's race, color, religion, <span class="Italic">sex</span>, or national origin." 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-2(a)(1) (emphasis added). As the AJ correctly stated, this law requires supervisors to "treat all employees and applicants for employment in a manner free of discrimination when conducting all personnel actions." Further, as the Supreme Court has held, the language of the statute is not limited to "economic or tangible" discrimination such as "personnel actions," but further prohibits statements or conduct that creates a "discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment." <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc.</span>, 510 U.S. 17, 114 S. Ct. 367, 370, 126 L. Ed.2d 295 (1993) (citing <span class="Italic">Meritor Savs. Bank v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57, 64-66, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 2404-05, 91 L. Ed.2d 49 (1986)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Carosella v. USPS</span>, 816 F.2d 638 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Holland agrees that "at the point" his statements became discriminatory conduct "through actual discrimination or through creation of a hostile work environment" it would have been appropriate for the government to take action against him under the cited rules and regulations. Holland points out, however, that although the agency originally charged him with actual discrimination and demoted him based on these charges, these specific charges were dropped at the hearing before the MSPB, and that the agency thereafter has attempted to support its demotion action based solely on his statements of belief. Consequently, for purposes of this case, the agency accepts that Holland has never committed a specific discriminatory act against a woman, either by a personnel action or by creating a hostile work environment through statements or conduct towards a woman or about women generally.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Holland has not engaged in a discriminatory act against anyone on the basis of sex or sexually harassed anyone, or used abusive language, violent treatment, or insulting demeanor against "the person(s) discriminated against," there is no evidence that the provisions of Item 29a of AFR 40750...were violated. Necessarily, therefore, the provisions of Item 29b were not violated. Likewise, there is no evidence that Holland violated the policy asserted by the deciding official as the actual basis for the agency's demotion action, that is "we as Air Force members can not discriminate."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ made no specific findings to support her conclusion that Holland's "statements violate the agency's EEO policies and constitute actionable misconduct." The full board found, and the Air Force argues, that AFR 40-713 and 40-701 and Pamphlet 40-11, are "broad enough to proscribe" Holland's statements. The Air Force first contends that the regulations and pamphlet "require [Air Force managers and supervisors] to make <span class="Italic">personnel decisions</span> without regard, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, to sex, and that are based solely on merit and fitness." We fully agree. But in this case there is no assertion or evidence that Holland ever made even one "personnel decision" violative of this requirement. The Air Force then argues, and this seemingly is what the full board found, that Holland's statements <span id="Page_2671"></span>are "unquestionably proscribed" by the regulations. With this we cannot agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency is alleging that Holland committed specific acts of misconduct each time he made a particular statement expressing a particular attitude, and that Air Force regulations prohibited such statements. The regulations cited by the MSPB and relied upon now by the Air Force say nothing about certain "statements" being prohibited. Nor do the cited regulations prohibit statements expressing beliefs regarding conduct which, if taken, would likely violate EEO regulations and statute. Besides dealing with discrimination, the cited regulations at most advise supervisors to "facilitate" and "support" the EEO program and its considerations. As we said in <span class="Italic">Grubka v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 858 F.2d 1570, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1988), charges such as failing to "foster a positive EEO climate" or failing to "demonstrate a personal commitment to EEO principles" are so vague as to "cover[&#8197;] everything and touch[&#8197;] nothing," and their alleged violation does not support disciplinary action against an employee. Though this case differs from <span class="Italic">Grubka</span> in that the Air Force and the full board have specifically identified EEO regulations and portions thereof, those portions of those regulations say nothing more specific than what was held to be overly vague in <span class="Italic">Grubka.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore conclude that the agency's charge is not supported by substantial evidence and is insufficient as a matter of law....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude this somewhat odd case with the following epilogue. It was said at oral argument that after 1988, the date of Holland's last inappropriate statement, a woman had come to be under Holland's employ in the warehouse, a woman who possessed sufficient physical strength to perform the heavy lifting and quick transport required for work in the warehouse. The ignorance of his generalizations thereby having been proved to him, we were told that Holland has had a change in attitude.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Curry v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 13 MSPR 327, 330-32 (1982), sustained demotion of a supervisor who made some sexist comments to a female employee who was not his subordinate. The Board refused to characterize the remarks--to the effect that women did not belong in the apprenticeship program--as sexual harassment, but considered the remarks to be disruptive speech not protected by the First Amendment. 29 CFR 1604.11(a) (2022) defines sexual harassment as "[u]nwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature." There was a distinction between matters sexist and sexual. Without sexual harassment, more than one or even more than a few incidents involving sexist remarks must occur to violate Title VII. A "course of conduct" or "pattern or practice" of harassment must be established. The Board could find no court case making one isolated incident of sexist behavior as opposed to sexual harassment, without loss of tangible employment benefits, a violation of Title VII. The demotion was sustained because of discriminatory behavior based on sex after analysis of the implications of the remark under the First Amendment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, insofar as the presiding official sustained the agency charge against appellant based upon his conclusion that appellant had discriminated against the female employee in violation of Title VII, that conclusion is clearly erroneous. Nonetheless, we find the charge sustainable on other grounds. The appellant was accused of discriminatory behavior on the basis of sex. There is in fact no dispute that his behavior was discriminatory as that term is commonly understood. Furthermore, it is clear that such conduct by one of its supervisory employees cannot go unchecked by the agency, lest the agency be said to condone such remarks by its employees. Furthermore, if such conduct were not to be held actionable, a course of conduct or pattern of discriminatory behavior could emerge wherein the agency as employer could ultimately be held liable under Title VII....&#8197;As set forth above, we accept the presiding official's findings of fact with respect to the conversation. Furthermore, the appellant had adequate notice of the fact that the agency was charging him with what it believed was discriminatory conduct based upon his remarks as the agency had every right to do. Thus the charge as stated by the agency is sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we have found the charge against the appellant sustained, two questions remain for resolution: (1) The question of appellant's affirmative defense that his remarks were protected by the First Amendment and (2) The question of the penalty to be imposed should the affirmative defense be found unsupported.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning first to the question of the appellant's affirmative defense that his remarks were protected speech under the First Amendment, we concur with the presiding Official's conclusion that this contention is "clearly without merit." However, as the presiding official failed to set forth the grounds for his conclusion, we herein clarify this ruling.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(a), an agency may take action against an employee only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service, and pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(C), the Board may not sustain an agency action "not in accordance with law." In <span class="Italic">Arnett v. Kennedy,</span> 416 U.S. 134, 161, 94 S. Ct. 1633, 1647, 40 L. Ed.2d 15, <span class="Italic">reh. denied,</span> 417 U.S. 977, 94 S. Ct. 3187, 41 L. Ed.2d 1148 (1974), the Supreme Court stated in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The phrase "such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service" as a standard of employee job protection is <span class="Italic">without</span> <span class="Italic">doubt intended to authorize dismissal for speech as well as</span> <span class="Italic">other conduct. Pickering v. Board of Education,</span> 391 U.S. 563, 568[88 S. Ct. 1731, 1734, 20 L. Ed.2d 8111 (1968), [rest of citation omitted], makes it clear that in certain situations the discharge of a Government Employee may be based on his speech without offending guarantees of the First Amendment. [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court makes it clear that Congress, of course, did not wish to authorize dismissal for constitutionally protected speech. <span class="Italic">Kennedy</span> at 165. Thus, dismissal for certain speech, not constitutionally protected, may be in accordance with law in the employment context and may promote the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the applicable standards the <span class="Italic">Kennedy</span> court refers to the now well known language in <span class="Italic">Pickering:</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The problem in any case is to arrive at a balance between the interests of the teacher, as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. 416 U.S. at 161, 94 S. Ct. at 1647, quoting <span class="Italic">Pickering, supra,</span> 391 U.S. at 568, 88 S. Ct. at 1734.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also, the Court in <span class="Italic">Kennedy</span> recognizes the possibility of infinite factual patterns, making it necessary to weigh the interests of each party on a case by case basis<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Courts since <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> have made it clear that the gravamen of the protected employee speech is the right of the employee to comment upon matters of public concern as opposed to the right of the employers to maintain efficiency, loyalty and morale. <span class="Italic">See Barrett v. Thomas,</span> 649 F.2d 1193, 1198-9, <span class="Italic">reh. denied,</span> (5th Cir. 1981) and cases cited therein. Thus employee speech, lacking a public dimension and which is seen as subversive to good order, efficiency or discipline in the work place, is more likely to be held unprotected, than is speech that is more public in character. <span class="Italic">See Barrett, supra</span> at 1198.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Put another way, a public employer, an agency, may more properly regulate speech that is most directly related to the employment milieu as opposed to the public forum. <span class="Italic">See Kannisto v. City</span> <span class="Italic">and County of San Francisco,</span> 541 F.2d 841 (9th Cir. 1976), <span class="Italic">cert</span> <span class="Italic">denied,</span> 430 U.S. 931, 97 S. Ct. 1552, 51 L. Ed.2d 775 (1977) upholding police officer's discharge for breach of regulation forbidding conduct "which tends to subvert the good order, efficiency or discipline" of the police department. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 842. In that case a Lieutenant in the Police Department made disparaging remarks about a superior officer while addressing his subordinates during a morning inspection. The Court in the course of its opinion note "...Kannisto's statements, made as they were during the regular performance of his duties, were so plainly inappropriate and disruptive, that they were without doubt beyond the pale of protection afforded by the First Amendment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 844.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Certainly in the instant case, we have a situation wherein appellant's remarks could be said to be subversive of good order, efficiency and discipline. Appellant, as a supervisory employee, and representative of management, engaged in a diatribe which was wholly subversive of management's policies with respect to promoting equal employment opportunity, and coercive and intimidating both in its intent and in its effect. If the agency were to condone conduct such as this, there would ultimately be a deleterious effect upon the working environment as well as upon the equal employment opportunity program mandated by statute, regulation and agency policy. Appellant's remarks have little or no value as public comment or information, and they are not merely tangential to the employment relationship, they are directly disruptive to it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons, we find appellant's remarks unprotected. This affirmative defense is without merit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A single comment did not establish a Title VII violation, <span class="Italic">Clark County School Dist. v. Breeden</span>, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 1509-10 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 21, 1994, respondent's male supervisor met with respondent and another male, employee to review the psychological evaluation reports of four job applicants. The report for one of the applicants disclosed that the applicant had once commented to a co-worker, "I hear making love to you is like making love to the Grand Canyon." At the meeting respondent's supervisor read the comment aloud, looked at respondent and stated, "I don't know what that means." The other employee then said, "Well, I'll tell you later," and both men chuckled. Respondent later complained about the comment to the offending employee, to Assistant Superintendent George Ann Rice, the employee's supervisor, and to another assistant superintendent of petitioner. Her first claim of retaliation asserts that she was punished for these complaints.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has applied &#x00A7; 2000e-3(a) to protect employee "oppos[ition]" not just to practices that are actually "made...unlawful by Title VII, but also to practices that the" employee <span id="Page_2672"></span>could reasonably believe were unlawful. 2000 WL 991821, at *1 (stating that respondent's opposition was protected "if she had a reasonable, good faith belief that the incident involving the sexually explicit remark constituted unlawful sexual harassment"); <span class="Italic">Trent v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court has held that Title VII is violated when the workplace is permeated with unwelcome discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult, that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment. <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 2405-06, 91 L. Ed.2d 49 (1986). The Court has explained that this standard for determining whether conduct violates Title VII takes a middle path between making actionable any conduct that is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a tangible psychological injury. It has said that mere utterance of an epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate Title VII, and that conduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment--an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive--is beyond Title VII's purview. It has also stated that, if the victim has not subjectively perceived the environment as abusive, the conduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim's employment and there is no Title VII violation. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.,</span> 510 U.S. 17, 114 S. Ct. 367, 370-71, 126 L. Ed.2d 295 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court has further indicated that the determination as to whether the environment is hostile or abusive must be made by examining all the circumstances. These may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity, whether it was physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance, and whether it unreasonably interfered with an employee's work performance. The Court also held that the effect on the employee's psychological well-being is relevant to determining whether the victim actually found the environment abusive, but is not required for a finding of harassment. 114 S. Ct. at 371. It has also explained that simple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment that would constitute sexual harassment. <span class="Italic">See Faragher v. City of Boca Raton</span>, 524 U.S. 775, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 2283, 141 L. Ed.2d 662 (1998). Thus, to meet its burden of proof on a charge of sexual harassment, an agency must establish that the allegedly harassing conduct occurred, that it was unwelcome, that it was of a sexual nature, and that it unreasonably interfered with the complainant's work performance, or created an intimidating or hostile work environment....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon evaluating all of the circumstances in this case, we believe that the administrative judge correctly concluded that, while the appellant's alleged conduct may have been crude, rude, vulgar, disrespectful, and inappropriate, it did not rise to the level of sexual harassment under Title VII because Howard did not subjectively view the appellant's behavior as abusive. <span class="Italic">See Harris.</span> Howard's testimony regarding the alleged harassment was internally inconsistent. While she stated that she did not like the appellant's comments, that she wanted the appellant to stop making the comments, and that she did not want to work around the appellant's "cussing," she also testified that she could deal with his name calling, and was not concerned with his cursing. She further testified that she did not mind working with the appellant, and did not want him to lose his job. The agency's claim that Howard was offended by the appellant's use of obscenities also loses credibility in light of evidence that she routinely used similar language. Thus, the agency has not established that the appellant's alleged conduct unreasonably interfered with Howard's work performance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A single remark was not enough to show sexual harassment if it was not part of a pattern of conduct to create an intimidating, offensive, or hostile environment. <span class="Italic">Walls v. USPS</span>, 10 MSPR 274, 280 (1982). Under <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Doyle</span>, 42 MSPR 376, 381-82 (1989), a single offensive remark to a woman would not constitute sexual harassment without a showing of psychological damage. Because the charge against the appellant was limited to the one remark, the Board would not expand on the charge to allow the conduct to be considered part of a pattern of conduct: "Because the charge involved a single occurrence directed toward a single individual, a finding of severe, pervasive, and frequent objectional conduct is impossible." A court discerned no sexual harassment in an isolated joke and conversation about a sexual matter that, though offensive or in poor taste, did not persist and did not "poison" the work environment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rennie v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hayes v. TVA</span>, 4 MSPR 411, 413-16, 4 MSPB 466 (1980), provides an example of actionable sexual harassment, including offensive remarks:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant, a grade M-5 Supervisor at the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), Knoxville, Tennessee, was suspended from December 5, 1979, to January 3, 1980 based on charges of conduct constituting sexual harassment of subordinate female employees in violation of TVA's equal employment opportunity (EEO) policy, and the misuse of government property. These charges were made by the TVA as a result of an agency investigation of charges of sexual harassment which were filed by certain female employees of the Watts Bar facility. Specifically, appellant was charged with:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Creating the appearance of using TVA time and property in the appellant's position as a supervisor to pursue a personal relationship with a female subordinate employee...;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Misusing government property and time by taking Ms. X (a female subordinate employee) on tours of the plant at least six times in a TVA vehicle and on TVA time although she had no responsibility or duty requiring her to be in the field;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Making continual suggestive remarks to TVA female employees <span id="Page_2673"></span>Ms. X and Kim Robbins without directly proposing sexual activities;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Rubbing the back and neck of Ms. X; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;Showing Ms. X a picture of the body of a naked woman attached to a picture of her head from a photograph previously taken by the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant timely appealed his suspension to the Board and denied the charges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After a three-day evidentiary hearing, the presiding official upheld all of the charges as established by the preponderance of the evidence, except for the fourth charge of "rubbing the back and neck of Ms. X." The presiding official further held that, based on the sustained charges, appellant's conduct constituted sexual harassment in violation of the agency's EEO regulations. He concluded that the efficiency of the service was promoted by appellant's suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official found that besides giving preferential treatment to a subordinate female employee with whom he pursued a personal relationship, appellant engaged in a pattern of conduct of making sexually oriented remarks to subordinate female employees, including the time that, without her knowledge, he took Ms. X picture at a Christmas party and had a cut-out of her face pasted on a nude centerfold picture. The presiding official also found that appellant had made sexually suggestive remarks on three other occasions. The first was when he told Ms. X that the time had come to "make his move" when they were both sitting in a parked vehicle after her employment interview. The second time was when appellant gave both Ms. X and another female employee, Ms. Robbins, tee shirts with the imprinted words "Nuclear Power--safer than sex."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although appellant was not specifically charged with discriminatory sexual harassment, we note that such continuing conduct on the part of the appellant, even to the extent of showing a nude centerfold-type picture with the head of a subordinate female employee attached to the reproduction of the body, without her permission, may be analyzed in that context. Even though the presiding official did not conclude that employment opportunities were conditioned on acquiescence to advances or sexual propositions (in fact, Ms. X was employed notwithstanding having, according to her testimony, rejected the appellant's advances), such an inference might have been drawn because sexually oriented conduct directed at female employees, particularly of an abusive nature, is tolerated by them in most cases only in order to keep their jobs. Thus, acquiescence to such behavior often constitutes a term or condition of employment even if in an individual instance the supervisory employee does not retaliate against an employee who fails to reciprocate his advances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are aware that most cases brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e, <span class="Italic">et seq.,</span> alleging sexual harassment or discrimination have involved situations where a female employee was in some way retaliated against for refusing to reciprocate a supervisor's advances. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Barnes v. Costle,</span> 561 F.2d 983 (D.C. Cir. 1977), where the plaintiff alleged that her job was abolished because she refused her male supervisor's sexual advances. It has also been held that to make a sex discrimination claim under Title VII a female employee must show that her "employment was in fact conditioned on acquiescence to romantic advances." <span class="Italic">Fisher v. Flynn,</span> 598 F.2d 663, 665 (1st Cir. 1979).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, what is involved in this case is more than simply a proposition made to a subordinate female employee by her supervisor on a single isolated incident. Rather, there is here a course of abusive and offensive behavior which, if directed in large part to female employees, is discriminatory.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, in line with case law, has promulgated guidelines on sex discrimination which provide that sexually oriented conduct constitutes sex discrimination, whether verbal or physical, where it "has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Brown v. City of Guthrie,</span> 22 FEP cases 1627 (W.D. Okla. 1980), the court found that a supervisor's practice of continually directing sexually oriented comments and other nonverbal conduct to a subordinate female employee, which became so unbearable that she felt forced to resign, constituted sexual harassment and discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Kyriazi v. Western Electric Co.,</span> 461 F. Supp. 894, 924-936 (D. N.J. 1978), where the court held that the creation of an indecent cartoon, which humiliated the plaintiff as a woman, was unlawfully discriminatory.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant also contended that, based on his corroborated testimony, Ms. X appeared pleased with the naked caricature and thus it was not discrimination. That contention must be rejected for, as the presiding official found, even if true, her laughter may have only been a means of disguising deeper feelings of humiliation which, if uncovered, may well have exposed her to more ridicule. She testified that she reacted with feelings of humiliation and embarrassment. Also, in that the conduct was that of her supervisor--appellant--it was inherently coercive. She testified that she would have complained sooner had she not feared losing her job. It can hardly be said that she consented to the caricature when it was made without her knowledge. The fact that she allowed her picture to be taken for another purpose does not give rise to the inference, implied by appellant, that she knew all along what he was going to do with it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As offensive as it was by itself, that incident was only part of the continuing conduct of appellant towards subordinate female employees which, according to Ms. X, culminated in a nervous condition requiring hospitalization.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Rogers v. EEOC,</span> 454 F.2d 234, 238 (5th Cir. 1971), <span class="Italic">cert.</span> <span class="Italic">denied,</span> 406 U.S. 957, 92 S. Ct. 2058, 32 L. Ed.2d 343 (1979), the Fifth Circuit said that "employees' psychological as well as economic fringes [that is, fringe benefits] are statutorily entitled to protection from employer abuse." We believe that the agency also has an interest in maintaining a working environment that is free from supervisory abuse and harassment of employees based on their sex.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Inasmuch as the presiding official's findings that appellant's sexually suggestive conduct toward subordinate female employees had a detrimental effect on the efficiency of the service in a variety of ways, including the misuse of government time and property as well as the likelihood of causing feelings of humiliation and embarrassment on the part of subordinate employees, are more than amply supported by the evidence, the holding for the agency applied the correct statutory standard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Attempting to distinguish sexual harassment and objectionable verbal conduct not constituting harassment, <span class="Italic">Brim v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 494, 498-99 (1991), mitigated the penalty imposed from a demotion to a suspension for remarks on the shop floor:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petition for review sets forth no basis to disturb the administrative judge's finding that the sexual remarks made in conversations held during the workday, on the workroom floor, in the presence of female employees, constitute conduct unbecoming a Postal Service employee. According to the Postal Service Standards of Conduct, each employee is expected to "maintain satisfactory personal habits so as not to be obnoxious or offensive to other persons or to create unpleasant working conditions." As detailed by the administrative judge, the agency has proven the charged conduct and such conduct is clearly violative of this policy. The agency has not proven the charge of sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In listing "various forms" that sexual harassment can take, the agency policy notes "making or threatening to make employment decisions based on an employee's submission to or rejection of sexual advances or requests for sexual favors"; "deliberate or repeated unsolicited remarks with a sexual connotation or physical contacts of a sexual nature that are unwelcome to the recipient"; and "a sustained hostile and abusive work environment so severe that it changes the terms and conditions of one's employment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first two forms of harassment are personal in nature and clearly require more than a mere expression of vulgarisms within hearing of the employees. The third form recognizes that offensive sexual conduct--even though not specifically and deliberately directed at any one or more individuals--may, nonetheless, under certain conditions, rise to tho level of "sexual harassment." The agency must demonstrate that such conduct has resulted in a sustained, hostile and abusive work environment, so severe as to change the terms and conditions of employment. In either instance, there must be egregious conduct or the pursuit of specific individuals in order to prove "sexual harassment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, there is no evidence that the appellant had directed his comments at any of the female employees. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the appellant's comments resulted in a "sustained hostile and abusive work environment." Even the offensive language itself did not appear to be unduly explicit or shocking to several of the employees. They described it as "showing off," "said in a joking way," "not said with bad intention or to offend anyone," "made like in jest." For the most part, the conversations consisted of two supervisors speaking to each other in voices loud enough to be overheard and boasting to each other of their sexual prowess. Offensive, certainly, but not sexual harassment under the agency's policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the sustained reason for the agency's action, that the remarks constitute conduct unbecoming a Postal Service employee, and noting that neither the appellant nor the agency now specifically dispute the administrative judge's finding on the penalty, we conclude that the administrative judge properly mitigated the penalty of a demotion to a 30-day suspension under the circumstances of this case. The Board has found that a 30-day suspension is the maximum reasonable penalty for the type of conduct at issue in this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">LaFever v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 31 MSPR 644, 646-47 (1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_2674"></span>Another decision sustained a 30-day suspension of a shipboard supervisor who used repeated offensive, sexually demeaning comments toward two female employees. In the Board's judgment, the supervisor expressed no recognition of the seriousness of his misconduct, meaning that the potential for rehabilitation was limited at best. The Board discounted as a mitigating factor the appellant's suggestion that the women who lodged complaints appeared to do so in order to avoid their own discipline for apparently leaving their posts of duty, <span class="Italic">Mann v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 54 MSPR 693, 699 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Board precedent also supports the reasonableness of the agency's penalty selection. Recently, the Board addressed an appeal in which two male supervisors spoke to each other in voices loud enough to be heard and boasted to each other of their sexual prowess<span class="Italic">. See Brim v. United States Postal Service</span>, 49 MSPR 494, 499 (1991). The Board found that their conversation was not directed at any of the female employees, and that the offensive language used did not appear unduly explicit or shocking to several of the employees; it found that the conversation did not even rise to the level of sexual harassment according to the agency's regulations<span class="Italic">. See Brim</span>, 49 MSPR at 499. Nevertheless, the Board still held that a thirty day suspension was the maximum reasonable penalty for the offensive language at issue in the case<span class="Italic">. See id.</span>, citing <span class="Italic">LaFever v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 31 MSPR 644, 646-47 (1986). This appeal involves a sustained charge of actual, deliberate, repeated sexual harassment by a supervisor, who directed "vituperative," "demeaning," and "insulting" comments at two female employees, and who expresses no recognition of the seriousness of his misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In conclusion, it was error for the administrative judge to find that the agency's penalty selection fell outside the tolerable limits of reasonableness<span class="Italic">. See Douglas</span>, 5 MSPR at 305, 306. While the penalty might not represent the balance that the administrative judge would have struck, the record evidence does not show that the agency's determination was unreasonable under the circumstances<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. at 306. The appellant's thirty-day suspension is sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Campbell v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 72 MSPR 480, 486-87 (1996), was remanded to an AJ for consideration of whether remarks by appellant to a coworker warranted a 60-day suspension for violation of either EEOC regulations defining sexual harassment or an agency regulation prohibiting sexually offensive conduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A finding of whether a working environment is "hostile" within the meaning of Title VII can only be determined by considering the totality of the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Harris</span>, 510 U.S. at 20-23, 114 S. Ct. at 369-371. Here, the administrative judge erred in failing to make findings on the cumulative effect of all of the appellant's alleged sexually offensive remarks on the work environment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">King</span>, 21 F.3d at 1580 (in determining whether alleged conduct constitutes sexual harassment under Title VII, the entire conduct must be considered).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Worsham stated that the appellant had commented to a group of employees, as she walked by, that if he had "tits and ass," he would have a good performance appraisal. She also stated that the appellant referred to her as a "biker slut" to Kim Stramski, a co-worker, and that he also told Stramski that she (Worsham) wore a low-cut "appraisal blouse" during appraisal time, and that the only reason she received a good performance rating was "because of her anatomy." In addition, Worsham stated that the appellant said that she had "something going on" with her supervisor, Bobby Young. Moreover, she stated that, after his wife's death, the appellant told her that it was too bad she was married because otherwise, they could "run off together with the insurance money." The administrative judge based her finding, in part, on the lack of frequency of the appellant's remarks. In finding that the appellant's conduct did not rise to the level of sexual harassment, however, she addressed only the "tits and ass" remark, the "biker slut" comment, which she found not proven, and the reference to Worsham's "appraisal blouse." She did not address any of the other alleged sexually offensive statements attributed to the appellant by Worsham, and thus failed to determine whether these statements were proven and, if so, whether the appellant's "entire conduct" created a hostile working environment. <span class="Italic">See King</span>, 21 F.3d at 1580; <span class="Italic">Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 2 MSPB 2, 1 MSPR 587, 589 (1980) (an initial decision must identify all material issues of fact and law, summarize the evidence, resolve issues of credibility, and include the administrative judge's conclusions of law and his legal reasoning, as well as the authorities on which that reasoning rests).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also determined that Worsham "never told the appellant that she was offended or that he should stop making such remarks." In her affidavit, however, Worsham stated that, when the appellant remarked that she had "something going on" with her supervisor, she told him it was not true, and to stop making remarks of that nature. She also stated that she brought the appellant's conduct to the attention of her supervisor, Bobby Young. These statements were unrebutted by the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we note that the administrative judge failed to address the evidence in the record concerning the psychological effect of the appellant's conduct on Worsham. Worsham testified that at one point she "fell apart" and started crying as a result of the appellant's conduct. Moreover, in her affidavit, she stated that she had to go to the base clinic for treatment, and also filed an Office of Workers' Compensation Programs claim, due to the stress created by the appellant's conduct. This evidence was supported by the testimony of other witnesses. If proven, the effect of the appellant's conduct on the employee's psychological well-being is relevant to a determination of whether the employee found the work environment abusive<span class="Italic">. See King</span>, 21 F.3d at 1580; <span class="Italic">Spithaler</span>, 1 MSPR at 589.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Notwithstanding the suggestion in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> that a harassment case requires an examination of the "totality of the circumstances," the AJ may decline to allow evidence of an office atmosphere of sexual joking and innuendo. At issue is the conduct toward a single individual, exacerbated by offensive touching. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lowe v. DOJ</span>, 63 MSPR 73, 77 (1994); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Davis v.

<p class="Body-Text">Calling a subordinate a "sweet thing" more than once violated the agency Code of Ethical Conduct, requiring that employees maintain satisfactory personal habits so as not to be obnoxious or offensive to other persons or to create unpleasant working conditions. Removal was mitigated to a 30-day suspension for a number of reasons, including the appellant's long past record and the improper characterization by the AJ of the conduct as sexual harassment rather than as a violation of the agency's regulations. <span class="Italic">Dubiel v. USPS</span>, 54 MSPR 428, 433-34 (1992) (assessment of the propriety of the appellant's behavior was not to be based on whether a female employee objected to it, although "that might affect the seriousness of the misconduct for purposes of determining the penalty"; "while the appellant's form of address to a subordinate cannot be condoned, we find that a 30-day suspension should effectively deliver that message to him and would impose a monetary loss more proportionate to the offense"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Tryon v. USPS</span>, 108 MSPR 148, 152 &#x00B6; 9, 2008 MSPB 35 (2008) (mitigating removal to a 60-day suspension of a letter carrier who hugged a postal customer); <span class="Italic">McManus v.

<p class="Body-Text">"The Board has held that removal is a proper penalty when a supervisor makes inappropriate comments of a sexual nature to co-workers." <span class="Italic">Batten v. USPS</span>, 101 MSPR 222, 228 &#x00B6; 14, 2006 MSPB 35 (2006) (citing<span class="Italic"> Alberto v. VA</span>, 98 MSPR 50, 53-59, 62 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 12 (2004); <span class="Italic">Luongo v.

DOJ</span>, 95 MSPR 643, 648 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15 (2004), sustained removal of a supervisory correctional officer who made sexually vulgar remarks to an agency contractor employee and to employees of the institution. An investigation showed that the appellant's acts were carried out over a period years, that he knew that his behavior was inappropriate, and, because the appellant was in charge of the facility's investigations, the recipients of his comments were unlikely to have complained. <span class="Italic">Alberto v. VA</span>, 98 MSPR 50 (2004), upheld removal, setting aside mitigation by an AJ, of a supervisory health systems specialist who engaged in a considerable number of inappropriate remarks and emails of a sexual nature to other employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lentine v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 94 MSPR 676, 682 &#x00B6; 13 (2003) (appellant was removed for sending an apparently objectionable email to a female employee after being previously warned not to contact that individual and having been previously reprimanded for conduct toward that individual; the agency did not need to wait until the conduct constituted sexual harassment).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Morrison v. NASA</span>, 65 MSPR 348, 357-58 (1994), affirmed suspension of an employee who stored sexually explicit materials on his computer and displayed the materials to female coworkers:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was not charged with sexual harassment and his appeal has not been adjudicated under such a charge. However, it is clear that an agency need not wait to discipline an employee until his or her inappropriate sexually offensive conduct becomes so pervasive and offensive that it constitutes unlawful discrimination under a hostile work environment theory. <span class="Italic">Carosella v. US Postal Service</span>, 816 F.2d 638, 643 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Brim v. US Postal Service</span>, 49 MSPR 494, 497-99 (1991). Rather, an agency may discipline an employee for "such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service" and we find that exposing coworkers in the work environment to sexually explicit material meets that standard. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the training material that the agency contended informed the appellant that his conduct was unacceptable specifically addressed sexual harassment, that material clearly stated that examples of hostile work environment sexual harassment included posters or calendars depicting partially clad women or men. Thus, the appellant was on notice that displaying such material in the workplace was inappropriate and he should have known that maintaining it on his agency computer was equally inappropriate. Accordingly, the agency properly charged the appellant with misconduct based on his sexually offensive conduct even though it did not constitute sexual harassment and, in selecting the penalty, properly considered the clarity with which he was on notice that such conduct was unacceptable in the work environment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As noted by the agency in the proposal notice, the introduction of sexually explicit material into the work environment could create <span id="Page_2675"></span>a debilitating and potentially discriminatory work environment and its presence inherently impedes the full inclusion of all employees as professional equals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we are unaware of any prior Board or Federal Circuit decisions in which an employee has been disciplined for exposing individuals in the work environment to sexually explicit material, the Board has held that a 30-day suspension is reasonable for poisoning the work environment with sexual comments or names. In <span class="Italic">Brim</span>, 49 MSPR at 499, the Board found that a 30-day suspension was the maximum reasonable penalty for the appellant's misconduct of making sexually explicit remarks during a loud conversation with a coworker that was overheard by other employees. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Dubiel v. US Postal Service</span>, 54 MSPR 428, 433-35 (1992), the Board found that a 30-day suspension was the maximum reasonable penalty for the appellant's misconduct of calling a female subordinate employee "sweet thing" on more than one occasion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Navy</span>, DA-0752-14-0285-I-1 (NP 7/5/2016) (upholding six-grade demotion: "The appellant further argues that the penalty of a six-grade demotion was outside the bounds of reasonableness. In support of his claim, he cites <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Small Business Administration</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 168 (2014), in which the Board found that a 60-day suspension and a one-grade demotion was the maximum reasonable penalty for a public affairs specialist found to have sent sexually oriented images and videos from his work computer. However, the misconduct at issue in this case is far more serious, in that the appellant shared a stolen nude image of his own subordinate employee with another subordinate employee. Moreover, in <span class="Italic">Chavez</span>, the Board mitigated the penalty based in part on a finding that the misconduct took place in an environment in which such conduct was condoned. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 17.").
