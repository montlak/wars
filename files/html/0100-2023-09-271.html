<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-268"><span class="space">3.</span> Privacy Act</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Occasional objections are raised to disclosure of information about witnesses or persons other than the appellant. Agencies invoke the Privacy Act by asserting that the Act prohibits the release of information from agency files concerning the identity of individuals whose names appear in those files. The Privacy Act is complex and will not be analyzed here; it is sufficient to comment that its purpose is not to regulate discovery in civil actions. The Federal Rules serve that function. Those rules provide the means for protecting individuals from annoyance and embarrassment. If the agency or appellant believes that individuals will be harassed or embarrassed if they are identified as witnesses, an application may be made for a protective order. Their office telephone numbers could be released, with an agreement to allow them to be interviewed at their offices rather than at their homes; it could be ordered that information released pertaining to them be sealed by the Board and that counsel not disclose the information to persons other than their clients, with similar restrictions on their clients. If an agency is sufficiently concerned that release of information in Board discovery will lead to a Privacy Act lawsuit by the subject of these records, application should be made to the AJ for a subpoena enforceable by the Board through a district court. The court has authority to direct release of the records pursuant to 5 USC 552a(b)(11). <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Hall v. VA</span>, 67 MSPR 622, 628 (1995) (discussing authority of Board to enforce subpoena through district court proceedings when a statute provided protection against administrative disclosure of records pertaining to treatment or claims of veterans). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Laxalt v. McClatchy</span>, 809 F.2d 885 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (the Privacy Act does not act as bar to civil discovery, although a court may require greater than usual scrutiny of objections to disclosure, <span class="Italic">in camera</span> inspection, and protective orders).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The interrelated restrictions of the Privacy Act and FOIA were described by the FLRA in <span class="Italic">SSA, San Francisco Bay Area and AFGE Local 3172</span>, 51 FLRA 58, 59 n.3 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Privacy Act regulates the disclosure of any information contained in an agency "record" within a "system of records," as those terms are defined in the Act, that is retrieved by reference to an individual's name or some other personal identifier. 5 USC &#x00A7; 552a(a)(4), (5). With certain enumerated exceptions, the Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of personal information about Federal employees without their consent. Section (b)(2) of the Privacy Act provides that the prohibition against disclosure is not applicable if disclosure of the requested information would be required under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 552 (FOIA). Exemption (b)(6) of the FOIA provides, in turn, that information contained in "personnel and medical files and similar files" may be withheld if disclosure of the information would constitute a "clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy[.] " 5 USC &#x00A7; 552(b)(6). If such an invasion would result, then disclosure is not required by the FOIA. In addition to the exception relating to the FOIA, other exceptions to the Privacy Act may permit disclosure of requested information. However, no other exceptions are asserted to apply in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies frequently invoke the Privacy Act to avoid disclosure of records sought during discovery--particularly records showing disparate or discriminatory treatment of an appellant. A response to a Privacy Act objection may include an analysis of any public interest involved in the disclosure that tends to make any invasion of privacy more rather than less warranted. Another area of examination is that of the "routine use" exceptions contained in agency records system notices defining permitted disclosures under the Privacy Act. Those routine uses include the authority to disclose information upon issuance of an administrative or judicial subpoena, or the allowance of disclosure in the <span id="Page_1258"></span>course of personnel litigation. If the "routine use" covers the disclosure, that should be the end of the dispute over the Privacy Act objection. Consideration should also be given to OPM's regulation, 5 CFR 293.311 (2022), describing the categories of information concerning federal employees that are subject to mandatory disclosure. If the regulation covers the information requested, the dispute should be at an end.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There is little law concerning the relation between the Privacy Act and rules governing discovery in judicial and administrative litigation. It is essential to determine whether the Privacy Act even applies to a discovery request. The Board considered the interplay of the Privacy Act and discovery procedures in <span class="Italic">Eaks v. DOJ</span>, 18 MSPR 328, 333-34 (1983). The appellant obtained a discovery order requiring the agency to provide records maintained on inmates of the Bureau of Prisons. The agency refused to produce the materials, contending that they were exempted from disclosure under the Privacy Act. The Board decided that the agency failed to establish that the Privacy Act and the agency records system descriptions or notices applied to the records requested, and sanctions were imposed for the agency's refusal to produce the material:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Act forbids agencies that maintain records about individuals from disclosing the information "to any person, or to another agency" without the consent of the individual to whom it pertains. 5 USC 552a(b). This prohibition on disclosure to third parties, however, applies only to records contained within a "system of records" maintained by the agency. To be recognized as being within a "system of records" for the purpose of the Privacy Act, the records must be retrievable by the individual's name or other identifying particular. Absent inclusion of the records in a system of records, the assertion of Privacy Act protection is groundless....&#8197;Therefore, prior to the Board's recognition of an agency's Privacy Act claim of protection, the agency has the burden of identifying the existence of the respective system of records.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the agency has not proven that the records at issue were kept within a "system of records" under the Privacy Act. It has offered nothing more in support of its resistance to discovery than the conclusory assertion that the Privacy Act prohibits their production. The agency has not shown that the inmate medical files are maintained within a "system of records" for the purpose of the Privacy Act nor has it identified the respective system. Therefore, the agency's defense...is not established.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board repeated the admonition that an objection to production of records based on the Privacy Act must be supported by a showing that the records in dispute are within the statute's coverage in <span class="Italic">Giltner v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 39 MSPR 253, 257 (1988). <span class="Italic">Giltner</span> added that, should the Privacy Act preclude access to the records, the agency should provide to the appellant the most current address available of the persons to whom the records pertain so that appellant may seek their permission to have limited access to their records:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the Administrative Judge concludes that these records are within a system of records, he must then consider whether appellant should be permitted access to them. The Privacy Act's prohibitions against release are not absolute. For example, even if records are within an agency's system of records, the records must be disclosed if disclosure of the record is for a "routine use." 5 USC &#x00A7; 552a(b)(3). In this case, we take official notice, pursuant to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.67, that the agency has identified certain medical records as within its system of records, and that disclosure of such records to the MSPB is for a routine use published by the agency pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 552a(e)(4)....&#8197;If the requested records are in fact within the agency's system of records, then the agency must show why disclosure of these medical records cannot be effected as a routine use.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, if findings on the foregoing questions do not result in access to the records, the Administrative Judge should order the agency to provide to appellant the most current address available of the persons to whom the records pertain so that appellant may seek their permission to have limited access to their records. 5 USC &#x00A7; 552a(b). In doing so, the appellant should advise the interested persons that the records will be sealed upon their request from further scrutiny outside the confines of this proceeding to minimize privacy intrusions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Not discussed in <span class="Italic">Giltner</span> was the body of case law developed by the FLRA and its reviewing courts suggesting that employees have a privacy interest in their home addresses. [Refer to Broida's <span class="Italic">A Guide to Federal Labor Relations Authority Law and Practice</span> (<a href="https://deweypub.com/store/23FLRA.html">Dewey Publications, Inc</a>. 2023).] The Board commented on whether the Privacy Act bars disclosure of an address of a witness in <span class="Italic">Black v. DHUD</span>, 42 MSPR 83, 87-88 (1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he administrative judge should determine whether the witness is a federal employee and obtain from the agency the name of her employing agency in order to make a request for her attendance at the hearing. If she is not a federal employee, the administrative judge should adjudicate the question of whether the agency may validly protect the release of the witness's address pursuant to the Privacy Act. The Board has determined that the first step in the analysis of any such claim is to determine whether the requested information is maintained in a "system of records" as defined by the Privacy Act. If the records are not retrieved by the subject's name or personal identifier, they are not within a system of records and a Privacy Act assertion of privilege is groundless....&#8197;Even if the address is within a system of records, the Privacy Act privilege is not absolute; for example, the Act permits disclosure if the information is for a "routine use."...&#8197;Further, in making a determination on whether otherwise protected information should be released, the privacy interest to be protected must be balanced against the public interest in disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this regard, we note that although a person has a valid privacy interest in protecting his name and address from disclosure, the courts have often held that the invasion of privacy effected by such disclosure is not as serious as it would be by the disclosure of more personal information. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy v. Federal Labor Relations Authority,</span> 840 F.2d 1131, 1136 (3rd Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">cert. dismissed</span>, __U.S.__, 109 S. Ct. 632, 102 L. Ed.2d 170 (1988)<span class="Italic">. See also U.S. Department of the Air Force v. Federal Labor</span> <span class="Italic">Relations Authority,</span> 838 F.2d 229, 232 (7th Cir. 1988) (where the data in question are widely disseminated, the secrecy and seclusion components of privacy are "minuscule"); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1760 v. Federal Labor Relations</span> <span class="Italic">Authority,</span> 786 F.2d 554, 556 (2d Cir. 1986) (the privacy interest of the average employee in his address is "not particularly compelling").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In comparison, it would appear that, whatever benefit may be derived by disclosure to the appellant personally, the public interest in disclosure to the Board itself is substantial, given the Board's important role in hearing and deciding federal employee appeals. Such disclosure would help effectuate the statutory purpose of fair adjudication while nondisclosure would tend to frustrate it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If necessary, therefore, on remand, the administrative judge must balance such factors, after receiving argument from the parties, and determine whether the agency may be compelled to release Ms. Kraeme's last address of record to the appellant or to the Board....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Biddle v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 63 MSPR 521, 531 (1994), approved redaction to resolve disputes over disclosure of personal information concerning comparable discipline:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that the administrative judge erred in denying the appellant's motion to compel answers to interrogatories 36 and 37, asking for information about employees accused of sexual harassment. We find that such information is relevant to the appellant's discrimination defense. The agency's objection that the Privacy Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 552a, precludes it from providing information regarding such misconduct can be overcome by redacting the name and any identifying information. On remand, the agency shall respond by providing the appellant with sanitized information.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Privacy Act antidisclosure provisions are raised to avoid civil (or criminal) liability by agencies and their officials through litigation initiated by individuals (other than the appellant) named in the records. <span class="Italic">Pippinger v. Rubin</span>, 129 F.3d 519, 530-33 (10th Cir. 1997), considered a claim by the plaintiff that information pertaining to a disciplinary action against him as an agency employee was disclosed in violation of the Privacy Act to (a) attorneys for another employee who, prosecuting an appeal before the MSPB, obtained that information during Board discovery procedures; and (b) agency officials defending the MSPB case. The court concluded the disclosures were consistent with the records system notice describing the uses of the information. Additionally, the plaintiff did not demonstrate that he was harmed by the disclosures. Finally, the disclosures did not meet the "intentional or willful" standard set by the Act defined by the court to be "action so patently egregious and unlawful that anyone undertaking the conduct should have known it unlawful, or conduct committed without grounds for believing it to be lawful or action flagrantly disregarding others' rights under the Act":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During Patrick Schluck's MSPB proceeding, IRS District Director Stephen Taylor, Administrative Officer Stephen Webb, and IRS labor relations specialists Joni Probasco and DeWayne Wicks each gave deposition testimony in which they "disclosed information from the ALERTS system and from his personnel records concerning John Pippinger." This deposition testimony was heard by IRS attorney Susan Neiser, and was also heard by a private attorney representing Schluck, a court reporter, and Schluck himself. The district court found that these disclosures did not violate Pippinger's rights under the Privacy Act because they were authorized by either the "need to know" exception of 5 USC &#x00A7; 552a(b)(1) (1994), or the "routine use" exception of 5 USC &#x00A7; 552a(b)(3) (1994)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pippinger responds, first, by asserting that there was no need for Webb, Probasco and Wicks to disclose the information about Pippinger's case (especially Pippinger's name) that they disclosed in their depositions. Second, Pippinger claims that disclosure of information obtained from Pippinger's records to the MSPB at Schluck's MSPB proceeding was unauthorized by the Privacy Act. Third, Pippinger claims that deposition testimony is not a "routine use" of the records kept in the ALERTS system, and that the Privacy Act therefore prohibited any disclosure from Pippinger's records to Schluck, Schluck's attorney, and the court reporter, none of whom were then employed by the IRS. We address each of Pippinger's three arguments in turn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Taylor, Webb, Probasco, and Wicks each "needed to know" the <span id="Page_1259"></span>information contained in Pippinger's Appeals, Grievances and Complaint System files and General Personnel and Payroll Records System files, in connection with their duties to investigate the allegations against Pippinger and recommend or implement a disposition. For similar reasons, IRS attorney Neiser also "needed to know" the record information about the Pippinger/Boak incident. Although Neiser was not involved in investigating <span class="Italic">Pippinger's</span> case, Neiser was charged with defending the IRS's actions in <span class="Italic">Schluck's</span> MSPB proceeding. The IRS's primary charge against Schluck was that Schluck had presided over disciplinary proceedings in which Pippinger was accused of having a romantic affair with a subordinate, while Schluck himself was in a romantic relationship with a subordinate. The IRS's position with respect to Schluck would have been rendered incomprehensible to Neiser if Neiser had not been apprised of Pippinger's situation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">What's more, the "routine use" exception permits far more disclosure of records than does the "need to know' exception<span class="Italic">. See generally</span> Deborah Sprenger, Annotation, <span class="Italic">What Constitutes "Routine Use" Disclosure</span> <span class="Italic">of Employee Records Exempted from Provisions of Privacy Act of 1974 Under 5 USC &#x00A7; 552a(b)(3)</span>, 107 A.L.R. Fed 857 (1992 &#x0026; Supp. 1995). The "routine use" exception permits disclosure of an otherwise protected record whenever such disclosure would be "for a routine use." 5 USC &#x00A7; 552a(b)(3) (1994). A "routine use" is defined as "the use of such record for a purpose which is compatible with the purpose for which it was collected." 5 USC &#x00A7; 552a(a)(7) (1994). Agencies that maintain a system of records are required to publish in the Federal Register a notice of "each routine use of the records contained in the system, including the categories of users and the purpose of each use." 5 USC &#x00A7; 552a(e)(4)(D) (1994). Records may be disclosed under the "routine use" exception only "under a routine use published...for the system of records covering [the disclosed] records." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 293.406 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Pippinger's records, though stored in the ALERTS system, were culled from two systems of records described in the Federal Register: the Appeals, Grievance, and Complaint System; and the General Personnel and Payroll Records System. The routine uses of records in both systems have been defined in the Federal Register to include "provid[ing]records and information to the...Merit Systems Protection Board...for the purpose of properly administering Federal Personnel Systems in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, and regulations." 57 Fed. Reg. 14,056, 14,057 (Appeals, Grievance, and Complaint System); <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 14,059 (General Personnel and Payroll Records System).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This language is broad enough to authorize the disclosure of <span class="Italic">Pippinger's</span> records to the Merit Systems Protection Board during the course of <span class="Italic">Scluck's</span> MSPB proceeding, so long as such disclosure is made "for the purpose of properly administering Federal Personnel Systems." In the case at bar, Pippinger has presented no evidence suggesting that his records were disclosed to the MSPB for any other purpose. Accordingly, the disclosures made by Taylor, Webb, Probasco, Wicks, and Neiser to the MSPB were authorized, "routine uses" of Pippinger's records.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The disclosures to Schluck, Schluck's attorney, and the court reporter were similarly made in conjunction with the MSPB proceeding and, accordingly, fall within the same "routine use" exception. One of the published uses for these systems of records is to allow the IRS to "disclose relevant, <span class="Italic">nonprivileged</span> information to a court, magistrate, or administrative tribunal, including...disclosure to opposing counsel or witnesses in the course of civil discovery...." 57 Fed. Reg. 14,056, 14,057 (Apr. 17, 1992) (Appeals, Grievance, and Complaint System) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">accord id.</span> at 14,059 (General Personnel and Payroll Records System). To avoid circularity, the qualifier "non-privileged" can only refer to privileges existing outside of the Privacy Act itself, such as the attorney-client privilege or the doctor-patient privilege. Otherwise, this particular "routine use" exception could never be invoked. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Laxalt v. McClatchy,</span> 809 F.2d 885, 888 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (analyzing the "pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction" exception to the Privacy Act (5 USC &#x00A7; 552a(b)(11)) and holding that the Act does not create any additional privileges that would collide with the federal civil rules of discovery); <span class="Italic">Bosaw v. National Treasury</span> <span class="Italic">Employees' Union,</span> 887 F. Supp. 1199, 1216 (S.D. Ind. 1995) (same). Thus, the disclosures to Schluck, Schluck's attorney, and the court reporter were authorized under the "routine use" exception to the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, we hold that Pippinger has no cause of action against the IRS for two additional reasons. First, Pippinger has presented no evidence indicating that the disclosures to Schluck, Schluck's attorney, or the court reporter, could possibly have had "an adverse effect" on Pippinger, as required under 5 USC &#x00A7; 552a(g)(1)(D) (1994); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also Parks v. Internal Revenue Serv.,</span> 618 F.2d 677, 682 (10th Cir. 1980) (Privacy Act plaintiff must be adversely affected by the violation in order to state a cause of action). Although Schluck no longer worked for the IRS at the time of the disclosure, he had been privy to every event described in Pippinger's records at the time the event occurred. We simply fail to see how disclosure to Schluck of facts already known to Schluck could "adversely affect" Pippinger. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> George Chamberlin, Annotation, <span class="Italic">Applicability of &#x00A7; 3(b) of Privacy Act of 1974 (5 USC &#x00A7; 552a(b)), Requiring IndividualAs Consent to Disclosure of Agency Records Maintained on Individual, To Disclosure of Information Otherwise Known to Federal Agency or Official</span>, 52 A.L.R.Fed 579 (1981 &#x0026; Supp. 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, Schluck would certainly have discussed with his attorney the events leading to Schluck's demotion. In doing so, Schluck could not have avoided telling the attorney about the Pippinger affair. Thus, Schluck's attorney, like Schluck, would already have known the "disclosed" information about Pippinger at the time of the disclosure. Finally, Pippinger has made no attempt to explain how disclosure to the court reporter adversely affected him. Thus, we hold that Pippinger has not satisfied the "adverse effect" requirement of 5 USC 552a(g)(1)(D) (1994).[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Pippinger has also failed to show that any such disclosure violated the "intentional or willful" requirement of &#x00A7; 552(a)(g)(4) (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">Kent v. SSA</span>, DE-0752-16-0391-I-1 (NP 10/27/2022), said of a Privacy Act objection concerning the agency's misconduct investigation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged that the agency violated Article 3-6(G) of the CBA, which provides that, "[i]n conducting investigations regarding a non-criminal matter that may result in an adverse determination...the parties are reminded that the Privacy Act requires that, to the extent practicable, information should be initially collected directly from the subject employee." It is unclear whether the agency conducted an "investigation" as contemplated by Article 3-6(G) prior to proposing the appellant's 30-day suspension, but the question of whether the agency complied with the Privacy Act is not one over which the Board has jurisdiction. <span class="italic">Social Security Administration v. Carr</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 313, 333 n.3 (1998), <span class="italic">aff'd</span>, 185 F.3d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 1999); <span class="italic">see also Martin v. Department of the Army</span>, 251 F.3d 170 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Table) (holding that alleged violations of the Privacy Act properly lie in district court)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Most Board cases concerning the Privacy Act consider it as a shield against disclosure of records to an appellant. The Privacy Act can be considered from a different perspective: "a party to a Board appeal need not show that records are subject to mandatory disclosure under the Privacy Act in order to obtain them in discovery." <span class="Italic">Montgomery v. Dept. of Army</span>, 80 MSPR 435, 439 &#x00B6; 10 (1998). For consideration of the relation between the Privacy Act and the attorney work product privilege, refer to <span class="Italic">Martin v. Special Counsel</span>, 819 F.2d 1181, 1184 (D.C. Cir. 1987), [discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-09-268.html#sec2-265">Attorney Work Product Privilege</a>"]. [Refer to Chapter 11, "Privacy Act; Disclosure of Confidential Information."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">Emanuele v. Dept. of Transp</span>, PH-0752-15-0539-B-3, n.2 (NP 2/2/2023), discounted the effect of the Privacy Act on agency investigations used in adverse actions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argued below that the agency violated the Privacy Act and that such a violation constitutes a violation of her due process rights. The administrative judge did not address this argument in the initial decision; thus, we address it here. Specifically, the appellant states that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(e) requires an agency to "collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs." (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 522a(e)). Based on this provision, the appellant argues that the agency was required to interview and question her prior to taking the removal action against her and that its failure to do so constituted a violation of her due process rights. We are not persuaded by the appellant's argument. The section of the statute relied upon concerns record creation and keeping and imposes the above-stated requirements for those purposes. The statute does not indicate that these requirements are a matter of due process for an adverse action taken against an employee. The appellant does not cite any authority to support her contention. Accordingly, the appellant's argument is unconvincing.</p>
