<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-149"><span class="space">d.</span> Insignia</h5>
<p class="noindent">Display of union insignia was discussed in <span class="Italic">Army Support Command, Ft. Schafter and SEIU Local 556</span>, 3 FLRA 796, 803-06 (1980) (ALJ Decision). Employees of a hotel were required to wear uniforms. Management prohibited them from wearing small badges designating union steward status during working hours and in work areas. The ALJ noted that the employees' right to wear small, neat, inconspicuous, nonprovocative union insignia at work has been recognized in both the private and public sectors. To determine whether there was a violation of that right under the Statute or whether "special circumstances" were present that allowed the agency to restrict that right, it was appropriate to examine the facts and balance the competing rights and obligations of all concerned. The ALJ concluded that a provision of the negotiated agreement stating that employees were required to wear uniforms that they could not alter without their employer's permission constituted a waiver of the right to wear a conspicuous badge of union position, and the ALJ determined that the badges worn, about the same size as the agency nameplates that the employer required the employees to wear, were conspicuous. Given the nature of the business, a hotel operation, the prohibition against union nameplates was necessary to avoid customer confusion as to who employed the individuals wearing the plates. The ALJ discounted agency arguments that customers objected to union insignia, noting that customers may have been unaware of employee rights under the Reform Act. The ALJ also discounted as unsupported by the record union arguments that there was no other way for employees in the bargaining unit to recognize their stewards.</p>
<p class="noindent">The use of a small sign stating "the steward is in," at the desk of an employee who served in that office, was protected, and its directed removal by management was an unfair labor practice, <span class="Italic">Customs Serv., Region VIII, San Francisco and NTEU</span>, 13 FLRA 7, 19 (1983) (ALJ Decision):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record made in this case does not reveal any of the "special circumstances" which call for nonuse of union insignia, such as safety considerations, as in <span class="Italic">Andrews Wire Corp.</span>, 189 NLRB No. 24, 76 LRRM 1568 (1971), or their being a cause of disruption in an environment with a previous history of animosity between employees regarding unionization, or rival labor organizations, as in <span class="Italic">United Aircraft Corp.</span>, 134 NLRB No. 15, 49 LRRM 1384 (1961), or serious jeopardization of the quality of the employer's product, as in <span class="Italic">Campbell Soup Co.</span>, 159 NLRB No. 18, 62 LRRM 1352 (1966), or a direct and constant contact with the public so as to adversely affect the employer's business, as in <span class="Italic">Consolidated Casinos Corp.</span>, 164 NLRB No. 132, 65 LRRM 1300 (1967)....</p>
<p class="noindent">The ALJ distinguished <span class="Italic">Army Support Command, Ft. Schafter and SEIU Local 556</span>, 3 FLRA 796 (1980), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, in <span class="Italic">Customs Serv.</span>, 13 FLRA at 17-18:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In the <span class="Italic">Fort Schafter</span> case, the Authority held that there was no right to wear conspicuous union insignia on the uniforms of a waiter and buffet cook serving the public in a hotel restaurant....&#8197;The union and the employer had agreed that uniformed employees could not change their uniforms without the consent of the employer....&#8197;Some customers complained about the wearing of union indicia, and were confused as to whether the employees were working for the hotel or the union. The hotel had a narrow profit margin and had to be self-sustaining....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The instant case is...distinguishable...&#8197;Here the employee has far fewer public contacts. Respondent's office is not a profit-making venture depending upon the goodwill of customers. Nor are visitors to the office likely to be confused by the union indicia at issue. It is not an official-looking sign. The desk is located in a work area too small, open, and congested to even suggest that employees might use the area for the conduct of union business. There is no rule or policy against use of non-official signs in work areas.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See AAFES, Ft. Drum Exch. and AFGE</span>, 41 FLRA 85 (1991) (reviewing button with inscription "AFGE Unity is Power").</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA approved, Chairman Calhoun dissenting, the use of pocket protectors (pen holders) with a union logo on the pocket flap for customs inspectors. The ALJ concluded that the insignia did not detract from the uniform and would not confuse the public. The penholder would not interfere with any purpose of the uniform. The investigators would still be clearly identifiable as law enforcement officers, and they would be distinguishable from other uniformed government employees. The penholder, neat and useful, was not one that would harm the image portrayed by the INS uniform. <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS, Port of Entry, San Ysidro and INS Council, AFGE Local 2805, San Diego</span>, 25 FLRA 490, 503 (1987) (ALJ Decision) ("<span class="Italic">INS 2</span>"); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">INS, Port of Entry, San Ysidro and INS Council, AFGE Local 2805</span>, 25 FLRA 447, 451 (1987) ("<span class="Italic">INS 1</span>") (similar result).

<p class="noindent-1">...There are many ways in which employees can form, join, or assist a labor organization....</p>

<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he use of special circumstances evolved as a standard for measuring the parameters within which union insignia may be worn at the workplace....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The NLRB and the courts have examined a number of factors when presented with the issue of whether unit employees may wear union insignia at the workplace.&#x2003;Generally, there is a balancing of employee rights to wear union insignia with an employer's need for production and efficiency....&#8197;[T]he NLRB and the courts look to the circumstances in which the Union insignia is worn, the size, shape and color of the insignia, as well as any messages imprinted thereon, the nature of the employer's activity, and the employer's need for production and safety.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]n cases in which special circumstances were found to exist, justifying the prohibition against the wearing of union insignia, there was evidence linking the wearing of union insignia, often large and obtrusive, with disruption of the employer's operations and maintenance of safety and discipline....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, it is apparent..., that the use of a special circumstances test to assess employee rights to wear union insignia at the workplace has long been accepted in the private sector and has been employed by the Authority as a viable standard on which to balance employee/employer rights. We find no reason to abandon our continued use of this standard.</p>

We also agree with the Judge's finding that the claims of divisiveness and factionalism are speculative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find speculative the Respondent's assertion that the wearing of a pin would interfere with the appearance of neutrality and impartiality which, according to Respondent, is required of border patrol agents....&#8197;[T]he likelihood that an illegal alien would take the time to closely inspect a small pin, and draw pro-union inferences on the part of the border patrol agent wearing the pin...is specious.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Respondent's assertion that it has applied its policy of allowing various types of pins and buttons to be worn by border patrol agents in a consistent and nondiscriminatory manner does not constitute a special circumstance justifying the prohibition. The Respondent cannot, by unilateral action, however consistent, establish special circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOJ, INS, Border Patrol, El Paso and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 38 FLRA 1256, 1267-68 (1991), again rejected the argument that considerations of internal security practices should bar small AFGE insignia on uniforms of armed agents:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">INS 3</span> [38 FLRA 701 (1990)], we examined the interplay of section 7106(a) and section 7106(b)(1) with section 7102 of the Statute. In that decision, we also considered the effect of the Supreme Court's <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span> decision, which addressed the relationship between management rights enumerated in section 7106(a) of the Statute and other sections of the Statute, as well as provisions of law and regulation outside the Statute. In <span class="Italic">INS 3</span>, we reaffirmed our view that section 7102 of the Statute grants Federal employees the right to wear Union insignia at the workplace, unless special circumstances exist. In determining whether special circumstances exist, we will look to the factors present in each case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">INS 3</span>, we considered whether border patrol agents, like the employees in these cases, who wore uniforms, pursuant to the Agency's right under section 7106(b)(1) to determine the methods and means of performing its work, had a right to wear Union insignia on the uniform at the workplace. We concluded that special circumstances did not exist in <span class="Italic">INS 3</span> and, therefore, that the border patrol agents did have a right to wear a Union lapel pin on their uniforms at the workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>

<p class="noindent">The Fifth Circuit entered the fray in <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS, Border Patrol v. FLRA</span>, 955 F.2d 998, 1001-07 (5th Cir. 1992), and concluded that "special circumstances" permitted the paramilitary Border Patrol to preclude adornment of uniforms with union insignia. The court discounted First Amendment arguments:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case arises out of a consolidated unfair labor practice proceeding brought under the Federal Service Labor Management Relations Statute (Statute). It involves a FLRA adjudication of two unfair labor practice complaints based on charges filed by the American Federation of Government Employees, National Border Patrol Council. The complaints alleged that the INS violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute by interfering with the rights of bargaining unit employees to assist labor unions by prohibiting them from wearing a small union lapel pin while on duty and by lowering an employee's appearance rating because he wore a union pin.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA agreed with the ALJ that INS had committed unfair labor practices by interfering with, restraining and coercing an employee in the exercise of his rights under section 7102 to form, join, or assist a labor organization by prohibiting the employee from wearing a union lapel pin while on duty, and by lowering an employee's appearance rating for wearing a union pin. The FLRA concluded that section 7102 does grant federal employees the right to wear a union pin unless special circumstances exist, and that no special circumstances existed in this case. Accordingly, the FLRA ordered the INS to cease and desist such practices and take affirmative action to effectuate the purpose and policy of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA argues that the right to wear union buttons is found in the broad right under section 7102 to form, join or assist a labor union, which reads in relevant part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Each employee shall have the right to form, join, or assist any labor organization...freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal, and each employee shall be protected in the exercise of such right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA argues that wearing the pin assists the Union by publicizing its existence, demonstrating employee support for the labor union, and showing pride and affiliation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The INS argues that although publicizing the existence of the Union and demonstrating support generally fall within the scope of Section 7102, congressional intent and legal precedent indicate that section 7102 does not grant the right to wear union insignia. The INS basically adopts the reasoning advanced by the Ninth Circuit in <span class="Italic">INS I</span> [<span class="Italic">INS v. FLRA</span>, 855 F.2d 1454, 1458 (9th Cir. 1988)]. There, the court pointed out that section 7102 was patterned after Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). Section 7 of the NLRA provides in relevant part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purposes of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 157. The Ninth Circuit then concluded that the right to wear a union lapel pin under the NLRA was conferred by the right "to engage in other concerted activities" language, and that Congress intentionally left this NLRA language out of the Statute. <span class="Italic">INS I</span>, 855 F.2d at 1459.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this conclusion, the Ninth Circuit relied on <span class="Italic">Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 324 U.S. 793, 65 S. Ct. 982, 89 L. Ed. 1372 (1945). The Ninth Circuit held that in <span class="Italic">Republic Aviation</span>, the Supreme Court concluded that <span id="Page_1368"></span>the right to wear union buttons arose from the right "to engage in other concerted activities" under Section 7 of the NLRA. <span class="Italic">INS I</span>, 855 F.2d at 1459. <span class="Italic">Republic Aviation</span> involved the discharge of three employees for wearing union steward buttons in violation of the employer's no solicitation rule. The Court found that the enforcement of the no solicitation rule violated the NLRA because it interfered with the employees' rights under section 7 of the NLRA. <span class="Italic">Republic Aviation</span>, 324 U.S. at 795-96, 65 S. Ct. at 984. The Court, however, did not hold expressly that the right to wear a union button arose only from the right "to engage in other concerted activities" in section 7. Nor can we read into the case such an implicit holding. Indeed, the Supreme Court recognized and approved the National Labor Relations Board's conclusion that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">the right of employees to wear union insignia at work has long been recognized as a reasonable and legitimate form of <span class="Italic">union activity</span>, and the respondent's curtailment of that right is clearly violative of the Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 802 n.7, 65 S. Ct. at 988 n.7 (emphasis added). Therefore, the INS's reliance on <span class="Italic">Republic Aviation</span> and the Ninth Circuit's analysis of that case, we think, is misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The INS also argues that Congress meant to circumscribe the rights of federal employees more than the rights of private employees, and that its interpretation of section 7102 is consistent with the intent of Congress. The INS cites <span class="Italic">Old Dominion Branch No. 496, Nat'l Ass'n of Letter Carriers v. Austin</span>, 418 U.S. 264, 278 n.13, 94 S. Ct. 2770, 2778 n.13, 41 L. Ed.2d 745 (1974), to support its conclusion that Congress meant to refrain from granting federal employees the right to wear union pins. Although it is true that federal employees do not enjoy the same rights as private employees, the FLRA correctly points out that in <span class="Italic">Letter Carriers</span>, the Supreme Court only discussed greater restrictions on federal employees in the context of strikes and picketing:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The absence of mention of a right to engage in concerted activities is no more than a reflection of the fact that the order does not permit federal employee unions to engage in strikes or picketing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The INS also contends that to hold that the federal employee's right to wear a union pin arises from the right to assist labor unions would create a disparity between public and private employees, because the private employee's right to assist labor unions does not include the right to wear a pin. This asserted disparity is premised however, on the INS's conclusion that the private employee's right to wear a union pin arises from the right to engage in other concerted activities, not the right to assist labor unions. Its argument is therefore contingent on its flawed analysis of <span class="Italic">Republic Aviation</span>. All other courts have grounded the private employee's right to wear union insignia in section 7 generally, not narrowly in the right to engage in other concerted activity....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The INS's argument that Ninth Circuit precedent and congressional intent compel the conclusion that the right to assist labor unions does not include the right to wear a union lapel pin is without merit. The FLRA's conclusion that section 7102, which grants "[e]ach employee...the right to...assist any labor organization," does confer the right to wear a union lapel pin on federal employees is well reasoned, and therefore, entitled to deference.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The INS argues that because it has the right to require uniforms, it also has the right to bar employees from adorning their uniforms with objects of their own choosing. It contends that the right to require a uniform includes the power to require uniformity. In <span class="Italic">INS I</span>, the Ninth Circuit held that the right to require a uniform necessarily encompasses the right to require unadorned uniforms:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The uniform requirement fosters discipline, promotes uniformity, encourages esprit de corps, and increases readiness. To allow employees to adorn their uniforms with objects of their own choosing undermines the very purpose that uniforms serve.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">INS I</span>, 855 F.2d at 1464. We cannot immediately accept the conclusion the Ninth Circuit reached because in assessing management's right to require unadorned uniforms, it simply assumed that management's statutory right to require a uniform supersedes the employee's statutory right to assist labor unions by wearing a pin. Nothing in the Statute, however, subordinates the rights granted to employees under section 7102 to the rights granted management under section 7106(b)(1). Since section 7106(b) does not explicitly supersede other rights granted under the chapter, the FLRA's conclusion that management's statutory right to prescribe a uniform does not automatically include the right to prohibit union pins is reasonable and entitled to deference.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to determine whether a uniformed border patrol agent has the right to wear a union pin while on duty, we employ the "special circumstances" test that has been widely applied by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the courts in cases involving the right of private employees to wear union insignia and which has also been applied by the FLRA in cases involving the right of public employees to wear a union lapel pin....&#8197;Under the "special circumstances test," the employee has the right to wear a union pin on his uniform absent special circumstances. <span class="Italic">INS II</span>, 38 FLRA at 715-718.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The NLRB, FLRA, and the courts have considered a number of factors when presented with the issue of whether employees may wear union insignia at work. They have looked to the circumstances in which the insignia is worn, the physical appearance of the insignia, the nature of the employer's activity and the employer's need for production, safety and discipline....&#8197;In cases where special circumstances were found to exist, there has been evidence linking the wearing of union insignia to a disruption of the employer's operations and maintenance of safety and discipline....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Below, the INS argued that special circumstances exist because allowing border patrol agents to wear union pins on their uniform while on duty would interfere with operations, morale, pride, esprit de corps, regimentation and discipline. It also argued that the wearing of union pins would create factionalism, divisiveness and the appearance of impartiality. Finally, the INS emphasized the para-military nature of the border patrol's operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA has recognized that military regulations are entitled to special deference.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 3006 and Idaho Army and Air National Guard</span>, 32 FLRA 539 (1988), the FLRA found that military technicians did not have the right to wear union badges on their uniforms while at work...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Below, the FLRA, relying on its decision in <span class="Italic">INS II</span>, pointed out that the border patrol was not military, and then concluded that the distinction between military and nonmilitary employees was critical. We, of course, concede that the border patrol is not military. Nevertheless, it is a para-military law enforcement unit, and as such, has many of the same interests as the military in regulating its employees' uniforms.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The INS's anti-adornment/uniform policy is critical to its mission, in that it promotes uniformity, esprit de corps and discipline, and creates an appearance of neutrality and impartiality. Thus, even though the border patrol is not military, we hold that its law-enforcement mission and the means of accomplishing that mission are comparable in significant ways. It follows that its anti-adornment/uniform policy is similarly entitled to deference. We further hold that, when a law enforcement agency enforces an anti-adornment/uniform policy in a consistent and nondiscriminatory manner, a special circumstance exists, as a matter of law, which justifies the banning of union buttons. Therefore, in the instant case, the border patrol agents do not have the statutory right to wear union lapel pins. Consequently, the INS has not committed any unfair labor practices by enforcing its policy or docking an employee's appearance rating for a violation of that policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because we have held that under the Statute the INS may prohibit union buttons, we must address whether under the First Amendment the employee's right might yet be protected. We assume, for the purpose of deciding this case, that wearing a union pin does constitute speech protected by the First Amendment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We begin with <span class="Italic">Pickering v. Board of Education</span>, 391 U.S. 563, 88 S. Ct. 1731, 20 L. Ed.2d 811 (1968), in which the Supreme Court established the test for determining the limits that may be placed on government employees' speech rights. <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> held that the First Amendment protects the rights of public employees "as citizens to comment on matters of public concern" in connection with the operation of the government agencies for which they work. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 568, 88 S. Ct. at 1734. The Supreme Court recognized, however, that the government has legitimate interests in regulating the speech of its employees that differ significantly from its interests in regulating the speech of people generally. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, the Court held that the scope of a public employee's First Amendment rights must be determined by balancing the "interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern, and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees."...&#8197;If the speech at issue involves a matter of public concern, and is thus protected by the First Amendment, the employer then must show that its interest in promoting the efficiency of the services provided by its employees outweighs the employee's interest in engaging in the protected speech....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"[T]he State's burden in justifying a particular [action or policy] varies depending upon the nature of the employee's expression."...&#8197;"The more central a matter of public concern the speech [or association] at issue, the stronger the employer's showing of counter-balancing governmental interest must be."...&#8197;The determination of the appropriate balance is also a legal determination to be made by the court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the purposes of this case, we assume, without deciding, that wearing the union button does constitute speech on a matter of public concern. Thus, we must determine whether the INS's interest in promoting efficiency in carrying out its mission outweighs the border patrol agents' interest in wearing union lapel pins. The Supreme Court has held <span id="Page_1369"></span>that the impact of the speech on the discipline by superiors and the harmony among co-workers, the impact of the speech on close personal relationships for which personal loyalty and confidence are necessary, and the degree to which the speech impedes the employee's performance or interferes with the regular operations of the employer are relevant factors to consider when weighing the two competing interests. <span class="Italic">Rankin</span>, 483 U.S. at 388, 107 S. Ct. at 2899; <span class="Italic">Pickering</span>, 391 U.S. at 570-73, 88 S. Ct. at 1735-37. Also relevant are the manner, time, and place in which the border patrol agents wear the pins. <span class="Italic">Connick</span>, 461 U.S. at 152, 103 S. Ct. at 1692. As discussed above, the INS argues that its anti-adornment policy, as an essential part of its uniform code, fosters discipline, promotes uniformity, encourages esprit de corps, and enhances the identification of its employees. The INS emphasizes the para-military nature of the border patrol agents' duties and argues that the wearing of union pins would create divisiveness and an appearance of partiality.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court has given deference to military uniform regulations when a public employee's First Amendment rights were at issue. In <span class="Italic">Goldman v. Weinberger</span>, 475 U.S. 503, 106 S. Ct. 1310, 89 L. Ed.2d 478 (1986), the Supreme Court held that the Air Force Policy prohibiting officers from wearing head gear while on duty was not a violation of the officers' First Amendment rights. The officer challenging the regulation was an Orthodox Jew who wanted to wear a yarmulke. The Court held that, when challenged on First Amendment grounds, its review of military regulations is much more deferential than its review of civil laws and regulations:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The military need not encourage debate or tolerate protest to the extent that such tolerance is required of the civilian state by the First Amendment; to accomplish its mission, the military must foster instinctive obedience, unity, commitment, and esprit de corps.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 507, 106 S. Ct. at 1313. In <span class="Italic">Kelley v. Johnson</span>, 425 U.S. 238, 247, 96 S. Ct. 1440, 1445, 47 L. Ed.2d 708 (1976), the Court held that a law enforcement agency's "[c]hoice of organization, dress, and equipment for law enforcement personnel is a decision entitled to the same sort of presumption of legislative validity as are state choices designed to promote other aims within cognizance of the State's police power." Just as we have held earlier, that the INS's anti-adornment policy is entitled to deference under the special circumstance test because of the para-military nature of its operations, we now hold that a law enforcement agency's anti-adornment policy is also entitled to deference when weighing the government's interest against the employee's interest under the <span class="Italic">Pickering</span>/<span class="Italic">Connick</span> First Amendment test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We think this deference is particularly warranted in this case.&#x2003;It is reasonable to conclude that allowing border patrol agents to wear union pins while on duty would create factionalism, interfere with discipline and create an appearance of partiality. At oral argument, for example, the Union stated that an important purpose of its members wearing the pin is to promote the solidarity of the Union. Solidarity against what and whom? Obviously against policies and practices of the INS they oppose and against those who differ with their position. It is not unreasonable to assume that allowing this schism to manifest itself in the form of a pin on the uniforms of the pro-union agents will create added tension; in short, there will be occasions when a union button can be interpreted as a symbol of defiance against supervisors and as a split in solidarity among union and non-union agents, which will have an impact on mission, discipline, and esprit de corps. Finally, it is reasonable to conclude that allowing border patrol agents to wear union pins would interfere with an appearance to the public of neutrality and impartiality, which is important to the mission of all law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA concluded below, and argues on appeal, that these deleterious effects are only speculative. We agree with the FLRA that the INS has not demonstrated with anecdotal evidence that these deleterious effects will in fact occur if agents are allowed to wear the pins. The Supreme Court, in <span class="Italic">Connick</span>, held, however, that it is not necessary "for an employer to allow events to unfold to the extent that the disruption of the office and the destruction of the working relationship is manifest before taking action." We think that this observation is especially applicable here where law enforcement is involved and the agency has an overriding interest in maintaining discipline, efficiency, and effectiveness in protecting the public safety and the safety of its officers. We therefore hold that the government has satisfied its burden by reasonably asserting that allowing border patrol agents to wear union lapel pins on their uniform while on duty will adversely affect its law enforcement mission for the reasons we have discussed in this opinion. Therefore, we hold that the INS's interest in promoting the efficiency of the border patrol by proscribing any adornments on the agents' uniforms outweighs the agents' interest in wearing a union lapel pin while on duty. This balancing results in only a minimal intrusion of the free speech rights of union employees. They can continue to express their support for the Union in myriad other ways that are absolutely unaffected by our decision today. Consequently, the INS anti-adornment policy does not violate the agents' First Amendment rights.</p>
