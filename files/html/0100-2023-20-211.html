<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-203_1"><span class="space">c.</span> Nondisciplinary Cases: Nonselection; Nonpromotion; Reassignments; Changes in Duties</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors are most often applied to disciplinary cases, where comparator information may be available. In a case involving nonselection or nonpromotion, reassignment or changes in duties, the appellant's wrongdoing is not an issue. Analysis may center on the reasons offered for the action challenged. Summarized by <span class="Italic">Fanelli v. DOD</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/nonprecedential/FANELLI_PATRICIA_ANNE_PH_1221_13_0019_B_1_FINAL_ORDER_1993151.pdf">PH-1221-13-0019-B-1</a> (NP 1/13/2023), involving a change of duties and relocation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that when the personnel action at issue is not disciplinary in nature, the first <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor does not apply straightforwardly and it is appropriate to consider the broader question of whether the agency had legitimate reasons for its action. <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of the Army</span>, 2022 MSPB 4, &#x00B6; 23....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Army</span>, 2022 MSPB 4, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23-31 (2022), found reprisal when the appellant was not selected for a position following her disclosures to the media and to a congressional office, resulting in adverse publicity for DOD (Air Force) and known to the agency (Army) management, concerning violations of DOD policies governing disposition of the remains of the appellant's husband, a servicemember killed in action in Iraq:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When, as in this case, an appellant shows by preponderant evidence that she made protected disclosures and that those disclosures were a contributing factor in the decision to take a personnel action, the burden shifts to the agency to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the personnel action in the absence of the whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2); <span class="Italic">Scoggins</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 592, &#x00B6; 26. In determining whether an agency has met its burden, the Board generally considers the following factors: (1) the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its action; (2) the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and (3) any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">Carr v. Social Security Administration</span>, 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Factor (1) does not apply straightforwardly to this case, however, as the personnel action at issue here is not disciplinary in nature, and therefore does not require supporting evidence of misconduct. <span class="Italic">Gonzales</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 248, &#x00B6; 12. Instead, it is appropriate to consider instead the broader question of whether the agency had legitimate reasons for the appellant's nonselection. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Schnell v. Department of the Army</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 83, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17, 23 (2010) (applying <span class="Italic">Gonzales</span> in adjudicating a nonselection for a temporary position). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has further clarified that "[e]vidence only clearly and convincingly supports a conclusion when it does so in the aggregate considering all the pertinent evidence in the record, and despite the evidence that fairly detracts from that conclusion." <span class="Italic">Whitmore v. Department of Labor</span>, 680 F.3d 1353, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the first <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor, the administrative judge found that the agency's explanation for not selecting the appellant lacked credibility because it was "riddled with inconsistencies" and that the agency "utterly failed to justify its selection decision." In making this finding, the administrative judge noted that the selecting official and two other management officials testified during the hearing that the appellant was not suited for the EA position for the following reasons: (1) the appellant had problems getting along with coworkers; (2) she had "leave usage" issues; and (3) she frequently demanded teleworking arrangements. The administrative judge found that none of these reasons for refusing to select the appellant were supported by the evidentiary record. In particular, the administrative judge found that the agency's claim that the appellant had trouble getting along with coworkers was directly contradicted by management in the appellant's 2010-2011 performance evaluation, as she received the highest possible rating under the category "Working Relationships &#x0026; Communications."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge further noted that the appellant's second-line supervisor, who criticized the appellant's ability to work with other administrative assistants and cast doubt on her leadership ability during the hearing, praised the appellant's performance on her evaluation form. As the administrative judge noted, the supervisor stated in his Senior Rater comments that the appellant could be relied on to train and assist senior administrative assistants on various tasks, had the capability and desire to excel in positions well above the administrative level, and had outstanding potential to succeed in a position of higher authority and responsibility. The administrative judge also found management's purported concern about the appellant's request for telework "an odd one," given that she made the request so that she could work for the agency while she was out on maternity-related sick leave, instead of being unable to make any work-related contributions during that time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the agency argues that, because the appellant was applying for a GS-09 position and the performance evaluation pertains to her performance in a GS-08 position, the administrative judge should have given less weight to the appellant’s performance evaluation and more weight to the testimony of agency officials regarding their concerns about the appellant’s potential for accomplishing GS-09 level work. This argument is unpersuasive. If the appellant had difficulty getting along with others, that should have been reflected in her performance evaluation. Her excellent rating in all categories, including “Working Relationships &amp; Communications,” and the praise she received from agency management in her performance evaluation, severely undermine the legitimacy of the agency’s reasons for its decision not to select her for the EA position. Accordingly, we agree with the administrative judge’s assessment of the first <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor and find that the agency did not have legitimate reasons for not selecting the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next consider the second <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor, the strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of any agency officials who were involved in the decision in question. As the administrative judge noted in the initial decision, although the appellant's protected disclosures exposed misconduct by personnel from the Department of the Air Force, rather than the Department of the Army, the evidence shows that the ramifications of the appellant's disclosures were not confined to the Air Force. For example, the record contains a December 6, 2011 email from a Washington Post reporter notifying the appellant of DOD personnel's reaction to a Facebook post in which she stated that an article about Dover MAO would be published soon. In the email, the reporter states that the appellant "gave some DoD people a heart attack" and that DOD personnel were "really worried" about the upcoming article. Thus, as the administrative judge found, the record shows that the appellant's disclosures were a source of anxiety for DOD personnel other than Air Force officials. Further, because Representative Holt decided not to vote for the NDAA of 2012, in part due to the appellant's disclosures, and the NDAA provides funding to all DOD agencies, those disclosures arguably jeopardized funding for every agency in DOD.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In evaluating the second <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor, we also have considered the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1371, which cautioned the Board against taking an unduly dismissive and restrictive view of retaliatory motive. The <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span> court stated that, "[t]hose responsible for the agency's performance overall may well be motivated to retaliate even if they are not directly implicated by the disclosures, and even if they do not know the whistleblower personally, as the criticism reflects on them in their capacities as managers and employees." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1370. Applying this broader view of retaliatory motive, the court has found that an official may have a retaliatory motive even if he is not "directly involved in the work at issue in an employee's disclosure." <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of Justice</span>, 842 F.3d 1252, 1261-62 (Fed. Cir. 2016). In another case, an agency official took a personnel action against a whistleblower employee, but that official was not personally implicated in the employee's disclosures, which concerned congressional testimony by a different agency official. The court determined that the Board's administrative judge erred by failing to consider whether the agency official who took the personnel action nonetheless had a "professional retaliatory motive" against the employee because his disclosures regarding the alleged inaccuracy of an agency Under Secretary's congressional testimony "implicated the capabilities, performance, and veracity of [agency] managers and employees, and implied that the [agency] deceived [a] Senate Committee." <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 923 F.3d 1004, 1008-09, 1018-19 (Fed. Cir. 2019).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this matter, although none of the agency officials involved in the decision not to select the appellant was directly implicated in the mishandling of service members' remains, the misconduct the appellant disclosed was egregious and her disclosures generated a significant amount of negative publicity for the DOD. Given these circumstances, the appellant's disclosures reflected poorly on DOD officials as representatives of the general institutional interests of the DOD, which is sufficient to establish a retaliatory motive. <span class="Italic">See Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1370; <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Department of the Interior</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 69 (2011). We therefore find that the agency officials involved in the decision not to select the appellant had some motive to retaliate against her for her disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor, there is no record evidence concerning the <span id="Page_4006"></span>agency's treatment of similarly situated nonwhistleblowers. As previously explained, it is the agency that bears the burden of proving that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the appellant's protected activity. <span class="Italic">Alarid v. Department of the Army</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 600, &#x00B6; 14 (2015). While the agency does not have an affirmative burden to produce evidence concerning each and every <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor, and "the absence of any evidence relating to <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three can effectively remove that factor from the analysis," the failure to produce such evidence if it exists "may be at the agency's peril," and "may well cause the agency to fail to prove its case overall." <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1374-75. Moreover, because the agency bears the burden of proof at this stage of the analysis, when the agency fails to introduce relevant comparator evidence, the third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor cannot favor the agency. <span class="Italic">Smith v. General Services Administration</span>, 930 F.3d 1359, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2019); <span class="Italic">Siler v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 908 F.3d 1291, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Here, the agency has failed to proffer any evidence pertaining to <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three. Under these circumstances, <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor 3 cannot weigh in the agency's favor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore find that the agency did not have legitimate reasons for its failure to select the appellant for the EA position, that the agency officials involved in the decision had some motive to retaliate, and that the agency's failure to provide evidence in support of <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor 3 does not favor the agency. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action absent the appellant's protected disclosures. We therefore agree with the administrative judge's determination that the appellant is entitled to corrective action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Schnell v. Dept. of Army</span>, 114 MSPR 83, 91-95 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-25, 2010 MSPB 67 (2010), applied the clear and convincing evidentiary standard and determined that the appellant was entitled, for lack of a reasonable explanation by agency officials as to the reasons for nonselection, to a retroactive remedy for reprisal against his disclosures of deficiencies in agency contractual oversight responsibilities involving a large contract--oversight failures that were within the appellant's experience to recognize and that were verified by a subsequent audit by the organization, the Army Audit Agency, that received the appellant's disclosures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reviewing the merits of an IRA appeal, the Board must examine whether the appellant proved by preponderant evidence that he engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), and that such whistleblowing activity was a contributing factor in an agency personnel action; if so, the Board must order corrective action unless the agency established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the disclosure. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fisher v. Environmental Protection Agency,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 296, &#x00B6; 15 (2008). We can make these determinations at this level because the appellant did not request a hearing and the evidence of record is complete. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Azbill v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 363, &#x00B6; 16 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A protected disclosure is a disclosure that an appellant reasonably believes evidences a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A); <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Department of the Interior,</span> 515 F.3d 1362, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2008). A reasonable belief exists if a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the appellant could reasonably conclude that the actions of the government evidence one of the categories in section 2302(b)(8)(A). <span class="Italic">LaChance v. White,</span> 174 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 528 U.S. 1153 (2000). To establish that the appellant had a reasonable belief that a disclosure met the criteria of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), he need not prove that the condition disclosed actually established a regulatory violation or any of the other situations detailed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A)(ii); rather, the appellant must show that the matter disclosed was one which a reasonable person in his position would believe evidenced any of the situations specified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Garst v. Department of the Army,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. 514, 518 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the record indicates that the appellant made disclosures to the AAA beginning in January 2005 to approximately July 2006. He made disclosures to the IG in May 2005 and March to June 2006.<span class="Italic"></span> As found by the administrative judge, the appellant disclosed to the AAA that problems existed with the inspection process and other matters, including the QASP, and disclosed to the IG that the agency blurred the lines of authority, confused surveillance concepts, employed inexperienced and untrained personnel, failed to provide necessary standards, and overpaid for services. We find that in making these disclosures, the appellant, at a minimum, disclosed a violation of law, rule, or regulation, which was protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A)(i). In particular, the appellant has shown that these disclosures exposed potential violations of the Federal Acquisition Regulations, 48 C.F.R., part 46, relating to quality assurance in government contracting. <span class="Italic">See Reid v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 508 F.3d 674, 678 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (finding section 2302(b)(8)(b) may be satisfied by a disclosure of a violation of the Federal Acquisition Regulations). As also found by the administrative judge, the appellant was in a position to reasonably believe his disclosures because he was the first-line supervisor for 18 QAEs, and the reasonableness of his belief was validated by the AAA's July 2006 report, which found that Fort McCoy must improve its monitoring of contractor performance. Thus, we conclude that the appellant proved by preponderant evidence that he made protected disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee may demonstrate that a disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure, and that the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action. <span class="Italic">Scott v. Department of Justice,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 211, 238 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 99 F.3d 1160 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table). Once the knowledge/timing test has been met, an administrative judge must find that the appellant has shown that his whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the personnel action at issue, even if, after a complete analysis of all of the evidence, a reasonable factfinder could not conclude that the appellant's whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the personnel action. <span class="Italic">Carey v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 676, &#x00B6; 13 (2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that Calvert was aware of the appellant's disclosure to the AAA. She also found that, although the appellant told the IG that he wished to remain anonymous, the nature of his complaints made it evident that they could have come only from him. As previously noted, the appellant submitted an October 31, 2006 answer indicating that he was not selected for the temporary position. As also previously noted, he submitted a May 1, 2007 e-mail summarizing an April 30, 2007 meeting and stating that his position would be eliminated under the new DSS structure. Those personnel actions occurred within approximately 1 to 2 years of the appellant's protected disclosures to the AAA and the IG. The Board has found that comparable periods of time between a protected disclosure and a personnel action can satisfy the knowledge/timing test. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gonzalez v. Department of Transportation,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 250 (2008) (finding that the appellant's disclosures were a contributing factor in his removal when they were made over 1 year before his removal); <span class="Italic">Redschlag v. Department of the Army,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 589, &#x00B6; 87 (2001) (finding that the appellant's disclosures were a contributing factor in her removal when they were made approximately 21 months and then slightly over a year before the agency removed her), <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 32 Fed. Appx. 543 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Interior,</span> 74 M.S.P.R. 666, 676 (1997) (finding that the appellant's disclosures were a contributing factor in the lower rating the agency gave him in his performance evaluation, which occurred over a year after he made the disclosures). We therefore find that the appellant has satisfied the knowledge/timing test. As such, we find that the appellant proved by preponderant evidence that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor in an agency personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of whistleblowing, the Board will consider whether the agency had legitimate reasons for the personnel action, the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of agency officials who were involved in the decision, and any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Carr v. Social Security Administration,</span> 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. Department of the Navy,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 248, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2006). Clear and convincing evidence is "that measure or degree of proof that produces in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief as to the allegations sought to be established." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.4(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency has failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the personnel actions absent any protected disclosures. As discussed above, the appellant asserted that he applied for the temporary position in August 2006 that included his normal duties, and that the agency divided his position into three positions in 2007 and singled his position out for elimination. In response, the agency submitted affidavits from Calvert and Neitzel containing only general statements that they never took any retaliatory personnel actions against the appellant. Neither Calvert nor Neitzel, however, provided any detailed explanation as to why the agency selected other applicants over the appellant for these positions that had considerable overlap with his then current position. Nor did the agency present any other evidence of the selection procedure that it followed in filling the positions or that would explain why the appellant was not considered the top applicant for them. Accordingly, the agency has failed to meet its burden of producing in our minds a "firm belief' that it would have taken the same personnel actions in the absence of the appellant's protected disclosures. Thus, we find that the appellant is entitled to corrective action in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Generally, an appellant who prevails in an IRA appeal is entitled to <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief that includes the following: cancellation of the retaliatory personnel action; the appellant's reinstatement to his former position or <span id="Page_4007"></span>to another substantially equivalent position, as appropriate; back pay; interest on back pay; and other employment benefits that he would have received had the action not occurred. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1); <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. Department of Justice,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 375, &#x00B6; 34 (2007). Here, the appellant's previous GS-11 position has been eliminated. However, we find that the earliest promotion opportunity for the appellant that may have been lost as a result of reprisal for his disclosures was the GS-12 position that he applied for and was not selected for on October 31, 2006. Thus, we find it appropriate to order the agency to promote the appellant to the GS-12 grade level effective October 31, 2006. <span class="Italic">See Armstrong,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 375, &#x00B6; 34.</p>
