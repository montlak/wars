<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-517"><span class="space">4.</span> Choice, Arrangement of Offices</h4>
<p class="noindent">FLRA rejected negotiability of a proposal that allowed employees some choice as to the particular office assignments they would have. The agency's uncontradicted statement of position indicated that the performance of its work would be facilitated by the ability to group employees functionally. FLRA determined that the proposal could not be negotiated because it interfered with the agency's right to determine technology, methods, and means of performing work. <span class="Italic">FUSE, NAGE Local R1-144 and Naval Underwater Sys. Ctr., Newport</span>, 28 FLRA 352, 354-55 (1987) (Proposal 1) (comparing <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 2910 and Library of Congress</span>, 19 FLRA 1180 (1985), and <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 25 FLRA 979 (1987)).</p>
<p class="noindent">An adverse effect on agency internal security practices may block the negotiability of a proposal to permit employee office choice within a large facility, as occurred when the agency successfully argued that lack of control over office location would impair the ability of managers to evacuate and account for their employees in the event of an emergency, <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 101 and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 58 FLRA 653, 654-55 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, management's right to determine its internal security practices includes the right to determine the policies and practices that are necessary to safeguard its operations, personnel, and physical property against internal and external risks<span class="Italic">. See AFGE, Local 1920</span>, 47 FLRA 340, 348 (1993). Where an agency demonstrates a link or a reasonable connection between its goal of safeguarding its personnel, property, or operations and its practice or decision designed to implement that goal, a proposal that directly interferes with or negates the agency's practice or decision affects the agency's right under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. The Authority will not examine the extent to which the practices adopted by management to achieve its security objectives actually facilitate the accomplishment of those objectives<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. at 349. Furthermore, arguments that essentially challenge the effectiveness of an agency's security measures do not operate to defeat a claim that those measures pertain to an agency's internal security practices<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1904</span>, 56 FLRA 787, 789 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chap. 83</span>, 35 FLRA 398 (1990), the Authority held that where a link is shown between an agency's internal security practices and the collocation of specific employees and specific facilities, a proposal to relocate the facilities conflicts with management's right to determine internal security practices. 35 FLRA at 410 (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 644, AFL-CIO</span>, 21 FLRA 658, 661-62 (1986), in which the Authority found that a proposal to relocate a library and convert space to offices affected the agency's right to determine its internal security practices).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon specific events that occurred at the Agency's facilities that endangered employees' safety, the Agency asserts that collocating employees within their branches at their new office location will allow managers to "control their internal security in a more efficient manner." The Agency maintains that the proposal would affect its right to determine internal security practices by impairing the ability of each supervisor "to locate his or her employees for purposes of ensuring swift and safe evacuation." The Agency adds that "[w]hen managers need to police a floor for employees, there is an increased possibility of compromising an orderly and prompt evacuation, and places the manager and employees in harms way." The Agency argues that "[b]y collocating employees within their branches, management can control their internal security in a more efficient manner."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, in the circumstances of this case and contrary to the Union's sole argument in this regard, that the Agency has established a link between its plan to locate employees within their respective branches and its goal of safeguarding its personnel. As the Agency notes, each floor that houses a division is approximately 11,000 square feet. The Agency has determined that a policy of locating employees by each of 11 branches, rather than by one of two larger divisions, will allow for greater control over employee safety when evacuations are required, as has occurred, and would obviate the need for managers to police an entire floor to ensure employee safety. Although the plan of clustering employees within branches, rather than by division, may also have been designed for other purposes, as the Agency acknowledges, an agency need only demonstrate a reasonable connection between its goal of safeguarding its personnel, property, or operations and the decision that would implement that goal<span class="Italic">. See AFGE</span>, 57 FLRA at 902-03. Nothing in Authority precedent suggests that an agency is required to show that the only basis for a particular decision or practice was to further its goal of safeguarding its personnel, property or operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the proposal "would not require employees to be co-located or clustered with other employees and supervisors in their respective branch." By allowing employees to select a seating assignment anywhere on the floor, the proposal would affect the Agency's plan of locating employees in a manner to improve employee safety. We find that the proposal is outside the duty to bargain because it would affect the agency's right to determine its internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., NAGE, Local R7-72</span>, 42 FLRA 1019, 1031 (1991) (proposal that would preclude agency from requiring employees to use and wear particular safety equipment found to interfere with agency's right to determine internal security practices); <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 2050</span>, 36 FLRA 618, 631 (1990) ("the [a]gency's decision as to the threats against which it will protect employees and the workplace constitutes an integral aspect of the [a]gency's determination of the internal security practices it will adopt for that purpose.").[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;In view of our determination that the proposal is outside the duty to bargain because it affects the right to determine internal security, we do not address the Agency's additional claims relating to other management rights. We also note that the Union makes no claim that the proposal is negotiable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) or (b)(3) of the Statute or that it is electively negotiable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1)<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Ass'n. of Civ. Technicians, NY State Council</span>, 56 FLRA 444, 449 (2000), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 56 FLRA 868, 871 (union made only bare assertions under &#x00A7; 7106(b) that were not considered by the Authority).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS, Family Support Admin.</span>, 28 FLRA 1108, 1109-11 (1987), approved for negotiation proposals that employees be able to select their offices in a new building and that selections be by seniority, and that employees sharing offices be permitted to select their office mates:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an agency asserts that a proposal concerning office space selection interferes with its right to determine the technology, methods and means of accomplishing its work, the agency must demonstrate that its choice of office space design has a technological relationship to accomplishing its work, and that the Union's proposal would interfere with the purpose for which the office space was adopted. <span class="Italic">FUSE, NAGE Local R1-44 and Naval Underwater Systems Center, Newport, Rhode Island</span>, 28 FLRA No. 54 (1987) (Proposal 1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In that case, the Authority found that the Agency had established a relationship between the assignment of work space and the performance of the Agency's work, thus making the grouping of employees on a functional basis a method and means of performing work under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 2910 and Library of Congress</span>, 19 FLRA 1180 (1985), the Authority concluded that the agency had demonstrated that the purpose of grouping employees according to their "primary functions" in the same work area was directly related to the agency's operations, and, thus it constituted a method and means of performing work under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case, however, is different from the cases cited above. The Union has agreed, in its response brief, to implement these proposals within the <span id="page_1001"></span>program arrangement selected by the Agency. By so doing, the Agency can still accomplish its objective of maintaining communication between employees who work on the same program, and reference materials, computers and telephones would be accessible to all employees....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Agency has not established any technological relationship between the space design and the work performed, nor any interference between these proposals and the office design selected by the Agency. Consequently, absent a technological relationship for a given office design, and absent proof of an actual interference of office space design, we find these proposals within the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Agency does not argue, and it is not apparent from the record, that the proposals would affect directly or indirectly the working conditions of nonunit employees. Accordingly, this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 25 FLRA No. 82 (1987), where the agency raised the argument that the proposals were nonnegotiable because they affected the conditions of employment of non-bargaining unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also claims that these proposals violate its management right to assign work under 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute because the assignment of office space is directly related to the assignment of work. However, we find that these proposals in no manner preclude the Agency from assigning specified duties to its employees. As noted above, the Union has agreed to implement its proposals within the program arrangement selected by the Agency. Accordingly, we find that these proposals do not interfere with the right to assign work.... <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2302 and Army Armor Center, and Fort Knox</span>, 19 FLRA 778 (1985) (Proposal 2).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 83 and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 64 FLRA 723, 725-27 (2010), approved as negotiable a proposal to change the process of office space selection by allowing employees to select from available cubicles by seniority and without regard to workgroup assignment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The proposal does not affect management's rights</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The proposal does not affect management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency fails to demonstrate that the proposal affects management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. According to the Agency, the proposal would prevent the Agency from seating employees according to their workgroups, which is one of the Agency's chosen methods and means of accomplishing its mission. It is undisputed that the proposal could result in employees being seated outside of their assigned workgroups.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The applicable legal framework is well established.&#x2003;In deciding whether a proposal affects management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work, the Authority initially examines whether the proposal concerns a "method" or a "means." <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 2192, </span>59 FLRA 868 (2004) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting). The Authority has construed the term "method" to refer to "the way in which an agency performs its work." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1920, </span>47 FLRA 340, 343 (1993). The Authority has defined the term "means" to refer to "any instrumentality, including an agent, tool, device, measure, plan, or policy used by an agency for the accomplishment or [the] furtherance of the performance of its work." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>The legislative history of the Statute indicates that the term "methods" was intended to mean "how" work is performed; the term "means" was intended to mean "with what." <span class="Italic">See Legislative History of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978</span>, U.S.C.C.A.N. 2830, 2831; <span class="Italic">see also GSA, </span>54 FLRA 1582, 1590 n.6 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the proposal concerns a method or a means, the Authority employs a two-part test to determine whether the proposal affects the management right. First, an agency must show that there is a direct and integral relationship between the particular method and means the agency has chosen and accomplishment of the agency's mission. Second, the agency must show that the proposal would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which the method or means was adopted. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU, </span>64 FLRA 395, 396 (2010) (citations omitted) (Member Beck dissenting as to the application of the methods and means test); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Council of GSA Locals, Council 236</span>, 55 FLRA 449, 452 (1999), <span class="Italic">petition for review denied</span>, Case No. 99-1244 (D.C. Cir. 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Authority precedent, Agency "functional grouping" policies may concern the methods and means of performing work. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Nat'l Border Patrol Council, Local 2544</span>, 46 FLRA 930, 944 (1992); <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 83</span>, 35 FLRA 398, 408 (1990); <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-89</span>, 32 FLRA 392, 401 (1988). However, applying the Authority's analytical framework, we conclude that the proposal does not affect management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the first part of the test, the Agency fails to establish a direct and integral relationship between seating employees according to their workgroups and accomplishing the Agency's mission. The Agency relies, without elaboration, on the claim that seating employees by workgroup facilitates collaboration and teamwork, and enables employees to share a file cabinet. SOP at 6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although there is clearly value as a general matter to collaboration and teamwork, and to sharing resources, the Agency's position on the negotiability issue is unsupported. The Agency does not describe or discuss the nature of the employees' duties, or why collaboration, teamwork, or access to a group file cabinet is directly and integrally related to accomplishment of the Agency's mission. <span class="Italic">See </span>SOP at 6; <span class="Italic">cf. NTEU, </span>41 FLRA 1195, 1204 (1991) (agency did not satisfy the first part of the Authority's methods and means test where it failed to describe nature of employees' duties or how locating employees by branch was directly and integrally related to the accomplishment of the agency's mission).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also fails to establish that the proposal is non-negotiable under the second part of the Authority's methods and means test. As was the case with respect to the first part of the methods and means test, the Agency's claims--that the proposal would prevent collaboration, teamwork, and sharing a file cabinet--are unexplained.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Union's Response rebuts the Agency's claims. The Union notes, without contradiction, that all of the cubicles identified in the proposal are located on the same floor, "within a few yards of" and "a matter of seconds" away from each other. Thus, employees wishing to collaborate with one another in person, or work as a team, may have to walk, at most, an additional few steps to another employee's desk. <span class="Italic">Cf. NTEU</span>, 41 FLRA 1283, 1290 (1991) (finding unpersuasive agency's assertions that seating employees within workgroups would allow for better communication, development of an informal mentor system, and permit supervisors to better monitor employees because office floor plans showed that employees would still be located within a very short distance from one another and supervisors). It also remains undisputed that employees largely communicate via email and telephone.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency's claims regarding use of a shared file cabinet and the possible distance between a manager and a secretary are similarly unsupported. The Agency fails to show how the proposal would impede use of the file cabinet, or prevent the manager and secretary from effectively interacting.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, we find that the Agency has failed to establish that the proposal affects its right to determine the methods and means of performing work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The proposal does not affect management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency fails to demonstrate that the proposal affects management's right to assign work under the Statute. The Agency does not address how the seating selection process would affect its management right. When an agency does not support its &#x00A7; 7106(a) claim with an explanation of how management's rights are affected, the Authority rejects the argument. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 60 FLRA 367, 380 (2004) (Authority declined consideration of an argument where agency presented "no explanation of how [the proposal] would affect its right to assign work") (Chairman Cabaniss and Member Pope dissenting <span id="page_1002"></span>on other grounds), <span class="Italic">petition for review granted, remanded in part, rev'd in part</span>, 437 F.3d 1248 (D.C. Cir. 2006)). Accordingly, we find that the Agency has failed to establish that the proposal would affect its right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Past practice principles have no bearing on the proposal's negotiability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's claim that the proposal is outside the duty to bargain because it violates a past practice is also erroneous. Past practice principles have no applicability as a potential bar to a proposal's negotiability. The general rule pertaining to past practice is well established: management may not change a past practice without first notifying the bargaining representative and affording it an opportunity to bargain. <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Ill.</span>, 5 FLRA 9 (1981); <span class="Italic">see also Dep't of the Navy N. Div., Naval Facilities Eng'g Command, </span>19 FLRA 705, 716 (1985). Here, there is no claim that the Agency has changed a past practice without first notifying the Union. The dispute between the parties is whether the Agency has a duty to bargain over the Union's proposal--not whether it has changed a past practice. Accordingly, we reject the Agency's argument that it has no duty to bargain with the Union over the proposal because it fails to conform to past practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The proposal is not outside the duty to bargain because of its effect on the terms and conditions of employment of NBU employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's final contention, that the proposal is outside the duty to bargain because of its effect on non-bargaining unit employees, is no more substantial than the Agency's other claims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's rule is well established. With exceptions described immediately below, a proposal that directly affects the conditions of employment of certain categories of NBU employees is outside the duty to bargain unless the proposal addresses matters that "vitally affect" conditions of employment of unit employees. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 32, </span>51 FLRA 491, 502 (1995) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 32</span>) (citation omitted); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Cherry Point, N.C. v. FLRA, </span>952 F.2d 1434, 1442 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>); <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 110 F.3d 810, 813 (D.C. Cir. 1997)). <span id="page_1003"></span>In particular, the vitally affects test does not apply in circumstances where a union seeks to bargain over the conditions of employment of employees in other bargaining units or of supervisory, management, or other personnel who are excluded by the Statute from membership in any bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1923</span>, 44 FLRA 1405, 1417, 1422-23 (1992) (citing <span class="Italic">Cherry Point, </span>952 F.2d at 1441).[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Consistent with <span class="Italic">Cherry Point, </span>NBU employees fall into four categories: (1) employees in other bargaining units; (2) supervisory, management, and other personnel who are excluded by the Statute from membership in any bargaining unit; (3) non-supervisory personnel who are not in any bargaining unit; and (4) non-employees. <span class="Italic">See Cherry Point</span>, 952 F.2d at 1441-42. As indicated in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, the vitally affects test does not apply when a union seeks to bargain over the conditions of employment of either of the first two categories. However, under <span class="Italic">Cherry Point, </span>the test does apply when the interests of individuals in either of the last two categories are directly implicated. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the vitally affects test, the Authority will find a proposal negotiable if it (1) vitally affects the working conditions of unit employees, and (2) is consistent with applicable law and regulations. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 32, </span>51 FLRA at 503. In determining whether or not a proposal vitally affects bargaining unit employees, the Authority looks to whether "the effect of that proposal upon unit employees' conditions of employment is significant and material, as opposed to indirect or incidental." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1827, </span>58 FLRA 344, 348 (2003) (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's proposal vitally affects unit employees' conditions of employment. The proposal's effect is significant and material. The Authority has held that the location at which employees perform their duties concerns matters "at the very heart of the traditional meaning of 'conditions of employment.'" <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of HHS, SSA, Balt., Md.</span>, 36 FLRA 655, 668 (1990) (holding that a change in employees' seating assignments gives rise to a bargaining obligation) (quoting <span class="Italic">Library of Cong. v. FLRA</span>, 699 F.2d 1280, 1286 (D.C. Cir. 1983)). The Authority has further concluded that proposals that affect the location at which employees perform their duties "present the sort of questions collective bargaining is intended to resolve." <span class="Italic">Dep't of HHS. Region IV, Office of Civil Rights, Atlanta, Ga., </span>46 FLRA 396, 418 (1992) (citation omitted) (upholding ALJ's rejection of agency's argument that employees' work location did not have a direct effect on their working conditions or a "significant and material" effect on unit employees). Accordingly, we conclude that part one of the vitally affects test is met.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Authority case law upon which the Agency relies is inapposite.&#x2003;The Agency cites <span class="Italic">Local 1985</span>, 55 FLRA 1145, to support its argument that the proposal is non-negotiable because it affects NBU employees. In that case, the employees who were affected by the union's proposal were part of another bargaining unit represented by a different exclusive representative. An agency is not required under the Statute to bargain with one exclusive representative about conditions of employment in a unit represented by another union because "such a requirement would run afoul of the principle of exclusive recognition." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Council of HUD Locals 222</span>, 54 FLRA 1267, 1276, n.11 (1998) (Member Wasserman dissenting as to other matters) (citing <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, 952 F.2d at 1442). Here, it is undisputed that the NBU employees are not represented by a separate union. Therefore, <span class="Italic">Local 1985 </span>does not apply. The Agency makes no other claim that would preclude application of the vitally affects test. Accordingly, we proceed to part two of the test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Agency does not claim that the proposal is inconsistent with a law, rule, or regulation other than the management's rights contentions rejected above, we find that part two of the vitally affects test is met. Consequently, we conclude that the proposal "vitally affects" unit employees' conditions of employment and hold that the proposal is not non-negotiable based on its effect on NBUs.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">PTO and POPA</span>, 32 FLRA 1168, 1176 (1988), "proposals and collective bargaining provisions concerning office space selection are negotiable unless the agency demonstrates that its choice of space design has a technological relationship to the accomplishment and furtherance of its work, and that the proposal would interfere with the purpose for which the space design was adopted." Determining to be negotiable a proposal in <span class="Italic">NTEU and NRC, Region V, Walnut Creek</span>, 41 FLRA 1195, 1199-1205 (1991), that employees be permitted to select offices by floor unless the selection clearly conflicts with work assignments, FLRA summarized the factors controlling office space selection proposals:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the proposal is negotiable.&#x2003;Initially, we note that the only issue in dispute concerns the portion of the proposal allowing for office selection by floor. The record indicates that the parties are in agreement as to the use of seniority, as defined by the proposal, for office selection....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right of an agency under section 7106(a)(1) to determine its organization refers to the administrative and functional structure of an agency, including the relationships of personnel through lines of authority and the distribution of responsibilities for delegated and assigned duties.... This right encompasses the determination of how an agency will structure itself to accomplish its mission and functions....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Authority decisions concerning the relationship between an agency's right to determine its organization and the designation of official duty stations are closely tied to the specific circumstances involved in each case.... The Authority previously has found that the terms "official station," "duty station," and "post of duty" usually refer to something more general than a work area or floor within a building.... Authority precedent does not support the broad conclusion that whenever an agency chooses to call the specific location in which employees are assigned to perform their work an "official duty station," the choice of that location always constitutes an exercise of the right to determine organization under the Statute.... Rather, Authority precedent supports a conclusion that an agency's designation of "official station," "duty station," or "post of duty" is encompassed within the right to determine organization only insofar as that designation has a direct and substantive relationship to an agency's administrative and functional structure....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, to come within the scope of the right to determine the organization of an agency, the Agency must establish that the "duty station" of employees, that is, where they are physically located, has a direct and substantive relationship to the Agency's administrative or functional structure. For the following reasons, we find that the Agency has not established that its determination to allow employees to select their workstations only from within the floor area designated for a given branch meets this requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note the Agency's statements that it has determined to locate its employees by branches and that there is a "'direct and substantive' relationship between a branch's work and the location of its employees." However, we also note the Union's arguments that the proposal does not involve an official duty station but, rather, a work area or floor within a building, and does not alter the Agency's organization by divisions, with each division divided into branches.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike the cases cited by the Agency, the proposal in this case would not prevent the Agency from reassigning functions from one organizational unit to another and changing the building in which the work of those functions would be performed...; prevent the Agency from closing or consolidating certain duty stations...; require the Agency to maintain duty stations in certain cities...; or determine how the Agency will be divided into organizational entities.... The proposal would simply allow employees on two of the three floors occupied by divisions to choose their office space by floor, rather than by branch. Although the Agency states that locating employees by branch on each floor contributes to the accomplishment of the Agency's mission, and the Agency specifies various reasons in support of its position, those assertions relate more to the Agency's argument that the proposal interferes with the methods and means of performing work, which we will address below. Such arguments do not establish that the choice of location constitutes an exercise of the Agency's right to determine its organization under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. We note, moreover, as to the Agency's statement that organizing employees by division enhances effective management, control and efficiency, that the proposal does not affect the Agency's decision to segment its operations into divisions and branches. The Union clearly states that the proposal is not intended to affect the Agency's determination to maintain that particular organizational structure and there is nothing in the proposal to establish otherwise.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we conclude that the Agency has not established that its determination to allow employees to select their workstations only from within the floor area designated for a given branch has a direct and substantive relationship to the Agency's administrative and functional structure. Therefore, we find that the proposal does not directly interfere with the Agency's right to determine its organization....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority employs a two-part test to determine whether a proposal interferes with management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work. First, an agency must show a direct and integral relationship between the particular method or means the agency has chosen and the accomplishment of the agency's mission. Second, the agency must show that the proposal would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which the method or means was adopted....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has construed "method" as referring to the way in which an agency performs its work.... "Means" refers to any instrumentality, including an agent, tool, device, measure, plan or policy used by an agency for accomplishing or furthering the performance of its work.... The term "performing work" is intended to include those matters that directly and integrally relate to the agency's operations as a whole....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The relative importance of a particular "means" of performing work is irrelevant to a determination of whether a proposal interferes with the right to determine the methods and means of performing work. The means employed need not be indispensable to the accomplishment of an agency's mission. Rather, the means need only be "a matter that is 'used to attain or make more likely the attainment of a desired end' or 'used by the agency for the accomplishing or furthering of the performance of its work.'"... Establishing a "functional grouping" of employees constitutes the methods and means of performing work under section 7106(b)(1) where it is shown that the performance of an agency's work is facilitated by the ability to group employees based on the functions which they perform.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that "nothing could be more functional than the grouping of the employees by branch.... The key is that the functional grouping <span class="Italic">facilitates</span> the accomplishment of the branch's, and therefore the agency's work. The union's proposal would take away the agency's ability to determine the functional grouping necessary to carry out its mission." The Agency contends that locating employees by branch is important because it would enhance supervisory and intra-branch communications and information exchange, and lead to greater supervisory control, organizational efficiency and employee effectiveness.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union, on the other hand, refutes the Agency's stated reasons for seating employees by branch. The Union essentially argues that supervisory and intrabranch communication would be unaffected by the proposal inasmuch as employees work independently, travel frequently and, therefore, see their supervisors infrequently. The Union adds that employees pick up their own mail and receive phone messages with little interaction with the administrative support staff. The Union also asserts that effective communications would not be impaired because the dimensions of the floors on which employees work measure 70 feet by 140 feet, thus placing all offices within a short distance of one another. As to the other reasons advanced by the Agency in support of its seating arrangement, the Union states that the management, control and efficiency of the Agency would not be affected because the intent of the proposal is not to change the Agency's current organizational structure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency has not established that there is a direct relationship between locating employees by branch and the accomplishment of the Agency's mission. Initially, we stress that nothing in the proposal would prevent the Agency from organizing employees by branch. The proposal is concerned basically with seating assignments, by allowing office selection on a floor, rather than a branch, basis. In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 36 FLRA 655 (1990), the Authority found that a change in employees' seating assignments gave rise to a bargaining obligation. In reaching that result, we noted that the location at which employees perform their duties, as one aspect of an employee's office environment, concerns a matter "at the very heart of the traditional meaning of 'conditions of employment.'"...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency has not established that the manner in which employees perform their work necessitates office selection on a branch basis in order to accomplish the Agency's mission. In this connection, the Agency has not described the nature of the employees' duties or the work of the branches so as to support a finding that a direct and integral relationship exists between office selection by branch and the performance of the Agency's mission "to protect the public health and safety."... Moreover, as noted above, the proposal would not prevent the Agency from accomplishing its work by organizing its employees by either branch or division.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find unpersuasive the Agency's assertion that office selection by branch would enhance supervisory control and communications. In <span class="Italic">HHS, Claremore</span> [39 FLRA 504 (1991)], based on the record before it, the Authority found that grouping employees together for the convenience of the supervisor and its effect on supervisory control did not constitute a functional grouping of employees so as to constitute a method or means of performing work under section 7106(b)(1). We reach the same result here. In this regard, the record reveals that office selection would be made from the floor on which the employees' respective branches are located and that, at most, a supervisor would have to walk a slightly greater distance to meet with an employee than if that employee were located in closer proximity to the supervisor. Similarly, at most, employees would have only slightly greater distances to walk, on the same floor, to meet with other branch employees. Further, we find that as employees are in a travel status approximately 33 percent of the time, the need for close proximity in order to maintain supervisory control and communication is somewhat diminished. With regard to the Agency's additional contentions, we conclude that, in the circumstances described by the parties, minimal changes in the physical location of employees would not have a sufficient effect on the Agency's organizational efficiency or employee effectiveness to affect our decision, especially in view of the fact that employees are absent from the office for considerable periods of time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Treasury, IRS</span> [35 FLRA 398 (1990)] is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Treasury, IRS</span>, the Authority found that a union proposal to provide 64 square feet of space for each bargaining unit employee did not prevent the agency from establishing a functional grouping of employees. Initially, however, the Authority found that the agency's plan to establish the functional grouping of employees constituted a means of performing work because the agency had established that the functional grouping facilitated supervision, communication, instructional capability, coverage for absent employees and created a team atmosphere. By contrast, as discussed above, the proposal here would not have a significant effect on supervision, communication and coverage. The additional factors that were present in <span class="Italic">Treasury, IRS</span> have not been raised and do not appear to be present here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is also distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Federal Union of Scientists and Engineers, National Association of Government Employees, NAGE, Local R1-144 and Naval Underwater Systems Center, Newport, Rhode Island</span>, 28 FLRA 352, 355 (1987) (noting the absence of contradictory arguments, the Authority found, with regard to a proposal for office selection, that the agency had established "a link...between the location of employees in workspace and furthering the performance of work."); and <span class="Italic">American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2910 and Library of Congress</span>, 19 FLRA 1180 (1985) (proposal concerning preference of seating assignments shown to directly and integrally relate to the agency's operations).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we find that the Agency has failed to establish that the proposal would interfere with the methods and means of performing work, as alleged. As the proposal also would not directly interfere with the Agency's right to determine its organization, we find that the proposal is within the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent">Seating arrangements were negotiable in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3928 and DHS, C&#x0026;IS, Nat'l Benefits Ctr.</span>, 66 FLRA 175, 176, 178-79 (2011) (Member Beck dissenting), involving the proposal that employees be seated in functional groups:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Wording</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employees at the [National Business Center] will be seated in functional groups in areas delineated for that work group. The functional work groups will be based upon identified work assignments and work flow that contribute to efficient production, collaborative work groups, identification of national security issues, mentoring and employee development, and appropriate supervision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Meaning</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties agree that, under the proposal, employees would be able to select their seating location according to seniority within their assigned division, rather than only from within their assigned team. As set forth above, a team is the smallest organizational unit and is composed of one supervisor and eight to twelve employees; a division is composed of several teams, and has approximately forty to fifty employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The proposal does not affect management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In deciding whether a proposal affects management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work, the Authority initially examines whether the proposal concerns a "method" or a "means." <span class="Italic">E.g., NTEU, Chapter 83</span>, 64 FLRA 723, 725 (2010) (<span class="Italic">Chapter 83</span>). The Authority has construed the term "method" to refer to "the way in which an agency performs its work.'" <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(quoting <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1920</span>, 47 FLRA 340, 343 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Local 1920</span>)). The Authority has defined the term "means" to refer to "any instrumentality, including an agent, tool, device, measure, plan, or policy used by an agency for the accomplishment or [the] furtherance of the performance of its work.'" <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(quoting <span class="Italic">Local 1920</span>, 47 FLRA at 343).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the proposal concerns a method or a means, then the Authority employs a two-part test to determine whether the proposal affects the management right. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>First, an agency must show that there is a direct and integral relationship between the particular method and means the agency has chosen and accomplishment of the agency's mission. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Second, the agency must show that the proposal would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which the method or means was adopted. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>It is well-established that an agency has the burden of providing a record to support its assertion that a proposal is outside the duty to bargain under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU</span>, 61 FLRA 871, 875 (2006) (then-Member Pope writing separately as to other matters).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Authority precedent, agency "functional grouping" policies may concern the methods and means of performing work. <span class="Italic">See Chapter 83, </span>64 FLRA at 725. However, applying the Authority's analytical framework, we find that the proposal at issue here does not affect management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, the Authority previously has held with respect to a similar proposal that the agency had failed to establish a direct and integral relationship between seating employees according to their workgroups and accomplishing the Agency's mission. <span class="Italic">See Chapter 83</span>, 64 FLRA at 725. In <span class="Italic">Chapter 83</span>, the Authority found that the Agency failed to describe or discuss why seating employees by workgroup facilitated collaboration and teamwork, and enabled employees to share a file cabinet. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>In <span id="page_1004"></span>addition, the Authority relied on the union's showing, which the Authority noted was without contradiction, that employees would still be located a very short distance from one another and supervisors. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Similarly, in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 41 FLRA 1283, 1290 (1991), the Authority found unpersuasive an agency's assertion that seating employees within workgroups would allow for better communication and development of an informal mentor system, and would permit supervisors to better monitor employees because office floor plans showed that employees would still be located within a very short distance from one another and supervisors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, as to the Agency's claim regarding work product distribution, the Agency asserts that seating employees in teams accomplishes the Agency's mission because each team performs a distinct type of work and such work is packaged and distributed to teams, rather than to individuals. The Agency also claims that seating employees in teams facilitates "[t]eam mentoring and daily interaction (between employees and between supervisors and employees)" and use of reference materials unique to their team. Apart from these generalized claims, the Agency does not describe or discuss the nature of the employees' duties, or why work product distribution, team mentoring and daily interaction, and use of reference materials is directly and integrally related to accomplishment of the Agency's mission. <span class="Italic">See Chapter 83</span>, 64 FLRA at 725.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency's claims, the Union asserts, without contradiction, that regardless of where employees sit within a division, work for all teams is delivered to and distributed in one central location. Individuals within the division retrieve work designated for their team from that central location and return to their seats.<span class="Italic"> </span>In addition, based on the floor plans submitted by the Union, which the Agency does not challenge, all of the seating locations for employees within each division identified in the proposal are in the same geographic area covering several rows of contiguous cubicles. The floor plan also supports the Union's claim that the seating locations are "within a few yards of" and "a matter of seconds" away from each other. Likewise, it is undisputed that the distance between employees' seating locations and their supervisor would only require an individual "to walk a couple of rows over."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we find the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Local 2910 </span>to be misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Local 2910</span>, the Authority found that the agency had established that a proposal concerning preference of seating assignments was directly and integrally related to the agency's operations. Based on the record evidence and arguments set forth above, the Agency has made no such showing here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, under the proposal, employees wishing to interact with one another or their supervisor may have to walk, at most, an additional few steps. It is also undisputed that employees largely perform work at their seating location and communicate via email using their individual work computers. Therefore, this case is similar to <span class="Italic">Chapter 83 </span>and <span class="Italic">NTEU </span>because the Agency fails to demonstrate how locating employees by team is directly and integrally related to accomplishing the Agency's mission. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 64 FLRA at 726; <span class="Italic">Chapter 83</span>, 41 FLRA at 1290.[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;The dissent's argument to the contrary is unsupported because it does not explain how the Agency met its burden of establishing that the proposal involved direct and integral relationships or directly interfered with mission-related purposes. The dissent's reliance on <span class="Italic">Chapter 83 </span>and <span class="Italic">AFGE, National Border Patrol Council, Local 2544</span>, 46 FLRA 930, 944 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Border Patrol Council</span>) is misplaced because, in those decisions, the Authority found that the agencies had <span class="Italic">failed </span>to demonstrate that the proposals affected management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work. <span class="Italic">Chapter 83</span>, 64 FLRA at 725; <span class="Italic">Border Patrol Council</span>, 46 FLRA at 944.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the Agency has failed to establish that the proposal affects its right to determine the methods and means of performing work.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;As the Agency has failed to establish that there is a direct and integral relationship between the particular method and means the Agency has chosen and accomplishment of the Agency's mission, it is unnecessary to examine the second prong of the methods and means test. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Council of GSA Locals, Council 236</span>, 55 FLRA 449<span class="Italic">, </span>453 n.10 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The proposal does not affect management's right to determine its organization under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The exercise of management's right to determine its organization encompasses the right to determine the administrative and functional structure of an agency, including the relationship of personnel through lines of authority and the distribution of responsibilities for delegated and assigned duties. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA</span>, 58 FLRA 175, 178 (2002) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Conn. Healthcare Sys., Newington, Conn.</span>, 57 FLRA 47, 48 (2001). The right also includes the authority to determine how an agency will structure itself to accomplish its mission and functions. <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 58 FLRA at 178<span class="Italic">. </span>This determination includes such matters as where organizationally certain functions shall be established and where the duty stations of the positions providing those functions shall be maintained. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3529</span>, 55 FLRA 830, 832 (1999) (citing <span class="Italic">NTEU, Atlanta, Ga.</span>, 32 FLRA 886, 889-90 (1988)). In order for its seating location requirements to come within the scope of the right to determine the organization of an agency, an agency must establish that the "duty station" of employees--that is, where they are physically located--"has a direct and substantive relationship to an agency's administrative and functional structure." <span class="Italic">Chapter 83</span>, 41 FLRA at 1287.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Chapter 83</span>, the Authority found that a proposal allowing employees to select their seating location from anywhere within floor space designated for three groups of employees, rather than being seated by group, did not have a direct and substantive relationship to the agency's administrative and functional structure. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also NTEU</span>, 41 FLRA 1195, 1200 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency argues that the proposal affects management's right to determine its organization because its plan to create teams and "establish where [t]eam members will be physically located has a direct and substantive relationship to the Agency's administrative and functional structure." However, nothing in the proposal or the Union's explanation of it would affect the Agency's ability to create teams or organize employees into teams. In this regard, it would simply allow employees to select their seating location by division, rather than by team. As such, the proposal would not have a direct and substantive relationship to the Agency's functional structure. <span class="Italic">See Chapter 83</span>, 41 FLRA at 1287; <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 41 FLRA at 1200.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the proposal does not affect the Agency's right to determine its organization.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;In view of our finding that the Agency has not shown that the proposal concerns its rights to determine the methods or means of performing work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) or its organization under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, it is unnecessary to address the Agency's arguments that the proposal does not constitute an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) or a procedure under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2).</p>
