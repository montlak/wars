<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-222"><span class="space">o.</span> Annuity Issues</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">It is no secret that settlements can be structured to enable employees to obtain retirement benefits that would otherwise be unattainable at the time of the settlement. Examples of these agreements include provisions calling for an agency to separate an employee through reduction in force, through a performance-based action, or for refusal to accept a geographical reassignment, permitting the employee to qualify for a discontinued service annuity that would be unavailable if the employee were separated for misconduct. Another example is an agreement permitting an employee to remain on the agency payroll, or on LWOP, for the time necessary to qualify for early retirement, when the alternative would be earlier, adverse separation. OPM occasionally decries these agreements as means of shifting the burden of settlement from employing agencies to the retirement fund. OPM General Counsel's "Settlement Guidelines" (available on the OPM website, <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/settlement-guidelines/">opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/settlement-guidelines</a>) note that "OPM's fundamental principle is that the Retirement Fund is not a litigation settlement fund." The "Guidelines" explain areas of concern to OPM as to settlements affecting annuity entitlements and caution that a settlement might not be honored by OPM if it runs afoul of OPM guidance. OPM encourages agencies to seek guidance concerning prospective settlements affecting retirement rights by contacting its Office of General Counsel at 202-606-1700 or by email to <a href="mailto:settlementguidelines@opm.gov">settlementguidelines@opm.gov</a>. [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-320.html#sec1-313">Retirement Benefit"; and refer in this chapter to "Settlement Provision Affecting Other Agencies</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One problem with settlements that may impact retirement arrangements is that, although the AJ may accept the settlement and dismiss the case as settled, the real benefit of the settlement, i.e., the ultimate retirement benefit, is in OPM's control. OPM's actual retirement determination may not be made for months or years after the appeal settles. OPM disapproval of the benefit the parties thought they negotiated may lead to additional litigation in an attempt to modify or rescind the settlement or, through a subsequent appeal involving OPM, to challenge the OPM annuity determination. To address the possibility of OPM disapproval of a retirement application based on a settlement designed to confer a retirement benefit, the settlement may be written so that it is conditional, that is, it contains a provision for reopening of the underlying appeal, at the appellant's request to the Board, on OPM's initial or final disapproval of the retirement application contemplated by the settlement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The effect on retirement benefits of some settlements negotiated between agencies and employees without the advance approval of OPM is subject to challenge by OPM. <span class="Italic">Jordan v. OPM</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/JORDAN_J_KATHLEEN_DC_831E_96_1068_I_2_OPINION_AND_ORDER_199709.pdf">77 MSPR 610</a> (1998), <span class="Italic">post</span>, appeared to bless settlements that impacted retirement eligibility. But in <span class="Italic">Parker v. OPM</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/PARKER_TERRELL_E_BN_831M_97_0035_R_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_248673.pdf">93 MSPR 529</a><span class="Italic">,</span> 536-39 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-21 (2003), overruling <span class="Italic">Jordan</span> in part, the Board signaled that OPM would not be bound to agreements negotiated by others but affecting the retirement funds:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 610, 615-16 (1998), <span class="Italic">recons. denied</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 144, <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, Misc. No. 627 (Fed. Cir. Sept. 15, 2000), the Board held that a settlement agreement entered into the record of an appellant's appeal for enforcement purposes was equivalent to a final Board order in all respects, and that OPM was required to effect its terms when adjudicating the appellant's entitlement to retirement benefits. In its previous decision in the present appeal, the Board referred to that holding; and, although it noted that the appellant's settlement agreement with RIARNG [Rhode Island Army National Guard] had not been entered into the record for enforcement purposes, it found that RIARNG had entered into the agreement because it believed that it had violated the appellant's rights under 38 U.S.C. chapter 43 in separating the appellant and declining to reemploy him<span class="Italic">.

It found further that the administrative judge and the parties to the agreement had been "operating under the misapprehension that the Board might not have jurisdiction over the appeal"; it noted that the Board had held that it had the authority to consider reemployment appeals filed by persons, such as the appellant, who were seeking to return to civilian reserve technician positions; and it stated that, under those circumstances, it could "see no reason why OPM should not be required to effect the terms of this agreement as a reemployment in accordance with chapter 43 of title 38."<span class="Italic"> id.</span> &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its reconsideration brief, OPM challenges the Board's findings regarding the reasons for and purpose of the agreement, and it again argues that RIARNG's actions following the agreement are not binding on it in its adjudication of the appellant's retirement rights. Reconsideration Brief at 10-17. On further consideration of this matter, we find that OPM's arguments have merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A party to a settlement agreement may take a settlement-related action that affects the rights of a person or organization that is not a party to the agreement. For example, an employing agency may cancel an employee's removal in settlement of an appeal of that action; and, when it does, OPM may be required to credit, for retirement purposes, the service the employee has gained as a result of that cancellation<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">O'Neill v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 76 F.3d 363, 365-66 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (employee's originally scheduled removal date "remained intact" for purposes of computing his retirement annuity because employee "neither settled, successfully appealed, nor successfully grieved his removal"). As the Board noted in <span class="Italic">Jordan</span>, however, a settlement agreement itself may not impose duties or obligations on a third party without that party's agreement<span class="Italic">. Jordan</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. at 616 (citing <span class="Italic">Local No. 93, International Association of Firefighters v. City of Cleveland</span>, 478 U.S. 501, 529, 106 S. Ct. 3063, 92 L. Ed. 2d 404 (1986)); <span class="Italic">see</span> 15A C.J.S. <span class="Italic">Compromise &#x0026; Settlement</span> &#x00A7; 43 (2002) ("As a general proposition, a valid compromise can only affect the rights of the parties to the agreement or those in privity with them.") (footnotes omitted). Under this rule, factual admissions in a settlement agreement have been held not to be binding on a person who was not a party to the agreement, and who did not have an opportunity to contest the alleged facts before the agreement was approved<span class="Italic">. In re Warmus</span>, 276 B.R. 688, 691, 694-95 (S.D. Fla. 2002). Similarly, a stipulation that was unsupported by evidence, and that appeared to the trial court to be simply an artifice for protecting the interests of one of the parties to the stipulation, was found not to be binding on organizations that were not parties to the case in which the stipulation was made<span class="Italic">. Markow v. Alcock</span>, 356 F.2d 194, 197-99 (5th Cir. 1966).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with the authorities cited above, we hereby overrule the holding in <span class="Italic">Jordan</span> that OPM is conclusively bound by the terms of settlement agreements to which it was not a party. Rather, we now hold that, with respect to a settlement agreement to which OPM is not a party, OPM has the authority to determine whether any separation date established by the agreement is an artifice designed to evade the statutory requirements for entitlement to an annuity. OPM's authority to question a personnel action taken as a result of a settlement agreement applies whether the statutory provisions at issue implicate filing deadlines, as in <span class="Italic">Jordan</span>, or substantive criteria for entitlement to a retirement benefit, as in this case. OPM's decision not to give effect to a personnel action taken as a result of a settlement agreement is, of course, reviewable by the Board on the facts of the particular case<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d)(1) (the Board has jurisdiction to review "an administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual or of the United States" under the CSRS).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, we find that OPM has presented persuasive reasons for finding that RIARNG's retroactive appointment of the appellant following the settlement agreement is not binding on OPM. The date of the appointment on which the appellant's retirement claim is based, i.e., June 4, 1990, does not appear to bear any relationship to RIARNG's alleged violation of the appellant's reemployment rights. It does not represent the date on which the appellant's military service began or the date on which it ended; and, while the appellant alleges that he asked during 1990 to be returned to civilian service--an allegation RIARNG denies--the approximate date of that alleged request was July 1, 1990, not June 4, 1990. Moreover, since the appellant remained on active military duty before, at, and after the time of the 1990 appointment, he clearly could not have served as a civilian employee at that time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Perhaps most significant, RIARNG selected that date not in its effort to reach a settlement agreement with the appellant, but, as indicated above, in its subsequent response to OPM's informal determination that the appointment originally documented following the settlement (i.e., the appointment of February 28, 1992) did not provide the appellant with the service necessary to meet the requirement in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b) that at least 1 year of the 2 years preceding his separation be served in a CSRS-covered position. Evidently, therefore, the documents suggesting that the appellant was appointed to a civilian position on June 4, 1990, were designed for no other purpose than to give the appearance that the <span id="Page_5140"></span>appellant had the service necessary for him to receive a CSRS annuity, so that the cost of the settlement would be paid from the CSRDF, rather than by RIARNG.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, we find that the documents purporting to show that the appellant was appointed to a civilian position on June 4, 1990, are comparable to the stipulations and factual admissions the <span class="Italic">Markow</span> and <span class="Italic">In re Warmus</span> courts found not binding on third parties. Accordingly, we find that OPM is not obligated to credit the appellant with service based on such an appointment.</p>

Cir. 2014 NP No. 2014-3088) ("The settlement agreement resolved the dispute between the parties and did not entitle Ms. Fenlon to disability retirement benefits from OPM.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a GS-5 Forestry Technician with the Department of Agriculture (USDA), was removed effective November 2, 2002, based on two misconduct charges, one of which he admitted, namely, repeatedly taking large cash advances on his government credit card for personal use. The appellant appealed his removal to the Board. During the course of the removal appeal, the appellant asserted that he was unable to perform a significant portion of his job duties, that is, those involving walking for long periods of time at a high altitude on uneven ground and firefighting. The parties subsequently entered into a written settlement agreement in which the appellant withdrew his appeal and USDA cancelled the removal action for alleged misconduct, agreed to purge the appellant's personnel files of all documents related to it, substituted a removal action for medical inability to perform the essential forest fire suppression duties of his position, and agreed to assist the appellant with his disability retirement application. The settlement agreement was accepted into the record for enforcement in an initial decision that dismissed the appeal as settled and that became the Board's final decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, who was 37 years old at the time, filed an application for a FERS disability retirement annuity based on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, and congestive heart disease. The appellant asserted that he could not perform his "timber" and "silviculture" duties under his position description, which comprised a total of fifty percent of his major duties, because he was unable to hike for numerous hours of each day over uneven surfaces and at high altitudes. The appellant also asserted that he was unable to perform firefighting duties, which comprised ten percent of his major duties under his position description.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM denied the appellant's application, finding that the medical evidence submitted by the appellant was insufficient to establish a disabling medical condition. OPM's initial decision also noted that the appellant had been removed for misconduct and that he had not shown any nexus between his misconduct and his alleged medical condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant requested reconsideration from OPM and also filed a petition for enforcement of the settlement agreement in his removal appeal with the Board. In the compliance proceeding, the appellant entered into a new, compact disc-recorded settlement agreement with USDA, in which USDA agreed to send OPM a letter stating its position that the appellant's medical conditions prevented him from performing his essential job duties because he is restricted from exposure to forest fire smoke and that it could not accommodate his medical conditions. OPM issued a final decision denying the appellant's request for reconsideration, finding that the appellant's alleged misconduct was his principal service deficiency and that the appellant had not submitted sufficient medical evidence showing that he was unable to perform useful and efficient service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appealed OPM's final decision to the Board and requested a hearing. After holding the requested hearing at which the appellant, his treating physicians, and his first-level supervisor testified, the administrative judge (AJ) reversed OPM's reconsideration decision. The AJ found that USDA erred when it submitted evidence of the canceled removal action to OPM, and that the appropriate remedy was for the Board to disregard the documents regarding the canceled removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that the appellant established that his medical conditions prevented him from hiking for long periods of time over uneven surfaces and at high altitudes, a critical element of his position of record. In addition, the medical evidence established that the appellant could not perform the firefighting duties of his position, which the AJ found were also critical to his position. Although OPM argued that, if the appellant quit smoking, he would be able to perform these job duties, the AJ found that the medical evidence showed that the appellant's health might improve, but it would never improve to the point that he could perform the firefighting duties of a Forestry Technician. The AJ determined that the appellant's disabling medical condition was expected to continue for at least 1 year from the date that he filed his application for disability retirement and that accommodation of the condition in his position was unreasonable. Finally, the AJ found that the appellant showed that he could not be reassigned to a vacant position in USDA at the same grade or level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an appeal from OPM's denial of a disability retirement application, the appellant bears the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)]. To be eligible for a disability retirement annuity under FERS, an employee must have completed at least 18 months of creditable civilian service, must be unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in his position, and must not have declined a reasonable offer of reassignment to a vacant position in the agency at the same or greater grade or pay level in the employee's commuting area in which he is able to render useful and efficient service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8451(a); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.103(a). OPM's implementing regulations further require that the disabling medical condition be expected to continue for at least 1 year from the date the application is filed and that accommodation of the condition in the appellant's position be unreasonable. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.103(a)(3), (4). A determination regarding entitlement to disability retirement benefits must consider the following evidence: (1) objective clinical findings; (2) diagnoses and medical opinions; (3) subjective evidence of pain and disability; (4) evidence relating to the effect of the applicant's condition on his ability to perform in the grade or class of position last occupied; and (5) evidence that the applicant was not qualified for reassignment to a vacant position at the same grade or level as the position he last occupied. <span class="Italic">Dunn v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 426, 432 (1994), <span class="Italic">appeal dismissed</span>, 91 F.3d 169 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that USDA violated the specific terms of its settlement agreement with the appellant, namely, to cancel the removal action and to assist the appellant with his disability retirement application, by submitting evidence of the canceled removal action to OPM. Thus, the AJ, citing <span class="Italic">Conant v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 255 F.3d 1371, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2001), disregarded the documents regarding the canceled removal action that were sent to OPM in error. However, in <span class="Italic">Conant</span>, the court found that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) "sabotag[ed]" the appellant's disability retirement application, in violation of a clean-record settlement agreement in which it had promised to give its "best efforts" to "effectuate" the appellant's disability retirement, when it submitted to OPM "unproven allegations of misconduct" and documents "it had promised to rescind." <span class="Italic">Conant</span>, 255 F.3d at 1376. The court instructed the Board to reconsider the appellant's claim for disability retirement without taking into account any evidence of the adverse action that was canceled under the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1377. Unlike the IRS in <span class="Italic">Conant</span>, USDA in this case did not promise that it would put forth its best efforts to help the appellant obtain disability retirement, although it was obligated to provide certain information to OPM regardless of the terms of the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See CSRS and FERS Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices</span>, &#x00A7; 60B2.1-2 (Aug. 15, 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the law has been refined since <span class="Italic">Conant</span>. In <span class="Italic">Parker v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 18 (2003), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 91 Fed. Appx. 660 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the Board held that OPM has the authority to disregard a personnel action taken pursuant to a settlement agreement to which OPM was not a party, when the personnel action was an evasive device designed to allow the appellant to qualify for retirement benefits for which he would otherwise have been ineligible. If OPM, in carrying out its statutory responsibility of deciding claims for disability retirement, may look behind a settlement agreement to which it was not a party, then it follows that the Board, in carrying out its statutory responsibility of reviewing an OPM final decision, may also look behind a settlement agreement to which OPM was not a party. Thus, we find that the appellant's failure to apply for disability retirement until after being removed for misconduct is a relevant factor in this appeal and detracts from the force of his application for a disability retirement annuity. <span class="Italic">See Anderson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 299, &#x00B6; 22 (2004), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 120 Fed. Appx. 320 (Fed. Cir. 2005).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Parker</span>, the Board rejected OPM's objections in an appeal involving an employee whose original termination date was adjusted through a settlement canceling the removal and creating some LWOP, to permit the employee to file a disability retirement application that would have been untimely if the original termination date remained in effect. In <span class="Italic">Jordan v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that OPM's authority to administer the retirement system does not empower it to ignore separation dates effected pursuant to settlement agreements entered into a record before the Board. OPM correctly asserts that Congress authorized it to administer the retirement system, and gave it the power to perform acts and prescribe regulations it deems necessary to carry out that authority. 5 USC &#x00A7; 8347(a)-(c). Congress, however, did not provide OPM with unfettered discretion in this regard. Instead, it directed that an OPM action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual under the retirement system be appealable to the Board under the procedures prescribed by the Board. 5 USC &#x00A7; 8347(d)(1). The Board's procedures empower its administrative judges to facilitate and accept settlement agreements. Specifically, the Board's regulations state that its judges will conduct fair and impartial hearings and will take all necessary action to avoid delay in all proceedings, and, to that end, they have the power to hold prehearing conferences for settlement, to initiate settlement attempts at any time, to dismiss an appeal as settled, with the settlement representing the final and binding resolution of the appeal, and to retain jurisdiction to ensure compliance with the agreement where the agreement is entered into the record for enforcement purposes. 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.41(b)(12), 1201.41(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, our precedent has consistently recognized that settling matters that come before us promotes both public and explicit Congressional policy. <span class="Italic">See e.g., Special Counsel v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Treasury,</span> 72 MSPR 62, 64 (1996). The Board has explained that public policy favors settlement agreements which serve to avoid unnecessary litigation and encourage fair and speedy resolution of issues before us, and it has rejected arguments that would discourage settlements as contrary to this policy. <span class="Italic">See Shaw v. Department of the Navy,</span> 39 MSPR 586, 590 (1989), <span class="Italic">overruled in part on other grounds by Joyce v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 74 MSPR 112, 115-17 (1997). The Board has also explained that Congress specifically intended the Board to settle matters subject to its jurisdiction, and that this practice is consistent with both a purpose of civil service reform, assuring expeditious consideration of appeals, and the Administrative Procedure Act. <span class="Italic">Shaw,</span> 39 MSPR at 590-91; <span class="Italic">Richardson v. Environmental Protection Agency,</span> 5 MSPB 289, 5 MSPR 248, 250, 250 n.1 (1981), <span class="Italic">modified, Shaw,</span> 39 MSPR at 590-91, <span class="Italic">overruled in part on other grounds by Joyce</span>, 74 MSPR at 115-17. The Board has also recognized that the Federal Rules of Evidence promote the policy of facilitating settlements by excluding settlement offers as evidence to show the existence or extent of liability, and it has adopted this practice in its proceedings, noting that the "law favors settlements."[1] <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel v. Costello,</span> 75 MSPR 562, 609 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Executive Order 12988, 3 CFR 157, 161 (1996), further illustrates federal policy favoring settlement in federal courts and administrative adjudication. It states that, in order to improve access to justice, encourage the filing of only meritorious claims, reduce needless litigation, and promote fair and prompt adjudication, among other concerns, all federal agencies should review their administrative adjudicatory processes and develop specific procedures to reduce delay in decision-making, facilitate self-representation, expand non-lawyer counseling and representation, and invest maximum discretion in fact-finding officers to encourage appropriate settlement of claims as early as possible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has further held that resolving an appeal based upon a settlement constitutes a final decision issued under the Board's appellate jurisdiction, and thus the Board has authority to enforce the settlement agreement once the agreement becomes part of the Board record. <span class="Italic">Richardson</span>, 5 MSPB 289, 5 MSPR at 250. Because the settlement at issue in the present case was entered into the record for enforcement purposes, it is equivalent to a final Board order in all respects, and OPM must effect its terms to the same extent it would a Board order on the merits in administering a retirement matter before it. <span class="Italic">See also Jones v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 56 MSPR 311, 314-15 (1993) (in effectuating terms of a settlement, the Board was not determining a statutory entitlement, but was instead enforcing the parties' contractual agreement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also reject OPM's assertion that the agreement improperly binds it even though it was neither a party nor an intervenor. Although a settlement may not dispose of a third party's claim, or impose duties or obligations on a third party without that party's agreement, the agreement here neither binds OPM nor obligates it to do anything. <span class="Italic">See Local Number 93 v. City of Cleveland,</span> 478 U.S. 501, 529-30, 106 S. Ct. 3063, 3079-80, 92 L. Ed.2d 405 (1986). The agreement neither mentions OPM directly, or by name, nor requires the appellant to file a disability retirement application. Further, the agreement provides no basis for either the appellant or her employing agency to initiate an enforcement proceeding against OPM for any action it takes or fails to take<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. Thus, the agreement in no way binds OPM or impedes its authority to administer the retirement system. OPM, however, must accept the underlying circumstances of the appellant's separation under the settlement the same way it would accept the circumstances existing pursuant to a final Board decision on the merits. <span class="Italic">See Richardson,</span> 5 MSPB 289, 5 MSPR at 250.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also disagree with OPM's characterization that the settlement created a fictitious period of service "solely for the purpose of evading" the statutory time limit for filing a disability retirement application. Parties may enter into a settlement for a myriad of reasons, including the desire to avoid the time and expense of litigation. <span class="Italic">See Shaw.</span> In any event, the reason the parties entered into the settlement is not germane to the issue before us. Instead, the relevant inquiry is whether OPM must recognize the separation date set forth in the employing agency's records pursuant to the settlement agreement. As explained above, the Board has previously held that it must, and, because that agreement has been entered into the Board's record for enforcement purposes, it is entitled to the same effect as any other final Board order. <span class="Italic">See Moran,</span> 72 MSPR at 141; <span class="Italic">Davenport,</span> 59 MSPR at 373; <span class="Italic">Richardson,</span> 5 MSPB 289, 5 MSPR at 250. OPM must, therefore, accept the separation date effected pursuant to the settlement agreement in determining the appellant's retirement claims, in the same way it accepts other certifications without further inquiry. <span class="Italic">See e.g., Bacani v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 64 MSPR 588, 594-96 (1994) (OPM bound by Department of Veterans Affairs certification of employee's individual retirement record), <span class="Italic">dismissed,</span> 56 F.3d 79 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table); <span class="Italic">Dickson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 37 MSPR 465, 468-70 (1988) (OPM bound by military determination of military retired pay).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM also argues that the appellant's receipt of disability retirement benefits pursuant to the settlement improperly shifts the bulk of the financial burden from her employing agency to the retirement fund. OPM asserts that, if the appellant obtains a disability annuity retroactive to September 1994, the amount paid from the retirement fund over the course of her expected life span would far exceed the total amount of a deferred annuity commencing at age 62, which would be the only annuity the appellant would be entitled to receive absent the settlement agreement. OPM argues that settlement shifts the cost of resolving the appeal from the employing agency to the retirement fund, thereby treating the retirement fund as a litigation settlement fund for the convenience of the employing agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This valid policy concern for protecting the integrity of the retirement system, however, cannot be viewed in a vacuum, and instead must be considered in light of the public policy favoring settlement agreements. In any event, we need not decide whether this reason alone warrants a different view of the settlement in this case, however, because the limited issue before us--whether the appellant timely filed her disability retirement application-does not on its face require any payment from the retirement fund.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Other pre-Parker decisions followed the Jordan approach. In <span class="Italic">Bynum v. OPM</span>, 89 MSPR 1, 5-6 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11 (2001), an employee removed for AWOL settled the appeal through an agreement requiring that the basis for the removal be changed to reflect "termination/disability." OPM disapproved her annuity application, an appeal ensued, and the Board found that the AJ properly applied a rebuttable presumption of disability based on the reason, established by the settlement agreement, for the employee's separation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM charges that the AJ erred in finding that the appellant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of her entitlement to a disability retirement because she considered that the true basis for the appellant's removal was physical inability to perform, when, in fact, that reason was "fictitious, fabricated, and fraudulent." In so arguing, OPM challenges the AJ's application of the <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption which provides that an employee's removal for disability, i.e., medical inability to perform her job duties, establishes a rebuttable <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of her entitlement to disability retirement, and shifts the burden to OPM to produce sufficient evidence to support a finding that she is not entitled to disability retirement benefits<span class="Italic">. See Bruner v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 996 F.2d 290, 293-94 (Fed. Cir. 1993). The <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption further provides that, if OPM satisfies <span id="Page_5142"></span>this burden of production, the totality of the evidence is considered to determine whether the employee satisfied her ultimate burden of establishing, by preponderant evidence, her entitlement to disability retirement<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 294.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">A settlement establishing a basis for removal that invoked a rebuttable presumption of disability was not a guarantee that an annuity would be received, <span class="Italic">Summers v. OPM</span>, 48 Fed. Appx. 762, 763-64 (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Summers' first argument on appeal is that she is entitled to disability retirement by reason of her settlement agreement with DOJ. As noted, pursuant to the settlement agreement, it was agreed that applicable records would be changed to state that Ms. Summers' employment with DOJ was terminated because she was medically unable to perform her duties. Ms. Summers maintains that she demonstrated entitlement to disability through the settlement agreement. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DOJ was not empowered to grant Ms. Summers disability retirement. It is OPM that "[determines] questions of disability and dependency" in administering the federal government's disability retirement program. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(c). Consequently, the settlement agreement itself stated in paragraph 6: "All parties understand that once the disability retirement documents are sent to [OPM], the approval is an OPM decision."

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found, and the Board agrees, that under 5 USC Chapter 83, Subchapter III (Civil Service Retirement), an annuitant's retirement annuity is calculated on the basis of the average basic pay received during a specified period of the annuitant's creditable service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 8331(4) and 8339(a).

(Emphasis supplied.) Thus, under OPM's official guidance, "the rate of annual basic pay--not the pay actually received by the employee--is to be used" to calculate the retirement annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> Federal Personnel Manual Supp. 831-1, Subch. S14-3(d)(1) (Sept. 21, 1981). Because OPM is the agency charged with the administration of the civil service retirement statutes, we accord deference to its reasonable interpretation of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8331(3), (4) and 8339(a). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hollowell v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Comptroller General's decision to which the appellant refers concluded, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that informal settlements of discrimination complaints without a specific finding of discrimination are authorized by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, and that federal agencies may authorize backpay awards, attorney fees, or costs without a corresponding personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 62 Comp. Gen. 239, 244 (1983). The Comptroller General's decision concerns an agency's authority to award backpay in informal settlement of discrimination complaints without also awarding a retroactive promotion. The decision, however, does not address the issue of whether such a backpay award without a corresponding retroactive promotion is includable in an employee's average basic pay under 5 USC &#x00A7; 8331 for purposes of calculating his retirement annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The terms of the settlement agreement in the present case did not provide for the appellant's retroactive promotion to the GS-12 grade level and the agency did not effect such promotion. Therefore, the Board concurs with the determination of the administrative judge that OPM correctly based its calculation of the appellant's retirement annuity on the average basic pay of her GS-11 position, and that OPM correctly excluded the lump-sum backpay award in calculating her annuity under 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8331(3), (4) and 8339(a).</p>

When the agency did not supply the proper documentation and the employee's application was denied, the Board declined to remedy the problem caused by the agency's failure to supply the material called for by the settlement. The court, however, took a different approach and essentially rewrote or reformed the settlement agreement to require the agency to redo the separation of the employee in a manner that permitted him to apply for disability retirement with the supporting material that the agency should have provided the first time around:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lary, a longtime employee of the USPS, suffers from Obstructive Sleep Apnea, a disorder that affects his breathing and thereby disrupts his sleep, often causing excessive drowsiness. As a consequence of this disorder, Lary was frequently late for his job as a Tour 2 Window Technician at the Benson United States Postal Station in Omaha, Nebraska.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On February 6, 2002, the USPS issued Lary a Notice of Proposed Removal charging him with "Unacceptable Conduct--Failure to Maintain a Regular Work Schedule/Tardy." On March 4, 2002, Lary was removed from his position effective March 8, 2002. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(b), Lary had until one year after his effective termination date, or March 8, 2003, to file a disability retirement application with the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On or about April 5, 2002, Lary appealed his removal to the Board, charging the USPS with violating the Americans with Disabilities Act <span id="Page_5143"></span>of 1990, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 12101-12213 (2000), and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2601-2654 (2000). On July 12, 2002, the parties entered into a "Stipulation and Settlement Agreement," pursuant to which Lary agreed to withdraw with prejudice his appeal and all other claims filed, never to seek or accept reinstatement to the USPS, and to accept a non-disciplinary removal for medical inability to perform his job duties due to sleep apnea.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The USPS made a number of return promises in the agreement. It agreed to vacate the March 4, 2002, Decision Letter removing Lary and the earlier Notice of Proposed Removal, and it agreed that those documents would be "removed &#x0026; expunged from [Lary]'s Official Personnel Folder and all other official files of the Agency." The USPS also agreed to "issue a new PS Form 50 that will indicate medical inability to perform as the reason for [Lary]'s removal." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Crucially, the USPS agreed to provide Lary three documents "in connection with [Lary]'s application for disability retirement <span class="Italic">within two weeks"</span> of the execution of the settlement.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 27 (emphasis added). Those documents were the Supervisor's Statement, the Agency Certification of Reassignment and Accommodation Efforts and the Disability Retirement Checklist. Under the disability retirement regulations, these three documents are required "in order to determine whether the individual meets the eligibility requirements set forth in [5 C.F.R.] &#x00A7; 844.103." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.203(a) (2006); <span class="Italic">see also</span> OPM Standard Form 3112, "Documentation in Support of Disability Retirement Application" (1995), <span class="Italic">available at</span> http://www.opm.gov/forms/html/sf.asp [now at <a href="https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf3112.pdf">https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf3112.pdf</a>] (requiring the forms as part of the disability retirement application process).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The USPS thus agreed to provide Lary, in the documents, with the statements necessary for Lary to meet the eligibility requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.103, including that the applicant was being removed for medical reasons; that accommodation efforts had been futile; that Lary's performance was deficient; and that the deficiency in Lary's performance was expected to continue indefinitely. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.103. The parties agreed to cooperate and communicate in good faith to implement the terms of the settlement. Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(c)(2)(i) (2006), the Board accepted the settlement agreement into the appellate record and retained jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The USPS, as called for in the settlement agreement, issued a new PS Form 50 indicating medical inability to perform as the reason for removal. However, it is undisputed that the USPS did not provide the three documents in connection with Lary's disability retirement application within two weeks of the settlement agreement, as provided for by the agreement. In fact, the agency did not provide the three documents, completely and correctly filled out, until May 13, 2003, well after the March 8, 2003, deadline for Lary's disability retirement application, and after Lary's counsel had contacted the USPS several times to request the documents.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ultimately the USPS itself filed Lary's disability retirement application with OPM, but this was not until May 13, 2003. On August 26, 2003, OPM rejected the application by letter because it was filed more than one year from Lary's separation on March 8, 2002. Lary did not seek review of OPM's decision. However, on July 16, 2003, Lary filed a petition for enforcement with the Board, alleging that the USPS had breached its obligations under the settlement agreement.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision must be affirmed unless it is found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation; or unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c) (2000); <span class="Italic">Yates v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 145 F.3d 1480, 1483 (Fed. Cir. 1998).

Mgmt.</span>, 255 F.3d 1371, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The question whether a breach of a contract is material is a mixed question of law and fact. <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 334 F.3d 1065, 1071 (Fed. Cir. 2003). At the same time, "[w]here, as here, the facts are undisputed, the determination of whether there has been material non-compliance with the terms of a contract...necessarily reduces to a question of law." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1072.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first consider whether there was a material breach of the settlement agreement. That there was a breach is clear, and the government itself does not dispute this fact. The government failed to provide the three documents referenced in the agreement within the specified two-week timeframe. Thus the question becomes whether the breach was material.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining materiality courts often look to whether the breached obligation is an important part of the contract. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Dep't of Hous. and Urban Dev.</span>, 124 F.3d 1439, 1442 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("A breach is material when it relates to a matter of vital importance, or goes to the essence of the contract.") (citing 5 Arthur L. Corbin, <span class="Italic">Corbin on Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 1104 (1964)). Here the government's failure to timely provide the three documents was central to the settlement agreement. The agreement expressly stated that the USPS would complete the required documents "in connection with [Lary]'s application for disability retirement." The documents were the very same ones that OPM required the USPS to complete before Lary's application could be considered complete. <span class="Italic">See</span> OPM Standard Form 3112, "Documentation in Support of Disability Retirement Application" (1995), available at <a href="http://www.opm.gov/forms/html/sf.asp">http://www.opm.gov/forms/html/sf.asp</a> [now at <a href="https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf3112.pdf">https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf3112.pdf</a>](listing the forms as required). Under these circumstances it is clear that the government breached an important obligation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether a breach is material, we have also considered the Restatement factors:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In determining whether a failure to render or to offer performance is material, the following circumstances are significant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;the extent to which the injured party will be deprived of the benefit which he reasonably expected;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;the extent to which the injured party can be adequately compensated for the part of that benefit of which he will be deprived;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c)&#x2003;the extent to which the party failing to perform or to offer to perform will suffer forfeiture;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(d)&#x2003;the likelihood that the party failing to perform or to offer to perform will cure his failure, taking account of all the circumstances including any reasonable assurances;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(e)&#x2003;the extent to which the behavior of the party failing to perform or to offer to perform comports with standards of good faith and fair dealing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Restatement (Second) of Contracts, &#x00A7; 241 (1981); <span class="Italic">see also Hansen Bancorp, Inc. v. United States</span>, 367 F.3d 1297, 1311-1312 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Here Lary has been deprived of the opportunity to timely file for disability retirement benefits, which he could reasonably expect from the settlement agreement. Since the Board does not have authority to grant damages, the second factor is also not met. <span class="Italic">See Wonderly v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 529, 532 (1995). There is no risk that the government will suffer forfeiture, and the government is not likely to take steps to cure its failure. Finally, under the fifth factor, the government offers no justification for failing to perform in a timely way.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ nonetheless held, and the government argues on appeal, that the breach was not material because, under OPM regulations, Lary could have filed an incomplete application and avoided missing the deadline. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.201(a)(3) ("An application...that is filed...within 1 year after the employee's separation, and that is incompletely executed...is deemed timely filed."); <span class="Italic">see also</span> OPM Standard Form 3112 ("OPM <span class="Italic">must receive</span> your application not more than <span class="Italic">one year</span> after the date you separated from your position. If you are unable to get all the information requested, do <span class="Italic">not</span> delay submitting your Standard Form 3112A to OPM.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reject this conclusion for two reasons. First, the argument that Lary could have timely filed an incomplete application is relevant only to the question whether he could have mitigated damages and not to the materiality of the breach. Even the detailed Restatement factors on materiality nowhere suggest that the nonbreaching party's failure to take steps that could mitigate damages is relevant to determining whether the breach was material. The government has cited no authority suggesting that the failure to take mitigation steps bears on the materiality of the breach. As the government did not make a mitigation argument below, and does not make one on appeal, we hold that the AJ erred in considering this ground.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second reason we reject the government's argument is that, even if Lary had filed an incomplete application and thus avoided missing the one-year deadline, he would still have been irreparably harmed by the government's breach. This is because disability benefits do not begin to accrue until all application requirements have been met and the application is complete. OPM Standard Form 3112-2, at 7 ("Disability annuity benefits begin accruing on the first day after your pay as an employee stops and disability and service <span class="Italic">requirements</span> have been met.") (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also</span> OPM Standard Form 3112 (describing the documents that the USPS agreed to provide in the settlement as required). Thus the government's delay here cost Lary retirement benefits which he had no way of recouping. The breach was clearly material.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now consider which remedy is appropriate here. The government admits that the MSPB can order rescission of the agreement and reinstatement of petitioner's claim on appeal or enforce the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Wonderly</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 532 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"In a rescission, the parties are restored to their respective positions prior to the transaction." <span class="Italic">Blanco v. United States</span>, 602 F.2d 324, 327 (Ct. Cl. 1979). Here rescission is not an adequate remedy. Rescinding the settlement agreement and reinstating Lary's appeal would not change the fact that Lary has missed the OPM deadline, since he had only one year from his <span id="Page_5144"></span>separation date of March 8, 2002, to file his application with OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second remedy that the government agrees is available in this case is enforcement of the agreement. Enforcement by specific performance is intended to have "the same effect that the performance due under a contract would have produced." Restatement Second of Contracts &#x00A7; 357 cmt. a; <span class="Italic">see also id.</span> at &#x00A7; 358(1) ("An order of specific performance...will be so drawn as best to effectuate the purposes for which the contract was made."). We hold that the appropriate remedy in this case is specific performance. An order of specific performance does not have to order the exact performance contemplated by the contract. The order "will be so drawn as best to effectuate the purposes for which the contract was made and on such terms as justice requires. It need not be absolute in form and the performance that it requires need not be identical with that due under the contract." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 358(1); <span class="Italic">McFarland v. Gregory</span>, 322 F.2d 737, 739 (2d Cir. 1963) ("In framing such a decree the performance that it requires need not be identical with that promised in the contract."). Rather, [t]he court should so mold its decree as best to effectuate the purposes for which the contract was made." Margaret N. Kniffin, <span class="Italic">Corbin on Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 1137 (Joseph M. Perillo ed., rev. ed. 1993); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 358 cmt. a (describing the goal of "assur[ing] the expectations of the parties").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is simply impossible to order that the documents be timely provided. Rather, in order to effectuate the purpose of the settlement agreement, which was to give Lary the opportunity to timely file for disability retirement with the full support of the USPS, the MSPB should order the USPS to take again all steps contemplated by the original agreement. Thus the MSPB should order the USPS to vacate any and all of Lary's prior removals, proposed removal letters and PS Form 50's and expunge them from the records, and to issue a new letter of decision removing Lary (effective on the date the new letter issues) and a new PS Form 50 indicating medical inability to perform as the reason for removal. It should further order the USPS to provide the three documents (the Supervisor's Statement, the Agency Certification of Reassignment and Accommodation Efforts and the Disability Retirement Checklist) within two weeks of the order of specific performance. These newly-issued documents should reference only the date of the removal entered pursuant to the order of specific performance, and not any earlier removals. Under OPM policy, Lary will then be able to file for disability retirement benefits within one year of the new removal entered pursuant to the decree of specific performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since Lary's previous removals will be expunged, the agency on remand should also award Lary any back pay and other relief that he may be due under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596 (2001). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 550.801 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. (2006). In order to avoid a windfall to Lary, any back pay should not exceed the amount of disability payments that Lary would have received in the relevant time period if the USPS had complied with the settlement agreement.[2] <span class="Italic">See Old Stone Corp. v. United States</span>, 450 F.3d 1360, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2006) ("[t]he non-breaching party should not be placed in a better position through the award of damages than if there had been no breach.") (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>
