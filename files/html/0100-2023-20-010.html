<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-11"><span class="space">d.</span> Threat to Public Health and Safety</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board has developed little law defining when a disclosure of a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety occurs under 5 USC 2302(b)(8), <span class="Italic">Sazinski v. HUD</span>, 73 MSPR 682, 685-87 (1997), explained that a disclosure to the National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE) of a danger to public health and safety was to be both substantial and specific to qualify for protection:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant wrote to the NSPE's Government Relations Department after he learned that the agency had decided to abolish "several" Regional Engineer positions, including his own. In his letter, the appellant stated that the field engineering program was established to provide technical support to the agency's housing program, that at one time the agency employed 80 engineers but that the current staff was "down somewhat from that number," and that the decision to abolish Regional Engineer positions did not "bode well" for either the incumbents of those positions or the future of the field engineering program. The appellant further stated that he had "extensive" credentials that "might justify" a position at agency headquarters, but that he preferred to work with contractors, architects, and engineers in the field. The appellant told the NSPE that he would appreciate "any efforts" the NSPE might make to "further [his] concern" for the future of the field engineering staff, such as sending a letter to the Secretary of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development (HUD) or generating publicity in the trade press.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that his letter to the NSPE was a disclosure of a "substantial and specific danger to public health or safety." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). We disagree. As explained in <span class="Italic">Prescott v. DHHS</span>, 6 MSPB 216, 6 MSPR 252, 258 (1981) (quoting S. Rep. No. 95-969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 21 (July 10, 1978)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[O]nly disclosures of public health or safety dangers which are both <span class="Italic">substantial</span> and <span class="Italic">specific</span> are to be protected [whistleblowing]. Thus, for example, general criticism by an employee of the Environmental Protection Agency that the agency is not doing enough to protect the environment would not be protected under [section 2302(b)(8)]. However, an allegation by a Nuclear Regulatory Commission engineer that the cooling system of a nuclear reactor is inadequate would fall within the whistleblower protections.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3607"></span>(Emphasis in original). In other words, revelation of a negligible, remote, or ill-defined peril that does not involve any particular person, place, or thing, is not protected. In his letter to the NSPE, the appellant at most expresses a fear that some day, the field engineering program might not have the resources it needs to support the housing program. Insofar as public health and safety is concerned, the letter does not even rise to the level of vagueness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The December 30, 1994 memorandum to "Ron Bailey, Management" and "Steve Hensley, Union." The appellant sent a memorandum to an agency official and a union official in which he stated that he was "concerned where I" and other Regional Engineers whose jobs were abolished "will be placed in the new reorganized [agency] structure." In the memorandum, the appellant stated that the field engineering program was understaffed. He also stated that with the newly-established "direct line between [headquarters] and the field offices," headquarters staff "may find themselves overloaded" with questions, and that this "overload may lead to a decrease in client services and delays in assistance." He further stated that the reorganization "may prove risky." The appellant opined that "the public health, safety, and welfare of HUD's clients could be compromised."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that his memorandum revealed a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. Under the standards enunciated above, however, the December 30, 1994 memorandum is not protected. The memorandum is phrased entirely in terms of what the appellant thought <span class="Italic">could</span> result from the reorganization. The reorganization was not even complete when the appellant wrote the letter, and the appellant did not know where he would be placed in the new structure or precisely how the reorganization would affect the provision of engineering services. Moreover, the memorandum does not contain a single reference to any particular hazard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Prescott v. DHHS</span>, 6 MSPR 252, 258-59, 6 MSPB 216 (1981), referenced in <span class="Italic">Sazinski</span>, elaborated on the Board's view of "specific danger to public health or safety":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The major point of appellant's petition, however, is that he had a reasonable basis for believing that regardless of what the Director may have said, the Director had, in fact, made a change in policy. Thus, he argues that he was justified in what he wrote. Although the record indicates that appellant may have had a reasonable basis for believing that the Director eliminated topics which were previously included within the agency's mission, the fact remains that the letters distorted the Director's stated position. That distortion is indefensible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the Board finds that the policy dispute between appellant and the Director is not the sort of information which one would reasonably believe to evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003; a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or (ii) mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">as contemplated by section 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history provides, with respect to the last mentioned category, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">only disclosures of public health or safety dangers which are both <span class="Italic">substantial</span> and <span class="Italic">specific</span> are to be protected. Thus, for example, general criticism by an employee of the Environmental Protection Agency that the agency is not doing enough to protect the environment would not be protected under this subsection. However, an allegation by a Nuclear Regulatory Commission engineer that the cooling system of a nuclear reactor is inadequate would fall within the whistleblower protections.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's claimed belief that the Director had terminated agency research into child abuse and neglect and the developmental origins of violence falls between the two extreme examples just stated, but does not give rise to a finding by the Board that appellant reasonably believed that a substantial and specific danger existed as to the public health or safety.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Standley v. Dept. of Energy</span>, DC-1221-16-0168-W-1 (NP 1/3/2017), reviewed the level of disclosure required as to a danger to public health or safety:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although a disclosure of a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety is protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), revealing a negligible, remote, or ill-defined peril that does not involve any particular person, place, or thing is not protected. <span class="Italic">See Johnston v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 518 F.3d 905, 909-10 (Fed. Cir. 2008). In <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Department of the Interior</span>, 515 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2008), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit identified a number of factors that the Board might consider in determining whether disclosing a danger to public health or safety is sufficiently substantial and specific to warrant protection under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">One such factor is the <span class="Italic">likelihood of harm resulting from the danger</span>. If the disclosed danger could only result in harm under speculative or improbable conditions, the disclosure should not enjoy protection. Another important factor is <span class="Italic">when the alleged harm may occur</span>. A harm likely to occur in the immediate or near future should identify a protected disclosure much more than a harm likely to manifest only in the distant future. Both of these factors affect the specificity of the alleged danger, while the nature of the harm--<span class="Italic">the potential consequences</span>--affects the substantiality of the danger.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1369 (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also Chambers v. Department of the Interior</span>, 602 F.3d 1370, 1376 (Fed.

We do not question that a delayed response to a nuclear detonation in space would imperil public health and safety, but the appellant has not shown that such an occurrence is more than a possibility occurring at an undefined point in the future. <span class="Italic">Cf., e.g., Johnston</span>, 518 F.3d at 910 (finding that the appellant disclosed a specific and substantial danger "not only because training exercises take place under extreme weather conditions and routinely involve the use of live fire and explosives, but also because a series of accidents had occurred during such exercises in the past").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The appellant argues that <span class="Italic">Chambers</span> is "outdated" and was "legislatively rejected" by Congress with the passage of the WPEA, which "reaffirmed its intent to protect <span class="Italic">all</span> disclosures that a whistleblower reasonably believes evidence" any of the conditions set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Although the WPEA broadened the types of disclosures that might be protected under the statute, the <span class="Italic">Chambers</span> factors go to the <span class="Italic">reasonableness of an employee's belief</span> that the matter he is disclosing represents a condition described by the statute. Moreover, our reviewing court still cites the <span class="Italic">Chambers</span> factors. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Yeh v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 527 F.

<p class="Body-Text">Summarizing cases, <span class="Italic">Elkin v. VA</span>, SF-1221-20-0387-W-1 (NP 7/18/2022), considered interrelated disclosures of alleged abuse of authority and danger to public health or safety:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The types of protected disclosures most relevant to the appellant's arguments on review are those concerning an abuse of authority or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. Regarding the former, the Board has explained that an abuse of authority is an arbitrary or capricious exercise of power by a federal official or employee that adversely affects the rights of any person or that results in personal gain or advantage to himself or to preferred, other persons. <span class="Italic">Linder v. Department of Justice</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 14, &#x00B6; 15 (2014). Regarding the latter, the Board has explained that disclosures about a danger to the public must be both substantial and specific to be protected. <span class="Italic">Schoenig v. Department of Justice</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6; 10 (2013). Factors to be considered in determining whether a disclosed danger is sufficiently substantial and specific to be protected include the likelihood of harm, when the alleged harm may occur, and the potential consequences of the harm. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Disclosure of an imminent event is protected, but disclosure of a speculative danger is not. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> To illustrate with a relevant example, the Board once found that an employee's disclosures were protected where he reasonably believed he was disclosing systemic problems regarding inadequate patient care with specific examples of misdiagnoses and misdirection of patients. <span class="Italic">Parikh v.

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Braga v. Dept. of Army</span>, 54 MSPR 392, 398 (1992), the employee was a GS-11 Clothing Designer who reported to higher-level officials his belief that his superiors were requiring him to design protective clothing that provided too little protection against the dangers that military personnel might encounter. The disclosures were protected, even though they involved the safety of a limited number of government personnel rather than the safety of the general public:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Regarding the appellant's safety concerns, we find that his disclosures alleged the existence of a "substantial and specific danger to public health or safety," within the meaning of the statute, notwithstanding the fact that the perceived danger was to a limited number of government personnel, and not to the general public. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Grady v. Department of Navy</span>, 38 MSPR 118, 121 (1989) (finding that an employee reasonably believed that his disclosure evidenced a danger to public health and safety where he complained that the agency's policy of allowing smoking in the library threatened the health of the staff and constituted a fire hazard). We further find that the appellant's allegations that his supervisors did not take appropriate steps to deal with the dangers he warned of constitute allegations of gross mismanagement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wojcicki v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 72 MSPR 628, 634-35 (1996), added that a protected disclosure may involve the safety of the appellant and his coworkers:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that a danger may be substantial and specific even though the perceived danger was to a limited number of government <span id="Page_3608"></span>personnel and not to the general public at large. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Braga v.

Department of the Navy</span>, 38 MSPR 118 (1988). In addition, the fact that an appellant's motivation in making the disclosure may have been personal does not prevent the disclosure from being protected whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See Berube v.</span> <span class="Italic">General Services Administration</span>, 30 MSPR 581, 596 (1986), <span class="Italic">vacated on other grounds</span>, 820 F.2d 396 (1987). Therefore, even though this appellant's disclosure about the sandblasting operation may have concerned a matter that affected only a limited number of co-workers, and even though it may have concerned a matter personal to him, it is still a protected whistleblowing disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant reasonably believed that the safety violation that he disclosed was substantial under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A). His own symptoms, coupled with his detailed observations of the problems with the sandblasting procedure and equipment certainly form the basis of a reasonable belief. The fact that the safety violations were quickly and easily alleviated does not reduce the reasonableness of a belief that the violations were a substantial danger to safety.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Here, Dr. Hessami's allegations amount to more than a general assertion that the VA is neglecting the health of its HCV patients. Even if she is unable to identify specific patients who were harmed, the allegation that a specific government physician is directing patients to take medications with known risks and side effects for an unnecessarily long period of time, paired with her reasonable belief that there was no clinical justification for doing so, does not represent a "negligible, remote, or ill-defined peril that does not involve any particular person, place, or thing, is not protected." <span class="Italic">Chambers</span>, 515 F.3d at 1368-69 (citation omitted).

<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether a disclosure is protected because of a reasonable belief that it evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, the Board considers factors such as (1) the likelihood of harm resulting from the danger, (2) the imminence of the potential harm, and (3) the nature of the potential harm. <span class="Italic">Parikh v.

<p class="Body-Text">Expressions of concerns about the safety of security of nuclear weapons transport, more specifically, the qualifications of the personnel who provide the security, were protected and, when a letter of counseling was issued as a result of those protected disclosures, the appellant was entitled to a finding of reprisal and corrective action, <span class="Italic">Johnston v. MSPB</span>, 518 F.3d 905, 907-12 (Fed. Cir. 2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Johnston is employed as a Safety and Occupational Health Manager ("SOHM") in the Office of Secure Transportation of the National Nuclear Security Administration in the Department of Energy (the "agency"). The agency's mission is to safely transport nuclear weapons and other nuclear materials. Agency employees are heavily armed and trained to safeguard nuclear weapons from attack by terrorists and other criminals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a SOHM, Johnston has extensive safety training and experience. In January 2006, she became aware that her supervisors planned to implement Policy 7.04a, which would take safety management responsibilities away from SOHMs and delegate them to other agency employees, known as Command Safety Representatives ("CSRs"). Johnston alleges that in January and February 2006, she "continually voiced to her supervisor, Dean Triebel, her concerns that under [proposed Policy 7.04a] responsibility for safety management would be delegated to personnel who lacked appropriate education and experience in safety management." On January 28, 2006, Triebel sent an email asking Johnston and other employees to review proposed Policy 7.04a. In response, on February 21, 2006, Johnston sent an email to Triebel and several others, some of whom worked outside her branch of the agency, expressing her dissatisfaction that under the proposed policy her job description and job responsibilities would be changed. She also "question[ed] the legality and the ethics" of the proposed policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On February 24, 2006, Johnston had a meeting with Triebel and another supervisor, Joseph Vigil. Johnston alleges that in this meeting she informed her supervisors she intended to communicate her criticisms of the proposed policy to the Department of Energy's Office of Inspector General ("OIG"). Johnston further alleges that her supervisors orally reprimanded her for voicing her concerns about proposed Policy 7.04a, and told her that she had "damaged [her] reputation beyond repair" by sending the February 21, 2006 email to persons outside her chain of command.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Soon thereafter, Johnston contacted the OIG, which summarized her disclosures as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Reliance on untrained safety personnel to review training lesson plans could put [agency personnel] and personnel from other agencies at risk for serious injury. [The agency] regularly conducts training exercises with rigorous physical activities and often with live fire and explosives. Training is conducted during periods of extreme heat and humidity, or exceptional cold weather. Fog, dust, sleet, high winds, snowfall, or rainfall can impair a trainee's vision, footing, and ability to manipulate a weapon, creating a potential safety hazard to both the trainee and those nearby. Additionally, [agency employees] routinely conduct joint testing exercises with other agencies, which add[s] to the complexity and safety hazards of the training exercise. The serious injury that occurred in 2002 underlines the risk that can arise from using untrained personnel to perform safety reviews.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Memorandum from Christine Shafik, Department of Energy Office of Inspections and Special Inquiries (March 13, 2006) [hereinafter <span class="Italic">OIG Memorandum</span>].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 1, 2006, Triebel issued a "counseling memorandum" to Johnston, stating that she had "demonstrated inappropriate conduct by sending out an email [regarding proposed Policy 7.04a] to members of [the agency] who were not associated with the issues." On March 15, 2006, Johnston received a revised performance plan. She alleges that this revised plan substantially reduced her training and safety management responsibilities and caused her to be "effectively demoted."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Johnston subsequently filed a formal letter of complaint with the OIG, further articulating her concerns regarding the dangers of the proposed policy. <span class="Italic">See</span> Letter of Complaint from Julie Johnston to the OIG (March 17, 2006) [hereinafter <span class="Italic">Letter of Complaint</span>]. In this letter, Johnston stated that "safety is not a popular sport.... [I]t is not about being on the right team.... [I]t is about doing the right thing, even when it is not the popular choice." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 2. She explained that she felt it was her "obligation...as a safety professional" to move forward with her complaints about the agency's plan to delegate safety management responsibilities to personnel whom she believed lacked adequate training and experience. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Soon thereafter, Johnston filed a complaint with the United States Office of Special Counsel, in which she alleged that accidents had occurred in training exercises in November 2002, January 2003 and November 2004 because of "flaws in the risk assessment procedures." <span class="Italic">See</span> Letter from Matthew C. Glover, U.S. Office of Special Counsel (June 20, 2006) [hereinafter <span class="Italic">Special Counsel Letter</span>]. After exhausting her administrative remedies at the Office of Special Counsel, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3), Johnston appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board, alleging that the agency had retaliated against her for engaging in protected whistle-blowing activity. The administrative judge dismissed her appeal for lack of jurisdiction, concluding that her disclosures were not protected by the WPA because they did not identify a substantial and specific threat to public safety. The administrative judge's initial decision became the final decision of the board on February 9, 2007. Johnston timely appealed to this court; we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Discussion</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Johnston argues that the board erred in dismissing her appeal; she contends she established board jurisdiction by non-frivolous allegations that she suffered reprisal for expressing her opinion that the agency's <span id="Page_3609"></span>implementation of Policy 7.04a would put agency personnel and others at risk for serious injury. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is a fundamental distinction between the requirements necessary to prevail on the merits of a WPA claim and those sufficient to establish board jurisdiction. To prevail on the merits, an employee must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor in an adverse personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Marano v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 2 F.3d 1137, 1140 (Fed. Cir. 1993). At the jurisdictional threshold, however, the employee's burden is significantly lower: for individual right of action appeals "the Board's jurisdiction is established by nonfrivolous allegations that the [employee] made a protected disclosure that was a contributing factor to the personnel action taken or proposed." <span class="Italic">Stoyanov v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 474 F.3d 1377, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>)). Thus, Johnston could establish a jurisdictional predicate for her claims by making non-frivolous allegations that: (1) her disclosures were within the purview of the WPA, and (2) she suffered reprisal in the wake of these disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I.&#x2003;Protected Disclosures</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPA protects several types of communications, one being a disclosure regarding what an employee "reasonably believes" to be a "substantial and specific danger to public health or safety." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8); <span class="Italic">Herman</span>, 193 F.3d at 1378-79. Johnston alleges she made such a disclosure; we deem her allegations non-frivolous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The disclosures made by Johnston were precise and unambiguous: she asserted that using inadequately trained personnel to review agency training exercises would increase the danger of serious injury to those conducting the exercises as well as others in the vicinity. Training exercises are designed to simulate attacks on nuclear weapons by terrorists and other criminals, and Johnston explained that they routinely involve the use of live fire and explosives. She further explained that training activities frequently take place under extreme weather conditions where "[f]og, dust, sleet, high winds, snowfall, or rainfall can impair a trainee's vision, footing, and ability to manipulate a weapon, creating a potential safety hazard to both the trainee and those nearby." <span class="Italic">OIG Memorandum</span> at 2. In addition, Johnston noted that agency employees "routinely conduct joint testing exercises with other agencies, which add[s] to the complexity and safety hazards of the training." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> She buttressed her claims regarding the dangers inherent in training activities by referring to a series of accidents, some of them serious, which had occurred during such activities in the past. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Special Counsel Letter</span> at 2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Johnston disclosed a very specific and substantial danger--that agency employees and others in the vicinity could suffer serious injury if inadequately trained personnel were charged with responsibility for managing training activities. Her beliefs were objectively reasonable, not only because training exercises take place under extreme weather conditions and routinely involve the use of live fire and explosives, but also because a series of accidents had occurred during such exercises in the past. <span class="Italic">See LaChance v. White</span>, 174 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (the standard for determining whether an employee's beliefs are reasonable under the WPA is an objective one). It is important to note, moreover, that Johnston expressed her fears not only to her immediate supervisors, but also made very detailed disclosures regarding her safety concerns to her agency's Office of Inspector General. <span class="Italic">See Willis v. Dep't of Agric.</span>, 141 F.3d 1139, 1143 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (no protection under the WPA when disclosures were not made to "authorities who were in a position to correct the alleged wrongdoing").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Johnston's disclosures are not the sort of vague, conclusory or facially insufficient allegations of government wrong-doing that fail to provide an adequate jurisdictional predicate under the WPA. <span class="Italic">See Herman</span>, 193 F.3d at 1380-81 (board had no jurisdiction under the WPA for the disclosure of "trivial" violations of agency rules); <span class="Italic">Fields</span>, 452 F.3d at 1304 (board had no jurisdiction under the WPA where a disclosure "was simply a chronology of events that did not contain any allegation of wrongdoing"). To the contrary, her allegations involve the sort of detailed and facially well-supported disclosures that have been deemed sufficient to support board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Reid v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 508 F.3d 674 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (jurisdiction established where employee had a "reasonable belief" that a potential violation of law could occur even where the violation never actually occurred); <span class="Italic">Yunus v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 242 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (allegations were "facially sufficient" to establish jurisdiction where factual underpinnings of claim were "not frivolous"); <span class="Italic">see also Eidmann v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 976 F.2d 1400, 1406-07 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (employee "reasonably believed" his agency violated a no-smoking ban where regulations prohibited smoking in public areas).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">II.&#x2003;Distinction between Substantive and Jurisdictional Determinations</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In dismissing Johnston's claims, the board erroneously conflated the requirements for establishing jurisdiction with those required to prevail on the merits of a WPA claim. <span class="Italic">See Spencer v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 327 F.3d 1354, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("This court for more than ten years...has tried to get the Board to clearly separate the issue of jurisdiction from that of the merits of a petitioner's case."); <span class="Italic">Spruill v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 978 F.2d 679, 686-89 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (contrasting jurisdiction with failure to state a claim and relating the nonfrivolous allegation standard to the well-pleaded complaint rule). The board premised its jurisdictional determinations on its conclusion that the "general tenor of [Johnston's] communications appears to be disagreement with the agency's decision to strip her of duties and to put her at the same level as others she deems less qualified in safety matters." <span class="Italic">Johnston</span>, slip op. at 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are two reasons why this determination was wrong. First, while Johnston's February 21, 2006, email to her supervisor focuses primarily on the fact that her own job description was being changed, her disclosures to the OIG contained detailed information regarding her concerns that proposed Policy 7.04a would delegate safety management responsibilities to unqualified personnel, thereby putting agency personnel and others at risk for serious injury. <span class="Italic">See OIG Memorandum</span> at 1-2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, and more importantly, Johnston's motivation for making her disclosures and her credibility are related to the merits of her claim, not to whether she made allegations sufficient to support board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See LaChance</span>, 174 F.3d at 1381 (bias or self-interest may be considered when adjudicating the <span class="Italic">merits</span> of a WPA claim). It may be true that Johnston's communications primarily involve dissatisfaction with her job assignments, and that she may be unable to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that she suffered reprisal for any protected disclosure. It is also possible that the agency can defeat her claims by showing, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken adverse personnel actions against her even absent any protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">See Marano</span>, 2 F.3d at 1141 (once an employee has established the existence of a personnel practice prohibited by the WPA, "the burden then shifts to the agency to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action against the whistleblower even in the absence of his protected disclosure"). Whether she will ultimately be able to prevail on the merits, however, is a wholly separate issue from whether the board had jurisdiction over her appeal. <span class="Italic">See Bell v. Hood,</span> 327 U.S. 678, 682 (1946) (claims regarding jurisdiction cannot be defeated by the possibility that the plaintiffs may not ultimately recover); <span class="Italic">see also Patterson v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, 424 F.3d 1151, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, the government acknowledges that an "employee is entitled to a hearing if she presents a non-frivolous allegation that the Board has jurisdiction over her [claims]." It contends, however, that Johnston's allegations are frivolous because it was "unreasonable" for her to believe that it was dangerous to employ CSRs, rather than SOHMs, to review agency training exercises. In support, it points out that CSRs would be given training and would be supervised by a CSR team leader.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This argument misses the mark. Johnston asserted that SOHMs have far more safety expertise than CSRs, and she was not required to prove conclusively that CSRs were incapable of properly reviewing training activities in order to establish board jurisdiction. On the contrary, under the WPA, "whether [an] allegation can be proven is a question on the merits that does not properly form a part of the jurisdictional inquiry." <span class="Italic">Reid</span>, 508 F.3d at 678; <span class="Italic">Greenspan v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 464 F.3d 1297, 1305 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (government doctor reasonably believed his disclosures evidenced misconduct, even when others at his agency thought his allegations were "unfounded"). Indeed, since Johnston's appeal was dismissed before she was given access to the agency's file on her case or provided with an opportunity to conduct discovery, it would have been well-nigh impossible for her to prove that CSRs lacked the requisite training and experience to safely review training activities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are few areas more fraught with potential peril to public safety than the transport of nuclear weapons. Johnston has been employed for several years as a safety and health expert at the agency charged with transporting the nation's nuclear stockpile, so it takes more than the government's mere contention that her allegations regarding safety issues are "frivolous" to dismiss at the jurisdictional stage of the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">III.&#x2003;Reprisal</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, to carry her jurisdictional burden Johnston was required to make non-frivolous allegations not only that she made a protected disclosure, but also that such disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take adverse personnel actions against her. Neither the administrative judge nor the board addressed whether she made non-frivolous allegations that her disclosures were contributing factors in any adverse personnel actions. Nor does the government address the issue here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court has made clear that a "whistleblower need only allege that the 'deciding official knew of the disclosure' and that the adverse action 'was initiated within a reasonable time of that disclosure' in order to make a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the adverse action." <span class="Italic">See Reid</span>, 503 F.3d at 678 (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)<span id="Page_3610"></span>(1)); <span class="Italic">see also Marano</span>, 2 F.3d at 1142. Because Johnston alleges that she "was subjected to a reduction in her job responsibilities and [issued] a disciplinary memorandum just days after making her disclosures to the OIG," we see her allegations that her disclosures contributed to the agency's actions as non-frivolous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board's jurisdiction does not normally extend to personnel decisions such as reductions in job responsibilities. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Knollenberg v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 953 F.2d 623, 625 (Fed. Cir. 1992).

Thus, changes in work duties and disciplinary action are personnel actions that are within the Board's jurisdiction if they resulted from disclosures protected by the WPA. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2); <span class="Italic">Reid</span>, 508 F.3d at 678.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has been employed as a Transportation Security Specialist with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) since September 2003. As such, he is tasked with covert testing of baggage and passenger security systems at U.S. airports and with overseeing a team of [redacted] people in conducting tests involving bags and passenger checkpoints. The testing involves attempts to pass simulated bombs and bags tainted with explosive contaminants through screening. The appellant's IRA appeal alleged that the agency violated the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) when it proposed to suspend him for 14 days and removed some of his team leader duties. He asserted that the agency's actions were in retaliation for protected disclosures, i.e., his criticism of proposed changes in standard operating procedures (SOPs) for [redacted] screening....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Disclosures regarding danger to the public must be both substantial and specific to be protected. <span class="Italic">Chambers,</span> 515 F.3d at 1369 <span class="Italic">(citing Herman v. Department of Justice,</span> 193 F.3d 1375, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 1999)). A disclosure of a speculative danger does not meet this test. <span class="Italic">Herman,</span> 193 F.3d at 1379. However, disclosure of an imminent event is protected. <span class="Italic">Reid v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 508 F.3d 674, 678 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Factors to be considered in determining whether a disclosed danger is sufficiently substantial and specific to be protected under the WPA include the likelihood of harm, when the alleged harm may occur, and the potential consequences of the harm. <span class="Italic">Chambers,</span> 515 F.3d at 1369.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The disclosures at issue in this appeal were the appellant's comments in April 2007 regarding proposed changes to screening SOPs and his reiteration of his concerns just prior to the August 4, 2007 implementation date of new SOPs. The appellant believed that the changes he saw in the SOPs could have catastrophic results by making it easier for an explosive device to be placed on board an aircraft.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant raised two specific matters. His primary concern was with regard to the procedure to be followed in a [redacted] bag search," which is conducted on [redacted] of bags at [redacted] utilizing the Explosive Trace Detection (ETD) test. The appellant believed that under the existing SOP, when a bag tested positive for explosive traces after an external swab was taken, TSA screeners were then required to [redacted] In contrast, he believed, the new SOPs would require [redacted].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The [redacted] bag search provisions are found at &#x00A7; 4.3.2 of both the original SOPs and the new version implemented on August 4, 2007. The latter is much shorter than the former, because it does not detail all steps to be followed (including, as the appellant asserted, searching of [redacted]. Rather, it refers the reader to another section for steps to follow when the external swab is negative, i.e., the [redacted] bag search provisions at &#x00A7; 4.3.3. Thus, the appellant's view that a change had been made in the [redacted] bag search provision appears to be correct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ determined that the appellant did not have a reasonable belief that his disclosures showed a substantial and specific danger, finding that he did not have the education, training, or expertise to support his claims and did not provide objective evidence or data that the proposed SOPs presented a danger to the public. The AJ found the appellant not credible because his educational background was in criminal justice rather than explosives or related technology, and he had no particular expertise in such matters. Moreover, the AJ noted, the appellant produced no evidence to support his claim that ETDs have a 10 percent failure rate or often do not alarm even when a sample 20 million times the stated sensitivity level was present. He therefore found that the appellant was presenting only an unsupported, subjective view. He also noted that the agency had a thorough evaluation process for assessing and approving changes, suggesting that the fact that others disagreed with the appellant meant his beliefs regarding the existence of safety issues were not reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the AJ erred in finding that the appellant did not prove by preponderant evidence that he had a reasonable belief that changes in the SOPs would pose a substantial and specific danger to public safety. Because the AJ's findings were not based on the witnesses' demeanor, with one exception, the Board may make its own factual judgments. <span class="Italic">See Leatherbury v. Department of the Army,</span> 524 F.3d 1293, 1304 (Fed. Cir. 2008) ("The general rule is that the Board is free to substitute its judgment for that of one of its administrative judges[,]" with the exception of overturning a demeanor-based credibility determination); <span class="Italic">see Hendricks v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 179, &#x00B6; 8 (2008). The Board may make determinations of fact different from those of the AJ where there is a sound reason, based on the record. <span class="Italic">Dogar v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ did not find the appellant's disclosures or hearing testimony credible in part because his claims were based on his work experience rather than particular education or training with explosives or related technology and because of the lack of objective evidence supporting the appellant's assertion that EDT machines have a 10 percent failure rate. These findings, however, are inconsistent with the standard in <span class="Italic">Lachance,</span> 174 F.3d at 1381, that the reasonableness of an individual's belief is based on facts known to and readily ascertainable by him. One of the appellant's principal job duties for 4 years prior to implementation of the new SOPs was to attempt to pass bags tainted with explosive contaminants through screening. His experience in conducting these tests, which is the basis for his conclusion that EDT machines do not detect explosive residue 10 percent of the time, is more than sufficient to support a reasonable belief in the fallibility of the machines. Moreover, there is no evidence that the appellant had any opportunity to discuss the matter with Jappinga so as to have access to her views. It was also error to judge the reasonableness of the appellant's beliefs by the opinion of Jappinga, who has superior credentials, because the appellant is not required to prove the truth of his assertion regarding a safety issue. <span class="Italic">See Schaeffer v. Department of the Navy,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 606, &#x00B6; 5 (2000). He is only required to prove that a reasonable person in his position would believe there was such an issue. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, it was error to determine that the appellant's belief was not reasonable simply because management officials involved in the review process, including Comacho, did not agree with him. Although the AJ found Comacho credible based on his demeanor in testifying that he did not believe the EDS/EDT protocol changed significantly in the August 2007 SOPs, Comacho did not explain his position. That is, he did not say why the change was not significant. Moreover, the appellant's interpretation is facially reasonable. A reading of the relevant provisions of the document, &#x00A7; 3.5 and &#x00A7; 4.3.1, together leads to the conclusion that the appellant reached, i.e., that a [redacted] is not always required in an EDT resolution of an EDS alarm, as it was in the original SOPs. With regard to the appellant's stated primary concern, the [redacted] bag search provisions, a reading of &#x00A7; 4.3.2 of the revised SOPs also supports the appellant's view that a change was made so that a positive outside swab did not always result in a [redacted]. This interpretation was also confirmed in an April 20, 2007 email from Kevin Donovan, the Manager of the Screening Procedures Branch responsible for the SOPs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Donovan stated in relation to the [redacted] bag search provision that "[W]e don't think it's that big of a change." As noted previously, Comacho also testified that the EDS/EDT change was not significant. The appellant's disclosures thus can be seen as a policy disagreement. However, a disclosure of information reasonably believed to evidence a danger to public safety may be protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), even if the alleged danger was created by a policy decision. <span class="Italic">Chambers,</span> 515 F.3d at 1368-69.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant in this case reasonably believed that the changes he identified in the agency's SOPs constituted disclosure of substantial and specific dangers to public safety. Our reviewing court has directed us to consider the likelihood of harm, when it may occur and the potential consequences in assessing whether the disclosure is substantial and specific. <span class="Italic">See Chambers,</span> 515 F.3d at 1368-69. In this case, the potential consequences--placement of an explosive device on a commercial airliner--obviously would be catastrophic. Moreover, the extensive screening measures that have been put in place by the government to prevent such an occurrence are a reflection of how likely and imminent the threat may be. We therefore find that the <span class="Italic">Chambers</span> criteria are met, <span id="Page_3611"></span>and that the appellant made protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">See Johnston v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 518 F.3d 905, 909 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (objection to nuclear weapons transportation policy change to involve less educated and experienced personnel was a protected disclosure regarding public safety). In so holding, we are not required to, and expressly do not, make any finding as to whether the SOP changes actually resulted in any threat to public health or safety.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the AJ in this case did not find that the appellant made protected disclosures, he did not determine whether the disclosures were a contributing factor in the actions at issue or whether the agency would have taken them in the absence of the disclosures. "To prevail on the merits, an employee must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor in an adverse personnel action." <span class="Italic">Johnston,</span> 518 F.3d at 909; <span class="Italic">see also Chambers,</span> 515 F.3d at 1367; <span class="Italic">Rusin v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">This is not the sort of disclosure that rises to the level of a "substantial and specific danger."

He explained that if the water entered the TRACON area, it could cause the electrical equipment therein to malfunction and impact the flying public and employees who may be at risk of injury from electrical shock. The administrative judge found the appellant's text page to be a protected disclosure pursuant to the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the agency contends that the appellant's text message of February 6, 2008, did not meet the definition of a protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). The agency specifically contends that the appellant's belief that he was disclosing a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety was unreasonable. Because we agree with the agency, we grant the agency's petition for review, finding that the appellant did not make a protected disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To prevail in a case of retaliation for whistleblowing under the WPA, an employee must show by a preponderance of the evidence that he made a protected disclosure and that disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action at issue. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1); <span class="Italic">Horton v. Department of the Navy</span>, 66 F.3d 279, 283-84 (Fed. Cir. 1995).

Department of the Air Force</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 628, 633-34 (1996). Whether an appellant has a reasonable belief that his disclosure evidences one of the categories of wrongdoing set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A) is determined by an objective test: whether a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily accessible by the appellant could reasonably conclude that the matter disclosed evidences one of those categories. <span class="Italic">Miller v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Department of the Interior</span>, our reviewing court stated that the danger to public health or safety reported in a protected disclosure cannot be "a negligible, remote, or ill-defined peril that does not involve any particular person, place, or thing." <span class="Italic">Chambers v.

The <span class="Italic">Chambers</span> court set forth the factors to be considered in examining whether a disclosure meets this standard:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;The likelihood that actual harm will result from the danger;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">2.&#x2003;The imminence of the danger; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">3.&#x2003;The potential consequences of the harm.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1369; <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Groseclose v. Department of the Navy</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 194, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24-25 (2009) (applying test from <span class="Italic">Chambers</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we learn from the plain language of the disclosure itself that (1) a pressure valve had burst, but (2) the water had been turned off, and (3) agency personnel were working on the problem. We also learn that the appellant assessed the situation as having "[n]o impact" at the time he issued the text page. This phrase is significant as it conveys both the appellant's subjective belief about the leak at the time he sent the text page and the understanding the recipients would have had when they received the page. The communications standard operating procedure (SOP) for NAS Specialists and other agency officers instructs these employees to "[p]rovide a level of impact (high, medium, or no impact)" when they send a text page regarding an event. The SOP defines a "no impact" event as one that "currently has no impact on NAS operations and is not expected to have an impact on NAS operations." Based on this assessment alone, a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily accessible by the appellant could not have reasonably concluded that the matters disclosed evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the appellant's text page included no request for assistance. Instead, the text page clearly shows that agency personnel already knew of the problem and had taken action to resolve it. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Horton</span>, 66 F.3d at 282 (purpose of WPA is to encourage disclosure of information to persons who may be in position to act upon and remedy the wrong); <span class="Italic">Wadhwa v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The inquiry into whether an appellant disclosed danger that is sufficiently substantial and specific to warrant finding that it is protected whistleblowing "is guided by several factors, among these: (1) the likelihood of harm resulting from the danger; (2) when the alleged harm may occur; and (3) the nature of the harm, i.e., the potential consequences." <span class="Italic">Chambers v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant stated that his concerns about his coworker arose when the appellant, after he overheard the coworker shouting and using profanity, engaged the coworker in conversation and the coworker revealed that he had violent tendencies and an assault record. Even considering the truth of the appellant's assertion that his coworker shouted, used profanity, and talked about his violent tendencies and assault record, the likelihood of such behavior escalating to danger through workplace harm is dependent on a series of wholly unknown and unpredictable events. Thus, we find that the potential harm is tantamount to being dependent on a series of unlikely events. <span class="Italic">See Parikh</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 197, &#x00B6; 15.

The appellant refused to place the pallets because, from his point of view, the pallets themselves were a safety risk. He contends that, by refusing to obey instructions to place the pallets and reporting the matter to higher-level management, he disclosed a serious safety issue. The administrative judge found that the appellant failed to show that he had a reasonable belief that the pallets posed a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Disclosures regarding danger to the public health or safety must be both substantial and specific to be protected. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 312, &#x00B6; 6 (2009). A disclosure of a speculative danger does not meet this test. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Factors to be considered in determining whether a disclosed danger is sufficiently substantial and specific to be protected include whether a substantial, specific harm was identified and whether the evidence supported a finding that the harm already had been realized or was likely to result in the reasonably foreseeable future. <span class="Italic">Chambers v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges on review that the administrative judge improperly discounted the risk posed by the pallets and overemphasized the fact that it was temporary. He avers the agency had better options for mitigating the hazard posed by the standing water. The Board's role is not to decide whether the agency made the best choice, but whether a reasonable person in the appellant's position would believe, not merely that the matter was a safety hazard, but that it posed a substantial and specific risk to public health or safety. <span class="Italic">See Swanson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Chambers</span>, the Federal Circuit found that the appellant disclosed a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety when she disclosed that a reduction in the number of police officers available resulted in more traffic accidents because the risk was specific, i.e., an increase in traffic accidents, and substantial rather than speculative because the risk had already occurred. <span class="Italic">Chambers</span>, 602 F.3d at 1379. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Aquino v.

Here, however, the appellant has presented no evidence as to whether the risk of falling on the pallets was substantial and specific; he merely relies on the common sense proposition that sometimes people fall and sometimes falls are serious. At best, therefore, the appellant has identified a potential future danger to public safety that has not been shown to be substantial, that could possibly lead to an injury that may or not be serious, and that was intended to be (and actually was) a temporary remediation of a more serious safety hazard. Consequently, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant's fourth disclosure was not protected.</p>

The Board's decision touched on many aspects of whistleblowing disclosures, including what constitutes a reasonable belief in the disclosure, the motivation for the disclosure, and the nature of the "clear and convincing" affirmative defense of the agency when there is some evidence of wrongdoing and the question arises whether that evidence would have prompted removal in the absence of the protected disclosures and the reaction by agency officials to those disclosures, <span class="Italic">Parikh v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether reprisal for whistleblowing activities occurred, an inquiry must be made into whether: The appellant made a disclosure protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8); the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's personnel action; and the agency can prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the disclosure. <span class="Italic">Morgan v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant has identified a large number of allegedly protected disclosures that he claims contributed to his removal, the notice of proposed removal itself cited only a limited number of those disclosures. Nearly all of the hearing testimony was directed toward the disclosures specifically cited in the notice of proposed removal, and the parties' most salient arguments on petition for review pertain to those disclosures in particular. We agree with the parties that the essence of this case is whether the disclosures cited in the notice of proposed removal were protected, and, for the reasons explained below, we find that this case can be resolved without a detailed analysis of each and every one of the appellant's disclosures. The Board may resolve the merits issues in an IRA appeal in any order it deems most efficient, <span class="Italic">Fisher v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The proposing official, Medical Service Chief Dr. Subhash Kukreja, charged the appellant with one count of "unauthorized release and disclosure of private and protected information," supported by six specifications. Each specification described personal patient information that the appellant disclosed and identified the individuals to whom he disclosed it. Among the disclosures identified in the notice of proposed removal were letters dated January 6, 2007 (disclosure 8), and March 12, 2007 (disclosure 9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In specification (v), the agency alleged that the appellant sent copies of disclosure 8 to Senator Barack Obama and Congressman Luis Gutierrez, and that the appellant's disclosure contained "the full names and diagnoses of three (3) patients. The agency alleged that there was nothing in disclosure 8 to show that the appellant was authorized to release the information, that the information had been properly requested of him, or that he advised the recipients of the need to keep the information confidential.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In specification (vi), the agency alleged that the appellant sent copies of disclosure 9 to Senators Obama, Kahikina Akaka, and Larry Craig, and that the disclosure included "copies of the medical records for four (4) [Veterans Administration] patients," which "contained the last names and partial social security numbers of the patients, as well as the patients' medical history, evaluations, specific prescribed medications, specific conditions and diagnoses." The agency alleged that there was nothing in disclosure 9 to show that the appellant was authorized to release the information, that the information had been properly requested of him, or that he advised the recipients of the need to keep the information confidential.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official, James Jones, Director of the Jesse Brown VAMC, sustained the charge in its entirety and effected the appellant's removal. The appellant admitted that disclosures 8 and 9 contained confidential patient information. He argued, however, that the agency was not permitted to discipline him for those disclosures because they were protected under the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3614"></span><span class="Italic">Disclosure 8 Meets the Requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A)(ii).</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In disclosure 8, the appellant alleged, among other things, that there are systematic problems within the Jesse Brown VAMC that have resulted in untimely and inadequate patient care. The confidential patient information that the appellant included in his disclosures to Senator Obama and Congressman Gutierrez related to particular examples of alleged misdiagnoses and misdirection of patients within the hospital. Specifically, the appellant alleged that a physician failed to diagnose a patient's rectal abscess and sent him home with hemorrhoidal medication rather than refer him for proper surgical treatment. The appellant also alleged that two patients who should have been accepted in the emergency room were improperly directed to the urgent care area, resulting in unjustifiable delays in their treatment, and that one patient who should have been admitted to the intensive care unit was improperly placed on the general medical floor, resulting in the eventual deterioration of his condition to the point where he required intubation. The appellant testified that he made disclosure 8 out of concern for patient health and safety.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Besides Senator Obama and Congressman Gutierrez, the appellant also sent a copy of disclosure 8 to the agency's Office of Inspector General (IG). The IG opened a case and referred the matter to Mr. Jones for investigation. Dr. Jeffrey Ryan, Associate Chief of Staff for Jesse Brown VAMC, investigated the appellant's allegations. Dr. Ryan determined that the treatment and management of the patients were appropriate in all cases. Mr. Jones relied on Dr. Ryan's assessment and drafted a response to the IG's inquiry reflecting Dr. Ryan's findings. Based on Mr. Jones's response, the IG closed the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether a disclosure evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, it is relevant for the Board to consider factors such as (1) the likelihood of harm resulting from the danger, (2) the imminence of the potential harm, and (3) the nature of the potential harm. <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Department of the Interior,</span> 515 F.3d 1362, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Applying the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Chambers,</span> the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to show that he reasonably believed his disclosure evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety because the danger that the appellant identified was too "remote and speculative" to fall within the purview of the WPA. The administrative judge found that the appellant's concerns amounted to disagreements about patient care.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with the administrative judge's findings, and we find that the appellant established that he reasonably believed that disclosure 8 evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. The nature of the harm that could result from the patient care and management issues that the appellant described in his disclosure is severe. Patients could die as a result of delayed treatment, misdiagnosis, or placement in lower levels of care with less monitoring than is appropriate for their conditions. In addition, the likelihood of such harm is high. The existence of different areas in the hospital providing different levels of care and monitoring, and the existence of a triage unit designed to direct patients to the appropriate areas, are reflections of how likely the harm may be. The allegedly deficient functioning of these various areas was the general subject of the appellant's disclosure. <span class="Italic">Cf. Miller v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 312, &#x00B6; 19 (2009) (the procedures put in place by the Transportation Security Administration to prevent the placement of explosive devices on commercial airliners were a reflection on how likely and imminent such a threat may be). When a patient requires immediate treatment or careful monitoring, harm may result directly from delays in providing such treatment and monitoring; the occurrence of harm is not dependent upon a series of unlikely events. <span class="Italic">Cf. Mogyorossy v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 652, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17 (2004) (a security guard's disclosure that he was permitted only to load three of four possible shells into his shotgun evidenced merely a speculative danger that might occur at some point in the future). Furthermore, the potential for harm is imminent because it could occur within a matter of hours or minutes. Again, the existence of areas in the hospital, such as the emergency room, designed to give prompt treatment to patients who require it, indicate how quickly complications could develop. <span class="Italic">See generally Chambers,</span> 515 F.3d at 1369 (discussing factors to consider in determining whether an alleged danger to public health or safety is "substantial and specific"). Moreover, the fact that the perceived dangers might have been limited to patients at the Jesse Brown VAMC does not prevent the dangers from being substantial and specific dangers to public health or safety. <span class="Italic">See Wojcicki v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. 628, 634 (1996) (a danger may be substantial and specific even though the perceived danger was to a limited number of government personnel and not to the general public at large).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is substantial evidence in the record to show that the Jesse Brown VAMC appropriately managed and treated all of the patients that the appellant mentioned in disclosure 8, and that none of the patients actually suffered harm because of the care that they received. There is also evidence to show that some of the examples of allegedly deficient patient care and management in disclosure 8 amounted to reasonable disagreements between the appellant and other staff about the way the patients should have been handled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although this evidence might tend to show that disclosure 8 did not actually evidence a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, we still find that the appellant reasonably believed that disclosure 8 did evidence such a danger. <span class="Italic">See Drake v. Agency for International Development,</span> 543 F.3d 1377, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (to establish that a disclosure was protected, an appellant need not show that the matter disclosed actually fell within one of the categories of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8); he need only show that a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by him could have reasonably concluded that it did); <span class="Italic">Fisher,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 296, &#x00B6; 7 (same); <span class="Italic">see also Lachance v. White,</span> 174 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999). For example, the appellant wrote that he instructed other doctors that a particular patient was septic and needed to be placed in intensive care, but he later discovered that the patient was not placed in the intensive care unit until after his condition had deteriorated to the point where he had to be intubated. To a reasonable physician in the appellant's position, it could appear that the physician who decided not to admit the patient to the intensive care unit immediately exercised poor judgment and endangered the patient's life. The fact that a subsequent investigation revealed that the physician's actions were appropriate does not detract from the reasonableness of the appellant's belief at the time he made the disclosure that triggered the investigation.[3] Under the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Lachance,</span> 174 F.3d at 1380-81, the question is whether the appellant had "a reasonable belief"--not whether his reasonable belief was the only one possible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The investigation into this matter was actually triggered by one of the appellant's prior disclosures, and the investigation concluded shortly before the appellant made disclosure 8. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether the appellant knew that the matter had been resolved, or knew what facts the investigation uncovered, at the time he made disclosure 8. <span class="Italic">See supra,</span> &#x00B6; 13 n.2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge noted, there is also evidence in the record to show that the appellant's motivation in disclosing the alleged misdiagnosis of the patient's rectal abscess was not his concern for patient care but rather his desire to tarnish the reputation of his coworkers. Specifically, Dr. Ryan testified that the appellant threatened to make the disclosure in response to his counseling the appellant on workflow issues within the hospital.[4] Based on this evidence, the administrative judge found that the appellant's claim lacked credibility. Nevertheless, we find that the appellant's motivation for making the disclosure is immaterial to whether he reasonably believed that it evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. In <span class="Italic">Horton v. Department of the Navy,</span> 66 F.3d 279, 282 (Fed. Cir. 1995), the administrative judge found that the appellant's disclosure was not protected because his motivation for making the disclosure was to "shift blame, create discord, and evade imminent disciplinary action," rather than to redress any wrongdoing or inform the public. The court, however, agreed with the full Board in finding that the appellant's allegedly malicious motive for making the disclosure did not deprive the disclosure of its protected status.<span class="Italic"> Horton,</span> 66 F.3d at 282-83. The court further found that the appellant's motive was immaterial to the credibility of his claim that he believed that the disclosure evidenced agency wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 283; <span class="Italic">see also Williams v. Department of Defense,</span> 46 M.S.P.R. 549, 553 n.5 (1991) (recognizing that personal motivation for making a disclosure is irrelevant to whether the disclosure is protected). Likewise, we find here that the appellant's allegedly vindictive motive for disclosing the misdiagnosis is immaterial to whether the disclosure was protected. We therefore find the appellant reasonably believed that disclosure 8 evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, and that the disclosure meets the criteria of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A)(ii).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In disclosure 9, the appellant alleged, among other things, that there are systematic problems within the Jesse Brown VAMC that have resulted in untimely and inadequate patient care. The confidential patient information that the appellant included in his disclosures to Senators Obama, Akaka, and Craig related to particular examples of allegedly unwarranted delays in treatment and misdirection of patients within the hospital. Specifically, the appellant alleged that a patient who should have been seen immediately for bladder catheterization spent three hours being directed between different areas of the hospital, that three patients were improperly directed to areas of the hospital where they could not receive appropriate treatment, and that one patient suffering from abdominal pain and constipation got frustrated with waiting for help and went home. The appellant testified that he made disclosure 9 out of concern for patient health and safety.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Besides Senators Obama, Akaka, and Craig, the appellant also sent a copy <span id="Page_3615"></span>of disclosure 9 to the IG. The IG opened a case and referred the matter to the Jesse Brown VAMC for investigation. Dr. Ryan investigated the appellant's allegations and determined that the treatment and management of the patients were generally appropriate. He acknowledged that there was a delay in catheterizing one of the patients, but he found that there were no complications as a result. Mr. Jones relied on Dr. Ryan's assessment and drafted a response to the IG's inquiry reflecting Dr. Ryan's findings. Based on Mr. Jones's response, the IG closed the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant failed to show that he reasonably believed his disclosure evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety because the danger that the appellant identified was too "remote and speculative" to fall within the purview of the WPA under the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Chambers.</span> She found that the appellant's concerns amounted to professional disagreements with other physicians at the hospital.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with the administrative judge's findings, and we find that the appellant established that he reasonably believed that disclosure 9 evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. For the reasons that we explained under our analysis of disclosure 8, the nature of the harm that could result from the patient care and management issues that the appellant described in his disclosure is severe. <span class="Italic">See supra,</span> &#x00B6; 15. In addition, delay in treating a patient with fecal or urinary retention could result in the infection or death of that patient. Also, for the reasons explained above, the harm that may result from unwarranted delays in treatment for patients requiring immediate treatment is both likely and imminent. <span class="Italic">See supra,</span> &#x00B6; 15. Particularly regarding the patient who reported to the hospital with constipation and abdominal pain and left without getting treatment, our finding that harm in his case was both likely and imminent is supported by Dr. Ryan's decision to have the patient transported back to the hospital for treatment the next day. We further find that, even if some of the patients that the appellant identified in disclosure 9 were not themselves under the threat of severe, likely, and imminent harm, they served as pertinent examples of the appellant's broader point that the Jesse Brown VAMC was systematically failing to give its patients timely and appropriate care.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is substantial evidence in the record to show that none of the patients that the appellant named in disclosure 9 suffered actual harm due to the allegedly unwarranted delays and that all of the patients ultimately received appropriate care. However, the mere fact that actual harm did not occur in any of the examples that the appellant cited does not mean that actual harm is unlikely to occur in the future. Furthermore, we disagree with the administrative judge's finding that the concerns expressed in disclosure 9 amounted to disagreements between the appellant and other physicians about proper patient care. In particular, there is no evidence that anyone at the Jesse Brown VAMC believed that the delay in catheterizing the patient with urinary retention was appropriate under the circumstances. It is undisputed that after the appellant made his disclosure, the Jesse Brown VAMC issued a memorandum to its staff clarifying its catheterization procedures in order to prevent such delays from occurring in the future. We therefore find the appellant reasonably believed that disclosure 9 evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, and that the disclosure meets the criteria of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Disclosures Underlying Specifications (v) and (vi) Were Not Specifically Prohibited by Law.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPA excludes from coverage disclosures "specifically prohibited by law" or Executive order, even if the disclosures otherwise meet the criteria of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A). <span class="Italic">MacLean v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 4, &#x00B6; 22 (2009). The agency argues that the appellant's disclosures are prohibited by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), Pub. L. No. 104-191, 110 Stat. 1936, which, as discussed below, generally prohibits healthcare providers from disseminating confidential patient health information. The appellant admits that his disclosures contained such information, but he argues that his disclosures fall under a whistleblower exception to the general rule. The agency argues that the appellant's disclosures do not meet HIPAA's whistleblower exception. Because the administrative judge found that none of the appellant's disclosures met the criteria of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A)(i) or (ii), she did not reach the issue of whether his disclosures were prohibited by HIPAA. We must reach the issue here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress has prohibited persons from violating the regulations that it authorized the Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services to promulgate pursuant to Pub. L. No. 104-191 &#x00A7; 264 (codified at 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1320d-2 note), and it has authorized both civil and criminal penalties for such violations. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1320d-4(b), 1320d-5, 1320d-6; 45 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 164.102. The regulations pertaining to the use and disclosure of protected health information[5] by covered entities[6] are found in 45 C.F.R. part 164, subpart E. Among other things, the regulations provide that the disclosure of protected health information is authorized in cases of whistleblowing. 45 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 164.502(j)(1). Specifically, the regulations provide:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Disclosures by whistleblowers</span>. A covered entity is not considered to have violated the requirements of this subpart if a member of its workforce or a business associate discloses protected health information, provided that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;The workforce member or business associate believes in good faith that the covered entity has engaged in conduct that is unlawful or otherwise violates professional or clinical standards, or that the care, services, or conditions provided by the covered entity potentially endangers one or more patients, workers, or the public; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;The disclosure is to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(A)&#x2003;A health oversight agency or public health authority authorized by law to investigate or otherwise oversee the relevant conduct or conditions of the covered entity or to an appropriate health care accreditation organization for the purpose of reporting the allegation of failure to meet professional standards or misconduct by the covered entity; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(B)&#x2003;An attorney retained by or on behalf of the workforce member or business associate for the purpose of determining the legal options of the workforce member or business associate with regard to the conduct described in paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the disclosures are authorized under the whistleblower provision only if two conditions are met: (1) The appellant had a good faith belief that one of the conditions in section 164.502(j)(1)(i) was satisfied; and (2) the disclosures were made to the proper parties named in section 164.502(j)(1)(ii) for the purposes identified in that section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;As relevant here, "protected health information" generally includes information that is created or received by a health care provider, relates to the physical health or provision of health care to an individual, could be used to identify the individual, and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium. 45 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 160.103.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;As a Veterans Administration hospital, the Jesse Brown VAMC is a "covered entity" under HIPAA. Tr. at 352-53, 361-62 (testimony of expert witness attorney June Sullivan), 510-11, 520 (testimony of expert witness Veterans Health Administration Privacy Officer Stephania Griffin); <span class="Italic">see</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1320d-1(a)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained above, the appellant reasonably believed that disclosures 8 and 9 evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. <span class="Italic">Supra,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-23. The appellant's disclosures can fairly be characterized as pertaining to alleged "violat[ions] of professional or clinical standards," and alleged deficiencies in "the care, services, or conditions" provided by the Jesse Brown VAMC that could "potentially endanger[] one or more patients." [<span class="Italic">S</span>] <span class="Italic">ee</span> 45 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 164.502(j)(1)(i). The agency argues on review that the appellant failed to prove that his belief on these matters was in "good faith" as required by 45 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 164.502(j)(1)(i) because that standard is more exacting than the "reasonable belief' standard of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). We disagree. "Good faith belief" and "reasonable belief" do not pertain to different degrees of belief but rather to different qualities of belief from subjective and objective standpoints respectively. <span class="Italic">See Little v. United Technologies, Carrier Transicold Division,</span> 103 F.3d 956, 960 (11th Cir. 1997) (a "good faith" belief is honest and <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> under a subjective standard, whereas a "reasonable belief' is reasonable under an objective standard). Under the facts of this case, we find that the appellant actually believed that the dangers that he was disclosing were real. We therefore find that the appellant's disclosures pertained to matters covered under 45 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 164.502(j)(1)(i), and that his beliefs met the "good faith" standard of that section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the appellant's disclosures were made to the proper parties named in 45 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 164.502(j)(1)(ii) for the purposes identified in that section. In specifications (v) and (vi) of the notice of proposed removal, the agency alleged that the appellant provided copies of disclosures 8 and 9 to Congressman Gutierrez and Senators Obama, Akaka, and Craig. The parties do not dispute that these individuals were members of the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the United States House of Representatives and United States Senate respectively at the time the appellant made these disclosures. Under Rule of the House of Representatives X(1)(s)(8) for the One Hundred Tenth Congress, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs has jurisdiction over "bills, resolutions, and other matters" relating to "[v]eterans' hospitals, medical care, and treatment of veterans." Similarly, under Standing Rule of the United States Senate XXV(1)(p)(1), matters concerning "[v]eterans' hospitals, medical care and treatment of veterans" are referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, which is authorized to report on these matters "by bill or otherwise." Based on these descriptions of the committees' authority, we find that they are "public health authorit[ies]" as that term is defined in 45 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 164.501. Specifically, each committee is an "authority of the United States" "that is responsible for public health matters as part of its <span id="Page_3616"></span>official mandate." <span class="Italic">See</span> 45 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 164.501. We further find that, in providing disclosures 8 and 9 to members of the committees, the appellant was providing the disclosures to public health authorities.[7] <span class="Italic">See</span> 45 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 164.501 (agents of a public health authority are included under the definition of "public health authority"). We also find that the appellant's disclosures were for a permissible purpose under section 164.502(j)(1)(ii)(A), i.e., to report an "allegation of failure to meet professional standards" by the Jesse Brown VAMC. Because the disclosures to the individuals named in specifications (v) and (vi) of the notice of proposed removal met both criteria of section 164.502(j)(1), we find that they are not specifically prohibited by HIPAA. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;There is some evidence to show that Senator Obama's office construed the appellant's disclosures as directed to the Senator in his capacity as a representative of his constituents rather than in his capacity as a member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. Tr. at 620-24 (testimony of Ms. Griffin). However, the impressions of Senator Obama's staff do not change that fact that the Senator was a proper party to receive the disclosure under 45 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 164.502(j)(1)(ii)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also argues that the appellant's disclosures were prohibited by the Privacy Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-579, 88 Stat. 1896. Among the purposes of the Privacy Act is to provide safeguards to individual privacy by ensuring that federal agencies do not misuse records of identifiable personal information but disseminate such records only for necessary and lawful purposes. Pub. L. No. 93-579 &#x00A7; 2(b)(4). The Act generally prohibits an agency from disclosing such records, including medical records, without the written authorization of the individuals to whom the records pertain, but the Act provides twelve exceptions to this general rule. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(a)(4), (b). One of the exceptions to the rule allows an agency to disclose records without prior written authorization of the individuals to whom the records pertain to a congressional committee with jurisdiction over the matters disclosed. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b)(9). We find that the appellant's disclosures to the various individuals in their capacities as members of the congressional committees on veterans' affairs fall within this exception and are therefore not specifically prohibited by the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency correctly argues that it removed the appellant not only for disclosing protected health information in violation of HIPAA but also for disclosing such information in violation of agency policy, i.e., VA Handbook 1605.1. The Board has found that an agency regulation can be a "law" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A) but only if the regulation meets certain criteria set forth in <span class="Italic">Chrysler Corp. v. Brown,</span> 441 U.S. 281 (1979).<span class="Italic"> MacLean,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 4, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-33. Specifically, the regulation must be both properly promulgated and "substantive." To be substantive, the regulation must meet three requirements. "These are (1) it must be a 'substantive rule'; (2) Congress must have granted the agency authority to create such a regulation; and (3) the regulations must be promulgated in conformity with any procedural requirements imposed by Congress." <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 25 (citing<span class="Italic"> Chrysler,</span> 441 U.S. at 301-03).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without deciding whether an agency handbook could ever be a "law" within the meaning of the WPA, we find that VA Handbook 1605.1 is not. Specifically, the Handbook is not a substantive rule within the meaning of <span class="Italic">Chrysler</span> because it pertains to agency "procedures involving the release of information," to ensure "compliance with the Privacy Act" and "the provisions of the Standards of Privacy of Individually-Identifiable Health Information, Title 45 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 160 and 164," among other laws. <span class="Italic">Cf. Chrysler,</span> 441 U.S. at 301-02 (distinguishing "substantive rules" from "interpretive rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice" (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 553(b), (d)). In other words, the Handbook sets forth procedures for agency employees to follow in order to comply with substantive statutes and regulations. <span class="Italic">Cf. St. Francis Health Care Centre v. Shalala,</span> 205 F.3d 937, 947 (6th Cir. 2000) (the agency manual was not a substantive rule because it interpreted a statute and regulation and set forth procedures for the agency to follow in carrying out a general substantive mandate). We find that the Handbook is unlike the regulation discussed in <span class="Italic">MacLean,</span> which the Board found to be substantive because it affected individual rights and obligations, was expressly authorized by Congress, and was published in the Code of Federal Regulations after notice and comment rulemaking. 112 M.S.P.R. 4, &#x00B6; 26. Rather, it is more like the handbook discussed in <span class="Italic">Reynolds Associates v. United States,</span> 31 Fed. Cl. 335, 340 (1994), which the court found did not have the "status as a rule of law" because it merely set forth "rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice." Therefore, even if the appellant's disclosures were prohibited by VA Handbook 1605.1, which does not appear to contemplate whistleblower disclosures, we still find that the disclosures were not "specifically prohibited by law" within the meaning of section 2302(b)(8)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant reasonably believed that the disclosures underlying specifications (v) and (vi) of the notice of proposed removal evidenced substantial and specific dangers to public health or safety, and the disclosures were not specifically prohibited by law, we find that they were protected under the WPA.[8] <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;There is no indication in the record that the disclosures were "specifically required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs." <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Disclosures Underlying Specifications (i) Through (iv) Were Specifically Prohibited by Law.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In specifications (i) though (iv) of the notice of proposed removal, the agency alleged that the appellant disclosed the same confidential patient information identified in specifications (v) and (vi) to other individuals. Specifically, the agency alleged that the appellant disclosed the information to Dr. Fred Zar, Program Director at the University of Illinois at Chicago Internal Medicine Residency Program, Marsha Miller, Complaint Officer at the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, and the appellant's attorney, Denise Mercherson. There do not appear to be any exceptions to the Privacy Act that would permit disclosure of patient medical information to these individuals.[10]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;Arguably, the appellant's disclosures to his attorney might be covered under the agency's Routine Use 53 for patient medical records. <span class="Italic">See</span> 74 Fed. Reg. 60,040 at 60,046 (Nov. 19, 2009) (the agency may disclose records to an authorized representative of one of its employees in reasonable anticipation of litigation against that employee regarding medical care provided during the period of his employment); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(a)(7), (b)(3), (e)(4)(D) (an agency may disclose covered records for a "routine use" that the agency defines by publication in the Federal Register). However, Routine Use 53 became available only after the appellant made the disclosures at issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> 74 Fed. Reg. 60,040. It was not available under the routine uses recognized by the agency at the time the appellant made the disclosures. <span class="Italic">See</span> 69 Fed. Reg. 18,428 at 18,431-18,434 (Apr. 7, 2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the Privacy Act covers only information contained in a "system of records," i.e., "a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(a)(5), (b). Courts have interpreted the statute to exclude coverage of information that an employee has not actually retrieved from a system of records but has by firsthand knowledge. <span class="Italic">E.g., Olberding v. United States Department of Defense, Department of the Army,</span> 709 F.2d 621, 622 (8th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">but see Bartel v. Federal Aviation Administration,</span> 725 F.2d 1403, 1410-11 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (the Privacy Act may cover information that was not actually retrieved from agency records if the employee who disclosed the information had a primary role in creating and using it). Although the appellant appears to have had firsthand knowledge of many of the incidents described in his disclosures, disclosures 8 and 9 recounted not only his memories of the incidents but also included medical records that the appellant obviously retrieved from the patients' medical files. Moreover, it would appear that the appellant obtained information from these records in writing the disclosure letters themselves. Because the evidence shows that the appellant disclosed information covered under the Privacy Act without the prior written consent of the individuals to whom the information pertained, and there was no statutory exception permitting the disclosures to the individuals identified in specifications (i)-(iv), we find that the disclosures underlying those specifications were specifically prohibited by law. Accordingly, those disclosures were not protected under the WPA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A); <span class="Italic">Kent v. General Services Administration,</span> 56 M.S.P.R. 536, 547-48 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the agency violated his due process rights by informing him for the first time at the hearing that it considered his disclosures to constitute a Privacy Act violation.[11] We decline to consider the appellant's argument because the instant appeal is an IRA appeal filed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221 not an adverse action appeal filed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701.[12] As an issue separate and distinct from the whistleblower allegations, the appellant's due process argument is not within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Marren v. Department of Justice,</span> 51 M.S.P.R. 632, 638 (1991) ("Congress did not give the Board general jurisdiction to decide the merits of the underlying personnel action from which an IRA complaint stems except to the extent that they are relevant or material to the appellant's allegation of retaliation for whistleblowing."), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 980 F.2d 745 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;The agency mentioned the Privacy Act in the notice of proposed removal, and it clearly argued that the appellant violated the Act in one of its submissions prior to the issuance of the first initial decision in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;Because the agency appointed the appellant pursuant to 38 <span id="Page_3617"></span>U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7401(1), the appellant lacks the right to appeal his removal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Appellant's Protected Disclosures Were a Contributing Factor to His Removal.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is apparent from the face of both the notice of proposed removal and the removal decision that the appellant's protected disclosures were a contributing factor to his removal. Moreover, both the proposing official, Dr. Kukreja, and the deciding official, Mr. Jones, testified that they took the action, in part, because of the appellant's protected disclosures, i.e., the disclosures identified in specifications (v) and (vi) of the notice of proposed removal. Because specifications (v) and (vi) are grounded in the protected disclosures themselves, we find that the disclosures were a contributing factor to the appellant's removal. <span class="Italic">See Chambers v. Department of the Interior,</span> 602 F.3d 1370, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Agency Has Not Shown by Clear and Convincing Evidence That It Would Have Removed the Appellant Notwithstanding the Protected Disclosures.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if an appellant establishes that he made protected disclosures that were a contributing factor to the agency's personnel action, the Board will not order corrective action if the agency can show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the action even in the absence of the protected disclosures. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2);<span class="Italic"> Jensen v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 379, &#x00B6; 6 (2007). Clear and convincing evidence "is that measure or degree of proof that produces in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief as to the allegations sought to be established." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.4(d) (noting that it is a higher standard than preponderant evidence). In determining whether an agency has met its burden, the Board will consider all of the relevant factors, including the following: (1) The strength of the agency's evidence in support of its action; (2) the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and (3) any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">Carr v. Social Security Administration,</span> 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">Azbill v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 363, &#x00B6; 17 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both the proposing official, Dr. Kukreja, and the deciding official, Mr. Jones, testified in general terms that protecting patient confidentiality is highly important to the agency. The record also shows that the appellant himself was aware of the importance of protecting confidential patient information, and the fact that he could be disciplined for not doing so, even if he did not understand all of the intricate laws, rules, and regulations governing its disclosure. In addition, Mr. Jones testified in detail about the other aggravating factors that he considered in arriving at his removal decision, including the repetitive nature of the appellant's disclosures, the nature of the appellant's position, the appellant's disciplinary history, the agency's loss of confidence in the appellant to protect confidential patient information, and the appellant's lack of potential for rehabilitation. This evidence tends to show that the agency would still have removed the appellant even if it were only for the unprotected disclosures underlying specifications (i) through (iv).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Jones and Ms. Griffin both testified that the agency had previously taken disciplinary action against several employees, including the removal of at least one employee, as the result of an inadvertent compromise of confidential veteran information. We find that this constitutes evidence that the agency takes disciplinary actions against non-whistleblowers for failing to protect confidential information with which the agency is entrusted. Nevertheless, the evidence is not especially probative as to what the agency would have done in the appellant's situation absent the protected whistleblowing. Specifically, the data compromise underlying the discipline of the comparison employees was highly publicized and involved information pertaining to "millions of veterans," whereas the disclosures underlying specifications (i) through (iv) in this case were not highly publicized and involved information pertaining to far fewer individuals. Moreover, the other employees were not employed at the Jesse Brown VAMC, and the record does not reflect exactly what disciplinary action was taken against how many employees, what positions those employees encumbered, what mitigating or aggravating factors were present in their cases, or what the specific facts of their cases were.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is also some evidence in the record to show that the agency officials involved in the removal action could have had a retaliatory motive in taking the action. The agency officials involved were Dr. Kukreja, the proposing official, Mr. Jones, the deciding official, and Dr. Ryan, who gave some input to Dr. Kukreja in drafting the notice of proposed removal. The appellant's protected disclosures criticized these officials and various hospital operations under their command. In addition, it may have been somewhat burdensome to these officials to have to expend time and effort investigating the appellant's disclosures and justifying the Jesse Brown VAMC's operations. However, considering the strength of the agency's evidence discussed above, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> &#x00B6; 37, it appears, on balance, that the agency officials' primary motive for removing the appellant was their concern over his perceived breaches of confidentiality rather than any animus or ill will.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, the central question in this case is whether the agency would have removed the appellant based only on the unprotected disclosures identified in specifications (i) through (iv) of the notice of proposed removal, in the absence of the protected disclosures identified in specifications (v) and (vi). Although some of the evidence discussed above suggests that the agency would have done so, the evidence as a whole is insufficient to leave the Board with a firm belief on the matter. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.4(d). In particular, the agency's table of penalties prescribes a range of discipline anywhere from reprimand to removal for a first offense of improperly disclosing confidential patient information.[13] In addition, Mr. Jones testified that the appellant's job performance was not a factor weighing in favor of his removal and that it is preferable to not remove employees when alternative corrective measures will suffice because employees are costly to replace. Most importantly, there is no evidence pertaining to the relative importance of the disclosures underlying the various specifications as to the agency's penalty determination, and there is no direct evidence to show that the agency would have removed the appellant if only specifications (i) through (iv) were sustained. Based on the record before the Board, we find that the agency has not shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have removed the appellant even in the absence of his protected disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13]&#x2003;Although the agency previously issued a decision suspending the appellant for improper disclosure of confidential patient information, the agency subsequently rescinded its decision without effecting the suspension. The appellant's prior discipline of record was for a matter other than disclosing confidential information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Corrective Action Is Warranted</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant has established by preponderant evidence that his protected disclosures were a contributing factor in his removal, and the agency has not established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have removed the appellant in the absence of the protected disclosures, the Board is required to order appropriate corrective action. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e); <span class="Italic">see Schnell v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant asserts that he reasonably believed that his disclosures about the weapons qualifications test and Maney's threat of physical violence evidenced: a violation of law, rule, or regulation; an abuse of authority; and a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. Because the appellant is allegedly required to qualify with and maintain proficiency in the use of a firearm, a reasonable person with his knowledge could conclude that his allegations regarding falsification of weapons qualifications scores for agency Police Officers evidenced a violation of law, an abuse of authority, and a specific danger to public health or safety. <span class="Italic">[S]</span><span class="Italic">ee Johns v.

The January 12, 2002 newspaper article reported that the appellant stated that the existing depot security staff was "sorely lacking" in training and professionalism, that "[t]hey are a bunch of Bubbas and kissing cousins out there," and that "[s]ome of them need to push back from the table more often." The appellant complained that he was left to fend for himself and that for several weeks guns were passed to him through a fence because he did not yet have the required security clearance to retrieve the guns himself. He also claimed that the SRT training at the DOE was too oriented to "'shoot, shoot, shoot'--just to save money."</p>

The debate was how those resources might best be used as to a component of the agency mission involved in controlling potential terrorist activities. The matter was studied and decided at higher levels of the agency, and the appellant was tasked with implementing the agency's directives. Her disagreement as to the wisdom or effectiveness of the choices that she was to implement was given voice in the newspaper article, and that article led, in part, to her discipline. The statements were unprotected, essentially because they were not reasonable disclosures of threats to public safety given the study that had preceded the agency determination of the course of action that would be followed, 103 MSPR 375, 386-88 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-25:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant admits that with just one exception (relating to the precise number of guards at monuments), she made the statements attributed to her in the Post article. Thus, the appellant publicly disagreed with the choice, made by officials who outrank her after extensive study by experts, to cut back on Park Police patrols along the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, and to reduce Park Police enforcement of traffic and drug laws, in favor of increasing security at monuments and memorials on the mall. Further, the appellant, the highest-level management official at the Park Police, publicly supported the police union's complaints about the change in mission emphasis mandated by Congress and officials in the Department of the Interior who outranked her. The appellant also publicly advocated more than doubling the size of the Park Police force--whose budget had <span class="Italic">already</span> doubled in the 4 years preceding the appellant's interview with the reporter--so that parkway patrols and enforcement of drug laws outside the national capital core could continue. She did this knowing that legislative appropriators and executive branch policymakers did not share her view, that they preferred to see the Park Police shed law enforcement activities traditionally performed by state and local police, and that they believed that the massive increase in the Park Police budget over the preceding 4 years had been squandered by poor management.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutory protection for whistleblowers "is not a weapon in arguments over policy or a shield for insubordinate conduct. Policymakers and administrators have every right to expect loyal, professional service from subordinates...."<span class="Italic"> Lachance v. White</span>, 174 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999). A policy disagreement can serve as the basis for a protected disclosure only if the legitimacy of a particular policy choice "is not debatable among reasonable people." <span class="Italic">White v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 391 F.3d 1377, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While in <span class="Italic">White</span> the appellant claimed that he revealed "gross mismanagement," the <span class="Italic">White</span> analysis is equally applicable here, where the appellant claims to have disclosed a substantial and specific danger to public safety.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge was right to conclude that this case presents a classic policy disagreement over which reasonable minds might differ, and that as a result, the appellant's interview with the reporter was not protected whistleblowing. The level and allocation of resources generally may impact traffic and crime. Nevertheless, law enforcement is not, and cannot be, omnipresent. Public resources are limited, necessitating choices by policymakers over how to allocate those resources. Every day government officials make judgments that directly or indirectly affect the level of risk to which private citizens, in various contexts, are exposed. An assertion that a particular judgment raises the risk level in one area is not automatically a protected disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rather, under <span class="Italic">White</span>, a statement that a particular policy choice raises risks to the citizenry is protected only if the desirability of the trade-off that the policy choice represents is "not debatable among reasonable people." 391 F.3d at 1382. In the present case, the appellant's statements to the Post reporter do not rise to this level. After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, no one can reasonably claim that beefing up security measures at monuments and memorials along the national mall is an illegitimate use of public resources. While some may disagree with that policy choice, a reasonable person could not conclude that policymakers have no right to make the choice in the first place. Since federal resources are not unlimited, then an individual's disagreement with the trade-off made by policymakers--to deemphasize Park Police traffic patrols and traditional law enforcement at the periphery of the national capital, in favor of protecting people at the core from terrorism--is nothing more than that, disagreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Revelation of what a reasonable person would consider an illegitimate choice by policymakers may be protected whistleblowing, but here, a reasonable person could not conclude that the policy choices with which the appellant disagreed were illegitimate. The decisions that displeased the appellant were the result of the lawful, ordinary give and take among executive and legislative officials. This exchange of views is common to the public policy making process. Trying to build support for a particular position in a policy debate, as the appellant did here, is distinct from revealing waste, fraud, abuse, or similar wrongdoing by government officials; Congress only intended to cover the latter situation when it enacted 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case thus stands in contrast to<span class="Italic"> Braga v. Department of the Army</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 392, 398 (1992), where a clothing designer disclosed a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety when he reported that the real-world threat levels from anti-personnel mines greatly exceeded the threat levels he had been asked to design body armor systems to meet, and that soldiers relying on that armor for protection would therefore be in grave danger of being killed or maimed. In <span class="Italic">Braga</span>, there was no evidence, as there is here, that the individual who made the disclosure was expressing disagreement with considered judgments reached by policymakers after extensive study and discussion. In the present case, the appellant has not shown that she disclosed a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), in her interview with the Post reporter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Member Sapin argues that there is no meaningful distinction between this case and <span class="Italic">Braga,</span> but in fact <span class="Italic">Braga</span> is fundamentally different from this case. All indications are that Mr. Braga reasonably believed that the actual risk of injury from anti-personnel mines would be unacceptably high to the officials who were ultimately responsible for sending troops into battle, were he to design the body armor according to the specifications he was given. Here, by contrast, the appellant expressed her disagreement with what she knew was a considered decision by executive and legislative branch officials to focus Park Police resources on the national capital core area rather than its periphery. The personal opinions that the appellant shared with the newspaper reporter and congressional staffer regarding the funding level and priorities consciously set by policymakers for her agency are quite different from Mr. Braga's revelation of substantial and specific dangers to troops he reasonably believed were unacceptably high.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with Chambers and the <span class="Italic">amicus</span> that the Board applied an incorrect standard when evaluating her WPA claim relating to disclosure of a risk to public safety. In our view, the Board improperly blended the concepts of gross mismanagement and risk to public safety.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board considered Chambers's disclosures under the standard from <span class="Italic">White</span>, 391 F.3d at 1382. <span class="Italic">Board Decision</span>, slip op. at 12-14. Where the Board considered whether Chambers's disclosures evidenced gross mismanagement, <span class="Italic">White</span> does provide the applicable standard. As discussed in <span class="Italic">White</span>, a lawful but problematic policy constitutes gross mismanagement when reasonable people could not debate the error in the policy. 391 F.3d at 1382. But <span class="Italic">White</span> concerned only gross mismanagement, not a danger to public health or safety. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1381.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board failed to distinguish disclosures of a danger to public health or safety from allegations of gross mismanagement. In particular, it applied the <span class="Italic">White</span> standard to "a statement that a particular policy choice raises risks to the citizenry." <span class="Italic">Board Decision</span>, slip op. at 13. While Chambers certainly expressed a disagreement with a policy decision, she also potentially disclosed a danger to public safety that may have resulted from that decision. The Board classified "[t]he personal opinions that [Chambers] shared with the newspaper reporter and congressional staffer regarding the funding level and priorities consciously set by policymakers for her agency," as different from disclosures of a danger to public safety, <span class="Italic">id</span>., slip op. at 15; but Chambers's opinions about the consequences of the policy decisions could have disclosed a danger to public safety. The Board should have considered those aspects of Chambers's disclosures directed to public safety and determined if she disclosed information she reasonably believed evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public safety.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The nature of Chambers's disclosure reveals the difficulty encountered by the Board. Law enforcement activities generally serve to increase public safety. The budget provided for law enforcement, however, limits the extent of protection. Allocating the budget to different aspects of law enforcement necessarily balances the risks and benefits affected; this balancing represents a quintessential management decision. Any such policy decision related to the allocation or distribution of law enforcement funding, therefore, could potentially be said to create a risk to public safety. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>., slip op. at 1, (Sapin, dissenting). Perhaps the Board's implicit recognition of this overlap led it to consider Chambers's disclosures exclusively as a dispute over policy rather than revealing a danger to public safety. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., slip op. at 12-14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPA, however, addresses disclosure of dangers to public health or safety separately from gross mismanagement. That under certain circumstances those concepts might overlap in the context of law enforcement does not change the fact that the statute creates two distinct standards. In other words, Congress did not intend, in our view, to categorically classify any danger arising from law enforcement solely as a policy issue, to which the standard for gross mismanagement would apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Certain parameters help define disclosure of a danger to public health or safety. The often-quoted legislative history, a Senate Report from the Committee on Governmental Affairs, provides examples of which disclosures fall within the statute:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[G]eneral criticism by an employee of the Environmental Protection Agency that the Agency is not doing enough to protect the environment would not be protected under this subsection. However, an allegation by a Nuclear Regulatory Commission engineer that the cooling system of a nuclear reactor is inadequate would fall within the whistle blower protections.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 21 (1978). The Board has interpreted that statement, stating that "revelation of a negligible, remote, or ill-defined peril that does not involve any particular person, place, or thing, is not protected." <span class="Italic">Sazinski v. Dep't of Housing &#x0026; Urban Dev.</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 682, 686 (1997). Our court has held that the disclosure of a danger only potentially arising in the future is not a protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">Herman v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 193 F.3d 1375, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Rather, the danger must be substantial and specific. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A variety of factors guide the application of the statutory language, helping determine when a disclosed danger is sufficiently substantial and specific to warrant protection under the WPA. One such factor is the likelihood of harm resulting from the danger. If the disclosed danger could only result in harm under speculative or improbable conditions, the disclosure should not enjoy protection. Another important factor is when the alleged harm may occur. A harm likely to occur in the immediate or near future should identify a protected disclosure much more than a harm likely to manifest only in the distant future. Both of these factors affect the specificity of the alleged danger, while the nature of the harm--the potential consequences--affects the substantiality of the danger.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, while the Board concluded that Chambers did not disclose a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, it did so after analyzing her claims under an incorrect standard--the test applicable to disclosures of gross mismanagement. Board Decision, slip op. at 13-14. Because the Board is best suited to analyze Chambers's disclosures in the first instance under the correct standard, we vacate and remand. <span class="Italic">See Hydril Co. LP v. Grant Prideco LP</span>, 474 F.3d 1344, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">Medrad, Inc. v. Tyco Healthcare Group LP</span>, 466 F.3d 1047, 1053 (Fed. Cir. 2006).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">By remanding this case to us, the court has reinstated the appellant's arguments, on petition for review, regarding the nature and effect of her public-safety-related statements. All other issues in these appeals have been resolved. Pursuant to the Federal Circuit's instructions, we have reconsidered our previous analysis of the appellant's arguments, including our findings on whether the appellant made disclosures protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). In doing so, we have applied the principles outlined in the court's decision in this case, as well as other relevant Federal Circuit and Board precedent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The two Board members do not agree on the issue of whether the appellant's allegedly protected disclosures are in fact protected under section 2302(b)(8). For reasons described in their separate concurring opinions, however, they have agreed on the disposition of these appeals. While Chairman McPhie would find that the appellant made some protected disclosures, he also would find that the agency presented clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same actions against the appellant in the absence of those disclosures. Vice Chairman Rose would find that the appellant made no protected disclosures, and she therefore would not reach the issue of whether the agency would have taken its actions in the absence of the appellant's allegedly protected statements. The Board members agree that, in light of their conclusions, the appellant's removal must be sustained, and her request for corrective action denied.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On further review, following revisitation of the appeal by the Board, the Federal Circuit found protected one of the disclosures that the Board found unprotected, leading to remand for further consideration of the penalty, since the protected disclosure was one basis of discipline against Ms. Chambers. The Federal Circuit explained in <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 602 F.3d 1370, 1375-82 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the two-member Board "affirm[ed] ...as modified" the initial decision sustaining Chambers' removal and denying her request for corrective action. <span class="Italic">Chambers III,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. at 321. The Board first denied Chambers' motion to reopen its previous decision and to reconsider the merits of the sustained charges apart from the WPA issue. The Board also rejected her WPA claims. Although the two Board members agreed on the disposition of the case, they did not agree on the reasoning. Chairman McPhie, in a separate concurring opinion, indicated that he would find certain of Chambers' statements both to the <span class="Italic">Washington Post</span> reporter and to the House staffer to be protected as evidencing a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. In particular, he found that the first two statements Chambers made to the <span class="Italic">Washington Post</span> that were cited by the agency in charge 2 were protected under the WPA. He also found additional statements made to the <span class="Italic">Washington Post</span> reporter, not cited specifically by the agency in charge 2, to be protected. Nonetheless, he indicated that he would find that the agency's penalty remained reasonable and that the agency presented clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same actions against Chambers in the absence of the disclosures he found protected, based on charges 3, 5, 6, and the sustained part of charge 2. Vice Chairman Rose, in a separate concurring opinion, noted that she would find none of Chambers' statements to be protected. She therefore did not reach the issues of whether the agency would have taken the same actions in the absence of the allegedly protected statements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Chambers timely appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Discussion</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3620"></span>As we explained in our opinion in <span class="Italic">Chambers II,</span> the inquiry into whether a disclosed danger is sufficiently "substantial and specific" to warrant protection under the WPA is guided by several factors, among these: (1) "the likelihood of harm resulting from the danger"; (2) "when the alleged harm may occur"; and (3) "the nature of the harm," i.e., "the potential consequences." <span class="Italic">Chambers II,</span> 515 F.3d at 1369. Disclosures of dangers to public health or safety must be considered separately from claims of gross mismanagement, and the fact that a particular health or safety statement involves a policy decision or disagreement does not deprive it of protection under the WPA. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1368-69. Consistent with these factors, the outcomes of past cases addressing whether particular disclosures were protected as revealing a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety have depended upon whether a substantial, specific harm was identified, and whether the allegations or evidence supported a finding that the harm had already been realized or was likely to result in the reasonably foreseeable future. Cases in which the employee's burden was found to be satisfied have concerned specific allegations or evidence either of actual past harm or of detailed circumstances giving rise to a likelihood of impending harm.[4]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">To prevail on the merits of a WPA claim, an employee must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she made a protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See Johnston v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 518 F.3d 905, 909 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Chambers argues that certain statements she made to the <span class="Italic">Washington Post</span> as well as statements she made to the House staffer were protected under section 2303(b)(8) because they constituted disclosures of information she reasonably believed evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public safety.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Charges 5 and 6, which concern instances in which Chambers was found to have failed to follow a supervisor's instructions and failed to properly follow the chain of command, are not alleged by Chambers to involve any WPA-protected disclosures. Because we affirmed the Board's decision on the merits with respect to all charges apart from the WPA issues, charges 5 and 6 are governed by our opinion in <span class="Italic">Chambers II,</span> which sustained the charges. <span class="Italic">See</span> 515 F.3d at 1369-70.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore need only consider charges 2 and 3. At the outset, we note that charges 2 and 3 were not based on Chambers' statements to the House staffer but were based entirely on Chambers' statements to the<span class="Italic"> Washington Post.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Chambers argues on appeal that charge 3 is in part grounded in disclosures protected under the WPA as disclosing a substantial and specific danger to public safety. Charge 3 accuses Chambers of "[i]mproper disclosure of budget deliberations." The <span class="Italic">Washington Post</span> article in question attributed the following statement to Chambers: "She said she has to cover a $12 million shortfall for this year and has asked for $8 million more for next year." The agency charged Chambers with improperly disclosing that she had "asked for $8 million more for next year." The agency stated that at the time, the 2005 budget had not yet been transmitted to Congress, and by informing the reporter of this request, Chambers disclosed 2005 federal budget deliberations to the media before transmittal of the budget to Congress, in violation of agency protocol.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Chambers previously disputed the accuracy of the statement which is the subject of charge 3. However, the AJ rejected her claim in that regard and all of the AJ's factual findings have been affirmed by the Board and by this court. <span class="Italic">See Chambers II,</span> 515 F.3d at 1370.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand from this court, both members of the Board apparently did not consider this statement as being related to public safety and therefore did not address it. Chambers argues on appeal that Chambers' statement about the budget, which is the foundation for charge 3, is indeed protected because "[w]hile the statement regarding Park Police funding needs does not disclose a substantial and specific danger to public safety in isolation, it is part of Chambers' overall disclosure that lack of funds was causing staffing shortages which in turn were causing dangers to public safety." We agree with the Board that Chambers' disclosure of these specific budget numbers is not an aspect of her disclosures directed to public safety. Indeed, Chambers admits that this statement does not "disclose a substantial and specific danger to public safety in isolation." Though it is true that the budget provided for law enforcement necessarily limits the extent of protection of public health and safety, Chambers alleged no substantial or specific danger to public health and safety in connection with her disclosure of budget numbers. Accordingly, the Board was correct in considering this statement to be unprotected. We therefore hold that the Board properly sustained charge 3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we reach a different result as to charge 2: "Making public remarks regarding security on the Federal mall, and in parks and on the Parkways in the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan area." Charge 2 is supported by a single specification. For convenience, we have numbered the individual statements. The specification details that Chambers made certain statements to the <span class="Italic">Washington Post</span> reporter and specifies that the resulting newspaper article among other things, state[d] the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Chambers said traffic accidents have increased on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, which now often has two officers on patrol instead of the recommended four.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;"It's fair to say where it's green, it belongs to us in Washington D.C.," Chambers said of her department. "Well, there's not enough of us to go around to protect those green spaces anymore."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;The Park Police's new force of 20 unarmed security guards will begin serving around the monuments in the next few weeks, Chambers said. She said she eventually hopes to have a combination of two guards and two officers at the monuments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency charged that these statements were improper because these "public remarks about whether and how many armed and unarmed U.S. Park Police officers are patrolling the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area[,] Federal malls, parks, and Parkways constitute [improper] public remarks about the scope of security present and contemplated for these areas under your jurisdiction." Chambers argues on appeal that all of her public safety-related disclosures to the <span class="Italic">Washington Post</span> reporter were protected under the WPA. Chairman McPhie analyzed all of the statements attributed to Chambers by the <span class="Italic">Washington Post</span> reporter in his article. With respect to the statements detailed in charge 2, he found the first two listed statements and other statements not listed to be protected and found the third listed statement to be unprotected. Vice Chairman Rose found all of Chambers' statements to be unprotected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not find it necessary for present purposes to examine all of Chambers' statements to the <span class="Italic">Washington Post</span> reporter as we agree with Chairman McPhie that Chambers' first statement that traffic accidents have increased on the Baltimore-Washington ("BW") Parkway, which often had two officers on patrol instead of the recommended four, was protected under the WPA as evidencing a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. First, an increase in traffic accidents is a significant and serious danger to public safety. Second, this statement details the specific consequence that has already resulted from the diversion of officers from the BW Parkway: more traffic accidents. Third, this statement contains the specific details as to the cause of the increased danger, namely the reduction from four officers to two. Here, the alleged danger--increased traffic accidents--was not vague or speculative. It was more than likely to occur, indeed it was certain, as it had already occurred. Such specificity is sufficient to establish a disclosure meriting protection under the WPA. Further, Chambers' beliefs both that traffic accidents present a substantial danger and that the diversion of Park Police from the BW Parkway was the cause of the increase in traffic accidents were reasonable.[7] Chambers' supervisor, Murphy, acknowledged that a change in "police staffing to patrol the highways" could affect traffic safety. <span class="Italic">Chambers III,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. at 330. Chambers had expertise in public safety, and she was familiar with the areas under her jurisdiction. Her expertise in these matters supports the reasonableness of her belief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The test for determining whether an employee had a reasonable belief that her disclosures evidenced misconduct under <span id="Page_3621"></span>the WPA is whether "a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee [could] reasonably conclude that the actions of the government evidence" wrongdoing as defined by the WPA. <span class="Italic">Lachance,</span> 174 F.3d at 1381.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the sole specification for charge 2 is grounded in a WPA-protected disclosure, the charge cannot stand. Vice Chairman Rose stated that she would sustain the whole of charge 2 as she found no WPA-protected disclosures. Chairman McPhie noted that he would sustain charge 2, reasoning that "the non-protected statements made by [Chambers] to the <span class="Italic">Washington Post</span> were alone sufficient to sustain Charge 2." <span class="Italic">Chambers III,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. at 337. However, the law is clear that such charge-splitting is impermissible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have explained that "[w]hen an agency proposes to discipline an employee, it must notify the employee of the conduct with which he is charged 'in sufficient detail to permit the employee to make an informed reply.'" <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 147 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (quoting<span class="Italic"> Pope v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 114 F.3d 1144, 1148 (Fed. Cir. 1997), and <span class="Italic">Brook v. Corrado,</span> 999 F.2d 523, 526 (Fed. Cir. 1993)). Agencies typically give this notice by designating a particular charge and accompanying the charge with a narrative description, the "specification," which sets forth the details of the charged misconduct. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> If the agency designates a specific charge as the basis for the proposed discipline, it must of course prove all the elements of that charge. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Where the agency only sets forth one specification, we have long held that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[i]t is not permissible for the [Board] to split a single charge of an agency into several independent charges and then sustain one of the newly-formulated charges, which represents only a portion of the original charge. If the agency fails to prove one of the elements of its charge, then the entire charge must fall.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Here charge 2 cannot stand.[8] Discipline may not be based on a disclosure protected by the WPA. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Greenspan v. Veterans Admin.,</span> 464 F.3d 1297, 1305 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Because the sole specification set forth to support charge 2 is grounded in at least one WPA-protected disclosure, charge 2 cannot stand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;The cases Chairman McPhie cites in support of his decision to sustain charge 2 do not hold that a charge may be parsed out and then sustained in part. For example, in <span class="Italic">Greenough v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 648, 656-57 (1997), the agency proved two specifications, but not the third, and the Board held that that was sufficient to sustain the charge. <span class="Italic">Greenough</span> does not authorize the Board to sustain a charge where the agency only sets forth one specification in support of the charge, and the charged conduct is grounded in WPA-protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">See also Hicks v. Dep't of the Treasury,</span> 62 M.S.P.R. 71, 74 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 48 F.3d 1235 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to prevail on a claim of reprisal for making disclosures protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2303(b)(8), an appellant must show by preponderant evidence that the disclosures were a contributing factor in the agency's personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1). The AJ considered this issue and found that the Chambers' statements that had been reported in the <span class="Italic">Washington Post</span> were a contributing factor in Chambers' placement on administrative leave and in her removal. The agency did not challenge this finding below, nor does it do so now. We therefore hold that the disclosure we find protected was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take adverse action against Chambers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">II</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The remaining issues are whether removal remains a reasonable penalty in light of the dismissal of charge 2 and whether the agency has proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel actions against Chambers in the absence of the protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2) (providing that "[c]orrective action...may not be ordered if the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of such disclosure"). We are unable to sustain the Board's decision as to either of these questions. Chairman McPhie's opinion relies on portions of charge 2 to sustain the reasonableness of the penalty. <span class="Italic">Chambers III,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. at 337 (indicating that "removal remains a reasonable penalty for the four sustained charges"). Our decision setting aside charge 2 means that the conduct covered by charge 2 cannot be relied on to sustain the reasonableness of the penalty even if some of that conduct could have formed the basis for a proper charge. Chairman McPhie also relied on portions of charge 2 in determining that the agency had established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action based on the sustained charges. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 339 (finding that the agency provided clear and convincing evidence "that it would have taken the same disciplinary actions against [Chambers] for her conduct underlying charges 3, 5 and 6, and the sustained portion of charge 2, even in the absence of her protected conduct").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the case of Vice Chairman Rose, she did not explicitly address the reasonableness of the penalty (presumably because she would have sustained charges 2, 3, 5, and 6). She did not decide whether the agency had established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action absent the protected disclosures because she found that none of the disclosures was protected. Thus, neither opinion provides a basis for sustaining the Board's action. Even if one of the opinions could be sustained, sustaining one of two board opinions, when each is necessary to the result, is not sufficient to sustain the action.[9] <span class="Italic">See Corus Group PLC v. Int'l Trade Comm'n,</span> 352 F.3d 1351, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("If any opinion necessary to the majority...fails to satisfy the statutory standard, the decision must be set aside.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;Of course, if we determine that a particular result is legally compelled, no remand to the Board would be necessary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances we think that the most appropriate course is to remand to the Board for further consideration. As to the reasonableness of the penalty, the Board must consider on remand whether the agency's penalty of removal was reasonable in light of the three remaining sustained charges--charges 3, 5, and 6. <span class="Italic">See Douglas v. Veterans Admin.,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305 (1981). Here, the deciding official's testimony is ambiguous as to whether he would or would not have taken the same action if charge 2 had not been sustained.[10] The resolution of such ambiguities is a matter for the Board in the first instance. If the Board determines that the deciding official would have removed Chambers based only on charges 3, 5, and 6, the Board itself must determine whether the penalty was reasonable. However, if there is "some indication that the agency would have regarded the sustained charges as insufficient to justify the penalty imposed," the Board must remand the case to the agency for redetermination of the appropriate penalty in the first instance. <span class="Italic">Guise v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 330 F.3d 1376, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">see Modrowski v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 252 F.3d 1344, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;The deciding official's testimony is as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">JUDGE BOGLE: ...Looking at the charges here, all of which you sustain, would you have imposed a lesser penalty if some of them had not been sustained, and if so, can you tell us which ones?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">THE WITNESS: Yes. If fewer than all of the charges had been sustained, I would have still imposed the penalty of removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">For me, the charge of improper disclosure of budget information [charge 3], the violation of the OMB circular [charge 3], the disclosure of the staffing and patrol numbers at the icons and the Federal parkways [charge 2], and the willful failure to carry out instructions by her immediate supervisor [charge 5], those all together aggregated to the point that I felt it [sic] was justified in removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">JUDGE BOGLE: Are you saying that each of these charges standing alone would warrant the penalty of removal?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">THE WITNESS: No, I don't think I'm saying that. I think what I'm saying is those three in particular together [charges 2, 3, and 5] warrant removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">JUDGE BOGLE: Tell me again which three you are talking about.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">THE WITNESS: The disclosure of budget numbers. ...The disclosure of security and staffing levels at the icons, and the failure to carry out instructions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">JUDGE BOGLE: Those were the three most important charges in your mind, and if those three were not sustained, what penalty would you have chosen?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">THE WITNESS: I would probably have proposed a suspension and perhaps a reinstatement into a position of less responsibility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the second question, the Board must decide whether the agency has established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have removed Chambers based on the sustained charges 3, 5, and 6. In making this determination, the agency cannot rely on the conduct underlying charges 1, 2, and 4, which have been set aside. We have identified certain factors which should be considered when determining this issue, such as</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its personnel action;[2] the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and[3] any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Carr v. Social Sec. Admin.,</span> 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before rendering a final decision on the two questions we have set out, the Board should receive briefing from the parties and should consider whether, for any reason, a remand to the AJ is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Chief Chambers was removed in 2004. In January of 2011, the Board, following two remands from the Federal Circuit, set aside the determination of its AJ that the removal should be affirmed and the removal was reversed based on a finding by the Board whistleblowing reprisal. The facts, extensively reiterated <span id="Page_3622"></span>in the 2011 decision, showed that Chambers made disclosures that were (and some that were not) protected, that there was some evidence of misconduct, but that the misconduct was not established by evidence sufficiently compelling as to meet the "clear and convincing" evidentiary standard necessary to sustain the removal despite the protected disclosures and the causal connection between the disclosures and the action taken against Chambers. Board Member Rose offered a concurring opinion noting that Chambers was a tenured civil servant entitled to the protections of the Reform Act and the Whistleblower Protection Act. Her point was that the agency could have designated her position as confidential or policymaking, and placed her in a position of either accepting policy decisions without disagreement or, if she expressed external disagreement, being subject to removal from her position without substantial whistleblower protections. The decision of the Board, along with the concurring opinion of Member Rose is reprinted below, with alterations in the text to minimize internal record references and to delete nonessential footnotes, <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/CHAMBERS_TERESA_C_DC_1221_04_0616_M_2_OPINION_AND_ORDER_566514.pdf">116 MSPR 17</a>, 20-64, 2011 MSPB 7 (2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is on remand from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which affirmed the Board's decision sustaining three charges underlying the appellant's removal, but reversed the Board's decision to sustain one additional charge. <span class="Italic">See Chambers v. Department of the Interior</span>, 602 F.3d 1370, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2010). The court remanded the case to the Board for consideration of the penalty as well as the issue of whether the agency presented clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel actions based on the sustained charges in the absence of the appellant's protected disclosures. For the following reasons, we REVERSE the initial decision, GRANT the appellant's request for corrective action, and ORDER the agency to cancel the appellant's placement on administrative leave and removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was employed as Chief, U.S. Park Police (USPP). On December 2, 2003, the Washington Post published an article quoting and otherwise describing statements the appellant allegedly made concerning her organization's need for additional resources. At 6:20 <span class="small">P.M.</span> the same day, her immediate supervisor, Donald Murphy, the Deputy Director of the National Park Service, sent her an e-mail message instructing her that she was "not to grant anymore [sic] inerviews [sic] without clearing them with [him] or" the appellant's second-level supervisor, Fran Mainella, the Director of the National Park Service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 5, 2003, Mr. Murphy placed the appellant on paid administrative leave "pending the completion of a review of [her] conduct," and on December 17, 2003, he proposed to remove her based on the following charges: (1) Making improper budget communications with a United States House of Representatives (House) Interior Appropriations Subcommittee staff member, Deborah Weatherly; (2) making public remarks regarding security on the federal mall, in parks, and on the parkways in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area; (3) improperly disclosing budget deliberations to a Washington Post reporter; (4) improper lobbying; (5) three specifications of failing to carry out a supervisor's instructions; and (6) failing to follow the chain of command. In a notice issued on July 9, 2004, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Fish and Wildlife and Parks Paul Hoffman informed the appellant of his decision to sustain all of the charges and to remove her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant had filed a January 29, 2004 complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) alleging that her placement on administrative leave and the proposal to remove her constituted reprisal for disclosures she made to Ms. Weatherly mentioned in the first charge, to the Washington Post, and to Ms. Mainella during the period from November 3 through December 2, 2003. On June 28, 2004, 11 days before the decision to remove her was issued, the appellant filed an IRA appeal with the Board's Washington Regional Office challenging the agency's decision to place her on administrative leave and propose her removal. In a subsequent submission, she indicated that the actions she was challenging in her IRA appeal included a "gag order" the agency had issued to her on December 2, 2003, i.e., the order mentioned above in which Mr. Murphy instructed her not to grant any more interviews without his prior approval or that of Ms. Mainella. On July 12, 2004, 2 days after the July 10, 2004 effective date of her removal, the appellant filed a Board appeal of that action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After a hearing, the administrative judge dismissed the IRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction and affirmed the removal action. The administrative judge sustained four of the six charges, i.e., the charges of making public remarks regarding security in public areas (charge two), improperly disclosing budget deliberations (charge three), failing to carry out a supervisor's instructions (charge five), and failing to follow the chain of command (charge six). She also found that: (1) Although the appellant's placement on administrative leave and her proposed removal were personnel actions that could be challenged in an IRA appeal, the "gag order" was not; (2) the appellant failed to establish that she made any disclosures protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8); and (3) even if the appellant had made protected disclosures and those disclosures were contributing factors in her placement on administrative leave and proposed removal, the agency established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken those actions in the absence of her alleged protected disclosures. The administrative judge found the appellant's other affirmative defenses unsubstantiated and held that the penalty of removal was reasonable in light of the sustained charges and other relevant factors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant petitioned for review of the initial decision. Two Board members affirmed the initial decision as modified, finding that the appellant had failed to show any material error in the administrative judge's findings and conclusions concerning the merits of the charges. <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Department of the Interior</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 375, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 12-13 (2006), <span class="Italic">aff'd in part, vacated in part, and remanded</span>, 515 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2008). The Board majority also concurred in the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant had not made protected disclosures, found that a disclosure not addressed by the administrative judge was not protected, found that the appellant had not shown material error in the administrative judge's analysis of the appellant's other affirmative defenses, and found the penalty of removal reasonable. The Board majority also noted that, in light of its conclusion that the appellant did not make a protected disclosure, it did not reach the question of whether the "gag order" was a personnel action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 32 n.5. In a dissenting opinion, Member Barbara J. Sapin asserted that the agency did not prove any of its charges and specifications and that the order restricting the appellant's contact with the news media, her placement on administrative leave, and her removal constituted reprisal for protected whistleblowing. 103 M.S.P.R. 375, dissenting opinion, &#x00B6; 2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant then filed a petition for judicial review with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Department of the Interior</span>, 515 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (<span class="Italic">Chambers I</span>). The court affirmed the Board majority's decision concerning the merits of the charges and the reasonableness of the penalty. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1365, 1370. The court found, however, that the Board had applied an incorrect standard in evaluating the appellant's claim that her removal was reprisal for her alleged protected disclosures to the Washington Post reporter and the House staffer of a danger to public safety. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1367-68. The court therefore vacated the Board's decision in part and remanded the appeals for application of the correct standard with respect to those potential disclosures. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1365, 1368-69, 1371. The court held that "[a]s to all other aspects of the Board's decision, however, we affirm." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1371.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the two-member Board affirmed as modified the initial decision sustaining the appellant's removal and denying her request for corrective action. <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Department of the Interior</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 321 (2009). The Board first noted that, by remanding the case the court had reinstated the appellant's arguments regarding the nature and effect of her public-safety-related statements, and that "[a]ll other issues in these appeals have been resolved." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 9. The Board denied the appellant's motion to reopen its previous decision and to reconsider the merits of the sustained charges apart from the whistleblowing issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 11. The Board also rejected her whistleblowing claims. Although the two Board members agreed on the disposition of the case, they did not agree on the reasoning. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 10. Thus, the Board affirmed the initial decision as modified by the Opinion and Order, still sustaining the appellant's removal and denying corrective action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 12. Chairman Neil A.G. McPhie, in a separate concurring opinion, would have found that the appellant made some protected disclosures, but that the agency presented clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same actions in the absence of those disclosures. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 10. Vice Chairman Mary M. Rose, in a separate concurring opinion, would have found none of the appellant's disclosures to be protected, and thus did not reach the issue of whether the agency would have taken the same actions absent the alleged protected disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant again appealed the Board's decision to the court. This time, the court held that although the Board properly sustained charges three, five, and six, it should not have sustained charge two, making public remarks regarding security on the federal mall, in parks, and on the parkways in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, because the sole specification for charge two was grounded in a protected disclosure, namely, that traffic accidents had increased on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, which often had two officers on patrol instead of the recommended four, and because that disclosure evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. <span class="Italic">Chambers</span>, 602 F.3d at 1378-80 (<span class="Italic">Chambers II</span>). The court further held that this disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take adverse action against the appellant, and that the remaining issues in the case were whether removal remained a reasonable penalty in light of the dismissal of charge two, and whether the agency proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel actions against the appellant in the absence of the protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1380. The court remanded the case to the Board for further consideration, including whether the penalty of removal was reasonable in light of the <span id="Page_3623"></span>three remaining sustained charges--charges three, five, and six--and whether the agency established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have removed the appellant based on the sustained charges. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1381-82. The court ordered the Board to receive briefing from the parties, consider whether a remand to the administrative judge was appropriate, and "address the other two actions as well [i.e., her placement on administrative leave and the agency's restriction of the appellant's access to the media] to see if corrective action is warranted." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1381-82 &#x0026; n.11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand from the court, the Board solicited briefs from the parties on the following issues: (1) Is the penalty of removal reasonable for the three sustained charges; (2) did the agency prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have removed the appellant in the absence of her protected whistleblowing; (3) what corrective action, if any, should be ordered for the appellant's having been placed on administrative leave and having had her media access restricted; and (4) is a remand to the administrative judge appropriate. The Board also requested the parties to brief an additional issue regarding penalty in light of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(B), but we find it unnecessary to reach this additional issue because of the findings we reach today. The parties have filed briefs and reply briefs addressing all the relevant issues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching our decision, we find it unnecessary to remand the appeal to the administrative judge. The administrative judge conducted a full hearing on all material issues in the appeal including, among other things, the merits of the agency's charges and the appellant's allegations of reprisal for protected whistleblowing activity. We therefore find the record sufficiently well-developed to resolve the issues remanded to us by the court. <span class="Italic">See Uske v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 544, 557 (1994) (remand is unnecessary to resolve conflicts in the evidence when the record is sufficiently well-developed to address the contested issues on review and the Board's findings are not based on witnesses' demeanor), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 56 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">see also Booker v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 72, &#x00B6; 7 (2008) and <span class="Italic">Gregory v. Federal Communications Commission</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 22, &#x00B6; 6 (1999), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 232 F.3d 912 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Table). We note that the administrative judge's terse "clear and convincing" analysis did not rely on the demeanor of witnesses in finding that the agency proved by the higher clear and convincing evidence standard that it would have placed the appellant on administrative leave and proposed her removal. [<span class="Italic">S</span>] <span class="Italic">ee Haabe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301-02 (Fed. Cir. 2002) ("When the demeanor-based deference requirement is not in play, the MSPB is free to reweigh the evidence and substitute its own decision as to the facts or law"). Further, this clear and convincing analysis was premised on the incorrect conclusion that the appellant had not engaged in protected whistleblowing activity. We also note that the administrative judge made no findings at all related to "clear and convincing evidence" and the agency's removal <span class="Italic">decision</span>. For all of these reasons, we find it appropriate to adjudicate the remanded appeal at the Board level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) prohibits any employee with the authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action from taking, failing to take, or threatening to take or fail to take, any personnel action because of the disclosure of information by an employee or applicant for employment that the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences a violation of law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). In an appeal before the Board, the employee or applicant must establish by preponderant evidence that she made a protected disclosure and that the disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1). If the employee or applicant meets that burden, the Board shall order such corrective action as it considers appropriate unless the agency shows by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the protected disclosure. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1)-(2); <span class="Italic">see Marano v. Department of Justice</span>, 2 F.3d 1137, 1141 (Fed. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court in this case has held that the agency proved three of the original six charges it brought against the appellant: Improperly disclosing budget deliberations to a Washington Post reporter; three specifications of failing to carry out a supervisor's instructions; and failing to follow the chain of command. <span class="Italic">Chambers II</span>, 602 F.3d at 1373 n.1, 1381. The court has also held that the appellant made at least one protected disclosure and proved that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the appellant's placement on administrative leave and removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1380. Because we find, as set forth below, that the agency did not meet its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that it would have placed the appellant on administrative leave and removed her in the absence of her disclosures, and that the agency would in fact have taken no action against the appellant in the absence of her protected disclosures, we need not address whether removal is a reasonable penalty in light of the dismissal of charge two by the court. <span class="Italic">See Stevens v. Department of the Army</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 619, 630 n.2 (1997) (upon finding that the appellant proved disability discrimination and reversing the removal, the Board held that it did not need to address the penalty); <span class="Italic">Marren v. Department of Justice</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 118, 120 n.1 (1985), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Hougens v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 135, 144 n.10 (1988); <span class="Italic">cf. Wills v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 90, &#x00B6; 8 (1999) (in light of the Board's determination that the agency did not prove its charge, the Board did not need to address arguments concerning the reasonableness of the penalty).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the court in <span class="Italic">Chambers II</span>, 602 F.3d at 1371 n.11, indicated that "[o]n remand, the Board should address the other two actions as well to see if corrective action is warranted," we do not interpret this instruction by the court as finding, or requiring the Board to find, that the restriction of the appellant's media access was a covered personnel action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). As explained above, the administrative judge initially found that the agency's action in this regard was not an appealable personnel action. The Board affirmed that finding when it affirmed the initial decision as modified. In <span class="Italic">Chambers I</span>, the court held that, except for the incorrect standard the Board applied in determining whether the appellant made a protected disclosure in connection with her removal, "all other aspects" of the Board's decision were affirmed. 515 F.3d at 1371. On remand from the court, the Board therefore noted that all issues, except for the appellant's arguments regarding the nature and effect of her public-safety-related statements, had been resolved. Thus, two full Board decisions and one court decision have upheld the initial decision's determination that the restriction on media access was not a personnel action. We therefore decline to revisit our previous ruling on this issue.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;We do not find any conflict in the court's two decisions regarding the media access issue. The Board is thus bound by the Federal Circuit's <span class="Italic">Chambers I</span> decision on this issue pursuant to the "mandate rule," a specific application of the "law of the case" doctrine. <span class="Italic">Hoover v. Department of the Navy</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 545, 552 (1993). To the extent there may be a conflict, the earlier panel decision in <span class="Italic">Chambers I</span> controls. <span class="Italic">See Johnston v. IVAC Corp.</span>, 885 F.2d 1574, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (if the holdings in two Federal Circuit panel decisions cannot be reconciled, the earlier panel decision remains controlling unless and until the court overrules it <span class="Italic">en banc</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, the record reflects that the appellant did not exhaust her remedy with OSC with respect to the agency's order that she obtain prior approval before granting media interview requests. <span class="Italic">See</span> OSC Complaint at 9-10, 18 (the appellant's OSC complaint indicating that the personnel actions she was challenging included a December 5, 2003 placement on administrative leave and a December 17, 2003 notice of proposed removal); (OSC's letter closing its investigation of her complaint "regarding your placement on administrative leave and proposed removal"); <span class="Italic">Ward v.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Protected Disclosures</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that charge two, "Making public remarks regarding security on the Federal mall, and in parks and on the Parkways in the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan area," could not be sustained because its sole specification was grounded in a protected disclosure, the court in <span class="Italic">Chambers II</span>, 602 F.3d at 1379, found it unnecessary</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">for present purposes to examine all of Chambers' statements to the Washington Post reporter as we agree with Chairman McPhie that Chambers' first statement that traffic accidents have increased on the Baltimore-Washington ('BW') Parkway, which often had two officers on patrol instead of the recommended four, was protected under the WPA as evidencing a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court held that an increase in traffic accidents was a significant and serious danger to public safety, that the appellant's statement detailed the specific consequences that had already resulted from the diversion of officers from the BW Parkway--more traffic accidents--and that the statement included the specific details as to the cause of the increased danger, namely, the reduction from four officers to two. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court found that the alleged danger was not vague or speculative and was more than likely to occur, given that it had, in fact, already occurred. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court also held that the appellant's belief that traffic accidents presented a substantial danger and that the diversion of Park Police from the BW Parkway was the cause of the increase in traffic accidents, was reasonable, given Mr. Murphy's acknowledgement that a change in police staffing to patrol the highways could affect traffic safety, as well as the appellant's expertise in public safety. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court recognized that the appellant had argued that "certain statements she made to the <span class="Italic">Washington Post</span> as well as statements <span id="Page_3624"></span>she made to the House staffer were protected under section 2302(b)(8) because they constituted disclosures of information she reasonably believed evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public safety." <span class="Italic">Chambers II</span>, 602 F.3d at 1377. Nevertheless, the court held that it was not necessary for "present purposes" to examine any of the appellant's alleged protected disclosures beyond the one it found protected. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1379. There is no indication in the court's decision that it intended to preclude the Board from finding on remand that other disclosures relating to public safety and identified in the court's decision were protected. In fact, the court referred to the plural "disclosures" in its instructions to the Board, thus suggesting that there might be other protected disclosures in addition to the one it found protected "for present purposes." <span class="Italic">See Chambers II</span>, 602 F.3d at 1373 ("[W]e remand to the Board for reconsideration of whether...the agency has presented clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel actions...in the absence of her protected disclosures"), 1380 ("[t]he remaining issues are whether removal remains a reasonable penalty...and whether the agency has proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel actions...in the absence of the protected disclosures"). Accordingly, we address whether the statements raised before the court, which the appellant made to the Washington Post reporter and the House staffer, constitute protected disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge in this case concluded that the appellant made the following statements to the Washington Post reporter:</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">&#x00B7;</span> "The U.S. Park Police department has been forced to divert patrol officers to stand guard around major monuments," resulting in "declining safety in parks and on parkways."</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">&#x00B7;</span> "[T]raffic accidents have increased on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, which now often has two officers on patrol instead of the recommended four."</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">&#x00B7;</span> "In neighborhood areas...residents are complaining that homeless people and drug dealers are again taking over smaller parks."</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">&#x00B7;</span> "Well, there's not enough of us to go around to protect those green spaces anymore."</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">&#x00B7;</span> "[M]any officers have remained on 12-hour shifts, with only limited bathroom breaks for those guarding monuments."</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">&#x00B7;</span> "My greatest fear is that harm or death will come to a visitor or employee at one of the parks, or that we're going to miss a key thing at one of our icons."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court in <span class="Italic">Chambers I</span> set forth the factors that guide the Board in determining "when a disclosed danger is sufficiently substantial and specific to warrant protection under the WPA." 515 F.3d at 1369. These are: (1) the likelihood of harm resulting from the danger; (2) when the alleged harm may occur; and (3) the nature of the harm--the potential consequences. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In light of these factors and prior cases, we find protected the appellant's statement concerning the diversion of Park Police patrol officers from national parks and the resulting increase in drug dealing in smaller national parks. This statement describes a specific consequence that the appellant alleged had already resulted from the diversion of Park Police patrol officers from the smaller national parks. This consequence, an increase in drug dealing, is an objectively significant and serious danger to public health and safety. The appellant's belief that it was so is, therefore, reasonable. Moreover, this resulting peril was not merely speculative or imminent; rather, it had already occurred. It was therefore not vague or speculative, but was specific and actual. In the context of this specific allegation, the appellant's more general reference to "declining safety in parks" and her claim that "there's not enough of us to go around to protect those green spaces anymore" are also protected. Those statements summarize and are supported by her more detailed statements addressing the same subject matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further note that the appellant had expertise in public safety and was familiar with the areas under her jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Chambers II</span>, 602 F.3d at 1379. Her belief that increased crime in the smaller national parks was attributable to a reduction in police patrols was therefore reasonable. For the foregoing reasons, we find that the appellant's statements concerning decreased police patrols and the diversion of park police from national parks, and the resultant increase in drug dealing constituted a protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other statements attributed to the appellant in the Washington Post article, however, do not constitute protected disclosures under the <span class="Italic">Chambers I</span> factors and in light of the relevant case law. Officers being required to remain on duty for 12-hour shifts without bathroom breaks might create the potential for fatigue and distraction that would undermine an officer's effectiveness. But in the absence of a specific example illustrating a substantial public health or safety consequence of the long shifts, or a manifestation of such fatigue, the statements standing alone are insufficient. Also insufficiently specific are the appellant's stated fear of "harm or death com[ing] to a visitor or employee at one of the parks, or that we're going to miss a key thing at one of our icons." These vague and conclusory allegations standing alone are unprotected. In addition, they are not supported by more specific allegations that would evidence a reasonable basis for her stated fears. Although the appellant pointed to the specific danger of increased numbers of drug dealers in the parks, her statements do not evidence a reasonable basis from which to conclude that the threats of "harm or death" are likely to befall a park visitor or employee as a result. These conclusory statements therefore differ from the ones relating to declining safety in the parks and on the parkways, which we and the court have found to be protected because they were supported by more specific statements evidencing their reasonableness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second communication acknowledged by the court was the e-mail message the appellant sent on December 2, 2003, to House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee staff member Ms. Weatherly. This disclosure was raised in connection with the appellant's removal, but was not raised in her OSC complaint with respect to the other personnel actions at issue in her IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">See Chambers</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 375, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15. In the e-mail, the appellant complained in relevant part that inadequate funding had resulted in inadequate staffing, and then identified several alleged consequences. These are: (1) "Not only are our most recognizable parks in jeopardy, so are the people who travel to and from Washington, D.C., on our parkways"; (2) "we generally have only two officers working at any one time on the George Washington Parkway, a situation that also occurs on our other parkways"; (3) "[W]e have had to turn our backs on drunk drivers, since making an arrest would require two officers off the street"; (4) the "staffing and resource crisis...will almost surely result in the loss of life or the destruction of one of our nations [sic] most valued symbols of freedom and democracy"; and (5) "the National Park Service's ability to protect these precious historical icons...or our guests who visit them or any of our other parks is increasingly compromised."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the <span class="Italic">Chambers I</span> factors and Federal Circuit and Board precedent, we find that most of these statements are not protected. The appellant's general pronouncements that the national parks are "in jeopardy," and that the National Park Service's ability to protect historical icons and visiting guests "is increasingly compromised," are too vague and nonspecific to be protected. The appellant's prediction that inadequate staffing will result in the loss of life or destruction of a monument is too speculative. These statements are divorced from any additional information by which the appellant's predictions can be judged. There may well be a staffing level below which reasonable predictions of likely harm could be made, but there is nothing in the appellant's statements to indicate she reasonably believed that level had been reached.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, the appellant's statements that patrolling the George Washington (GW) Parkway with only two officers had already required the USPP to "turn [their] backs on drunk drivers" in order to avoid requiring the officers to abandon their posts, identifies the specific cause of a substantial and specific danger to public safety that has already occurred. It is objectively reasonable to believe that a failure by Park Police officers to arrest suspected drunk drivers presents a substantial danger to other drivers and pedestrians on the GW Parkway. Her statement that "people who travel to and from Washington, D.C., on our parkways" are "in jeopardy" is also protected because it summarizes in conclusory form her identification of the specific and substantial threat of lax drunk driving enforcement. Accordingly, we find that the appellant's statements in the December 2, 2003 e-mail concerning the number of officers patrolling the GW Parkway, the consequent decision not to arrest suspected drunk drivers, and the resulting jeopardy to parkway travelers, are protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). The appellant's other statements in the e-mail are not protected.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The Board's reviewing court has held that disclosures made through normal channels as part of the disclosing employee's normal duties are not protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 263 F.3d 1341, 1352-54 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The record shows that the appellant communicated with Ms. Weatherly in the course of her work, and that her predecessor also occasionally talked to Ms. Weatherly regarding USPP needs. We see no indication, however, that communications such as the e-mail message at issue here, i.e., appeals to a subcommittee staff member for increased funding and expressions of concern to her regarding the effects of a failure to obtain that increase, made up part of the appellant's normal duties. Moreover, the fact that information an employee disclosed is closely related to the employee's day-to-day responsibilities does not remove the disclosure of that information from protection under section 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See Marano v. Department of Justice</span>, 2 F.3d 1137, 1142 (Fed. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Contributing Factor</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, in order to prevail on a claim of reprisal for making disclosures protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), an appellant must <span id="Page_3625"></span>show by preponderant evidence that the disclosures were a contributing factor in the agency's personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1). An employee may demonstrate that a disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure, and that the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court in <span class="Italic">Chambers II</span>, 602 F.3d at 1380, held that the administrative judge considered the contributing factor issue and found that the appellant's statements that had been reported in the Washington Post were a contributing factor in her placement on administrative leave and removal. The administrative judge based this finding on the timing of the actions in relation to the disclosure and on evidence that Mr. Murphy was aware of the appellant's statements to the reporter at the time he placed the appellant on administrative leave and proposed her removal. The court noted that the agency did not challenge this finding and that the disclosure it found protected was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to "take adverse action" against the appellant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. For the same reasons expressed by the court and the administrative judge, we find that the appellant's disclosure to the Washington Post reporter concerning the diversion of Park Police patrol officers from national parks and the resulting increase in drug dealing in smaller parks was also a contributing factor in her placement on administrative leave and removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the appellant's December 2, 2003 e-mail to Ms. Weatherly, which we have found constitutes a protected disclosure, was a contributing factor in the appellant's removal. The record includes a copy of an e-mail that Ms. Weatherly sent to Mr. Murphy on December 4, 2003, referring to an e-mail the appellant had sent her "[j]ust the other day," and indicating that the appellant's e-mail had been forwarded to Mr. Murphy under separate cover. Ms. Weatherly acknowledged at the hearing that the message to which she was referring was "[p]erhaps" the December 2 e-mail from the appellant, and the description of the message she provided to Mr. Murphy leaves little room for doubt that she was referring to that message. Mr. Murphy acknowledged that he received, probably on December 4, 2003, or the next day, the appellant's December 2, 2003 e-mail message to Ms. Weatherly that had been forwarded to him by Ms. Weatherly. Thus, we find by preponderant evidence that the appellant's December 2, 2003 e-mail to Ms. Weatherly was a contributing factor in her December 5, 2003 placement on administrative leave and her removal, which was proposed by Mr. Murphy on December 17, 2003. <span class="Italic">See Scott v. Department of Justice</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 211, 238 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 99 F.3d 1160 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table).[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;It is unclear whether Mr. Hoffman was aware of the appellant's December 2, 2003 protected disclosure to Ms. Weatherly when he decided to remove the appellant. However, an appellant can show that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor by proving that the acting official was influenced by an individual with actual knowledge of the disclosure. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Baldwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 469, &#x00B6; 23 (2010). We find that Mr. Hoffman was influenced by Mr. Murphy's decision to propose the appellant's removal, had imputed or "constructive" knowledge of this protected disclosure, and acted within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the removal. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6; 24; <span class="Italic">Visconti v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 17, 24 (1998); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Hoffman Deposition at 35 (Mr. Hoffman considered Mr. Murphy a colleague and friend).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Clear and Convincing Evidence</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant made protected disclosures that were a contributing factor in her placement on administrative leave and removal, the remaining issue is whether the agency met its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same actions in the absence of the protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2); <span class="Italic">Chambers II</span>, 602 F.3d at 1380. In particular, the court instructed the Board to determine whether the agency established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have removed the appellant based on the sustained charges three, five, and six, absent her protected disclosures relating to public health and safety. <span class="Italic">Chambers II</span>, 602 F.3d at 1382 (in making this determination, the agency cannot rely on the conduct underlying charges one, two, and four, which have been set aside). Clear and convincing evidence is that measure or degree of proof that produces in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief as to the allegations sought to be established. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.4(d). It is a higher standard than a "preponderance of the evidence," which is the degree of relevant evidence that a reasonable person, considering the record as a whole, would accept as sufficient to find that a contested fact is more likely to be true than untrue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(q)]. As explained by one of the sponsors of the WPA, "clear and convincing evidence" is an intentionally high standard of proof:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"Clear and convincing evidence" is a high standard of proof for the Government to carry. It is intended as such for two reasons. First, this standard of proof comes into play only if the employee has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the action against him or her--in other words, that the agency action was tainted. Second, this heightened burden of proof on the agency recognizes that when it comes to proving the basis for an agency's decision, the agency controls most of the cards--the drafting of the documents supporting the decision, the testimony of witnesses who participated in the decision, and the records that could document whether similar personnel actions have been taken in other cases. In these circumstances, it is entirely appropriate that the agency bears a heavy burden to justify its actions.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel actions in the absence of whistleblowing, the Board will consider the following factors: The strength of the agency's evidence in support of its action; the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">Carr v. Social Security Administration</span>, 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Strength of the Agency's Evidence</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When examining the strength of the agency's evidence, the Board will look at the evidence the agency had before it when it took the alleged retaliatory action. <span class="Italic">Yunus v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 242 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Russell v. Department of Justice</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 317, 326 (1997). If the agency fails to investigate a charge sufficiently before bringing an action, such a failure might indicate an improper motive. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Carr</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 313, 335 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 185 F.3d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 1999).[9] However, if relevant facts are developed on appeal to the Board that the agency had no prior reason to know, the Board will not find that such facts undercut the agency's otherwise sufficiently clear and convincing evidence that, at the time of the action, its decision would have been the same absent the whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. It behooves an agency, when faced with the "clear and convincing evidence" standard, to fully explain all of its potentially questionable actions to meet that burden. <span class="Italic">Cosgrove v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;After the appellant submitted her written reply to the proposal notice, Mr. Hoffman conducted interviews with five agency employees and Ms. Weatherly. Mr. Hoffman also considered an affidavit from John Wright and comments prepared by Randolph Myers. However, Mr. Hoffman did not seek any additional information from the appellant after she had submitted her reply to the proposed removal, even though such additional information may have helped him to fairly resolve contested issues of material fact.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Charge Three</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board and the court sustained this charge of improperly disclosing budget deliberations. The agency alleged that the appellant violated section 22.1 of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-11 (2003), which it quoted as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The nature and amounts of the President's decisions and the underlying materials are confidential. Do not release the President's decisions outside of your agency until the budget is transmitted to Congress. Do not release any materials underlying those decisions, at any time, except in accordance with this section.... Do not release any agency justifications provided to OMB and any agency future plans or long-range estimates to anyone outside the executive branch, except in accordance with this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserted that the President had not transmitted the 2005 budget to Congress, that the appellant had informed the Washington Post reporter, during the same interview mentioned above, that she had "asked for $8 million more for next year," and that making this statement before the President transmitted the 2005 budget to Congress constituted an improper disclosure of 2005 federal budget information in violation of section 22.1 of OMB Circular A-11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Washington Post article provided, in relevant part,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Park Police's new force of 20 unarmed security guards will begin serving around the monuments in the next few weeks, Chambers said. She said she eventually hopes to have a combination of two guards and two officers at the monuments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_3626"></span>Though such guards have worked inside the Washington Monument and the White House Visitor Center, Chambers said they had not previously been used outside monuments in place of a police officer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">She said a more pressing need is an infusion of federal money to hire recruits and pay for officers' overtime. She said she has to cover a $12 million shortfall for this year and has asked for $8 million more for next year. She also would like $7 million to replace the force's aging helicopter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">But leaders in Congress are not inclined to go along. Instead, they have backed a 2001 report by the National Academy of Public Administration, which found that Park Police spent about 15 percent of their time on activities that "often are extraneous to the park service mission."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency had before it interview testimony from the National Park Service's Budget Director, Charles Bruce Schaefer, indicating that the USPP had requested from OMB $8 million for fiscal 2005. In her response to the proposal notice, however, the appellant alleged that her statement regarding the $8 million figure was reported inaccurately, and that she was in fact responding to a question from the reporter about how much money was <span class="Italic">needed</span>, rather than how much she or the agency had <span class="Italic">requested</span>.[10] The agency does not deny--and in fact, Mr. Murphy has conceded--that employees are entitled to publicly express their beliefs as to the resources the agency needs to meet its goals. In fact, the record shows that Mr. Murphy had previously made statements to the press that are similar to the statements allegedly made by the appellant to the Washington Post. (Mr. Murphy described in Arizona Star article as saying "he's pushing Congress to spend $4 million to $7 million to install 32 miles of the barrier at Organ Pipe"). Moreover, the frequency with which correction notices appear in newspapers demonstrates that factual errors like those described by the appellant here are not uncommon. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.64 (official notice may be taken of matters of common knowledge).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;This statement by the appellant in her response to the proposal notice was consistent with her deposition and hearing testimony. As noted in footnote 9 above, although the deciding official interviewed other individuals after receiving the appellant's response to the proposed removal, he made no additional inquiries of the appellant that may have resolved conflicts in the evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Washington Post article itself does not strongly support the charge. As indicated above, it includes a statement that the appellant said she had "asked for $8 million more for next year." The sentence in which this statement is made, however, immediately follows a sentence in which the appellant is described as having said that "a more pressing need is an infusion of federal money to hire recruits and pay for officers' overtime." The article therefore could be read as indicating that the $8 million to which the appellant referred represented an amount that would cover only two components of the budget increase to which she referred, i.e., money to hire new employees and money to pay overtime. It is also followed immediately by a statement that the appellant "also would like $7 million to replace the force's aging helicopter," and preceded by a statement that she needed to "cover a $12 million shortfall" for the year. Thus, the article could be interpreted as indicating that the appellant referred to an increase of at least $15 million--nearly twice the size of the overall net increase in USPP funding that the agency actually had requested. In fact, the Washington Post published another article by the same reporter 4 days after the article at issue here, and that article described the appellant's statement regarding the $8 million figure in a manner consistent with the appellant's allegation, i.e., it indicated that the appellant had said "that her department had a $12 million shortfall this year and that $8 million was <span class="Italic">needed</span> for next year." In any event, the December 2 article is hearsay evidence, and, while relevant hearsay evidence is admissible in Board proceedings, the Board generally favors live testimony over hearsay. <span class="Italic">Bledsoe v. Department of Justice</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 93, &#x00B6; 17 n.4 (2002), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 60 Fed. Appx. 803 (Fed. Cir. 2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official obtained a declaration from John Wright, the agency's senior public affairs officer. Mr. Wright's declaration indicates only that Mr. Wright read to the reporter statements that the reporter attributed to the appellant, asked the reporter "whether in connection with the aforementioned statements that appeared in The Washington Post on December 2, 2003, he had accurately quoted" the appellant, and that the reporter "stated that he had accurately quoted [the appellant] and that The Washington Post stands behind what was written in the December 2, 2003, story." However, as noted above, this hearsay statement from Mr. Wright regarding the reporter's account of what the appellant told him is inconsistent with the article published by the same reporter 4 days after the December 2, 2003 article that formed the basis for this charge. Moreover, Mr. Hoffman did not interview Mr. Wright or the Washington Post reporter. Mr. Wright later indicated in his deposition that he had not "go[ne] into the details of" the alleged statement at issue here, that when he tried to question the reporter further concerning the appellant's statements, the reporter declined to provide further information and referred Mr. Wright to his editor, and that when he called the editor and attempted to ask further questions, the editor declined to provide any answers and instead referred him to someone he believed was counsel for the newspaper.[11] It appears, therefore, that the reporter declined to answer specific questions about the accuracy of the particular statement at issue here and that Mr. Hoffman could have learned this information if he had interviewed Mr. Wright and asked him more probing questions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;Mr. Wright testified that he did not call the person identified by the editor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Murphy testified that he knew that Jeff Capps, chairman of the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) Labor Committee for the USPP, provided some information to the Washington Post reporter before the reporter spoke with the appellant, but Mr. Murphy did not make an inquiry to determine what information Mr. Capps or the FOP might have given to the Washington Post for the December 2, 2003 article. Mr. Murphy testified that it did not occur to him at the time that some of the statements in the article might have had as their source Mr. Capps or the FOP, and not the appellant. There was no inquiry done at Mr. Murphy's direction to try to sort out which of the Washington Post article statements came from the FOP and which came from the appellant. This information could have been available to Mr. Hoffman at the time he made his decision had a sufficient investigation been conducted. Similarly, Mr. Hoffman testified that it was not important to him to "determine, in [his] role as the deciding official to know how [the appellant] came to talk about these three figures in the Washington Post, in other words, what was asked by the reporter and what did she say?" Mr. Hoffman did not ask the media office to determine whether the reporter might have asked the appellant how much money she needed to perform her job, he did not know whether the reporter asked her what she needed and whether she said in response what she needed, he did not know whether she told the reporter that the total amount needed was $27 million, and as far as Mr. Hoffman was concerned that was "irrelevant."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, when the agency made its decision, the appellant's position regarding the nature of her statements to the reporter was unrebutted by any other person present during her interview with the reporter. Under the above circumstances, we find that the evidence in support of charge three that was before the agency when it removed the appellant was not particularly strong.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Specification One of Charge Five</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Charge five, failure to carry out a supervisor's instructions, was supported by three specifications. In the first specification, the agency alleged that Mr. Murphy instructed the appellant to detail a member of her staff, Pamela Blyth, to the Office of Strategic Planning, that the appellant stated that she was unwilling to do so because Ms. Blyth was too valuable to lose, that after the appellant continued to object, Mr. Murphy informed her that he was giving her a specific order to effect the detail, that the appellant continued to express her unwillingness to detail Ms. Blyth, that Mr. Murphy offered to permit the detail to be served in increments acceptable to the appellant, and that the appellant nevertheless failed to detail Ms. Blyth.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant responded to this specification by asserting that she never received and never refused to carry out an instruction to detail Ms. Blyth. She claimed that, although she voiced opposition to the detail, she did not fail to follow an instruction because Mr. Murphy was going to detail Ms. Blyth and she "never understood that she received an order to effectuate a detail herself." In this regard, the appellant informed the agency that Mr. Murphy informed her of <span class="Italic">his</span> intent to detail Ms. Blyth, never provided the appellant with a starting date for the detail, told the appellant that he would speak further with Ms. Blyth to work out the specifics, engaged the appellant in a "healthy, professional disagreement and debate" about this and other topics, and told the appellant that he "could" order the appellant to detail Ms. Blyth, but never gave her such an order. The appellant claimed that after she learned from Ms. Blyth on August 21, 2003, that the detail would begin on Monday, August 25, 2003, she sent an e-mail to Mr. Murphy describing the projects Ms. Blyth was working on and thanking Mr. Murphy for identifying a schedule that would allow Ms. Blyth to stay focused on those tasks while still on the detail. (August 21, 2003 e-mail from the appellant to Mr. Murphy, presented as supporting documentation to her written reply to the notice of proposed removal). Mr. Murphy's response to that e-mail, dated August 22, 2003, suggests that he was satisfied with the steps the appellant had taken up to that point. (thanking the appellant for her message and referring to another matter). The appellant also submitted to the agency an undated memorandum from the "Deputy Director," i.e., Mr. Murphy, to Ms. Blyth indicating that, "[t]o assist you in meeting these goals and to provide you with additional on-the-job training in fundamental areas of strategic planning, I am detailing you for 120 days to the Office of Strategic <span id="Page_3627"></span>Planning...effective...." This memo suggests that Mr. Murphy viewed it as his responsibility to effect the detail of Ms. Blyth.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When asked during the agency's investigatory interview what instructions or orders he gave the appellant regarding Ms. Blyth's detail, Mr. Murphy testified that "I gave her instructions that Pamela Blyth was to do a--what amounted to, I believe, 120-day detail at the Office of Strategic Planning," and provided a long, detailed explanation as to why he believed the detail was justified. He testified that he called the appellant in and "gave her instructions that I had taken this up the chain and that we had agreed that this was important" and that he "clearly communicated to her this was going to happen." He testified that he "gave her very clear instructions," and she "understood that this was to happen." When asked if he could elaborate on how it was absolutely clear that the appellant was to carry out an instruction to implement the detail, as opposed to the appellant's allegation that Mr. Murphy was going to effect the detail himself, Mr. Murphy replied, "Sure. I communicated to the chief that it was her responsibility to have Pamela report for the detail on Monday." When asked, however, whether he "sen[t] a memo to Ms. Blyth because [he] thought it was [his] responsibility to put her on detail or because [he] believed that [the appellant] was not going to put Ms. Blyth on the detail," Murphy stated that this was an "interesting question," and that the answer was "[p]robably a little of both."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, the appellant acknowledged in her response to the proposal notice that she expressed objections to the detail and attempted to persuade Mr. Murphy not to effect it. These objections and efforts, however, would not necessarily support this specification. <span class="Italic">See Berube v. General Services Administration</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 581, 592 (1986) (as long as senior executives perform their assigned responsibilities and do not engage in actionable misconduct, their disagreements with policy decisions may not form the basis for adverse actions against them), <span class="Italic">vacated on other grounds</span>, 820 F.2d 396 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Instead, the question raised by this specification was whether Mr. Murphy instructed the appellant to take some action or actions to effect the detail and, if so, whether the appellant failed to take the action or actions as instructed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, the agency did not seek any additional input from the appellant regarding this specification after she had replied to the proposed removal. In addition, it did not interview Ms. Blyth to learn who communicated with her regarding the effecting of the detail. In fact, when questioned about the basis for his belief that the appellant failed to comply with his instructions regarding the detail, Mr. Murphy referred to the appellant's conversation with J. Steven Griles, Deputy Secretary of the Interior, and to the subsequent decision of Mr. Griles to cancel the detail. When Mr. Hoffman asked him whether the appellant's "going to Griles [had] any bearing on [his] determination that [the appellant] was willfully disobeying your order to detail" Ms. Blyth, Mr. Murphy replied that it did. The pleasant tone of the August 2003 e-mail messages between the appellant and Mr. Murphy that are cited above, in which it appeared that the appellant had not failed to follow any instruction regarding the detailing of Ms. Blyth, contrasts sharply with that of an e-mail message Mr. Murphy sent to the appellant a few days later, after learning that the detail would not be effected as scheduled. In the latter message, Mr. Murphy described the appellant's communication with Mr. Griles as "unacceptable," "a breach of supervisory protocol," and "totally inappropriate"; he stated that he could "only assume [the appellant's] intentions were nefarious"; and he asserted that her "obtaining the Deputy Secretary's okay in the absence of [Mr. Murphy's] input only [made her] insubordination all the more egregious." Even if Mr. Murphy was annoyed by the appellant's earlier efforts to dissuade him from effecting the detail, there is no indication that he expressed this level of anger previously or--more importantly--that he previously accused the appellant of insubordination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the appellant's communication with Mr. Griles and the email communication between the appellant and Mr. Murphy appear to have occurred only after Mr. Murphy had arranged the specifics of the detail and informed Ms. Blyth about it. Moreover, the decisions to postpone and eventually cancel the detail were made by Mr. Murphy's superiors and not by the appellant. In sum, the communications and documentary evidence mentioned above do not strongly support a finding that the appellant failed to follow any instructions by Mr. Murphy to effect the detail in question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Specification Two of Charge Five</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second specification of charge five concerns a request by OSC, which had been investigating the propriety of the hiring of Ms. Blyth, Deputy Chief Barry Beam, and Deputy Chief Dwight Pettiford. The agency noted that OSC had asked for proof that Mr. Beam and Mr. Pettiford had undergone medical and psychological evaluations, and it alleged that Mr. Murphy had instructed the appellant, on or about June 12, 2003, to direct those employees to undergo the required evaluations. It also alleged that the appellant had responded by "protest[ing] that, for various reasons, [the] evaluations were not necessary," that Mr. Murphy explained to the appellant that none of her reasons had merit, that he "[t]hereafter" instructed the appellant for a second time to direct the employees to undergo the evaluations, and that the appellant failed to do so, instead challenging the propriety of the instructions and "openly express[ing her] unwillingness to comply with them."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her response to the proposal notice, the appellant asserted that Mr. Murphy, as of June 11, 2003, believed that the tests for Mr. Beam and Mr. Pettiford had been waived, and indicated that he would be meeting with the solicitor's office the next day. The appellant claimed that during a conversation on June 12, 2003, Mr. Murphy informed her that it would be best if these employees took the tests, she replied that the final decision was his but asked him to consider the issue one last time, Mr. Murphy listened patiently then told her that he would call in the employees and explain to them in person what he had decided to do and why he had changed his mind, and she thought that was a good idea and would tell the employees to expect such a meeting. The appellant informed the agency that, instead of having a meeting, Mr. Murphy prepared memoranda for Mr. Beam and Mr. Pettiford that directed them to make arrangements to take the tests, and instructed the appellant to give the memoranda to those employees. As part of her response to the proposal notice, the appellant submitted copies of those June 16, 2003 memoranda, giving the employees 2 weeks to schedule their psychological examinations. The appellant asserted that she gave the memoranda to the employees, thus complying with the only order given to her on this issue, and instructed them to comply with the provisions in the memoranda. The appellant presented evidence that on June 29, 2003, Mr. Beam sent an e-mail to the appellant indicating that he had scheduled the required examination but was challenging it through the grievance and equal employment opportunity (EEO) processes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency appears to have had before it a signed, December 4, 2003 memorandum written by Mr. Murphy that provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">On or about June 1st I was informed by...the solicitors office that the investigators from the Office of the Special Counsel were concerned about the hiring process of the two USPP deputy chiefs, Barry Beam and Dwight Pettiford. The job announcement required that a psychological test and physical exam be passed by the candidates selected before they could be hired. Neither Beam nor Pettiford completed the testing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The OSC became involved because a whistle blower alerted them to the "illegal" hiring. The OSC informed the DOI [Department of the Interior] solicitors office that it would be a good idea for Beam and Pettiford to complete the tests, even though they had already been hired.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I immediately informed [the appellant] that Beam and Pettiford must take the tests. She protested that this was not necessary, that it would give the "snipers" who did not like her new management policies a victory, and besides both Pettiford and Beam had passed tests as young officers previously. I gave her a direct order to have them complete the tests. I also notified Beam and Pettiford that they had to take the test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I informed the chief that the OSC had a great deal of authority in these matters and that they could order the dismissal of Beam and Pettiford and the re-advertisement of the positions. The chief did not understand the seriousness of this investigation. She subsequently stalled the testing process by not following through on my direct order to have Beam and Pettiford take the tests. The tests were not taken until sometime in September after I reissued my order to Beam and Pettiford in writing and met with them to further explain why it was important that they comply. During this period, the chief cooperated reluctantly and was not supportive of my position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During his interview with Mr. Hoffman, Mr. Murphy testified in response to a question about the appellant's assertion that he agreed to take responsibility for telling Mr. Beam and Mr. Pettiford of his decision that they undergo the evaluations. Mr. Murphy indicated,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[t]hat's unequivocally false and a total mischaracterization of what is the...case. I directed Chief Chambers to have Beam and Pettiford undergo these--the psychological testing. It came to my attention a few months later, again I believe through the solicitor's office, that it had not been done. And I called Chief Chambers in to the office to find out why it had not been done. And, again, to make a long story short, right back into the discussion about the snipers and the people out to get her and her command staff. She didn't believe it was necessary and no adequate explanation had been given as to why. That's when I had to intervene finally and it's ironic because I'm intervening to protect her and to protect her command staff from possible problems from the Office of the Special Counsel. So I intervened at her request. She said well, will you talk to Beam and Pettiford and let them know why this is important and communicate it that it's you that wants this done, which I did and they appreciated me talking to them and giving them an explanation. Again, I'm <span id="Page_3628"></span>trying to be cooperative with the chief. I mean, at that point, I could have slapped her with again being insubordinate right there. I'm here being cooperative and trying to understand her point of view, giving her the benefit of the doubt. So I talked to Beam and Pettiford and explained to them why this is important to be done and they said they would comply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">His willingness to talk to Beam and Pettiford was partly motivated because she "refused to carry it forward," and she "said she wouldn't do it."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While Mr. Murphy's December 4, 2003 memorandum and his testimony during the interview provide some support for this specification, the memorandum is unsworn and written approximately 6 months after the events in question and only 1 day before he placed the appellant on administrative leave. The agency also had before it evidence indicating that the appellant did not fail to follow any instructions from Mr. Murphy, that progress relating to the examinations for Mr. Beam and Mr. Pettiford was being made, and that any delays were not the result of any "stall[ing]" by the appellant. For example, the appellant submitted to the agency a July 23, 2003 letter from Mr. Murphy to Mr. Beam responding to Mr. Beam's grievance relating to the psychological examination and informing Mr. Beam that "[o]nce you provide the information regarding the personal relief you are requesting, I will provide you with my written decision regarding your grievance." She further submitted August 20, 2003 e-mails from Mr. Murphy to Mr. Beam and Mr. Pettiford informing that "[i]t was good to meet with [them] regarding [his] earlier letter directing [them] to complete [their] psychological testing," that he was pleased that they agreed to complete the testing "immediately," and that he would assist them by attempting to expedite the scheduling of the tests "once you have received and answered the list of questions." Mr. Murphy instructed Mr. Beam and Mr. Pettiford to "[p]lease keep Chief Chambers informed of your progress." The appellant sent an August 30, 2003 e-mail to Mr. Murphy informing him that Mr. Beam had an interview scheduled for September 3, 2003, informed him on September 17, 2003, that Mr. Beam had completed the requirements, and informed him on November 10, 2003, that Mr. Pettiford had completed his medical and psychological tests, but had not heard from anyone "on the status."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The testimony cited above, along with other evidence in the record, suggests that Mr. Murphy may have confused the appellant's actions prior to the issuance of his memoranda to the deputy chiefs with her actions following the issuance of those memoranda. The record includes another document written by Mr. Murphy that suggests such confusion. In that document, which is headed "Notes on Chief of Police," Mr. Murphy made the following statement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">As a result of recommendations made by [the solicitor's] office and consultation with OSC it was concluded that [the deputy chiefs] should take the...examination. I directed them by memo to do so. The chief objected and frustrated our efforts to resolve this serious issue. It was not until recently that we received her cooperation and that of the deputy chiefs. They have finally complied. It is my belief, however, that the chief deliberately advised the deputy chief's [sic] to disobey my direction to them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is not clear, however, how the appellant allegedly "stalled" or "frustrated" the process. Once Mr. Murphy directly ordered, by means of the June 16, 2003 memoranda, Mr. Beam and Mr. Pettiford to take the tests, it would appear that any failure to complete the process would have been their failure to follow Mr. Murphy's instructions, not the appellant's failure to do so. Moreover, the agency did not specifically charge the appellant with any action or inaction following Mr. Murphy's issuance of his memoranda to the deputy chiefs. In sum, much of the evidence before the agency indicated that any delay in completing the testing was not due to any action or inaction on the part of the appellant, but was instead the result of the interactive process between Mr. Murphy and Mr. Beam/Mr. Pettiford relating to such matters as grievance and EEO procedures, Mr. Beam and Mr. Pettiford's receipt and answering a list of questions presented by Mr. Murphy, and their scheduling, taking, and waiting for the results of the examinations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Specification Three of Charge Five</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The last specification of charge five concerns the "tractor man" incident at Constitution Gardens, which seriously disrupted traffic in Washington, D.C., in early 2003. According to the agency, the Organization of American States (OAS) had complained that armed USPP sharpshooters had been deployed on the grounds of its headquarters during the incident and that this action had violated a treaty. The agency also alleged that Randolph Myers, an attorney in the agency's solicitor's office, needed to meet with the appellant to assess whether the USPP had violated any treaties and whether it had complied with its own General Orders requiring contacting the Department of State. It alleged further that Mr. Myers had asked the appellant to discuss the complaint with him, that the appellant had failed to respond to this request, and that this failure constituted a violation of instructions by Mr. Murphy "to fully cooperate with and work with attorneys in the Solicitor's Office in connection with any information and/or assistance they needed regarding the ['tractor man'] incident."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her response to the proposal notice, the appellant asserted that Mr. Murphy did not instruct her to fully cooperate and work with attorneys in the solicitor's office regarding the incident and that she did not recall ever having a conversation with Mr. Murphy about the "tractor man" incident except to invite him to the "after-action critique" and to discuss the written report as to the findings in that critique. She asserted that a meeting with Mr. Myers had been scheduled but cancelled, and that she did not recall the reason for the cancellation or who had cancelled it. The appellant claimed that Lt. Phil Beck tried several times, at the appellant's request, to reschedule the meeting with Mr. Myers, but a mutually available time was not agreed upon, and asserted that "[a]t no time did anyone convey an urgency to the Chief that she needed to meet with Mr. Myers immediately," and "[a]t no time did she consider that she was not fulfilling an obligation or following an order." The appellant asserted that she was "never aware that Mr. Murphy believed she failed to carry out his instructions regarding any issue relating to this matter until the charge appeared in the proposal for removal."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When he was asked during the agency investigation to describe the instructions he gave the appellant regarding the OAS matter, Mr. Murphy testified that he did not "recall speaking with [the appellant] directly about this instance." When questioned further about the matter, he testified that his "memory [was] just really sketchy on that," and although he seemed to indicate at times that he provided some sort of instructions to cooperate, he stated that he was "being ambivalent" because he knew he was testifying under oath, that his "memory [was] just failing him," and that he would "have to go back and check." Furthermore, although during the interview he was asked to submit a written, signed, and dated statement summarizing his recollection and providing any supporting documents, as well as a statement summarizing how his instructions were given and in what time frame, Mr. Murphy conceded at the Board hearing that he had submitted nothing in that regard. As previously noted, Mr. Hoffman did not interview the appellant. Moreover, he did not interview Lt. Beck, who could have corroborated the appellant's account. The agency did not produce any written order from Mr. Murphy instructing the appellant to cooperate with Mr. Myers,[12] nor did it produce any contemporaneous writings from Mr. Murphy relating to such an instruction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;Mr. Myers testified about his attempts to meet with the appellant, but he did not provide any probative evidence about what Mr. Murphy may have instructed the appellant to do.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the agency had little evidence to conclude if and what Mr. Murphy had instructed the appellant to do with Mr. Myers, or if the appellant had failed to follow any instruction given by Mr. Murphy. Its evidence to support specification three of charge five was therefore weak. Although the Board and the court sustained charge five, for all the reasons just discussed, we find that the agency's evidence supporting the charge at the time it took its removal action was not particularly strong.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Charge Six</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The last charge, failure to follow the chain of command, is related to the matter at issue in the first specification of charge five, i.e., to Ms. Blyth's scheduled detail to the Office of Strategic Planning. In this charge, the agency alleged that, during the week of August 18, 2003, when Mr. Murphy was absent from the office, the appellant appealed to Deputy Secretary Griles and convinced him to "cancel [Mr. Murphy's] instructions that Ms. Blyth be detailed...." The agency asserted that, by appealing Mr. Murphy's instruction to Mr. Griles, rather than to her second-level supervisor, Ms. Mainella, the appellant failed to follow the chain of command.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her response to the proposal notice, the appellant acknowledged that she did not contact Ms. Mainella before contacting Mr. Griles, who was her fourth-level supervisor. Nevertheless, the appellant asserted that she did not violate any law, regulation, or policy, her actions were welcomed and condoned by Mr. Griles and consistent with the actions of others throughout the agency, and Mr. Griles's determination to cancel the detail showed that the charge did not promote the efficiency of the service. The appellant further claimed that she did not consult with Ms. Mainella because Ms. Mainella had told her that she would support whatever decision Mr. Murphy rendered regarding the detail of Ms. Blyth and that after she informed Mr. Capps about the detail and the fact that certain projects would not move forward as planned, Mr. Capps left a telephone message for Mr. Griles urging him to contact the appellant. The appellant indicated that she contacted Mr. Griles the night before Ms. Blyth's detail was scheduled to begin after she was unable to reach her third-level supervisor, Assistant Secretary Craig Manson, and she had not heard from Mr. Griles after the call was placed by Mr. Capps. After she explained to Mr. Griles her concerns regarding the detail, Mr. Griles subsequently called the appellant later that evening and informed her that the detail had been "reversed."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's contacting Mr. Griles without first actually talking to <span id="Page_3629"></span>Mr. Murphy, Ms. Mainella, and Mr. Manson could be regarded as taking her concerns regarding the detail of Ms. Blyth outside the chain of command. Going outside the chain of command may constitute a basis for disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. U.S. Coast Guard</span>, 10 M.S.P.R. 573, 578 (1982). Nevertheless, the agency identified no agency instruction or similar authority prohibiting the appellant from taking the action she took here, and the record before the agency includes some evidence that such actions were considered acceptable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, Mr. Manson indicated during his interview that it was not unusual for the appellant to call him directly about various matters, and when he heard the appellant's voicemail message about the detail of Ms. Blyth he did not think that it was unusual that she was calling him about any particular subject. During its interview, however, the agency did not ask Mr. Manson whether it was inappropriate for the appellant to have contacted Mr. Griles under these circumstances.[13] When asked during the agency investigation whether the appellant's communicating with him outside the chain of command was something he welcomed or condoned, Mr. Griles testified that he did not condone or particularly encourage it, but</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[a]s I do with most career people in the Department, if they have something to say to me, I talk to them. On this particular occasion, she felt that there was something that she committed to do for the Assistant Secretary, myself, and that it was going to be inhibited by the detail of the employee away from her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13]&#x2003;In fact, when Mr. Manson was asked such a question during his deposition, he indicated that it would have been appropriate for Mr. Murphy to have reminded the appellant that she should start at the lowest level of the chain of command, and that, while he did not know whether disciplinary action would have been proper because he did not know what previous conversations Mr. Murphy may have had with the appellant about that subject, it "wouldn't have been appropriate for [Mr. Murphy] to respond in any hostile manner" to the appellant's "having gone to [him] or Mr. Griles to cancel [Ms. Blyth's] detail," and he could think of no specific conditions that would justify disciplining the appellant for contacting him or Mr. Griles in connection with the detail. He also testified that it was "[q]uite common" for subordinates to come to him outside the presence of their immediate supervisors, that such actions did not cause him concern, that he knew of no document or training indicating that employees were prohibited from raising concerns with second-level supervisors in the absence of first-level supervisors, and that he found such practices to be "quite efficient."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Griles indicated that he dealt with the chain of command issue by having a meeting in his conference room in which all of the chain of command was present, as well as a discussion at that time regarding how the appellant should work within the chain of command. He also acknowledged that he "perceive[d] a problem regarding...the whole detail matter," and testified that "it appeared to [him] that that would have been an arbitrary decision by [Mr. Murphy] to detail [Ms. Blyth] at a time when the [appellant] was relying on her for a budget preparation." When asked whether the appellant's contacting him outside the chain of command was "inappropriate," Mr. Griles did not describe the action as inappropriate; instead, he responded that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[i]t was unusual for an employee to call me like that. I have had other employees stop me and talk to me, or at meetings voice issues to me about things that may be going on that we weren't aware of. But the direct approach that she made to me in terms of this issue, particularly the detailee, was a little unusual.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board and the court have found that the agency proved this charge by preponderant evidence, we find, under the circumstances described above, that the agency did not have strong evidence when it issued its decision notice that the appellant acted improperly in bringing her concerns regarding the detail of Ms. Blyth to the attention of Mr. Griles.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Motive to Retaliate</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One of the factors to consider in ruling on whether the agency met its burden of proof is the strength of any retaliatory motive on the part of the officials who were involved in the decision in question. <span class="Italic">See Carr</span>, 185 F.3d at 1323-24. Because direct evidence of a retaliatory motive is rare, petitioners may rely on circumstantial evidence giving rise to an inference of impermissible intent. <span class="Italic">See Fellhoelter v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 568 F.3d 965, 971 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 327 (relying on circumstantial evidence to find a strong motive to retaliate). A proposing official's strong motive to retaliate may be imputed to a deciding official. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 610, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-20 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have found that the appellant made protected disclosures of substantial and specific dangers to public health or safety that are reflected in the December 2, 2003 Washington Post article in which she indicated that traffic accidents had increased on the BW Parkway, which often had two officers on patrol instead of the recommended four, and that the diversion of USPP patrol officers from national parks resulted in an increase in drug dealing in smaller national parks. In addition, the appellant made a protected disclosure in her December 2, 2003 e-mail to Ms. Weatherly concerning the number of officers patrolling the GW Parkway, the consequent decision not to arrest suspected drunk drivers, and the resulting jeopardy to parkway travelers. Underlying these disclosures were the appellant's statements indicating that the substantial and specific dangers existed because the USPP did not have sufficient staffing or funding. In fact, the court has already held that one of the agency's charges could not be sustained because it was grounded in protected whistleblowing activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that there is ample evidence in the record suggesting that the acting officials were motivated to place the appellant on administrative leave and remove her in reprisal for her protected disclosures. First, we note that the agency placed great importance on its relationship with the House of Representatives Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, and more specifically with Ms. Weatherly, a staff member for that subcommittee. Mr. Murphy testified during his interview with Mr. Hoffman that when the appellant "first came on board I said that <span class="Italic">Debbie Weatherly was a person that she needed to talk to and to get to know</span> and she should make contact and that I would make sure that she got to do that. <span class="Italic">And I said she's a very important person in Congress</span>."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Weatherly testified that she was concerned that the appellant was communicating to Congress, in the next to last paragraph of her December 2, 2003 e-mail, that she perceived there to be a crisis that might result in loss of life or destruction of a monument because several years earlier, before the appellant came to the USPP, there was gross fiscal and day-to-day mismanagement at the USPP to the degree that they were on the borderline of being anti-deficient, a very serious offense. She testified that Congress had been very generous to the USPP over the last 8 years, giving them larger increases than the National Park units as a whole. She further testified that after the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) made its findings and recommendations, the committee took the position that until the fiscal and management problems were under control, the USPP budget would only be adequate but not cut, and Congress would not look at their day-to-day needs. Ms. Weatherly testified that she was "irritated to the extent that I felt like there should have been a lot more progress, particularly on the most important, most serious recommendations of NAPA...." She testified that the appropriations committee was hoping for more progress in implementing NAPA's recommendations before additional funds would be allocated for the USPP. She testified that NAPA felt that the USPP officers were performing duties that were not core to their mission, and that that was directly related to how the committee might view additional appropriations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Weatherly testified that she and Mr. Murphy talked about the appellant's comments in the press and that she could not say whether that was at her initiative or Mr. Murphy's, but that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">[t]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic">he committee is always concerned when it's represented in the media by anyone where the inference [is that]</span> <span class="Italic"> Congress isn't doing its job properly, not supplying enough money</span>, and it's the feeling of the--the members that we have done more than an adequately [sic] job, given the current circumstances, with the Park Police.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(emphasis added). In addition, the transcript reflects the following testimony from Ms. Weatherly:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">MR. HARRISON: Well, I take it from your prior testimony that if Ms. Chambers said to the Washington Post that she needed X amount of money for protecting the parks or a monument, that other than what you've already explained, which you were hoping for implementation of NAPA before more money was requested, you weren't necessarily taking a position on the--the substance of her comment that, you know, here's how much money we need to do this job.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">MS. WEATHERLY: It was an inappropriate forum.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">MR. HARRISON: I don't understand your answer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">MS. WEATHERLY: That's not the proper forum to go through--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">MR. HARRISON: --to--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">MS. WEATHERLY: We have hearings where people come and testify. You can submit testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">MR. HARRISON: Okay. And Ms. Chambers could testify to your committee on this matter?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">MS. WEATHERLY: We have had the Park Police chief on occasion in the past over the years, rarely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">MR. HARRISON: Okay. But it's not prohibited?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">MS. WEATHERLY: It's not prohibited.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">MR. HARRISON: Okay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">So, did you think it violated some rule for Ms. Chambers to talk to the press about these matters, what she felt was needed?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_3630"></span>Do you know of any rule that was violated?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">MS. WEATHERLY: I don't know of any--I mean I don't--can't speak for the executive branch.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">MR. HARRISON: Okay. It didn't violate any rule of Congress, I take it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">MS. WEATHERLY: No.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">MR. HARRISON: Okay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">MS. WEATHERLY: Obviously.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">MR. HARRISON: <span class="Italic">So, what you're saying is you would have preferred that the communication come to your committee rather than going through the media?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">MS. WEATHERLY: <span class="Italic">Absolutely</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Weatherly expressed her concerns regarding the appellant's actions to the agency. One day before Mr. Murphy placed the appellant on administrative leave, Ms. Weatherly sent Mr. Murphy a December 4, 2003 e-mail indicating that, "<span class="Italic">in light of the inaccurate news reports this week</span>," she wanted to remind Mr. Murphy about their conversation several weeks ago regarding her November 3, 2003 telephone conversation with the appellant, which related to the events underlying charge one that was brought by the agency, Weatherly wanted to work with him to "<span class="Italic">correct this situation as soon as possible</span>," and hoped the information she provided him "will be helpful." According to Mr. Murphy, her reference to inaccurate news reports referred to the December 2, 2003 Washington Post article and various interviews on television. Mr. Murphy described Ms. Weatherly's December 4, 2003 e-mail as expressing concern that the USPP had been asking for additional funding when Congress had been quite generous, and Ms. Weatherly did not understand why they were again being asked for additional funding and "was extremely concerned about that and expressed her, her angst over that." According to Mr. Murphy, Ms. Weatherly asked him in a December 3, 2003 telephone call, "<span class="Italic">what's going on with the chief, why is she saying those things in the media, they're just not true. Congress has been very generous to the Park Police. I don't understand why she feels that way</span>." (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's placement on administrative leave, Mr. Murphy testified that his concern was that she was</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">sending a message that others were reading, particularly Congress, who felt that they had been quite generous and supportive of the United States Park Police, and these kinds of statements, rather than helping a particular agency or division or office get additional funding, often have the opposite effect, and that's why communicating the right message and the way you communicate it is so important, and that was the motivation here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">He also testified at the hearing, when asked why he believed placing the appellant on administrative leave was proper, that "some of the things that were being communicat[ed] and represent[ed] were actually having a negative impact on our ability...to effectively negotiate our budget and complete the budget process for the National Park Service." When asked whether he was concerned about the relationship between the agency and Ms. Weatherly, Mr. Murphy testified, "Yes, very--very much so," and explained that his concern was that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">this is the senior staffer for the appropriations committee for the Department of Interior that oversees our--our budget, and when that staff person has a lack of trust and doesn't believe that the department is willing to follow its instructions or we don't have the ability to supervise our--our personnel to comply with congressional directives, that's often reflected negatively in the budgeting process for the National Park Service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Murphy testified that after he called Ms. Weatherly following Ms. Weatherly's call to Ms. Mainella and Mr. Schaefer in connection with the events surrounding charge one, Ms. Weatherly "felt that it was totally inappropriate and she was kind of ranting, as she has a way of doing, that this was inappropriate and she couldn't understand why we couldn't control our senior staff and that this was not a good thing to have happen."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Hoffman testified that it was important to him to determine whether the appellant's conversation with Ms. Weatherly on November 3, 2003, caused Ms. Weatherly "great anxiety." He determined that Ms. Weatherly "<span class="Italic">was very upset by [that]</span> <span class="Italic"> conversation</span>." (emphasis added). When asked, during the hearing, if he was motivated to remove the appellant because she "dared to criticize the Department or the administration," Mr. Hoffman testified that, "[W]ell, I don't know that I would put it that way." He testified that the Washington Post article wherein the appellant "said that she needed a force of 1,400 officers in order to properly protect all of the areas she's responsible for was the exact opposite of the Department and the National Park Service policies that had been communicated to her on numerous occasions," and that "[w]hat it said to me was that she was not capable of communicating Department policy or adhering to Department policy when she communicated the exact opposite message in the media." Mr. Hoffman testified that, with respect to the appellant's statements to the Washington Post reporter, "I would expect her to communicate the policies and positions of the Department of the Interior and not her own personal policies and positions." Thus, it appears that Ms. Weatherly believed that the appellant's disclosures to the Washington Post were made in an "inappropriate" forum and caused her and the committee "concern[]" because the appellant had been inferring that Congress wasn't "doing its job properly," and that Ms. Weatherly conveyed those concerns back to the appellant's superiors at the agency, who ultimately shared those beliefs and acted to allay these concerns and protect the agency's budget by placing the appellant on administrative leave and removing her, thereby demonstrating that it could "control [its] senior staff."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The timing of the appellant's placement on administrative leave and removal, shortly after the Washington Post published its December 2, 2003 article and the appellant sent her December 2, 2003 e-mail to Ms. Weatherly, also suggests that the agency was motivated to retaliate against her based on those disclosures. Mr. Murphy testified that after he read the Washington Post article by noon on December 2, he called Steve Krutz from human resources to his office prior to noon or "thereabouts" and directed Mr. Krutz to draft a disciplinary document that was "so pressing" for Mr. Murphy that Mr. Krutz stayed until 8 <span class="small">P.M</span>. that very day to work on it. Mr. Murphy testified that some of his concerns about the appellant dated to August and September 2003, but he did not initiate disciplinary action against her until December 2, 2003, after the publication of the Washington Post article. Mr. Murphy testified that he decided to place the appellant on administrative leave effective December 5, 2003, after his telephone conversation with Ms. Weatherly on December 4, 2003.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the conduct alleged by the agency in charge six and in specification one of charge five occurred prior to August 25, 2003, when Ms. Blyth's detail was scheduled to begin. The conduct at issue in the second specification of charge five occurred around June 16, 2003, when Mr. Murphy issued his memoranda to the deputy chiefs instructing them to undergo evaluations. Finally, the conduct at issue in the third specification of charge five is said to have occurred sometime during the period from July through September 2003. Thus, Mr. Murphy placed the appellant on administrative leave on December 5, 2003, and proposed her removal on December 17, 2003, approximately 6 months after the events underlying the earliest of the sustained charges and 3 months after the latest incident underlying these charges. There is no indication that Mr. Murphy or anyone in the agency had been planning any discipline against the appellant based on any of the conduct underlying charge five or charge six before she made her protected disclosures. (testimony of Mr. Murphy that before the publication of the Washington Post article he had planned to discipline the appellant in connection with charge one, a charge that was ultimately not sustained).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record includes evidence that the actions that formed the basis of charge six, i.e., the appellant's having communicated with Mr. Griles concerning Ms. Blyth's scheduled detail, caused Mr. Murphy to be quite angry. On August 25, 2003, Mr. Murphy sent the appellant an e-mail message in which he described her communication with Mr. Griles as unacceptable and inappropriate, accused her of insubordination, and stated that obtaining Mr. Griles's "okay in the absence of [his] input only [made] her insubordination all the more egregious." This message appears to have been sent prior to the meeting at which Mr. Griles approved the "resolution...that satisfied the needs of the agency...." (Mr. Murphy's reference in his e-mail message to the appellant to his plan to give Mr. Griles "a thorough briefing on this issue"). Nevertheless, nothing in the record indicates that Mr. Murphy took any further action related to this matter until after the Washington Post article was published. Moreover, we see no evidence that Mr. Murphy took any action with respect to the other matters at issue here until after that article was published or that he even expressed any anger regarding the alleged actions underlying the other charges prior to that publication.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Any argument that Mr. Murphy and Mr. Hoffman were not implicated in or harmed by the appellant's protected disclosures, or did not have a personal motive to retaliate, ignores the fact that Mr. Murphy was the National Park Service Deputy Director directly responsible for the Park Police, and Mr. Hoffman was a high-level political appointee in the Department of the Interior. The appellant's disclosures clearly reflected on both of them as representatives of the general institutional interests of the agency by addressing the inability of the USPP to effectively perform its mission to protect the public and the failure of the administration to seek sufficient funding for it to do so. <span class="Italic">See Carr</span>, 185 F.3d at 1322-23 (finding motive to retaliate based on criticisms of the management of the office for which the acting official had responsibility). In addition, as set forth above, the appellant's disclosures appeared to indirectly pose a threat to the funding for the USPP and the National Park Service, an issue that we find caused concern for Mr. Murphy and Mr. Hoffman.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Treatment of Similarly-Situated Non-Whistleblowers</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3631"></span>The agency has not presented evidence showing that it took similar actions against employees who were not whistleblowers but who were otherwise similarly situated to the appellant. Under these circumstances, the agency's failure to do so supports a finding that the agency failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same actions against the appellant in the absence of her protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">See Brewer v. Department of the Interior</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 363, 371 (1997); <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 327-28; <span class="Italic">see also Fulton</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 79, &#x00B6; 9 (quoting a statement by Sen. Levin from the Congressional Record to the effect that the heightened "clear and convincing evidence" burden of proof on the agency under the WPA recognizes that, when it comes to proving the basis for the agency's decision, the agency "controls most of the cards," including records that could document whether similar personnel actions have been taken in other cases).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we find that the agency's evidence in support of its actions was not strong at the time it took the actions,[14] the record demonstrates that the acting officials had a significant motive to retaliate against the appellant, and the agency did not show that it took similar actions against similarly-situated non-whistleblowers. We therefore find that the agency has not met its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that it would have placed the appellant on administrative leave and removed her in the absence of her protected disclosures. In fact, we are simply not left with a "firm and definite conviction" that the agency would have taken any action based on the sustained charges in the absence of her protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">Cf. Miller</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 610, &#x00B6; 23 (evidence in support of taking some disciplinary action was far outweighed by the strong motive to retaliate by agency officials who were involved in the disciplinary actions and the lack of evidence showing that the agency took similar actions against otherwise similarly-situated non-whistleblowers).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[14]&#x2003;We have relied, in assessing this factor, on some evidence that was not actually before the agency when it took its actions, but that we find the agency had prior reason to know if it had investigated the charges sufficiently. <span class="Italic">See infra</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 30, 32-35, 49-52, 54; <span class="Italic">Carr</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 335. We find that even in the absence of our consideration of this evidence, however, we would reach the same conclusion, i.e., that the agency's evidence in support of its actions was not strong at the time it took those actions, and that in light of this factor and the other relevant factors, the agency otherwise did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have placed the appellant on administrative leave and removed her, or taken any action against her at all in the absence of her protected whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Deciding official Hoffman testified that charges two, three, and five considered together ("aggregated") would warrant removal and that he would not have removed the appellant if all 3 charges were not sustained. Given that the Federal Circuit has found the conduct alleged in charge two to be protected whistleblowing activity, the undisputed record plainly establishes that the agency would not have removed the appellant in the absence of her protected whistleblowing disclosures. Moreover, for all of the reasons discussed above, especially when Hoffman's testimony is considered with the significant taint on Hoffman's removal decision because of Murphy, the weakness of the charges and timing of the removal action, as well as Murphy's and Hoffman's strong motives to retaliate for the appellant's protected whistleblowing activity, we find that the agency failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken any action against the appellant in the absence of her protected disclosures.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">CONCURRING OPINION OF BOARD MEMBER MARY M. ROSE</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I write separately to address the anomaly at the heart of this case. Again, the appellant was the Chief of the United States Park Police. Ordinarily an agency head serves at the pleasure of the President or a cabinet Secretary, and is expected to carry out the Administration's policies faithfully.[1] Here, among other things, the appellant publicly disagreed with the Administration's budgetary priorities and its plan to redirect some Park Police resources toward securing the National Capital Region from terrorist attacks. Instead of working to further the Administration's lawful and carefully-considered program for the Park Police,[2] the appellant chose to be an obstacle and to state her opposition publicly. For an agency head to behave in this way is extraordinary and, in all similar instances of which I know, is not tolerated.</p>

The decision to except a position from the competitive service on one of these grounds may be made by the President, the Office of Personnel Management, or the head of an agency, <span class="Italic">id</span>., and once made is the kind of "discretionary judgment call" that is not reviewable by the Board, <span class="Italic">Stanley v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">What makes the present case unique is that, despite the appellant's status as head of an agency, she was a tenured employee in the competitive service with the right to appeal her removal to the Board. The agency has never argued that the position of Park Police Chief was designated as confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating before the appellant was appointed to it, and the record indicates that in fact such a designation was never made. In other words, the appellant had the same rights <span class="Italic">vis-&#x00E0;-vis</span> her employment as Chief of the Park Police--including the right to appeal her removal and to claim protection from whistleblower retaliation, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513(d), 7701(c)(2)(B)--that rank and file civil servants have with respect to their employment.

<p class="Body-Text">After its 2009 <span class="Italic">Chambers</span> analysis, the Board considered the protected nature of a disclosure of potential workplace violence, <span class="Italic">Groseclose v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 111 MSPR 194, 203-04 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24-25, 2009 MSPB 66 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Department of the Interior</span>, 515 F.3d 1362, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2008), the Federal Circuit set forth three factors to be considered in determining whether the disclosure of a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety has occurred:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">One such factor is the likelihood of harm resulting from the danger. If the disclosed danger could only result in harm under speculative or improbable conditions, the disclosure should not enjoy protection. Another important factor is when the alleged harm may occur. A harm likely to occur in the immediate or near future should identify a protected disclosure much more than a harm likely to manifest only in the distant future. Both of these factors affect the specificity of the alleged danger, while the nature of the harm--the potential consequences--affects the substantiality of the danger.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's email identified a harm that he believed was likely to occur in the immediate or near future. <span class="Italic">See</span> 0524 IAF, Tab 2, Appendix at 218 (stating that one of the employees involved had "snapped"). We also find that the appellant believed that a violent workplace confrontation was relatively likely. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> (indicating that both of the employees involved were exhibiting several of the warning signs for workplace violence). Although the appellant did not specify the nature of the potential harm, we find that it is reasonable to conclude <span id="Page_3632"></span>from the appellant's email that he believed serious injuries or death could result from escalation of the ongoing workplace conflict. We note that he mentioned that one of the employees involved carried an "illegal knife." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> It may be that the appellant's belief concerning the nature and likelihood of the harm was not objectively reasonable. However, that is a question for the merits stage of this appeal. At the jurisdictional stage, applying the factors set forth by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Chambers</span>, we find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that he disclosed a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. <span class="Italic">See Johnston v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 518 F.3d 905, 909-12 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that she disclosed a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety when she expressed her concern that a change in agency staffing policy would put agency personnel and others in danger); <span class="Italic">Wojcicki v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 628, 634 (1996) (a danger may be substantial and specific even though the perceived danger was to a limited number of government personnel and not to the general public at large).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Herman v. DOJ</span>, 193 F.3d 1375, 1377-80 (Fed. Cir. 1999), confirmed the Board's view that for a complaint of a threat to public health or safety to be protected, the threat reported must be substantial, more than an expression of an unlikely contingent danger:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In September 1997, Dr. Herman was laterally reassigned from the position of Chief Clinical Psychologist, GM-13, at the Federal Prison Camp, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, to that of Staff Clinical Psychologist, GM-13, at the Federal Correctional Complex, Coleman, Florida. Dr. Herman filed a complaint about his reassignment with the United States Office of Special Counsel ("OSC"). The OSC terminated its investigation without taking corrective action. Dr. Herman timely appealed to the MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the MSPB, Dr. Herman alleged that his reassignment to a new facility was a "prohibited personnel action" which was taken in retaliation for two separate whistleblowing disclosures. Dr. Herman contended that the first disclosure was a memorandum given in July 1997 to the associate warden at the prison camp urging the warden to either formalize an agreement with the Base hospital for use of its facilities in the event there is a suicidal inmate or create a suicide watch room at the prison camp. Before the Board, Dr. Herman asserted that the memorandum indicated that failure to have a formal written agreement with the hospital, or have a suicide watch room at the camp itself, potentially posed a substantial and specific danger to the public health and safety within the meaning of the WPA and violated the U.S. Department of Justice/Federal Bureau of Prisons Suicide Prevention Program ("SPP") Directive P.S. 5324.03.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Herman contended that the second disclosure was a statement he made in June 1997, by telephone to the national Employee Assistance Program ("EAP") Coordinator in Washington, DC, and in writing to the associate warden that EAP Directives requiring confidentiality of counseling information may have been violated when his department's telephone log was copied during an investigation of his conduct by prison officials. The EAP provision, Directive P.S. 3792, states that the "confidential nature of EAP <span class="Italic">counseling information</span> of all employees referred for assistance shall be preserved with the same enhanced level of confidentiality as counseling records of employees with alcohol and drug abuse problems." (emphasis added). Dr. Herman contended that the copying of the telephone log during an investigation of Dr. Herman's alleged unauthorized use of the telephone could have been a violation of Directive P.S. 3792 and of other federal laws and regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order for the Board to have jurisdiction over an IRA appeal under the WPA, one of the things that a petitioner must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, is that he engaged in whistleblower activity by making a disclosure protected under the WPA, i.e., he disclosed information that he <span class="Italic">reasonably believed</span> evidenced "a violation of law, rule, or regulation," 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A)(i), or "gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety," 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A)(ii). <span class="Italic">Willis v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 141 F.3d 1139, 1142-43 (Fed. Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the memorandum provided to the associate warden, Dr. Herman noted that the camp does not have a suicide watch room but does have an informal agreement with the Base hospital to utilize its facilities in the event the camp has a suicidal inmate. The memorandum goes on to state that to be "in complete compliance with the suicide watch room requirements," the camp should have "a formal written agreement with the hospital or look at making a new suicide watch room at the camp."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Herman contends, on appeal, that a reasonable interpretation of the memorandum was to report a substantial and specific danger to that portion of the inmate population that was potentially suicidal, if the hospital's facilities were not available when needed due to, what he termed, "the vagaries of the informal agreement." Specifically, Dr. Herman contends that, given his position as Program Coordinator of the SPP, responsible for the day-to-day supervision of the program, he reasonably believed that he disclosed a situation that posed a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety. Second, he contends that the memo reported a violation of the Directive pertaining to the SPP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We must disagree. The legislative history of the initial whistleblower provisions, originally passed as part of the Civil Service Reform Act ("CSRA"), Pub. L. No. 95-454 (Oct. 13, 1978), now codified in various portions of Title 5 of the United States Code, indicates that the Act was not intended to apply to disclosure of trivial or <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> matters. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 USCCAN 2723, 2730 (indicating that the Act is needed as a means to protect, for example, the "pentagon employee who discloses billions of dollars in cost overruns, the GSA employee who discloses widespread fraud, and the nuclear engineer who questions the safety of certain nuclear plants"). The plain language of the statute requires that the disclosure relate to a "substantial and specific danger to public health or safety." The legislative history explains that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the Committee intends that only disclosures of <span class="Italic">public health or safety</span> <span class="Italic">dangers</span> which are both <span class="Italic">substantial and specific</span> are to be protected. Thus, for example, general criticisms by an employee of the Environmental Protection Agency that the agency is not doing enough to protect the environment would not be protected under this subsection. However, an allegation by a nuclear regulatory commission engineer that the cooling system of a nuclear reactor is inadequate would fall within the whistle blower protections.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 USCCAN 2723, 2730 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that Dr. Herman's memorandum, discussing the absence of a formal agreement between the hospital and the prison camp, did not disclose a "substantial and specific danger to public safety" that, according to legislative intent, warrants protection under the WPA. The Board noted that the prison camp does have a designated suicide prevention room which is located at the Base hospital and that the room was accessible to the prison pursuant to an informal agreement with the Base hospital. The Board further noted that Dr. Herman did not challenge the adequacy of the arrangements at the room itself or take issue with the substance of the agreement with the hospital. He simply took issue with the informal nature of the agreement. The AJ also noted that Dr. Herman's own words, speculating that there may be a danger "if someone 'dropped the ball' because of the vagaries of an informal agreement," demonstrate that his concern about the danger was neither substantial nor specific. Thus, Dr. Herman has failed to allege facts to demonstrate a reasonable belief that the location of the suicide watch room or the informal agreement between the hospital and the prison camp presents a "substantial and specific danger" that, according to legislative intent, warrants protection under the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, at the time Dr. Herman made his statement about the suicide watch room, the prison camp had not placed an inmate on suicide watch in at least three years. Dr. Herman has failed to identify any prison inmates, or any other members of the public, needing access to a suicide watch room, or even that there is a specific and substantial likelihood that there will be individuals in the future needing access to the suicide watch room.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with the Board's conclusion that a reasonable person would not believe that the situation violated the SPP Directive. According to Dr. Herman, the SPP Directive requires that the institution have a designated suicide prevention room for inmates who are placed on suicide watch. However, the prison camp did have a designated suicide prevention room, namely, the room that is located at the Base hospital, and that is available to the prison camp pursuant to an informal agreement with the Base hospital. There is nothing in the Directive that prohibits the prison camp's informal arrangement for a nearby, but off-site, suicide watch room. Indeed, the Board found that the Directive even contemplates the possibility that the room will be located off-site. The Board noted that the Directive states that while the institution's designated suicide prevention room is <span class="Italic">ordinarily</span> located in the health services area, the Directive expressly provides that the suicide watch room may be placed in a "different area," given the unique features of some institutions. Thus, Dr. Herman has failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish that a reasonable person would conclude that the memorandum disclosed any violation of the SPP Directive. Accordingly, we agree with the AJ that Dr. Herman has failed to carry his burden of proof by preponderant evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Arizmendi v. DHS,</span> SF-1221-14-0576-W-1 (NP 4/21/2015) (exposure to paint fumes at work: "Here, however, the appellant has at best identified a potential future danger to public health and safety that has not been shown to be substantial and that occurs only occasionally, making the risk of exposure to the alleged danger relatively unlikely.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Again, in <span class="Italic">Auston v. MSPB</span>, 371 Fed. Appx. 96, 100-02 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP), the Board's reviewing court emphasized the necessity of specific disclosures relating to health and safety if those disclosures are to receive WPA protection:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found that it lacked jurisdiction over the disclosures Mr. Auston raised before the OSC, namely his 2005 disclosure of possible <span id="Page_3633"></span>noncompliance with Agency standards and the threat of unsafe conditions due to inadequate staffing in the SPD, for an alternative reason. Specifically, the Board found that Mr. Auston did not "identify a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety" and thus had not made a non-frivolous allegation that these disclosures were protected under the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Mr. Auston does not dispute this holding, the Agency, as Intervenor, suggests that remand on the issue may be in order because the Board did not discuss our recent decision in <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Department of the Interior,</span> 515 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2008), where we identified factors relevant to determining whether a disclosed danger is sufficiently substantial and specific to be protected under the WPA. The Agency reasons that because it is unclear whether the Board considered the <span class="Italic">Chambers</span> factors in finding that Mr. Auston failed to identify a "substantial and specific danger to public health or safety," the issue should be remanded to the Board with instructions to discuss these factors. Despite the Board's failure to explicitly refer to <span class="Italic">Chambers,</span> we conclude that the Board correctly found that Mr. Auston failed to make non-frivolous allegations that his disclosures were protected under the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPA protects an employee from an unfavorable personnel action taken because of a protected disclosure.<span class="Italic"> See Drake v. Agency for Intl Dev.</span>, 543 F.3d 1377, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2008). The WPA defines a protected disclosure as "any disclosure of information by an employee...which the employee...reasonably believes evidences (i) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or (ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8); <span class="Italic">Drake,</span> 543 F.3d at 1380 (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)). In <span class="Italic">Chambers,</span> we held that the Board erred in analyzing disclosures relating to public health or safety under the test applicable to disclosures of gross mismanagement, which is referred to as the <span class="Italic">White</span> standard.[2] <span class="Italic"> Chambers,</span> 515 F.3d at 1368-69; <span class="Italic">see Chambers v. Dep't of the Interior,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 375, 387-88 (2006) ("<span class="Italic">Chambers I</span>"), <span class="Italic">vacated in relevant part</span>, 515 F.3d 1362. We concluded that, for aspects of the disclosures that were directed to public health or safety, the Board should have determined whether the appellant disclosed information that she "reasonably believed evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public safety," rather than merely analyzing the disclosures under the standard for "gross mismanagement." <span class="Italic">Chambers,</span> 515 F.3d at 1368. We emphasized that, to be protected under the WPA, the involved danger "must be substantial and specific," as opposed to "negligible," "ill-defined," or "only potentially arising in the future...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1369. We then referred to a "variety of factors" that guide the determination of whether "a disclosed danger is sufficiently substantial and specific to warrant protection under the WPA," including the likelihood of the harm, when the alleged harm may occur, and the nature of the harm. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Under the <span class="Italic">White</span> standard, a policy constitutes "gross mismanagement" only if a conclusion that the agency erred "is not debatable among reasonable people." <span class="Italic">White v. Dep't of the Air Force,</span> 391 F.3d 1377, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Agency is therefore correct that <span class="Italic">Chambers</span> identified a number of factors relevant to whether a danger to public health or safety is sufficiently substantial and specific to be protected under the WPA. Nothing in our <span class="Italic">Chambers</span> decision, however, mandates that the Board must explicitly discuss each of these factors in determining whether a disclosure involves a "substantial and specific danger to public health or safety" under the WPA. Therefore, the Board's failure to expressly reference the <span class="Italic">Chambers</span> factors is not, in itself, erroneous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's analysis is consistent with the <span class="Italic">Chambers</span> decision, as well as the rest of our case law interpreting disclosures that involve a "substantial and specific danger to public health or safety." Applying the "substantial and specific" standard drawn from the statutory language itself and reiterated throughout our case law, including <span class="Italic">Chambers,</span> the Board found that Mr. Auston did not "identify a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety." <span class="Italic">[S]</span><span class="Italic">ee Chambers,</span> 515 F.3d at 1368-69; <span class="Italic">Herman v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 193 F.3d 1375, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Unlike the Board decision vacated in <span class="Italic">Chambers,</span> which relied exclusively on the <span class="Italic">White</span> standard--applicable only to disclosures of "gross mismanagement"--in finding that the disclosures at issue did not evidence a "substantial and specific danger to public health or safety," the Board here, though it cited to <span class="Italic">White,</span> did not apply the <span class="Italic">White</span> standard in reaching this determination. <span class="Italic">[S]</span><span class="Italic">ee also Chambers,</span> 515 F.3d at 1366; <span class="Italic">Chambers I,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. at 387-88. Rather, the Board's reasoning addresses several of the <span class="Italic">Chambers</span> factors, even though the Board did not expressly frame its analysis around them. As to when the alleged harm may occur, <span class="Italic">Chambers</span> stressed that the WPA does not protect the disclosure of a danger that is "remote" or "only potentially arising in the future." <span class="Italic">Chambers,</span> 515 F.3d at 1369; <span class="Italic">see Herman,</span> 193 F.3d at 1379. In this case, the Board reasoned that, despite Mr. Auston's submission of sterilization policies, he did not identify any policy breach or "impending breach" of a policy. With respect to the likelihood of the harm, <span class="Italic">Chambers</span> explained that a disclosure is not protected under the WPA if the disclosed danger "could only result in harm under speculative or improbable conditions...." <span class="Italic">Chambers,</span> 515 F.3d at 1369. Here, the Board objected to Mr. Auston's failure to make specific allegations that the alleged understaffing in the SPD was resulting in unhygienic equipment. The Board emphasized that Mr. Auston's "general reliance on VA 7176," which details the sterilization requirements for the Agency's hospitals, cannot cure the lack of specificity of his allegations. The Board's analysis shows that Mr. Auston's disclosure was too vague and speculative to constitute a "substantial and specific danger to public health or safety." <span class="Italic">Cf. Johnston v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 518 F.3d 905, 910 (Fed. Cir. 2008) ("[Appellant] disclosed a very specific and substantial danger."). As such, Mr. Auston failed to allege facts that, if proven, could demonstrate a reasonable belief that the alleged understaffing of his department presents a "substantial and specific danger to public health or safety."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cahill v. DHHS,</span> AT-1221-14-0906-W-1 (NP 4/1/2015) (remanded on other grounds, <span class="Italic">Cahill v.

Furthermore, although the imminence of the harm is questionable, we find that its occurrence is not merely speculative, and it goes without saying that the nature of the potential harm is serious. The Board and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have found that the mismanagement of agency initiatives designed to protect public health and safety constitutes a substantial and specific danger to the same. <span class="Italic">Chambers</span>, 602 F.3d at 1379 (a disclosure about reduced staffing levels leading to additional traffic accidents qualified as a disclosure of a danger to public safety); <span class="Italic">Aquino v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Young characterizes her complaints regarding the agency's failure to accommodate her disability as posing a danger to the "health of the Appellant," i.e., to Ms. Young herself, not a substantial danger to the health or safety of the public. For that reason, Ms. Young's "reasonable accommodation" complaints do not qualify as whistleblower disclosures falling within the Board's IRA jurisdiction. And because her complaints to her supervisors regarding the agency's failure to accommodate her disability did not constitute whistleblower disclosures, her contention that she was retaliated against for those complaints did not constitute a form of whistleblower retaliation falling within the Board's IRA jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If action is taken against an employee who is insubordinate in response to an order believed by the employee to constitute a safety threat, the Board must consider evidence bearing upon how the agency evaluated the employee's reports of the safety hazard and when and how the agency advised the employee of the agency's evaluation of the reported hazard. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Larson v.
