<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-273"><span class="space">a.</span> Related EEO Violation; Prohibited Personnel Practice Allegation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bodus v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 82 MSPR 508, 514-17 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-17 (1999), decided that an appellant may not tack onto a USERRA claim a related EEO claim, that is, the appellant may not bring a claim only under USERRA and accompany that claim with an assertion of prohibited discrimination under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Rehabilitation Act, or the ADEA. The appellant who raises USERRA as an affirmative defense to an action otherwise within the Board's jurisdiction may, however, assert an EEO claim as an affirmative defense:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The language of USERRA limits the Board's authority in pure USERRA cases--that is, cases involving personnel actions that are not otherwise appealable to the Board[3] --to determining whether the agency has violated USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The Merit Systems Protection Board shall adjudicate any complaint brought before the Board pursuant to, [38 USC &#x00A7; 4324(a)(2)(A) or (b)] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;If the Board determines that a Federal executive agency has not complied with the provisions of this chapter relating to the employment or reemployment of a person by the agency, the Board shall enter an order requiring the agency or employee to comply with such provisions and to compensate such person for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by such person by reason of such lack of compliance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In a case involving both an appealable action and a USERRA claim, the USERRA claim would be an affirmative defense to the action. <span class="Italic">Morgan v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 82 MSPR 1 (1999). The appellant in such a case could also present other affirmative defenses, including age discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA, 38 USC &#x00A7; 4324(c)(l)-(2). The statute defines "complaint" as a claim that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;[a] person is entitled under this chapter to employment or reemployment rights or benefits with respect to employment by an employer; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)(B)&#x2003;in the case that the employer is a Federal executive agency, such employer or the Office of Personnel Management has failed or refused, or is about to fail or refuse, to comply with the provisions of this chapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 USC &#x00A7; 4322(a). Thus, the Board may adjudicate an allegation that the agency has not complied with USERRA and, if the Board determines that the complainant has proved this allegation, order remedial action. As remedial action, the Board, may only order the agency to comply with USERRA and provide back pay. The statute does not authorize the Board to adjudicate claims outside the USERRA complaint or order remedial action on any basis other than a USERRA violation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Statements of Congressional intent in USERRA and its legislative history support this interpretation. Congress enacted USERRA in order to eliminate disadvantages in civilian employment resulting from military service, not to extend veterans greater appeal rights in general.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;The purposes of [USERRA] are--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;to encourage noncareer service in the uniformed services by eliminating or minimizing the disadvantages to civilian careers and employment which can result from such service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;to minimize the disruption to the lives of persons performing service in the uniformed services as well as to their employers, their fellow employees, and their communities, by providing for the prompt reemployment of such persons upon their completion of such service; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;to prohibit discrimination against persons because of their service in the uniformed services.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 USC &#x00A7; 4301(a). Congress did not contemplate that the Board's adjudication of a USERRA complaint would extend to non-USERRA issues. "[USERRA] would give to the [Board] the jurisdiction to decide contested cases concerning Federal sector reemployment rights." H.Rep. 65, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. 39 (1993). "The remedies available to federal employees are limited...to orders that the employer comply with the provisions of [USERRA] and to an award of lost wages and other benefits." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 40.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction to decide discrimination claims in mixed cases does not provide a basis for jurisdiction over such a claim in a pure USERRA case. The Board's jurisdiction to hear discrimination claims extends to those cases in which an employee or applicant:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited by [various statutes] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1). In a pure USERRA case like this one, the employee has not been affected by an action that may be appealed to the Board. <span class="Italic">See supra</span> at 511-13. USERRA does not permit veterans to appeal otherwise unappealable actions. Rather, USERRA permits veterans to file complaints of USERRA violations. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 38 USC &#x00A7; 4324(b) ("A person may submit a complaint against a Federal executive agency") <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(d) ("An employee against whom an action is taken under this section is entitled to appeal to the [Board] under section 7701 of this title.") Therefore, section 7702 does not provide the Board jurisdiction over a discrimination claim, and the case cannot be a mixed case. <span class="Italic">See Cruz,</span> 934 F.2d at 1245-46 (the Board has no jurisdiction over discrimination claims absent an appealable action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, pure USERRA cases are not <span class="Italic">appeals</span> of personnel actions. Rather, they are petitions for remedial action like Special Counsel petitions for corrective action under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214 and individual right of action (IRA) cases under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221. <span class="Italic">Cf. Marren v. Department of Justice,</span> 51 MSPR, 632, 638-39 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 980 F.2d 745, 1992 WL 307876 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). What distinguishes an appeal from a petition for remedial action is that in an appeal, the Board reviews a personnel action, whereas, in a petition for remedial action, the Board adjudicates a complaint. In an appeal before the Board, just like an appeal before a court of appeals, the Board reviews a decision that resulted from a due process proceeding<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b) (identifying procedural requirements for adverse action). The Board may overturn that decision if the due process proceeding was flawed in some way: if the evidence or the applicable law does not support the decision, if the agency did not follow the required procedures, or if the decision resulted from discrimination or a prohibited personnel practice. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a petition for remedial action, the Board, like a trial court, determines only whether the petitioner has proved his or her claim for relief. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(b)(4)(A) (the Board shall order corrective action if the Special Counsel demonstrates a prohibited personnel practice); 38 USC &#x00A7; 4324(c)(2) (the Board shall order corrective action if it finds an agency has violated USERRA). <span class="Italic">See also Marren,</span> 51 MSPR at 638-39. The Board does not review the merits of the agency's decision in order to ensure that the agency provided the employee due process. The Board cannot order remedial action if the petitioner fails to prove the claim giving rise to his petition, but proves that the underlying personnel action was improper on some other ground. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Marren</span>, the Board held that IRA's are not subject to the provisions of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701 or &#x00A7; 7702, and therefore the Board lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of the personnel action at issue in an IRA and lacks the authority to decide, in conjunction with an IRA, the merits of an appellant's allegation of prohibited discrimination. <span class="Italic">Marren</span>, 51 MSPR at 636-39 (1991). The Board considered the language of the statute and Congress' intent to encourage whistleblowing and protect whistleblowers from retaliation, not to extend them greater appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Similar considerations underlie our determination that the Board may not consider non-USERRA discrimination claims in pure USERRA cases, as detailed in the discussion above. In <span class="Italic">Marren</span>, the Board further found that limiting its jurisdiction under the Whistleblower Protection Act to exclude other prohibited discrimination did not adversely affect the Congressional intent to provide special protection to whistleblowers. Whistleblowers subjected to unappealable personnel actions who believe they have also been the subject of discrimination prohibited by 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) have recourse to the remedies of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 641-42. So too, veterans with pure USERRA claims who also believe that their agency committed prohibited discrimination against them on a basis other than their military service may seek redress from the EEOC.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Metzenbaum v. DOJ</span>, 240 F.3d 1068, 1070-72 (Fed. Cir. 2001), questioned the Board's refusal to consider EEO claims tacked onto USERRA cases. The issue was whether, under the Board's regulations, a USERRA case is an "appeal." If it is an appeal, EEO claims may be asserted with that appeal, as the court explained before it remanded the case for further consideration:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction is limited to that expressly granted by statute or regulation. <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240, 1243 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). The Board's jurisdiction to hear "mixed cases" is defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1), which states that the Board's jurisdiction extends to cases in which an employee or applicant for employment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;has been affected by an action which the employee or applicant <span class="Italic">may appeal</span> to the Merit Systems Protection Board, and</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1). (Emphasis added.) In such a case, "the Board shall...decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner argues that this case is a "mixed case" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702, so that the Board has jurisdiction over the disability discrimination and reprisal claims, in addition to the USERRA claim. Initially we note that we have jurisdiction over this petition for review pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9) and 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(d)(1). Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1), this court is without jurisdiction to review Board decisions concerning discrimination and reprisal on the merits under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702. <span class="Italic">Spears v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 766 F.2d 520, 522 (Fed. Cir. 1985). However, in such cases, this court has jurisdiction to review decisions on threshold issues such as the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 522; <span class="Italic">see also Ballentine v. <span id="Page_456"></span>Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 738 F.2d 1244, 1247 (Fed. Cir. 1984) ("The language of &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1)...itself strongly suggests that until the merits of a 'mixed' discrimination are reached by the MSPB, procedural or threshold matters, not related to the merits of a discrimination claim before the MSPB, may properly be appealed to this court.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the issue of Board jurisdiction, the statute clearly limits the Board's jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 7702 to cases involving an "appeal" of adverse actions<span class="Italic">. See Spears</span>, 766 F.2d at 522-23 ("Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a), the MSPB has jurisdiction over mixed cases which involve an adverse action normally appealable to the MSPB and an allegation that a basis for the action was discrimination."); <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span>, 738 F.2d at 1246 (discussing mixed cases under &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under USERRA, a veteran may file a "complaint" of a violation of the statute<span class="Italic">. See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(1) ("The Merit Systems Protection Board shall adjudicate any complaint brought before the Board pursuant to [38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324] (a)(2)(A) or (b)." (emphasis added)). The Board's reasoning in the decision under review references the Board's earlier interlocutory order in <span class="Italic">Metzenbaum I</span> and the Board's recent decision in <span class="Italic">Bodus v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 82 MSPR 508 (1999). Both in <span class="Italic">Bodus</span> and in the earlier interlocutory decision here, the Board found that a complaint filed under USERRA is not an "appeal" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In these earlier opinions, the Board reasoned that because a complaint filed under USERRA is not an "appeal" to the Board, this case is outside the scope of "mixed case" review under &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1), and that the Board lacks jurisdiction under that statute to review the discrimination and reprisal claims. The Board further noted that there are no other statutory grounds for the Board to review the discrimination and reprisal claims. Therefore, the Board here dismissed the discrimination and reprisal claims for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's reasoning in this case and in the earlier <span class="Italic">Bodus</span> case has much to recommend it. The difficulty, however, is that the Board has adopted regulations which appear to take a contrary approach. Although an earlier version of these regulations existed at the time of <span class="Italic">Bodus</span> and <span class="Italic">Metzenbaum I</span>, these regulations were, surprisingly, not cited in either of those cases, or in the government's informal brief in this case. The current regulations are 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.3(b)(1) and 1208.4. While the regulations make no mention of section 7702, section 1201.3 defines the appellate jurisdiction of the Board (as contrasted with its original jurisdiction which is defined in section 1201.2) and includes a newly added subsection (b)(1) treating complaints under USERRA as appeals and stating that they "are governed by part 1208 of this title," relating to appeals. Rules and Regulations for Merit Systems Protection Board, 65 Fed. Reg. 5409, 5409 (Feb. 4, 2000) (to be codified at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.3(b)(1)). Section 1208.4 of part 1208 of the new regulations specifically states that an "'[a]ppeal' means a request for review of an agency action...and includes a 'complaint' or 'action' as those terms are used in USERRA (38 U.S.C. 4324)..." and that a "'USERRA appeal' means an appeal filed under 38 U.S.C. 4324...." Rules and Regulations for Merit Systems Protection Board, 65 Fed. Reg. 5410, 5412 (Feb. 4, 2000) (to be codified at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1208.4). These regulations make clear that placing USERRA claims within the Board's appellate jurisdiction was not inadvertent. Indeed, under an earlier regulation in effect between December 22, 1997 and February 4, 2000, the Board also considered USERRA complaints to be appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances we believe a remand to the Board is required so that it may reconsider its decision in this case in light of the Board's own regulations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Jolley v. DHUD</span>, 299 Fed. Appx. 969 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP) (USERRA case noting but not commenting upon the <span class="Italic">Metzenbaum</span> result).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following remand, the Board reaffirmed its earlier decision that there was no jurisdiction over EEO or reprisal claims tacked onto a "pure" USERRA claim, <span class="Italic">Metzenbaum v. DOJ</span>, 89 MSPR 285, 288-92 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-16 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The USERRA statute was enacted by Congress in 1994 to eliminate disadvantages in civilian employment resulting from military service. We begin by examining its language. <span class="Italic">See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 842, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed.2d 694 (1984). As set forth at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(a), the statute's stated purposes were:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;to encourage noncareer service in the uniformed services by eliminating or minimizing the disadvantages to civilian careers and employment which can result from such service;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;to minimize the disruption to the lives of persons performing service in the uniformed services as well as to their employers, their fellow employees, and their communities, by providing for the prompt reemployment of such persons upon their completion of such service; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;to prohibit discrimination against persons because of their service in the uniformed services.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress contemplated that the Board's adjudication of a USERRA complaint would extend only to USERRA issues. "[USERRA] would give to the [Board] the jurisdiction to decide contested cases concerning Federal sector reemployment rights." H.R. Rep. No. 65, 103rd Cong., 1st Sess. 39 (1993). "The remedies available to federal employees are limited.... to orders that the employer comply with the provisions of [USERRA] and to an award of lost wages and other benefits." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 40.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The language of the statute, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(1)-(2), provides for the Board's authority in pure USERRA cases which, like the one here under review, involve personnel actions that are not otherwise appealable to the Board, to determine whether the agency has violated USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The Merit Systems Protection Board shall adjudicate any complaint brought before the Board pursuant to [38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(a)(2)(A) or (b)] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;If the Board determines that a Federal executive agency or the Office of Personnel Management has not complied with the provisions of this chapter relating to the employment or reemployment of a person by the agency, the Board shall enter an order requiring the agency or the Office to comply with such provisions and to compensate such person for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by such person by reason of such lack of compliance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To effectuate these purposes, however, including the Board's responsibilities under the law, Congress notably did not provide for application of the Board's appellate procedures, set forth at 5 U.S.C. Chapter 77. <span class="Italic">Compare, e.g.,</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d), providing that employees against whom adverse actions are taken can appeal to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701; 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(e), providing that employees who have been reduced in grade or removed for performance-based reasons under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 43 can appeal to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701. Rather, the statute specifically provided that the Board could prescribe regulations to carry out its activities, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4331(b)(2)(B), pursuant to Congress' broad authorization of the Board to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary for the performance of its functions, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(h).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In so doing, the Board propounded regulations to deal with the special requirements for these kinds of cases, placing them in a separate part of the, regulations from those at 5 C.F.R. Part 1201, which set forth the Board's general "Practices and Procedures." Much as it did with whistleblower appeals, 5 C.F.R. Part 1209, the Board, effective February 4, 2000, implemented interim regulations which cover Practices and Procedures for Appeals Under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act. 5 C.F.R. Part 1208. Those procedures are distinct from those which derive from 5 U.S.C. Chapter 77 in several important respects. For example, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.24(d) provides that, in cases that are appealable to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701, an appellant has a statutory right to a hearing. The Board's USERRA regulations, however, provide only that an appellant can request a hearing which the AJ may provide "once the Board's jurisdiction over the appeal is established." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.13(b). In addition, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(1) and (2) provide that, except for those filed under USERRA, appeals must be filed within 30 days of the effective date of the action being appealed. Because USERRA contains no statutory time limit for filing a complaint, the Board did not, in the USERRA regulations, provide a time limit for filing a USERRA appeal, determining that to do so would be inconsistent with Congress' intent in enacting USERRA. 65 Fed. Reg. 5411 (Supplementary Information) (Feb. 4, 2000); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.12. Moreover, the Board's general "Practices and Procedures," set forth at 5 C.F.R. Part 1201, include, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, Subpart E, Procedures for Cases Involving Allegations of Discrimination, but the USERRA regulations that specifically reference those subparts of 5 C.F.R. Part 1201 that apply to appeals arising under USERRA include no mention of Subpart E<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at &#x00A7; 1208.3. The Board issued the interim regulation at &#x00A7; 1208.3 after its decision in <span class="Italic">Bodus</span>, which held that the Board lacked authority over discrimination issues covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702 in pure USERRA appeals. <span class="Italic">Bodus</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 508 &#x00B6; 14. This indicates the Board's intention that other claims of discrimination, apart from the one giving rise to the USERRA appeal, not be heard in the adjudication of those appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other parts of the Board's current USERRA regulations are in accord, making it clear that "appeal," as used in those regulations, includes a "complaint" or "action" as those terms are used in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.4(a). The Board's statement that "appeal" is inclusive in this manner indicates an effort on its part to achieve consistency in describing matters that the Board is authorized to review. It does not purport to suggest that, because USERRA complaints are "appeals," they are, by definition, appealable to the Board pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701 and, therefore, subject to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, appeals or complaints under USERRA, like appeals or complaints filed under the individual right of action (IRA) provisions of the Whistleblower Protection Act, 5 C.F.R. Part 1209, differ from appeals that otherwise fall under the Board's appellate jurisdiction. That is so because <span id="Page_457"></span>the person filing the appeal has alleged that, based on his status, an agency has violated a specific law designed to protect him, and not that he was the subject of a particular action. The Board has held that its authority with regard to IRA appellants does not extend beyond whistleblower issues, does not allow for a decision on the merits of the underlying personnel action except to the extent necessary to address the appellant's whistleblower claims, and does not include a review of other claims of prohibited discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Marren v. Department of Justice</span>, 51 MSPR 632, 637-40 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 980 F.2d 745 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). Similarly, the Board has held, and we reaffirm today, that its authority with regard to USERRA complaints or appeals does not extend beyond the complained-of discrimination because of military status, does not allow for a decision on the merits of the underlying matter except to the extent necessary to address the appellant's military status discrimination claims, and thus does not include a review of other claims of prohibited discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Metzenbaum</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 700 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-6; Bodus, 82 M.S.P.R. 508 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-17; <span class="Italic">see also Fahrenbacher v. Department of the Navy</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 500 &#x00B6; 20 (2000), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> sub nom. <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009 (Fed. Cir. 2001). This is so regardless of whether the Board refers to such claims in its regulations as appeals or complaints. The terminology used simply does not, nor can it, render these matters subject to the statutory provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701 and 7702 when the USERRA statute itself does not so indicate. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Department of Justice</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 59, 67 (1996) (provisions of statute will prevail in any case where there is a conflict between a statute and a regulation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, having reconsidered our decision in this case in light of our regulations, we find that our decision was correct, and that the Board lacks jurisdiction to review the appellant's allegations of discrimination and reprisal raised in connection with this pure USERRA case.</p>
