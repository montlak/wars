<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-377"><span class="space">b.</span> Reasonableness of Time</h5>
<p class="noindent">FLRA became involved in the details of a fee petition in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force Hq., 832d Combat Support Group, DPCE, Luke AFB and AFGE Local 1547</span>, 32 FLRA 1084, 1099-1101 (1988), evaluating rates and hours:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court described how a reasonable attorney fee award should be determined in <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424 (1983)....&#8197;<span class="Italic">Hensley</span> involved a request for attorney fees under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1988. However, the Court stated that "[t]he standards set forth in this opinion are generally applicable in all cases in which Congress has authorized an award of fees to a 'prevailing party.'...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court stated in <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> that the starting point for an attorney fee award is the "number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate."...&#8197;This calculation, according to the Court, provides "an objective basis on which to make an initial estimate of the value of a lawyer's services." Thus, an appropriate attorney fee award requires a determination of whether the hours worked were reasonably expended and whether the Applicant's request for an award at a particular hourly rate is reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The approach described by the Supreme Court for determining the amount of a reasonable attorney fee award frequently is designated as the "lodestar" method....&#8197;Once the lodestar is established, enhancements to that figure, such as the multiplier requested by the Applicant in this case, may be considered.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, the Supreme Court noted the responsibilities of the applicant and the district court in litigation to determine the attorney fee award. According to the Court, the applicant "bears the burden of establishing entitlement to an award and documenting the appropriate hours expended and hourly rates."...&#8197;In addition, the Court stated that it is "important" that the district court provide "a concise but clear explanation of its reasons for the fee award."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[Under] <span class="Italic">Northcross v. Board of Education</span>, 611 F.2d 624, 636-37 (6th Cir. 1979),..."' if a district court decides to eliminate hours of service adequately documented by the attorneys, it must identify those hours and articulate its reasons for their elimination.'" <span class="Italic">Crumbaker</span> [<span class="Italic">v. MSPB</span>], 781 F.2d 191 (Fed. Cir. 1986)....&#8197;On remand the [<span class="Italic">Crumbaker</span>] court directed the Board to examine the record, take evidence if necessary, and make its determination "supported by a concise but clear <span class="Italic">explanation</span> of its reasons for any reduction of the hours awarded from those claimed."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, the Supreme Court specifically addressed the calculation of hours for which an award is requested. The Court stated that the hours expended are not necessarily those "reasonably expended."...&#8197;The Court also noted that applicants should make a good faith effort to exclude hours that are "excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary."...&#8197;If such billing judgment is not exercised, the Court instructed the courts to exclude hours not reasonably expended.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note our recent decision in <span class="Italic">Ray Brook</span>, 32 FLRA 20, 27-28, which set forth the principle that requests for attorney fees must be carefully scrutinized to determine whether and to what extend participation by outside counsel contributed to the General Counsel's efforts in prosecuting the case or merely duplicated those efforts.</p>
<p class="noindent">Moving on to specific time charges in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force Hq., 832d Combat Support Group, DPCE, Luke AFB and AFGE Local 1547</span>, 32 FLRA 1084 (1988), FLRA deemed reasonable 18.2 hours of attorney time, and 4.4 hours of paralegal time spent on preparation of ULP charges, prehearing stipulations, conferences with FLRA agents, assistance during the FLRA investigation, and participation in the FLRA hearing. The expenditure of time was detailed in an affidavit submitted to FLRA by counsel in support of his request for fees and costs. Time was approved for work by a paralegal on the posthearing brief. FLRA rejected the finding of its ALJ that counsel's brief was largely duplicative of the FLRA brief. The arguments and factual descriptions presented in the brief of counsel did not duplicate those of FLRA's General Counsel. FLRA approved 1.8 of the 2.1 hours claimed for paralegal time spent on the posthearing brief. Time was also awarded for filing an opposition to exceptions filed by the agency. Compensable were hours spent on preparing the fee petition and defending it against the agency's exceptions to a fee award by the FLRA ALJ.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 46 FLRA 1080, 1092-94 (1992), reviewed the details of a fee petition, with emphasis on analysis of how to measure the contribution of union counsel who supported FLRA's General Counsel during the presentation of a ULP case to an ALJ:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent argues that the award of attorney fees is not supported by a fully articulated, reasoned decision setting forth the specific findings justifying the determination that the time and nature of the work performed were reasonable. The Respondent states, specifically, that there was no affirmative finding by the Judge that the Union's attorneys contributed substantially to the General Counsel's efforts or that the review conducted by Krakoff of Gray's work was more than merely supervisory or ministerial in nature. The Respondent also claims that the Judge improperly awarded overhead costs to both Union attorneys even though they share the same offices and, presumably, the same costs of operation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority previously has described the requirements that are necessary for determining the reasonableness of fee awards under the Back Pay Act.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span>, 32 FLRA at 1098-1101. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Overseas Education Association and U.S. Department of Defense, Dependents Schools</span>, 39 FLRA 1261, 1267 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Overseas Education</span>). Generally speaking, fee requests must be closely examined to ensure that the number of hours expended were reasonable. Further, any reduction in fees must be clearly explained<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1267. Also, as here relevant, the Authority stated in <span class="Italic">HUD, San Antonio</span> that requests for attorney fees must be carefully scrutinized to determine whether, and to what extent, participation by outside counsel contributed to the General Counsel's efforts in prosecuting a case. For the following reasons, we conclude that the Judge properly found that the fees requested were reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, with respect to the hours of work performed by the Union's attorneys, the Judge reviewed the information provided and found that the attorneys had sufficiently detailed the dates, time spent, and the nature of the work performed in connection with the unfair labor practice proceeding. The Judge further noted that there was no factual information presented in the record to dispute the particularized time spent by each attorney. While the Respondent disagrees with these findings in its exceptions, there is no basis on which to conclude that the hours expended were unreasonable. For example, the Respondent questions Gray's request for fees in connection with nearly 2 hours spent on arranging for, preparing, and completing a motion to postpone the scheduled unfair labor practice hearing on the basis that such time was not spent on substantive legal analysis. However, the Authority's Rules and Regulations permits the filing of motions by parties, and we are unwilling to find that the time spent on that activity was not reasonably expended.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Judge found that there was no evidence to support the Respondent's claim that the legal services provided by the Union's attorneys were unnecessary or duplicative of the General Counsel's efforts in prosecuting the unfair labor practice case. The Judge relied on <span class="Italic">HUD</span>, <span class="Italic">San Antonio</span>, in which the Authority held that "the mere presence of an administrative prosecutor does not <span class="Italic">per se</span> preclude an award for contributions to the proceedings made by outside counsel." 24 FLRA at 891. The Judge also noted the Authority's finding in that case that, absent a specific showing, the Authority would not conclude that participation by outside counsel was either duplicative of or failed to make a substantial contribution to the General Counsel's efforts. The Respondent essentially argues that the posthearing brief submitted by the Union was substantially similar to that provided by the General Counsel. However, the Respondent also acknowledges that additional arguments were made by the Union. Under these circumstances, we find, in agreement with the Judge, that there is no basis on which to conclude that the participation of the Union's attorneys in this case was duplicative of, or failed to make a substantial contribution to, the General Counsel's efforts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that there is no merit to the Respondent's claim that the review of Gray's work by Krakoff should not be compensated because there was no finding that such review involved legal analysis that was more than supervisory or ministerial in nature. As we stated in <span class="Italic">Overseas Education</span>, 39 FLRA at 1268-69, the denial of fees to an attorney whose participation is limited to administrative or supervisory functions must be based on a finding that the functions performed by that attorney were either insufficiently related to the case or were duplicative of work performed by the principal counsel. In this case, there was no showing that the activities of Krakoff were unrelated to the case or were duplicative of the work performed by Gray.</p>
<p class="noindent">Also developing the issues of contribution by union counsel to a ULP prosecution, as well as the investment of time by counsel, was <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Austin Compliance Ctr. and NTEU Chap. 247</span>, 48 FLRA 1281, 1294-1301 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has previously described the requirements that are necessary for determining the reasonableness of fee awards under the Back Pay Act.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> [<span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span>, 32 FLRA] at 1098-1101<span class="Italic">. See also Overseas Education Association and U.S. Department of Defense Dependents Schools</span>, <span id="page_1650"></span>39 FLRA 1261, 1267 (1991) (<span class="Italic">OEA</span>). In general, fee requests must be closely examined to ensure that the number of hours expended were reasonable. <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, 46 FLRA at 1092. Any reduction in fees must be clearly explained. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Further, requests for attorney fees in connection with unfair labor practice cases must be carefully scrutinized to determine whether, and to what extent, participation by outside counsel contributed to the General Counsel's efforts in prosecuting a case. <span class="Italic">Id.; United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, Region VI</span>, 24 FLRA 885 (1986) (<span class="Italic">HUD</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge found that the issues raised by the Union "were <span class="Italic">all</span> raised, litigated and briefed by [the] General Counsel" and that the Union "did not prevail on any of the separate issues it raised, litigated and briefed....&#8197;Accordingly, the Judge denied fees for time spent by Wolf preparing the post-hearing brief and the exceptions to the Judge's initial decision. The Union argues that the Union significantly added to the prosecution of the case. The Respondent argues that the Union's efforts duplicated those of the General Counsel because the Union "did not prevail on any claims other than those also raised by [the] General Counsel."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Union's post-hearing brief and exceptions did not primarily duplicate, or fail to contribute to, the General Counsel's efforts in prosecuting the case. The Authority's Rules and Regulations provide that a party to an unfair labor practice case has, among other things, the right to appear at any hearing with counsel and the right to file a post-hearing brief to the Judge. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2423.16 and 2423.25. Because "these aspects of participation are entitlements under the Authority's Rules and Regulations, [the Authority] will not second-guess a party's decision to seek legal representation" for an unfair labor practice proceeding. <span class="Italic">HUD</span>, 24 FLRA at 891. "Nor will [the Authority] conclude, absent a specific showing, that participation by outside counsel was either duplicative of, or failed to make a substantial contribution to, the General Counsel's efforts in prosecuting the case<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the post-hearing brief, we find that although the Union raised some of the same successful arguments as the General Counsel, the Union's brief presented the arguments in different ways and presented additional arguments not raised by the General Counsel. In particular, only the Union analyzed the development of the "'Moonlighting Rule'" and argued that the Respondent improperly deducted wages the employee could have earned concurrently in a "moonlighting" job. Accordingly, we reject the Judge's finding, and the Respondent's assertion, that the Union did not prevail on any of the issues it raised that were different from those raised by the General Counsel. In the absence of a specific showing to the contrary by the Respondent, we conclude that the Union's brief did not primarily duplicate, or fail to contribute to, the General Counsel's efforts in prosecuting the case. <span class="Italic">See HUD. See also Luke AFB</span>, 32 FLRA at 1105 (the union's brief is not "primarily duplicative" of the General Counsel's where the union's brief raises an issue raised by the General Counsel but also raises an issue based on a theory different from that used by the General Counsel).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge also denied fees for time that the Union spent in its post-hearing brief and exceptions on the unsuccessful claims that the complaint should have been amended to allege that the Respondent was obligated to comply with the award as of April 14, 1989, and that the employee should have been compensated for adverse tax consequences. The Judge found that, pursuant to <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, "[t]hese two claims were distinct from the claims which were successful[.]" The Union argues that the Judge improperly denied fees for the two claims because the claims were not distinct in all respects from claims that were successful.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The standards in <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> are applicable to requests for attorney fees under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See Luke AFB</span>, 32 FLRA at 1100. The Supreme Court stated in <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> that a "fee award should not be reduced simply because the plaintiff failed to prevail on every contention raised in the lawsuit." <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 435 (citation omitted). The Court further stated that "[l]itigants in good faith may raise alternative legal grounds for a desired outcome, and the court's rejection of or failure to reach certain grounds is not a sufficient reason for reducing a fee<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. The Court in <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> "distinguished that situation from one where the prevailing party's different claims for relief are based on different facts and legal theories." <span class="Italic">Hanson v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 28 MSPR 176, 181 (1985) (<span class="Italic">Hanson</span>). Where the plaintiff has failed to prevail on a claim that is "distinct in all respects" from the successful claims, the hours spent on the unsuccessful claim should be excluded in considering the amount of a reasonable fee. <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 440. However, "[w]here a lawsuit consists of related claims, a plaintiff who has won substantial relief should not have [the] attorney's fee reduced simply because the district court did not adopt each contention raised<span class="Italic">." Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge and the Authority rejected the Union's claim that the complaint should have been amended to state that the Respondent was obligated to comply with the arbitration award as of April 14, 1989, rather than July 31, 1989. We find, contrary to the Judge, that this unsuccessful claim is not distinct in all respects from the successful claims. The Union's claim is based on the Respondent's failure to comply with the same arbitration award with which the General Counsel alleged, and the Authority found, the Respondent had failed to comply since July 31, 1989. The Union ultimately was successful in convincing the Judge and the Authority that the Respondent had failed to comply with the award and was unsuccessful only as to the specific date when the Respondent's failure began. As the Union's claim merely disputes the date from which to measure the Respondent's compliance with the same arbitration award, we find that the claim is related to the successful claim that the Respondent failed to comply with the award. Therefore, consistent with <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, we conclude that fees should have been allowed for time spent on this claim. <span class="Italic">See Hanson</span>, 28 MSPR at 181 (no reduction of fees for unsuccessful claims where "all claims advanced by appellant, including those upon which he did not prevail, were based on the same facts").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge rejected the Union's claim that the employee should have been compensated for adverse tax consequences, but found that the employee should receive backpay for an additional 2-week period. In 44 FLRA 1306, the Union successfully argued to the Authority that the employee should not have had his overtime and "moonlighting" earnings deducted from the backpay award and won substantial relief for the employee. We find, contrary to the Judge, that the Union's unsuccessful claim that the employee suffered adverse tax consequences due to the Respondent's willful failure to comply with the award is not distinct in all respects from the successful remedial claims for additional backpay and for overtime and "moonlighting" earnings. All of these claims arise from the Respondent's failure to comply with the award and address the losses allegedly suffered by the employee. Consistent with <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, we find that because the Union won substantial relief, it "should not have [the] attorney's fee reduced simply because the [judge] did not adopt each contention raised." <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 440.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge denied fees for time spent by Wolf: (1) preparing a letter to the Respondent demanding compliance with the award and discussing a letter drafted by the Respondent concerning the employee's reinstatement; (2) determining that the Respondent would not comply with the award; (3) researching the forum in which to appeal the Respondent's refusal to comply with the award; (4) consulting and updating the employee; (5) consulting with the supervisor and various Union representatives; and (6) studying the Judge's and the Authority's decisions. The Judge found that although some of these activities were "customary to an attorney-client relationship[,]" none of the activities contributed to [the] General Counsel's efforts in prosecuting the case."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Judge improperly denied fees for these activities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We stated above that consistent with <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, any reduction in fees must be clearly explained. The Judge's only explanation for denying fees for the above-noted activities is that the activities did not contribute to the prosecution of the General Counsel's case as required by Authority case law. We find that the Judge's explanation is conclusory. That is, the Judge has not clearly explained the reason for denying fees for these activities within the meaning of <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>. Accordingly, we will remand the case to the Judge for a clear explanation of whether, or to what extent, fees should be granted or denied for these activities. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R5-188 and U.S. Department of the Air Force, Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina</span>, 46 FLRA 458, 465-66 (1992) (the Authority remanded an attorney fee award where the award was conclusory and failed to set forth a detailed and reasoned explanation on the reasonableness of denying or awarding fees for certain activities). <span class="Italic">See also Defense</span> <span class="Italic">Mapping Agency</span>, 47 FLRA at 1197-98.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge also denied fees for time claimed by Schneider in 1990 and 1991 for consulting with Wolf because the Judge found that that activity "did not contribute to [the] General Counsel's efforts in prosecuting the case[.]" The fact that an attorney's participation in a case was limited to administrative or supervisory functions is not, by itself, a sufficient basis for denying attorney fees. <span class="Italic">OEA</span>, 39 FLRA at 1268. A denial of fees to an attorney whose participation is limited to supervisory functions should be based on a finding that the functions performed by that attorney were either insufficiently related to the case or were duplicative of work performed by the principal counsel<span class="Italic">. See OEA</span>, 39 FLRA at 1268-69. We find that the Judge's explanation is conclusory. That is, the Judge has not clearly explained the reason for denying fees for these activities within the meaning of <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>. Accordingly, we will remand the case to the Judge for a clear explanation of whether, or to what extent, fees should be granted or denied for this activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge also failed to award fees for time spent by Wolf on the following activities: (1) a phone call to one of two Union representatives on August 29, 1989; (2) a call to the employee on October 6, 1989; (3) <span id="page_1651"></span>reviewing the answer on March 3, 1990; (4) various communications with the Respondent's attorney in 1990 and 1991; (5) studying the General Counsel's and the Respondent's post-hearing briefs; (6) matters relating to the hearing on January 29 and 30, 1991; (7) telephone calls to the General Counsel on August 27, 1991, and June 22, 1992, and to the Authority on June 9, 1992; (8) reviewing the transcript prior to filing the post-hearing brief; (9) filing and reviewing motions for extensions of time to file post-hearing briefs; and (10) reviewing the transcript on October 8, 1991, and the Respondent's motion for reconsideration on June 22, 1992. The Union objects to the Judge's failure to award fees. The Judge stated that the activities for which he awarded fees were those which did not duplicate the efforts of the General Counsel. However, the Judge did not specifically state why he disallowed fees for these particular activities and it is not apparent from the record whether these activities duplicated the efforts of the General Counsel or whether the time spent on any of these activities is excessive. As we are unable to determine from the record whether fees should be granted or denied for these activities, we will remand the case to the Judge for a clear explanation of whether, or to what extent, fees should be granted or denied for these activities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge also denied fees for time spent by Wolf on January 28, 1991, "in preparing to testify as a witness" and testifying "as a witness inasmuch as he was not then acting as an attorney in the litigation of this case[.]" We find that the Judge has clearly explained the reason for denying fees for this activity within the meaning of <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>. However, because we are unable to determine from the record how much time should be deducted from January 28, 1991, for this activity, we will remand the case to the Judge to make that determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we noted previously, the Union argues that the Judge should not have denied fees for any of the activities for which fees were requested except for 20 hours relating to backpay computation. In the absence of specific exceptions by the Union, we adopt the Judge's finding that 20 of the hours requested for backpay computation should be denied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge denied fees for .4 hours spent relating to a FOIA request on February 13, 1991, and March 8, 1991, because the Judge determined that the request had "no known relevancy" to the case. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 17. In the absence of any specific explanation by the Union as to the relevancy of the FOIA request, we find that the Judge has clearly explained the reason for denying these fees within the meaning of <span class="Italic">Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union requests an additional 5 hours of fees for the time that Schneider spent preparing the opposition to the Respondent's exceptions in this case. Noting that the General Counsel filed no submissions with the Authority relating to the attorney fee award, we find that the Union has not duplicated the efforts of the General Counsel and has contributed to the case. <span class="Italic">See Luke AFB</span>, 32 FLRA at 1106 (award of fees appropriate where the applicant's brief was the only opposition to the agency's exceptions). Accordingly, we find that the request is reasonable and that Union may receive fees for that time.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA disallows time for work clearly not contemplated as within the scope of prosecution of a ULP complaint, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Austin Compliance Ctr. and NTEU Chap. 247</span>, 48 FLRA 1281, 1300 (1994), that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge further denied fees for 3.9 hours spent in relation to the Union's supplemental reply to the Respondent's opposition to the Judge's initial decision. The Judge offered no specific explanation for this deduction. However, the Authority's Rules and Regulations do not specifically provide for a supplemental reply to an opposition, and permission for supplemental submissions must be requested and granted pursuant to section 2429.26 of our Rules and Regulations. As the Union was not granted permission to file its reply and as the Authority in 44 FLRA 1306 specifically denied the Union's request that we consider its reply, we find that the fees were properly denied. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Logan v. U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 23 MSPR 345, 351 (1984) (counsel should not be compensated for preparing a motion for reconsideration by the presiding official where 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.111 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. makes no provision for such a motion).</p>
<p class="noindent">Discovery on fee issues is within the discretion of the ALJ who entertains the fee petition. If the record developed by the judge without discovery is sufficient for disposition of the fee petition, the denial of discovery is not reversible error. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 46 FLRA 1080, 1090 (1992). [Refer to Chapter 9, "<a href="0100-2023-16-374.html#sec8-374">Awards of Counsel Fees</a>," concerning fee awards in arbitration cases.]</p>
