<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-45"><span class="space">k.</span> Intolerable Working Conditions</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">"One way to overcome the presumption of voluntariness of a resignation is to show that the employee's working conditions were so difficult that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign." <span class="Italic">Glenn v. Soldiers' &#x0026; Airmen's Home</span>, 76 MSPR 572, 580 (1997). In a forced resignation case, the burden is on the appellant to show by a preponderance of evidence that the agency made conditions so unbearable for her that she was coerced into resigning. <span class="Italic">Jovanovich v. VA</span>, 3 MSPR 438, 440, 3 MSPB 510 (1980); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Glenn v. Soldiers' &#x0026; Airmen's Home</span>, 76 MSPR 572, 581 (1997) (hearing was warranted on the basis of nonfrivolous allegations that the resignation resulted from harassment, was tolerated by the agency, and of a magnitude sufficient that a reasonable person would feel compelled to resign). A resignation through settlement does not become involuntary if office conditions improve after the settlement and the appellant then changes his mind about working for the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Barker v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 34 MSPR 248, 251 (1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McKeown v. MSPB,</span> <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/20-1062.Opinion.4-16-2020_1571133.pdf">809 Fed. Appx. 953</a>, 955-56 (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP), described what is required to establish intolerable working conditions sufficient to vitiate a resignation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One way for the petitioner to rebut the presumption of voluntariness is to show that the resignation was the product of coercive acts by the agency, such as intolerable working conditions. <span class="Italic">Shoaf</span>, 260 F.3d at 1341; <span class="Italic">Staats v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 99 F.3d 1120, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 1996). But "the doctrine of coercive involuntariness is a narrow one." <span class="Italic">Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1124 (describing limited scenarios where a resignation was involuntary, like when it was "induced by a threat to take disciplinary action that the agency knows could not be substantiated" or where the agency attempts to force the employee to quit, without "any legitimate agency purpose"). We objectively consider the totality of the circumstances to determine whether "a reasonable employee confronted with the same circumstance would feel coerced into resigning." <span class="Italic">Shoaf</span>, 260 F.3d at 1342 (quoting <span class="Italic">Middleton v. Dep't of Defense</span>, 185 F.3d 1374, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 1999)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reviewing the record, we have no doubt that Mr. McKeown had a fraught working relationship with his direct supervisor and other FEMA Region IX administrators. However, a stressful working environment does not equate to coercion. <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 115 M.S.P.R. 609, 616-17 (M.S.P.B. 2011) (reasoning that a finding of coercion was not supported by an appellant's allegations of, among other things, her supervisors' "increasing demands that she perceived as trying to cause her to fail" and "groundless[ ] critic[ism]" of her work); <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dep't of Def</span>., 85 M.S.P.R. 310, 322 (M.S.P.B. 2000) ("Dissatisfaction with work assignments, a feeling of being unfairly criticized, or difficult or unpleasant working conditions are generally not so intolerable as to compel a reasonable person to resign.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Boyd v. Dept. of Labor</span>, AT-0752-12-0513-I-1 (NP 9/17/2013), summarized the elements of an involuntary resignation based on assertions of intolerable working conditions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Intolerable working conditions may render an action involuntary when the working conditions were made so difficult by the agency that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to leave the workplace, and the appellant put the agency on notice of the objectionable working conditions and requested assistance or remediation from the agency. <span class="Italic">Peoples v.

<p class="Body-Text">A reconsideration decision in <span class="Italic">Heining v. GSA</span>, 68 MSPR 513, 519-23 (1995), outlined the elements of an appeal alleging that the appellant was forced to resign because of intolerable working conditions involving inequitable treatment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is axiomatic that a resignation or retirement is presumed voluntary. <span class="Italic">See Christie v. United States,</span> 518 F.2d 584, 587, 207 Ct. Cl. 333 (1975). However, the presumption of voluntariness may be rebutted if the employee can establish that the resignation or retirement was the product of duress or coercion brought on by government action, or of misleading or deceptive information, or if the employee was mentally incompetent. <span class="Italic">See Scharf v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 710 F.2d 1572, 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The common element in all cases where the Board and the courts find an involuntary resignation or retirement is that factors have operated on the employee's decision-making processes that deprived him or her of freedom of choice. <span class="Italic">See id.; Perlman v. United States,</span> 490 F.2d 928, 933, 203 Ct. Cl. 397 (1974).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two scenarios have emerged in cases where the employee has alleged that he or she was coerced by the agency or employer into resigning or retiring. The first scenario arises when the agency or employer has proposed or threatened an adverse action against the employee and the employee resigns or retires in the face of the impending action. <span class="Italic">See Cruz v. Department of the Navy,</span> 934 F.2d 1240 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>); <span class="Italic">Christie v.

Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 50 F.3d 1005 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Navy,</span> 66 MSPR 421 (1995).[2] In both scenarios, the courts and the Board have determined the voluntariness of the resignation or retirement based on whether the totality of the circumstances supported the conclusion that the employee was effectively deprived of free choice in the matter. <span class="Italic">See Braun</span>, 50 F.3d at 1007; <span class="Italic">Scharf</span>, 710 F.2d at 1574; <span class="Italic">Christie,</span> 518 F.2d at 587; <span class="Italic">Perlman</span>, 490 F.2d at 933.

<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to involuntary resignations and retirements brought on by agency coercion or duress, the courts and the Board have followed the principles set forth in <span class="Italic">Fruhauf v. United States</span>, 111 F. Supp. 945, 951, 126 Ct. Cl. 51 (Ct. Cl. 1953), interpreting "the law of duress." The court stated that as of the date of its opinion, it had found three elements common to all situations where duress had been found to exist. These elements, easily applicable to the line of cases at that time where the employee has tendered his resignation in the face of a threatened or proposed adverse action, are the following: (1) One side involuntarily accepted the terms of another; (2) the circumstances permitted no other alternative; and (3) said circumstances were the result of coercive acts of the opposite party. <span class="Italic">See Schultz v. Department of the Navy,</span> 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Christie</span>, 518 F.2d at 587; <span class="Italic">Barthel,</span> 38 MSPR at 251 n.11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However in the case of a constructive discharge due to intolerable working conditions, while the issue of voluntariness is the same, the circumstances are different from the resignation versus adverse action scenario, and the elements set forth in <span class="Italic">Fruhauf</span> and its progeny must be tailored and/or expanded to fit the situation. <span class="Italic">Cf. Paolillo v. Dresser Industries,</span> 865 F.2d 37, 40 (2d Cir. 1989) (while the judge's charge to the jury presented the issue as a constructive discharge case because of intolerable working conditions, where he should have stated the issue as whether the retirement was voluntary in the face of time pressures by the employer, the court concluded that the charge was adequate because it adequately posed the issue of voluntariness to the jury). Specifically, in the case of constructive discharge due to intolerable working conditions, the Board has tailored these factors to answer the ultimate question of whether under all the circumstances working conditions were made so difficult by the agency that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign. <span class="Italic">See Jones,</span> 66 MSPR at 423-24.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues that the Board departed from the test to establish whether an employee has been constructively discharged because of duress. In this regard, OPM states that the appellant did not establish that the agency imposed the terms of her resignation or that she was faced with the choice between resignation or removal. However, OPM misses the point. As the court indicated in <span class="Italic">Fruhauf,</span> the law of duress broadens with time "making it virtually impossible to arrive at any clear-cut definition and...<span class="Italic">must of necessity depend upon the circumstances of each individual case</span>." <span class="Italic">Fruhauf</span>, 111 F. Supp. at 951. The Board did indeed use the standard employed by the courts to examine the surrounding circumstances to test the ability of the employee to exercise free choice, and found objectively that the reasonable employee in Ms. Heining's position would have had no choice but to resign. The fact that the first factor stated in <span class="Italic">Fruhauf</span> is inapplicable to most constructive discharge cases where there is no adverse action currently pending does not mean that the appellant was not deprived of free choice by the surrounding circumstances and has not proved coercion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently held in a very similar case that the employee had made a non-frivolous allegation that, if proven, could establish that his resignation was coerced. <span class="Italic">Braun</span>, 50 F.3d at 1008. In that case, the employee, who had an impeccable record for twelve years, received eleven disciplinary actions after being assigned to a new supervisor, and filed at least two grievances, a complaint and nine informal complaints alleging discrimination or reprisal for having filed his earlier complaints. The court vacated the Board's administrative judge's finding that the employee failed to make a non-frivolous allegation of involuntariness because at the time of his resignation the agency had not instituted an adverse action or any action that could be viewed as a threatened or attempted removal. The court held that the administrative judge should have reviewed all the circumstances of the case, including the frequency of the supervisor's actions, the employee's prior successful evaluations and his grievances as well as the possible abuse of agency procedures, to conclude that the employee had made a non-frivolous allegation of involuntariness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Braun</span>, as in this case, the <span class="Italic">Fruhauf</span> element of one side involuntarily accepting the terms of another does not apply to the circumstances of the case, and there was no agency adverse action pending in either case at the time of the employees' resignation. As in <span class="Italic">Braun</span>, Ms. Heining was an exemplary employee before she engaged in protected activity and she then became subject to agency actions such as an unsatisfactory performance rating and the denial of a promotion.[3] Like Mr. Braun, Ms. Heining filed many grievances and a complaint. All these circumstances in <span class="Italic">Heining</span> were proved after a lengthy hearing and the Board correctly affirmed the administrative judge's conclusion that Ms. Heining's resignation was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;An agency must have reasonable grounds for threatening to take disciplinary actions, and if it does not, the agency action is "purely coercive." <span class="Italic">Schultz</span>, 810 F.2d at 1136; <span class="Italic">Barthel,</span> 38 MSPR at 251. Thus, the agency's retaliatory actions in this case could be properly viewed by the administrative judge as "purely coercive."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues that the Board erroneously held that unpleasantness in general, rather than choice, is the touchstone for determining voluntariness. However, OPM misconstrues the Board's holding in this case. The Board did focus on Ms. Heining's deprivation of choice as the <span id="Page_1962"></span>touchstone of its analysis. In cases where constructive discharge based on intolerable working conditions is alleged both the courts and the Board will find the resignation involuntary only if the employee demonstrates that the employer or agency engaged in a course of action that made working conditions so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in that employee's position would have felt compelled to resign. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 48 F.3d at 1354; <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 968 F.2d at 429; <span class="Italic">Buckley</span>, 758 F.2d at 1531; <span class="Italic">Clark,</span> 665 F.2d at 1173-76; <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, 66 MSPR at 424; <span class="Italic">Taylor</span>, 61 MSPR at 193. By using the "reasonable person" test, the courts and the Board are using an objective standard. Moreover, as in the case where an employee resigns in the face of a proposed removal, the courts and the Board focus on whether the employer's or agency's actions in rendering the workplace so pervasively unpleasant and difficult deprived the employee of any other choice but to quit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not persuaded by OPM's argument that the Board erred in finding that Ms. Heining's working conditions were intolerable to her. The fallacy of OPM's argument is that it segments different facts of the case to find no evidence of intolerable working conditions instead of viewing all the facts together. The totality of the circumstances supports the Board's conclusion that the working conditions were intolerable and the resignation was involuntary. For example, OPM notes that other employees found the working environment unpleasant and did not resign,[4] that the administrative judge and the Board did not specifically connect the denial of the appellant's request for a compressed work schedule to coercion and that the Board did not clearly connect the large amounts of sick leave used by Ms. Heining with her resignation. However, the administrative judge and the Board (by adopting the initial decision) found the totality of the following facts to support the conclusion that a reasonable person in Ms. Heining's shoes would have been compelled to resign: (1) Ms. Heining was rated an exemplary employee before her whistleblowing; (2) she was denied a promotion because of her whistleblowing; (3) she was placed under the supervision of a supervisor about whom she had previously complained; (4) the six-month period that the agency allotted Ms. Heining to demonstrate that she warranted a promotion was a sham and was used to build up a case against her of unsatisfactory performance; (5) she was singled out for inequitable treatment when, unlike others, she was denied a compressed work schedule; (6) after the retaliatory course of action by the agency, and not before, the appellant took a substantial amount of sick leave and stated that her doctor advised her to seek other employment because of the stress of the job; (7) she was rated unsatisfactory in her performance in reprisal for whistleblowing; (8) she was considered a very good worker by a different supervisor before she was to be placed on a PIP, and was to be supervised during her PIP by a person who had been instrumental in the denial of her promotion and in her unsatisfactory rating; and (9) her formal complaint of whistleblowing and her many grievances were either ignored or investigated in an unfair and meaningless manner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The fact that other employees found the working conditions unpleasant supports Ms. Heining's allegation of unpleasant working conditions. However, this fact has no relevance to Ms. Heining's case of involuntary resignation. There is no evidence that others in her unit were whistleblowers who were subjected to the same retaliatory actions as Ms. Heining. Thus, other employees in her unit cannot represent the "reasonable employee" "in the same shoes" as the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, OPM contends, citing to <span class="Italic">Boze v. Branstetter,</span> 912 F.2d 801, 805 (5th Cir. 1990), that the Board's decision is a departure from the principle that a resignation is voluntary if the appellant has not pursued all statutorily prescribed avenues of redress. As previously pointed out by the Board, however, the facts of <span class="Italic">Boze</span> are distinguishable from this case. <span class="Italic">See Heining,</span> 61 MSPR at 553. In <span class="Italic">Boze</span>, the employee resigned after filing a grievance and before his employer rendered even an initial decision. <span class="Italic">Boze</span>, 912 F.2d at 803-04. He offered no proof of discrimination or of an unpleasant or difficult working environment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 805. Here, not only did Ms. Heining offer an overwhelming amount of evidence supporting an intolerable working environment, but she did not resign until she pursued many grievances and two complaints, receiving an adverse decision on her grievances in May 1990, just prior to her resignation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the agency's inequitable handling of the investigations of her complaints and grievances constituted aggravating factors contributing to the conclusion that the appellant's working conditions were intolerable. <span class="Italic">See Clark,</span> 665 F.2d at 1175-76. From that posture, a reasonable person in Ms. Heining's position would have felt locked into a position from which he or she could obtain no relief. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. A reasonable person in Ms. Heining's position would not "stand pat and fight" any longer, and we reaffirm our finding that her resignation under the circumstances was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Christie,</span> 518 F.2d at 587. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Perlman</span>, 490 F.2d at 933 (the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies has no application when the agency involved had defaulted in its obligation toward the employee).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The underlying decision before reconsideration, <span class="Italic">Heining v. GSA</span>, 61 MSPR 539, 553-54 (1994), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence of record further shows that the appellant's second-line supervisor (Mr. Creel) did not forward the complaints contained in the appellant's August 1989 memorandum to the agency's Inspector General, although agency guidelines required reporting of suspected irregularities within the agency to that official. Moreover, the evidence of record and hearing testimony indicate that the agency's investigation of the appellant's grievances relied heavily on the accounts of agency managers and did not solicit to any great extent the views of the appellant and agency employees who could support her version of events. Finally, the record shows that the appellant's usage of sick leave rose significantly in the period shortly before her resignation, apparently as a result of illnesses brought on or exacerbated by the pressures of her working environment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency correctly notes, that the appellant did not take full advantage of her appeal rights regarding her grievances and that she did not file a formal EEO complaint or a complaint with OSC until after her resignation. The agency cites <span class="Italic">Bose v. Branstetter</span>, 912 F.2d 801, 805 (5th Cir. 1990), to support its argument that the appellant was not constructively discharged because she did not pursue all available avenues of redress. The employee in that case, however, resigned only three weeks after he filed a grievance and before his employer rendered even an initial decision on the grievance; the appellant here started the grievance process in October 1989 and received a decision on nor grievances in May 1990. <span class="Italic">See Bose</span>, 912 F.2d at 603-04 The court in <span class="Italic">Bose</span>, also supported its holding in that case with the finding that not "even a modicum of evidence" suggested that the employee had been discriminated against, and the facts of that case do not show that the employee offered even meager proof of a difficult or unpleasant working environment. <span class="Italic">See Bose</span>, 912 F.2d at 803-04.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By contrast, the discussion above shows that the agency engaged in reprisal against the appellant because of her whistleblowing and that the working environment within JA-4 was generally difficult and severely unpleasant. It also shows that the appellant attempted to obtain some remedy for her problems at work but that the agency thwarted those efforts through investigations that either failed to meet its own guidelines or that were unbalanced and incomplete. The record further demonstrates that the appellant had significant health problems at the time of her resignation due in part to the stress caused by her working conditions. Given this background, we can discern no clear error in the administrative judge's finding that the appellant was constructively discharged. The sustained findings of whistleblower reprisal, coupled with the aggravating factors of the appellant's pervasively difficult, unpleasant working environment and her poor health, establish that a reasonable person in her circumstances would have felt compelled to resign. <span class="Italic">See Landgraf</span>, 968 F.2d at 429-30. Although the appellant did not pursue all potential forms of redress before resigning, we agree with the administrative judge that, given her prior experiences with the handling of her August 1989 memorandum and her grievances, it would still not have been unreasonable for her to conclude that resignation was the only realistic alternative to her intolerable working conditions. <span class="Italic">See Burke</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. at 439.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pourier v. DHHS</span>, DE-0752-13-0135-I-1 (NP 4/18/2014) ("Intolerable working conditions may render an action involuntary when the working conditions were made so difficult by the agency that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to leave the workplace, the employee put the agency on notice of the objectionable working conditions, and the employee requested assistance or remediation from the agency. <span class="Italic">Peoples v.

<p class="Body-Text">Another example of nonfrivolous allegations of harassment of sufficient intensity to require a hearing on an involuntary resignation appeal is <span class="Italic">Taylor v. EPA</span>, 61 MSPR 188, 190-93 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant resigned from her position as Environmental Engineer, GS-9, citing an "unprofessional and intolerable" work environment....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the administrative judge's acknowledgment order, the appellant again requested a hearing, and submitted a 3-page affidavit stating that agency officials intentionally pressured her to resign by, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, assigning her secretarial duties inconsistent with her professional position, criticizing her work and interpersonal skills without foundation, and impugning her veracity and credibility. The appellant further stated that she felt compelled to resign, citing her fear that the stress caused by the agency's conduct would precipitate a potentially life-threatening epileptic seizure....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1963"></span>A resignation is involuntary due to duress or coercion, where: (1) One side involuntarily accepted the terms of another; (2) circumstances permitted no other alternative; and (3) the circumstances were the result of the coercive acts of the opposite party. The Board has found that where an employee's working conditions are rendered so intolerable by alleged discrimination or harassment that she is "forced" into resignation, there has been a constructive discharge, and the employee's resignation is involuntary. The ultimate question to be decided in this regard is whether working conditions were so difficult that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Collins</span>, 55 MSPR at 188-89, the Board found that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that her resignation was coerced by the agency's discrimination and retaliation, where she did not specify the particular acts of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation directed against her, and did not explain the link between this alleged conduct and the nature and severity of her health concerns.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By contrast, the appellant in the present case alleged specific acts of discrimination and harassment on the part of agency officials, and expressly described the link between this conduct and her health concerns. In addition, the appellant filed a letter from her physician attesting to the severity of her condition. In her letter of resignation, attached with her petition for appeal, the appellant expressly stated that her working conditions were rendered intolerable by the agency's alleged course of conduct, and in her affidavit in response to the administrative judge's acknowledgment order, she described her fear that the stress and pressure caused by these practices would result in a potentially life-threatening epileptic seizure. We find that these allegations, if proven, could support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of involuntariness, and that therefore the appellant's claim of constructive discharge cannot be labeled as frivolous.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Allegations warranting a hearing were discussed in <span class="Italic">Barry v. Dept. of Interior</span>, DC-0752-14-0040-I-1 (NP 9/5/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his appeal, the appellant alleged that: (1) he is a gay man; (2) he overheard management officials making disparaging remarks about gay people and he heard managers state that the training center was "run by a [expletive]" and an "idiot"; (3) his supervisors falsely told him during a performance review that employees under his supervision had complained that he had created a hostile work environment and that, unless he voluntarily stepped down as Director, an investigation of those complaints would ensue; and (4) when he refused to step down, he was involuntarily reassigned to work under the direct supervision of one of the supervisors who provided him with the false information and was a subject of the appellant's EEO complaint. We find these allegations sufficient under the above-stated standards to satisfy the appellant's evidentiary burden and to garner him a jurisdictional hearing.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Normally, the Board lacks jurisdiction over resignations and retirements, because those acts are presumed voluntary. A petitioner can overcome the presumption of voluntariness and obtain a hearing on jurisdiction, however, by making nonfrivolous allegations that: (1) the resignation or retirement was based on threats of adverse action; (2) the resignation or retirement was based on "alleged misinformation and deception"; or (3) the resignation or retirement was coerced through "working conditions so intolerable" that the employee was forced to leave. <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The test for coercion requires the employee to show: "(1) the agency effectively imposed the terms of the employee's resignation or retirement; (2) the employee had no realistic alternative but to resign or retire; and (3) the employee's resignation or retirement was the result of improper acts by the agency." <span class="Italic">Shoaf v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Ms. Russell argues that she established the agency coerced her into resigning. We agree that Ms. Russell did not make non-frivolous allegations establishing coercion, and therefore was not entitled to a jurisdictional hearing. Ms. Russell focuses mainly on the third prong of the involuntariness test (improper agency acts)--alleging that Ms. McCarty singled her out to create a developmental plan, called her illiterate, and discriminated against her based on race, selecting another individual for charge nurse. Further, Ms. Russell complains that a more senior manager denied her LWOP request pending mediation. Ms. Russell does not attempt to show, however, that the agency imposed the terms of her resignation, or that she had no other realistic alternative but to resign. Indeed, at the time of her resignation, the agency was attempting to mediate the issues between Ms. Russell and Ms. McCarty. In that regard, Ms. Russell could have waited for the resolution of mediation to see if the situation improved. Further, while the situation between her and Ms. McCarty was not ideal, Ms. Russell has not shown she was effectively deprived of free choice in the matter. Finally, it was not unreasonable for the agency to deny Ms. Russell's LWOP request, considering the mediation could have taken weeks or months.</p>

While it is clear that the work situation with Ms. McCarty was stressful, Ms. Russell has not made out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of coercion.

<p class="Block-Quote1">When, as here, an employee alleges that intolerable working conditions forced her to resign, the Board will find her resignation involuntary only if she demonstrates that the agency engaged in a course of action that made working conditions so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in her position would have felt compelled to resign. The doctrine of coerced involuntariness is "a narrow one" and does not apply if the employee resigns because she "does not want to accept [measures] that the agency is authorized to adopt, even if those measures make continuation in the job so unpleasant...that [she] feels that [she] has no realistic option but to leave." <span class="italic">Staats v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 1996). The touchstone of the "voluntariness" analysis is whether, considering the totality of the circumstances, factors operated on the employee's decision-making process that deprived her of freedom of choice. Vitale, 107 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, in a formal EEO complaint, the appellant alleged that, from November 19, 2014, to January 23, 2015, management officials subjected her to harassment and verbal abuse, denied her request for an EEO representative during meetings, and issued her a letter of counseling in retaliation for her prior EEO activity, reporting staff misconduct and violations of law, and "speaking up after being mistreated." The appellant later amended her complaint to include allegations that, in February 2015, she became aware that her second-level supervisor would be reviewing all of her work. She subsequently submitted another amendment, alleging that, on March 27, 2015, she was ordered to stay past her duty hours, and her supervisor challenged her complete work assignments, personally attacked her work integrity, and accused her of violating boundaries. After the appellant resigned, she again amended her EEO complaint, alleging that she felt threatened when alone with her supervisor and that "ongoing harassment, bullying by [her] supervisor and lack of protection from the administration" forced her to resign.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, in response to the administrative judge's order on jurisdiction, the appellant alleged that the following agency actions created intolerable working conditions: (1) management treated her differently than her coworkers; (2) management moved her from the psychology department to an inmate unit; (3) management did not allow her to supervise an intern; (4) her supervisor and the chief of her department harassed her; (5) she did not receive an outstanding rating on her performance evaluation; (6) a coworker harassed and physically struck her before being escorted out of the building; (7) the Special Investigative Supervisor and Office of Internal Affairs each filed a "case" against her; (8) her supervisor sent her harassing emails on a daily basis and entered her office throughout the day to talk about her performance; (9) she was "blamed for the suicide of an inmate [she] was helping"; (10) management made "slanderous and retaliatory" claims about her and questioned her ethics; (11) her "files were reviewed and not released in a timely manner"; and (12) management denied her request for representation during meetings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision, the administrative judge found that the appellant's stated reasons for resigning--allegations of a stressful work environment, <span id="Page_1964"></span>increased scrutiny, and unfair assignments--were insufficient as a matter of law to establish involuntariness. She further found that the appellant's unsupported allegation that a coworker harassed her and physically struck her was insufficient to establish a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction. The administrative judge also found that the investigation of the appellant in connection with her former patient's suicide did not render her resignation involuntary. Lastly, the administrative judge found that, when the appellant resigned, she was pursuing her retaliation complaints through the EEO process and that she had a viable option to remain in her position and fight the alleged harassment and retaliation through that process rather than resign. <span class="italic">Id</span>. Thus, the administrative judge concluded that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that her resignation was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant does not identify any particular error in the initial decision but argues again that the agency subjected her to intolerable working conditions that forced her to resign and that its coercive actions were retaliatory and discriminatory.[3] The appellant's mere disagreement with the administrative judge's well-reasoned findings provides no basis to disturb the initial decision. <span class="italic">See Davison v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 9 (2011).

<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Although the appellant reiterates many of her allegations from below, she does not renew her contention that the agency created intolerable working conditions when a coworker "harassed and physically struck" her.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In dismissing this appeal for lack of jurisdiction, the administrative judge considered the appellant's allegation that he disagreed with the agency's change in his retirement code and found that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation of agency misinformation, deception, or coercion that could render his resignation involuntary. <span class="italic">See Vitale</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 19 (explaining that one way to overcome the presumption of a voluntary resignation is to show that (1) the resignation was the product of misinformation or deception by the agency or (2) the resignation was the product of coercion by the agency). As to the allegation of a hostile work environment, the administrative judge found that the appellant's allegations were too vague to suggest working conditions that would compel a reasonable person to resign. We agree with these findings for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant submitted a retirement application in 2020, and, after the agency informed him that he was ineligible for retirement, he submitted a resignation letter on May 28, 2021. Although the appellant stated that he disagreed with the agency's determination regarding his entitlement to special retirement eligibility for firefighters, he did not allege that the agency provided him with misinformation or coerced his resignation. Rather, the appellant stated that, after the agency denied his retirement application, it offered him the opportunity to return to duty. The appellant has not alleged that he filed an appeal relating to his retirement eligibility or that exhaustion of that process would have been futile.[2] See 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 842.804(c), 842.807 (setting forth appellate procedures for retirement eligibility determinations for firefighters). Although the appellant may have preferred to retire rather than continue working, he has failed to nonfrivolously allege that he had no choice but to resign from employment and that it was the agency's wrongful conduct that deprived him of that choice. <span class="italic">See Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 15 (finding that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege an involuntary retirement when the appellant had options for contesting allegedly improper agency actions), <span class="italic">aff'd</span>, 469 F.

<p class="Body-Text">The assertion of involuntariness in a forced resignation case will be assessed objectively. It is immaterial that the appellant tells the agency she is being forced to resign. The issue as to the validity of the resignation is not the agency's knowledge of the appellant's reasons for resigning but whether those reasons, objectively considered, would have forced a reasonable person <span id="Page_1965"></span>to resign, <span class="Italic">Shelborne v. MSPB</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/07-3003.pdf">223 Fed. Appx. 990</a>, 993 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, Ms. Shelborne argues that the administrative judge erred in finding her resignation to be voluntary because the agency knew that she felt forced to resign before her resignation took effect. Ms. Shelborne argues that the agency was aware of her belief that she was forced to resign because she filed her appeal with the Merit Systems Protection Board before her resignation became effective and because she stated on her resignation form that her resignation was "forced."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Shelborne appears to contend that if the agency knew she felt coerced to resign, her resignation must be regarded as involuntary as a matter of law. That is incorrect. A resignation is coerced when improper agency conduct would leave a reasonable person in the employee's position with no realistic choice but to resign. <span class="Italic">Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1124. Ms. Shelborne might have felt compelled to resign based on what she felt were unfair agency actions, and she might have made that feeling known to the agency, but her subjective feelings do not establish that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign and thus do not show that the agency improperly coerced her resignation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Shelborne's arguments do not address the core reasoning of the administrative judge's ruling: that the agency's demands that Ms. Shelborne produce quality work and comply with leave policies were proper and would not have compelled a reasonable person to resign. Ms. Shelborne has done nothing on appeal to show that the administrative judge erred in reaching that conclusion, nor has she pointed to any other agency conduct that could be considered sufficiently coercive to render her resignation legally involuntary.</p>

In <span class="Italic">Collins</span>, the Board found that the appellant's affidavit, submitted with her petition for appeal, did not reiterate the allegations in her letter of resignation that she resigned because of health concerns, and that she did not make any specific allegations before the administrative judge linking her health claims with the alleged harassment or showing the severity of her claimed ailments. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 190. Here, in contrast, the appellant submitted a sworn statement averring that in June 1991, he received harassing telephone calls from an NIS supervisor and several NIS agents late at night at his home, which prompted extreme fear in him and his family based on threats made by NIS supervisors against his life in the past. He related that this and other incidents produced sleepless nights and stress-related worries. He also stated that in July and August 1991, he sought medical treatment for severe chest pains and stomach cramps. Finally, he asserted that on September 17, 1991, he suffered a blackout, collapsed, and was taken to a hospital where the doctor informed him that his condition was stress-related and told him to take a month off from work. He related that on September 20, 1991, he had an appointment with the doctor, but that a supervisor told him to go to an agency doctor and disciplined him for not doing so. He concluded that he became confused and stressed out "to the point of no [sic] being able to breathe" and that this situation became too much for him and his family to handle so that he had to resign to be treated and attempt to regain his health.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note that, approximately nine months prior to the issuance of the initial decision in this appeal, the Board modified the legal proposition set forth in <span class="Italic">Collins,</span> that it must determine its jurisdiction without considering any evidence submitted by the agency.

She received a "Fully Successful" performance rating on February 19, 1997, which, although it was not as high as ratings she had received in previous jobs, contained no negative remarks and would not have caused a prospective employer to question her capabilities. Nonetheless, the appellant became increasingly frustrated, leading her to believe that she could only remedy her situation by resigning. However, an employee's subjective evaluation is not the measure of the voluntariness of a resignation based on alleged intolerable working conditions. Rather, to prevail before the Board, the appellant must show that a reasonable person in her position would have believed that she had no other option but to resign. <span class="Italic">McCray,</span> 80 MSPR at 158-59 &#x00B6; 8. Based on our review of the entire record, the appellant has failed to make such a showing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Affirming the Board, the reviewing court determined, <span class="Italic">Gregory v. FCC</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 00-3070):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Ms. Gregory makes a number of arguments. Essentially, however, they reduce to two contentions. The first is that the Board's decision is not supported by substantial evidence. After a review of the evidence of record, we must reject this argument.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found that, although Ms. Gregory was unhappy in her work situation, she failed to show that a reasonable person in her position would have believed that her only option was to resign. This finding is amply supported by the evidence presented in the proceedings before the Board. For example, although Ms. Gregory did not receive as high a performance rating as she had at other jobs, she was rated as "Fully Successful" with no negative remarks in her performance rating on February 19, 1997. In addition, there is testimony supporting the agency's assertion that Ms. Gregory's leave request was denied due to work that needed "to get out." Also, Ms. Gregory's witnesses did not testify from personal knowledge that her working conditions at the time of her resignation were intolerable. Instead, their knowledge of Ms. Gregory's working conditions was derived primarily from what they had been told by Ms. Gregory. Furthermore, three of Ms. Gregory's four witnesses testified that Ms. Gregory should have transferred to another position within the agency, and one witness specifically testified that she had encouraged Ms. Gregory not to quit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Gregory's second argument is that the Board's decision is contrary to established case law. In making this argument, she cites four cases: <span class="Italic">Heining v. General Servs. Admin.</span>, 68 MSPR 513 (1995); <span class="Italic">Braun v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 50 F.3d 1005 (Fed. Cir. 1995), <span class="Italic">Markon v. Department of State</span>, 71 MSPR 574 (1996); and <span class="Italic">Bates v. Department of Justice</span>, 70 MSPR 659 (1996). Ms. Gregory's reliance on these cases is misplaced.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Heining</span>, the Board determined that the totality of the circumstances supported a finding that the employee's working conditions were intolerable and that the employee had been constructively discharged. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Heining</span>, 68 MSPR at 522-23. The employee had engaged in protected whistleblowing activity against two supervisory employees. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 516. In finding her working conditions intolerable, the Board noted, among other things, that: Ms. Heining had been rated as an exemplary employee before the whistleblowing; she was denied a promotion because of the whistleblowing; she was placed under the supervision of the very supervisor about whom she had made the protected disclosure; she was singled out for inequitable treatment because, unlike others, she was denied a compressed work schedule; she was rated unsatisfactory <span id="Page_1966"></span>in her performance in reprisal for whistleblowing; and her formal complaint of whistleblowing and her many grievances were either ignored or investigated in an unfair and meaningless manner. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 522-23. Indeed, the Board stated that "not only did Ms. Heining offer an overwhelming amount of evidence supporting an intolerable working environment, but she did not resign until she pursued many grievances and two complaints, receiving an adverse decision on her grievances...just prior to her resignation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 523. Thus, "[a] reasonable person in Ms. Heining's position would not stand pat and fight' any longer." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is readily distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Heining</span>. While at the FCC, Ms. Gregory was never rated as an exemplary employee, and she was not suddenly downgraded in retaliation for any of her activities. Instead, the evidence of record indicates that Ms. Gregory's supervisor found objective problems with her work and that Ms. Gregory did not receive a promotion because the quality of her work did not warrant one. Moreover, Ms. Gregory was not assigned to work under the supervisor about whom she had complained. Instead, she was transferred to work for a different supervisor. In sum, we cannot say that the record evidence in this case shows that a reasonable person would not "stand pat and fight" any longer, but instead would feel locked into a position from which they could obtain no relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither <span class="Italic">Braun</span> nor <span class="Italic">Markon</span> is on point. Each of these cases involved a situation in which a non-frivolous allegation of involuntariness had been made but the AJ denied the petitioner a hearing on the merits. Both cases were remanded for determinations on the merits. Ms. Gregory, however, has had her appeal fully heard by the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, in <span class="Italic">Bates</span> the Board found that a border patrol agent with the Immigration and Naturalization Service had been coerced into resigning through a continuous and unredressed pattern of harassment<span class="Italic">. See Bates</span>, 70 MSPR at 669-72. Most significantly, the agent had complained repeatedly about interference with her radio transmissions by other employees, which created a dangerous and potentially life-threatening situation. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 667-71. In response, the agency only took token actions to control the problem that were belated, half-hearted, and ineffective. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 670. The present case is a far cry from <span class="Italic">Bates</span>. There simply is no comparison between the egregious conduct at issue in <span class="Italic">Bates</span> and the facts of this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Baldwin v. VA</span>, 109 MSPR 392, 398-99 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-20, 2008 MSPB 169 (2008) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. VA</span>, 111 MSPR 586, 2009 MSPB 126 (2009), on further review of counsel fee petition following remand, <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. VA</span>, 115 MSPR 413, 2010 MSPB 221 (2010)), concluded there was no jurisdictional basis for an involuntary resignation appeal based on the circumstances described by the appellant as demeaning:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although not addressed by the AJ in the ID, the appellant also argued below that the agency made working conditions so "onerous and demeaning" that his separation from service was involuntary. In cases where intolerable working conditions are alleged, the Board will find an action involuntary only if the employee demonstrates that the employer or agency engaged in a course of action that made working conditions so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in that employee's position would have felt compelled to resign or retire. <span class="Italic">Markon v. Department of State</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 574, 577 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On PFR, the appellant reiterates the "allegations of coercive activity by the [a]gency" that he made below, contending, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the agency: assigned him to clean areas of the boiler plant that had not been cleaned in 16 years and told other employees not to help him, even though difficult tasks were generally tackled by all operators; unjustifiably threatened him with discipline; conducted unwarranted investigations targeted at him; and required him to be accompanied by agency police while on the premises of KCMC, even though there was no evidence that he was a threat to the agency or its property.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Markon</span>, we find that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously assert that his daily working conditions were so intolerable that a reasonable person in his position would have felt compelled to resign. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Miller v. Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 310, &#x00B6; 32 (2000) (dissatisfaction with work assignments, a feeling of being unfairly criticized or difficult or unpleasant working conditions are generally not so intolerable as to compel a reasonable person to resign). Therefore, he did not make a nonfrivolous allegation that he was coerced to resign as result of intolerable working conditions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A dispute (or misunderstanding) as to whether appellant was entitled to take some leave or be charged AWOL, and the consequences of an AWOL charge, were insufficient to meet a jurisdictional test of involuntariness, <span class="Italic">Lisbon v. DOD</span>, CH-0752-13-0155-I-1 (NP 9/30/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that his resignation was involuntary due to agency misinformation because he was informed he could either be listed as AWOL or resign after his leave request was denied. The administrative judge found that the agency correctly advised the appellant and did not provide misinformation. In applying the voluntariness test to resignation actions initiated by an employee where there has been no threat of an adverse action, such as a removal, the appropriate test for voluntariness where a constructive discharge is alleged is whether, under all of the circumstances, working conditions were made so difficult by the agency that a reasonable person in the appellant's position would have felt compelled to resign or retire. <span class="Italic">Markon v. Department of State</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 574, 577 (1996). Our reviewing court has held that involuntariness is determined by an objective standard where the employee must establish that a reasonable employee confronted with the same circumstances would feel coerced into resigning. <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Clearly the appellant planned to attend the competition with his son whether or not the leave request was approved. However, the appellant stated that he believed that being coded as AWOL would lead to his being removed. The appellant's supervisor stated that the appellant would have received a verbal counseling if he had been recorded as AWOL. There is no record of the appellant having any prior disciplinary actions that put him on notice that a single AWOL charge would lead to his removal. The appellant has not shown that his belief that he would be removed for a first instance of being AWOL is reasonable, particularly considering the support the agency offered to provide for the competition and the fact that he had sufficient accrued leave to cover the 3 days of absence he actually intended to take.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argued that he was denied his right to exercise free choice when the agency allegedly forced him to resign. Our reviewing court has noted the importance of free choice in the decision to resign. <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1329. The court has held that if the employee had a choice to stand pat and fight, but chose not to, then the employee had a choice and the action was not involuntary. There is no evidence that the appellant attempted to tell his supervisor, after he had been told that his request was denied because he had insufficient leave to cover the request, that he had sufficient leave because he was only going to be absent for 3 days. Instead, the record reflects that the appellant submitted his resignation and refused to discuss the reason with his second-level supervisor because he believed it would be pointless. The appellant discounts an agency statement made after his resignation that he could have challenged the AWOL after the competition as unrealistic. The appellant also stated that he, "has never been, nor will ever be: AWOL. It goes against every fiber of his profession both as a retired soldier and civil servant." The appellant had multiple opportunities to challenge the denial of his leave request, including clarifying the actual days of absence and his sufficient leave time prior to submitting his resignation. We therefore find the appellant was not deprived of free choice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the Board does not have jurisdiction over discrimination claims unaccompanied by an otherwise appealable action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tardio v. Department of Justice</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 371, &#x00B6; 31 (2009). Because the appellant failed to show that his resignation was involuntary, the Board lacks jurisdiction over his appeal, and we cannot adjudicate the merits of his discrimination claims.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Difficulties between an appellant and his supervisor did not establish a jurisdictional basis for an involuntary resignation appeal, <span class="Italic">Searcy v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 114 MSPR 281, 286-87 &#x00B6; 13, 2010 MSPB 127 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...His specific claims are found in his first EEO complaint where he contended that his supervisor denied his request for advanced leave, spoke to him in a disrespectful way, and did not provide him any assistance with his work assignments, and that a higher-level official refused to grant him an education waiver that would have allowed him to apply for certain vacancies. We find that these allegations do not evince working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person in the appellant's position would have felt compelled to resign. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Miller v. Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 310, &#x00B6; 32 (2000) (dissatisfaction with work assignments, feeling unfairly criticized, or difficult or unpleasant working conditions are generally not so intolerable as to compel as reasonable person to resign). Moreover, we also note, as the administrative judge did, that the appellant initially raised these issues in August 2008, when he filed his first EEO complaint, but that he did not resign until January 28, 2009. <span class="Italic">See Terban v. Department of Energy</span>, 216 F.3d 1021, 1025 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (evidence that a relatively short period of time elapsed between the alleged coercion and the employee's resignation is probative of involuntariness). This five month lapse of time further undercut the appellant's assertion that his working conditions were so intolerable as to have compelled his resignation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Problems between the appellant and his coworkers did not rise to the level of duress to invalidate a resignation, <span class="Italic">Green v. VA</span>, 112 MSPR 59, 64-65 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11, 2009 MSPB 142 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserted that he was mistreated by coworkers and that this too contributed to his involuntary resignation. He stated that he "had a no win situation working around 6 to 12 nurses a day, yelling and screaming all at the same time in demanding tones.... Laughter, scheming and plotting against me were present in some cases." He <span id="Page_1967"></span>also asserted that a nurse had spread rumors about his personal life. In support of his assertion that he was mistreated by nurses, the appellant submitted a letter from a patient who apparently witnessed a nurse "upset" and "laugh at" the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In cases where intolerable working conditions are alleged, the Board will find an action involuntary only if the employee demonstrates that the employer or agency engaged in a course of action that made working conditions so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in that employee's position would have felt compelled to resign or retire<span class="Italic">. Markon v. Department of State</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 574, 577 (1996). Applying the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Markon</span>, we find that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously assert that his daily working conditions were so intolerable that a reasonable person in his position would have felt compelled to resign. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Miller v. Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 310, &#x00B6; 32 (2000) (dissatisfaction with work assignments, a feeling of being unfairly criticized or difficult or unpleasant working conditions are generally not so intolerable as to compel a reasonable person to resign). While the appellant identified a single nurse who allegedly continued to spread rumors about him, the appellant's statement regarding such complaints is dated June 19, 2006, more than a year before his resignation. Moreover, the appellant's assertions amount to vague and general claims that nurses "spread[ ] rumors" and were "trying to get back at [him] for some reason." Therefore, the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that he was forced to resign as a result of intolerable working conditions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Allegedly intolerable working conditions caused by a subordinate and some agency medical documentation requests were insufficient to reverse a resignation, <span class="Italic">Bracy v. USPS,</span> DA-0752-09-0670-I-2 (NP 7/14/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant (a longtime supervisor) essentially argues that her resignation was involuntary because she was "threatened" by a subordinate, the threat put her in fear for her safety, the agency failed to investigate the subordinate under its formal procedures to protect her, and the agency harassed her (and threatened her with discipline) by requesting unnecessary medical documentation when she was on sick leave. Taken together, the appellant maintains that she had to resign to avoid the subordinate, prevent a disciplinary action against her, and preserve her benefits. None of the appellant's contentions are persuasive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has the burden of proving the Board's jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Parrott v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 519 F.3d 1328, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2008); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)]. An employee-initiated action, such as a resignation or retirement, is not generally appealable to the Board; such actions are presumed to be voluntary and the appellant bears the burden of proving otherwise. <span class="Italic">Terban v. Department of Energy</span>, 216 F.3d 1021, 1024 (Fed. Cir. 2000). If an employee claims that her resignation was coerced by the agency creating intolerable working conditions, the employee must show that a reasonable employee in her position, considering the totality of the circumstances, would have found the working conditions so oppressive that she would have felt compelled to resign. <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the outset, the appellant completely fails to explain why she deemed the incident with her subordinate so serious that resigning was the only option. Notably, the appellant did not describe any other violent or hostile contacts with the subordinate nor did she present any basis for concluding he was a threat. Indeed, the appellant indicated in her Equal Employment Opportunity materials that the individual was always loud and defensive, but, when he got upset, he went to the appellant's supervisor to complain about her (rather than engage in violent or confrontational behavior). In addition, the appellant had the option of disciplining him for improper conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, the mere fact the subordinate shouted at her would not amount to objectively intolerable working conditions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">generally</span> <span class="Italic">Terban</span>, 216 F.3d at 1025 (verbal confrontation between the appellant and a supervisor did not render her resignation coerced);<span class="Italic"> see also Green v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 59, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (2009) (vague and general allegations of being laughed at or yelled at by coworkers and being made the subject of workplace rumors do not suffice). While the appellant may have found the subordinate unpleasant to deal with, an employee is not guaranteed a stress-free work environment. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 15 (2011). Similarly, that the appellant thought the agency's investigation of the subordinate's conduct was inadequate or failed to take her concerns seriously also does not suffice to make her resignation involuntary. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of Defens</span>e, 85 M.S.P.R. 310, &#x00B6; 32 (2000) ("Dissatisfaction with work assignments, a feeling of being unfairly criticized, or difficult or unpleasant working conditions are generally not so intolerable as to compel a reasonable person to resign."). The appellant clearly had alternatives to resigning, including disciplining the subordinate or seeking a transfer or shift change. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 310, &#x00B6; 29 (an employee must act reasonably and "not assume the worst").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's contention that the agency's letters requesting medical documentation placed her under duress and forced her resignation is baseless. The letters were form letters used by all supervisors (such as the appellant), they were not intended to punish or threaten the appellant, and they were automatically generated by the agency's electronic resource management system when the appellant's most recent medical documentation failed to indicate her likely date of return. While the letters did mention a possible charge of Absence Without Leave and removal, the letters also expressly provided that those consequences would only be triggered if the recipient failed to comply with the instructions--<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, return to work or provide updated medical information. The appellant also conceded that she only received the letters when her medical documentation failed to include a likely return date or was otherwise about to expire.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the appellant had no reasonable basis for deeming the letters threatening nor would a reasonable person view them as so intolerable as to make resignation one's only choice. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 392, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-20 (2008) (allegations of being assigned to onerous tasks, being unjustifiably threatened with discipline, and being subjected to unnecessary investigations did not suffice). Furthermore, any possibility of discipline was entirely speculative on the appellant's part, and she clearly had the option of contesting a disciplinary action, if and when it occurred. <span class="Italic">See Brown</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 15; <span class="Italic">see generally</span> <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1329 (the appellant's resignation was not involuntary if he had a choice whether to resign or contest the validity of the agency action).</p>

While he may have based his decision in part on information that the appellant's supervisor provided to the clinical psychologist, the appellant has failed to show that the physician's independent judgment was thereby compromised. We also note that both the physician and the psychologist worked for the private hospital to which the appellant was taken, and there is no reason to believe that either of them was acting under the direction of the agency in this matter. We therefore find that, even accepting as true all of the appellant's claims regarding the incident, the agency's actions were not ultimately the cause of his involuntary hospitalization and thus cannot be legally deemed to have led to his resignation. <span class="Italic">See Vitale</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 19; <span class="Italic">Heining</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 519-20.").</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish Board jurisdiction where a claim of involuntary resignation is made, an appellant must overcome the presumption of voluntariness by making a non-frivolous allegation that the resignation was the result of misinformation, deception, or coercion by the agency. <span class="Italic">Dick v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 290 F.3d 1356, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2002).

<p class="Block-Quote1">We consider first Ms. Davis's allegations of involuntary resignation caused by factors other than her sexual harassment charge. With respect to those, Ms. Davis does not contend that her resignation was the product of misinformation or deception, and her appeal does not appear to fall into the "coercion" category. Under a <span class="Italic">Middleton</span> analysis, Ms. Davis's resignation <span id="Page_1968"></span>was not the result of coercion. Specifically, Ms. Davis did not involuntarily accept the terms of the DHS, and the circumstances permitted her to remain an employee and participate in the investigations into her conduct. Further, the circumstances surrounding Ms. Davis's resignation were not the result of coercive acts of the DHS. She was found to have fraudulently represented her need for FMLA leave, and she compounded her deception by making what was determined to be additional false allegations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since involuntary resignation is a totality of the circumstances test according to <span class="Italic">Shoaf</span>, Ms. Davis's subsequent allegations contributed to the circumstances and cannot be ignored. All of her allegations, other than her sexual harassment, were determined to be "unfounded" and when investigated, frivolous. Thus we conclude that Ms. Davis's allegations, other than her sexual harassment charge, do not support a finding that her resignation was coerced. Ms. Davis chose to resign over a year after her sexual harassment allegation had been resolved when the agency was asking her to testify regarding the truthfulness of the additional allegations.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the denial of her reasonable accommodation request, the appellant also points to the Hatch Act investigation and the resulting Letter of Caution as facts that made her working conditions intolerable and caused her to resign. The Board has held that being subjected to unnecessary investigations and being unjustifiably threatened with discipline does not suffice to establish an allegation of involuntary resignation. <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 392, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-20 (2008). Nevertheless, in assessing whether a resignation was involuntary, the Board must look at the totality of the circumstances, and thus these individual incidents, when considered with the other record evidence, may support a finding of involuntariness. <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 10 (stating that the issue in an involuntary resignation appeal is whether, considering the totality of the circumstances, the employee's working conditions were made so difficult that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 469 F. App'x 852 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Similarly, the appellant's allegations of discrimination and reprisal must also be considered as part of the total circumstances that may support a finding of involuntariness even if the appellant's evidence does not support a finding of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Markon v. Department of State</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 574, 578 (1996) (stating that at the jurisdictional stage of an involuntary retirement appeal, the Board will consider allegations of discrimination to the extent that they bear on the issue of voluntariness).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, given the low evidentiary threshold required to constitute a nonfrivolous allegation that her resignation was involuntary, we find that the appellant has met that burden....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Negative and positive actions of supervisors and coworkers must be considered. Actions of third parties to the employment relationship are unlikely to be given weight. Routine job frustrations will not invalidate a challenged resignation, <span class="Italic">Miller v. DOD</span>, 85 MSPR 310, 320-22 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 26-32 (2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant must prove that under all the circumstances working conditions were made so difficult by the agency that a reasonable person in her position would have felt compelled to resign<span class="Italic">. Heining,</span> 68 MSPR at 520. Thus, she had to show that a reasonable person would have felt that there was a causal connection between all of the circumstances, including those incidents that were remote in time, and her resignation. In addition to the findings made by the AJ, we note the following factors in concluding that she has not meet this burden.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant testified that on the day she resigned she spoke with her second-level supervisor at the time, Floyd Carter, and informed him that Adams had told another employee before Adams had been selected to become the appellant's supervisor, that she (Adams) would make the appellant resign, "squash [her] like a bug," and make her life miserable. Adams had become the appellant's interim supervisor around February 1998. The appellant testified that she also told Carter that she did not see any alternative but to resign, and that the IG investigation of an earlier complaint she had filed was affected by the IG's involvement with her prior second-level supervisor and the IG's failure to interview her. She did not, however, recall telling Carter about any of the other incidents that had occurred years before.... Before she resigned the appellant had requested that the other interim supervisor try to get her assigned to his team, but he told her that such a reassignment was not possible. On the day before she resigned the appellant also had the dispute with Johnson.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the AJ that the appellant did not prove that working conditions were made so difficult by the agency that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign. The appellant knew that Adams would be her supervisor temporarily and would only "possibly" do her next appraisal. Carter testified that the interim supervisors would serve until the vacancy announcements and competition for the permanent positions had been completed. He testified that he did not permit switching from one team to another because "it was going to be a very short period of time. And I didn't want to have people just going at their whim from one team to the other because they didn't like an individual or something like that."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant admitted that she never confronted Adams with the comments she was told Adams had made about her. We also agree with the AJ that Adams' actions toward the appellant as a supervisor, which the AJ found did not create intolerable working conditions, were more significant than any statements Adams may have made to others about the appellant when she was merely the appellant's coworker. <span class="Italic">Cf. Thomas v. Shoney's Inc.</span>, 845 F. Supp. 388, 391-92 (S.D. W.Va. 1994) (a manager's racially derogatory comments that the plaintiff heard about from others did not rise to the level of severe or pervasive and did not create an abusive working environment), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 60 F.3d 825 (4th Cir. 1995) (Table). The record shows that Adams gave the appellant time off without charging her for leave when an emergency arose. In addition, "in an effort to handle it in a fair way and not be heavy handed," Adams refrained from citing the appellant for a security violation when the appellant did not open incoming mail. Adams also testified without contradiction that she helped the appellant log onto her computer and the agency's computer network. These actions are inconsistent with the appellant's claim that Adams contributed to an unrelentingly difficult work environment. To prove a constructive discharge an employee has an obligation to act reasonably, not assume the worst, and not jump to conclusions too quickly. <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Taco Bell Corp.,</span> 156 F.3d 884, 890 (8th Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Tidwell v. Meyer's Bakeries, Inc</span>., 93 F.3d 490, 494 (8th Cir. 1996). We find that the appellant unreasonably assumed the worst regarding the alleged comments by Adams.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the AJ found, four agency management employees tried to talk the appellant out of resigning by advising her of other options, such as filing a grievance, utilizing a mediator, or taking some leave or leave without pay to consider the situation. The appellant's former supervisor, Clarence Lucas, had permitted the appellant to work a second job outside the agency, and had allowed her to come to work late and work extra time (instead of using leave) when her second job caused her to work late. Lucas also allowed the appellant to switch her compressed work days. The appellant received numerous performance awards throughout the years, including a "Special Act or Service" award as late as December 1997. Moreover, the record reflects that the appellant was never happy about working in the agency's St. Louis office after having previously worked for the agency at Scott Air Force Base.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An event that cannot be attributed to the agency also affected the appellant's decision to resign. Some time between March 23, 1998, and her April 12, 1998 resignation, the appellant received notice from the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) that its investigation into her request for corrective action regarding her claim of reprisal for whistleblowing and other prohibited personnel practices was being closed. The appellant described the effect of this letter as akin to getting "kicked in the stomach. I mean, it was devastating." The appellant's descriptions of the other incidents she complained of do not match this description in vividness. Thus, we find that the closure letter from OSC was likely on the appellant's mind a few weeks later when she decided to resign, especially given her testimony that the agency's resolution of the IG complaint in <span id="Page_1969"></span>the fall of 1997, more than six months earlier, was weighing heavily on her mind at that time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee is not guaranteed a working environment free of stress. Dissatisfaction with work assignments, a feeling of being unfairly criticized, or difficult or unpleasant working conditions are generally not so intolerable as to compel a reasonable person to resign. <span class="Italic">See Carter v. Ball</span>, 33 F.3d 450, 459 (4th Cir. 1994) (citing <span class="Italic">Stetson v. NYNEX Serv. Co.,</span> 995 F.2d 355, 360-61 (2d Cir. 1993)). Considering the totality of the circumstances in this appeal, we find that the appellant has not proven by preponderant evidence that the agency created working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person in the appellant's position would have felt compelled to resign.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marland v. Dept. of Army,</span> CH-0752-14-0794-I-2 (NP 3/18/2016) ("We thus find that the appellant admitted that the agency attempted to address her complaints regarding her first-level supervisor. The fact that she did not fully take advantage of these attempts and resigned shortly after the agency transferred her, undermines her argument that her resignation was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 310, &#x00B6; 29 (finding that, to prove a constructive discharge, an employee has an obligation to <span id="Page_1970"></span>act reasonably, not assume the worst, and not jump to conclusions too quickly)."); <span class="Italic">O'Donnell v. USPS</span>, PH-0752-12-0382-I-1 (NP 7/3/2013) ("Applying this standard, the administrative judge correctly found that the allegedly improper actions of agency management (which consisted of a supervisor asking the appellant about his Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 usage and calling him nicknames, a manager going to the emergency room to visit the appellant, and the appellant's supervisor saying the appellant would be removed if he were found to be talking about the manager, were not sufficient to constitute such difficult circumstances that a reasonable person would feel compelled to retire. While the purported acts of agency officials may have been stressful for the appellant and made for an unpleasant work environment, these actions do not establish that the appellant was forced to work in conditions so intolerable that he had no choice but to resign. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 310, &#x00B6; 32 (2000) (an employee is not guaranteed a working environment free of stress)."); <span class="Italic">Welcome v.

<p class="Body-Text">A demotion at the end of probation and leave restriction were not a constructive removal justifying reversal of a resignation, <span class="Italic">Moody v. MSPB</span>, 221 Fed. Appx. 971, 972 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, Ms. Moody's demotion to GS-13 and adherence to a strict leave policy would not coerce a reasonable employee to resign. First, Ms. Moody submitted her resignation letter approximately three months after her demotion. Thus, the demotion did not present Ms. Moody no alternative but to resign. Indeed, a few months intervened between her demotion and her resignation. While the working environment may not have been pleasant after the demotion, an unpleasant work environment does not present the employee no choice but to resign. Further, Ms. Moody's dissatisfaction with the leave policy, including a choice between compliance with the policy and potential disciplinary action for unauthorized absence, does not equate to forcing an employee to resign.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">Cf. Richardson v. VA</span>, AT-0752-16-0583-I-1 (NP 10/14/2022) (resignation to pursue education and career options was not involuntary because the agency declined to grant leave or change of work schedule for that purpose).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Tension between the appellant and his supervisor does not constitute duress or coercion. The test for duress is an objective one and cannot be based solely on appellant's subjective belief that he was being pressured. <span class="Italic">Rubio v. DHHS</span>, 12 MSPR 119, 121-22 (1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Chandrasekhar v. DHHS</span>, 58 Fed. Appx. 487, 490 (Fed.

Dept. of Air Force</span>, 31 MSPR 374, 375 (1986) (it was insufficient for establishing a coerced resignation that "appellant had trying work conditions and difficulty with her supervisor"). Plausible, benign explanations for agency actions must be considered. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. DOD</span>, 85 MSPR 310, 317-18 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-19 (2000) (agency explanations were accepted concerning allegations that the appellant's personal effects were searched, that an IG investigation into the appellant's complaints was biased or superficial, and that adjudication of the appellant's grievance was unduly delayed). A resignation over a salary dispute is not involuntary. It amounts to a choice between unpleasant alternatives. <span class="Italic">Bryant v. USPS</span>, 29 MSPR 514 (1985) (Table). A resignation was not involuntary because the appellant would be terminated and his file adversely documented unless he resigned. <span class="Italic">Ahmed v. EPA</span>, 11 MSPR 548, 551 (1982). A bad performance rating did not establish a basis for declaring involuntary a resignation, <span class="Italic">Kibler v. Dept. of Army</span>, DC-0752-15-0915-I-1 (NP 5/12/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Regarding his retaliation claim in particular, the appellant asserts that the agency issued him a negative performance rating in retaliation for his filing of a grievance. However, even if proven, such an allegation could not establish that a reasonable person in his position would have felt compelled to resign because, as the administrative judge correctly noted, the appellant could have stayed and contested his performance rating through available procedures instead of resigning. <span class="Italic">See Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1329 (Fed.
