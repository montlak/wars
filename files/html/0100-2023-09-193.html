<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-190"><span class="space">7.</span> Substitution; Survival of Claim</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 1201.35 (2022) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;If an appellant dies or is otherwise unable to pursue the appeal, the processing of the appeal will only be completed upon substitution of a proper party. Substitution will not be permitted where the interests of the appellant have terminated because of the appellant's death or other disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;The representative or proper party must file a motion for substitution within 90 days after the death or other disabling event, except for good cause shown.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;In the absence of a timely substitution of a party, the processing of the appeal may continue if the interests of the proper party will not be prejudiced.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The regulation follows judicial precedent. The right to employment and to earn a living free from undue molestation is a property right affecting the estate of a federal employee. This right does not abate on the appellant's death. <span class="Italic">Bilanow v. United States</span>, 309 F.2d 267, 268 (Ct. Cl. 1962). The effect of bankruptcy, and of whether the appellant or the bankruptcy estate that is the real party in interest, was recognized as an issue but not resolved. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Crosby v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 579, 582 (1998).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> summarizes Board guidance on substitution of parties, at Chapter 2:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">SUBSTITUTION OF PARTIES</span>. Since the right to file an appeal is a personal right, normally only an appellant or his or her representative may file. Decisions that reject attempts to file an appeal by someone other than the affected employee or annuitant refer to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.35 to state that while the regulations permit a properly substituted party to pursue the appeal of an appellant who dies or is otherwise unable to pursue an appeal, they do not provide for substitution of a party before the appeal is filed. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Estate of Pyc v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 326 (1997). Such decisions, however, do not mention the potentially conflicting statement in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.24(a) that "Only an appellant, his or her designated representative, or a party properly substituted under &#x00A7; 1201.35 may file an appeal." Thus, the rule seems to remain that the appeal right is personal to the affected employee or annuitant. Nonetheless, after an appeal is filed, if an appellant dies or becomes incapacitated, and the individual's interest in the appeal has not terminated, the appeal may be processed upon the substitution of a proper party. <span class="Italic">See Manangan v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 51, 53 (1993). The representative or the proper party must file a motion for substitution within 90 days of the death or other incapacitating event, except for good cause shown. 5 C.F.R. 1201.35(b). In the absence of a timely substitution, processing of the appeal may continue if the interests of the proper party will not be prejudiced. 5 C.F.R. 1201.35(c).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The motion for substitution is to be filed by the representative or proper party within 90 days after the appellant's death or disability. As a practical matter, if substitution is required, (the late) appellant's counsel (assuming it was not a <span class="Italic">pro se</span>) or family member or friend should expeditiously let the AJ (or the Clerk of the Board if the case is on PFR) know what occurred, with notice to agency counsel. The Board does not insist on these formalities in all cases, and it may permit a case to proceed without a motion for substitution. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="italic">Favalora v. OPM</span>, PH-831M-19-0450-I-1, n.2 (NP 9/2/2022) ("No motion to substitute Ms. Eck as the proper party has been filed here. However, the Board's regulations provide for the continued processing of an appeal in the absence of a timely motion to substitute 'if the interests of the proper party will not be prejudiced.' 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.35(c).

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Davis v. OPM</span>, 938 F.2d 1283, 1284-85 (Fed. Cir. 1991), considered the right of a surviving spouse to file for a disability annuity for a decedent. The court resolved that the spouse could not file the application, but its decision was based on considerations of the nature of retirement law rather than on the ability of an estate to be substituted for an appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After Mr. Davis' death, petitioner, as the administratrix of the estate of Mr. Davis, filed two applications for a disability retirement annuity on behalf of her deceased husband....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) rejected the disability retirement application filed on behalf of Mr. Davis after his death....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board affirmed OPM's determinations. Relying upon this court's decision in <span class="Italic">Oshiver on behalf of Oshiver v. OPM</span>, 896 F.2d 540 (Fed. Cir. 1990), the Board held, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the right to file for a disability annuity is personal to the employee, and affirmed OPM's denial of an application for a disability retirement annuity filed on his behalf. No decision was made by OPM or the board on whether or not Mr. Davis would have been entitled to a disability annuity had he applied. The Board then concluded that petitioner had "no right to a survivor annuity derived from the disability retirement annuity which she claims that her late husband should have received." <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, No. PH08319010227, slip op. at 2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he applicable statutes require an application for disability retirement to be made to OPM. 5 USC 8337(a) (1988) ("An employee who completes 5 years of civilian service and has become disabled shall be retired on the employee's own application or on application by the employee's agency."); 5 USC 8345(i)(1) (1988) ("No payment shall be made from the Fund unless an application for benefits based on the service of an employee or Member is received [by OPM] ..."). Since Mr. Davis was not employed in any position covered by the CSRA at the time of his death, the provision of section 8341(d) is inapplicable. Thus, petitioner is entitled to prevail only if she can show that Mr. Davis "died] after having retired under this subchapter" within the meaning of section 8341(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner advances two arguments for the proposition that Mr. Davis died "after having retired" within the meaning of section 8341(b)(1). First, petitioner claims that she should be permitted to make a posthumous application for disability retirement on his behalf as administratrix of his estate. Second, she argues that she should receive a survivor annuity without filing any application on his behalf if Mr. Davis was <span class="Italic">eligible</span> to retire when he died.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM interprets the above quoted provisions to mean that an employee must <span class="Italic">personally</span> file an application for a disability annuity, except in limited circumstances not pertinent here, e.g., when an agency must file on the employee's behalf, and that an application for such annuity cannot be filed in any event after the death of the employee. Accordingly, OPM rejected petitioner's posthumous application for disability benefits on behalf of her husband.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court has explained that "if the statute [being construed] is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute." <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 2782, 81 L. Ed.2d 694 (1984) (footnote omitted); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Money v. OPM</span>, 811 F.2d 1474, 1477 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (stating that "[t]he longstanding interpretation placed on a statute by the agency charged with its administration should be followed unless there are compelling indications that it is wrong."). Petitioner argues in essence that OPM's interpretation is wrong and as the administratrix of his estate her application on her deceased husband's behalf must be accepted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Essentially the argument is over whether an application for disability benefits can be made after an employee has died. We hold that OPM's interpretation of the statute is reasonable that a posthumous application for disability retirement by the administratrix of the employee's estate does not meet the statutory requirements. This interpretation is in line with the decisions of this court holding that the right to file an application for retirement benefits is "personal" to the employee "alone." <span class="Italic">Oshiver</span>, 896 F.2d at 541 (quoting <span class="Italic">Roebling v. OPM</span>, 788 F.2d 1544, 1547 (Fed. Cir. 1986)). Moreover, this Court has stated that certain annuity rights do not accrue automatically but only upon a claim being made by the claimant while alive. <span class="Italic">Davis v. OPM</span>, 918 F.2d 944 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (rejecting a claim for annuity payments by heirs of a surviving spouse who died without making a claim). That Mr. Davis was not officially credited with the necessary five years of service until after his death does not permit a different result. We agree with OPM that a claim to a disability annuity, like a claim to a survivor's annuity, cannot first be filed after the death of the claimant.</p>
