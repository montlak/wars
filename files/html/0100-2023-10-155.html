<p class="noindent">Under 5 USC 7105:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(e)(1)&#x2003;The Authority may delegate to any regional director its authority under this chapter--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;to determine whether a group of employees is an appropriate unit;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;to conduct investigations and to provide for hearings;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)&#x2003;to determine whether a question of representation exists and to direct an election; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(D)&#x2003;to supervise or conduct secret ballot elections and certify the results thereof.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;The Authority may delegate to any administrative law judge appointed under subsection (d) of this section its authority under section 7118 of this title to determine whether any person has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(f)&#x2003;If the Authority delegates any authority to any regional director or administrative law judge to take any action pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, the Authority may, upon application by any interested person filed within 60 days after the date of the action, review such action, but the review shall not, unless specifically ordered by the Authority, operate as a stay of action. The Authority may affirm, modify, or reverse any action reviewed under this subsection. If the Authority does not undertake to grant review of the action under this subsection within 60 days after the later of--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;the date of the action; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;the date of the filing of any application under this subsection for review of the action; the action shall become the action of the Authority at the end of such 60-day period.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to reconsideration requests involving regional unit clarification decisions, under 5 CFR 2422.31 (2022) [formerly 5 CFR 2422.17], the application for review must be filed with FLRA within 60 days of the date of the regional decision and order, a deadline that cannot be extended or waived. <span class="italic">See Dept. of Navy, Naval Computer and Telecomms</span>. Command and AFGE Local 1, 42 FLRA 1265, 1266 (1991) (application for review dismissed as one day late, after initial submission to FLRA regional office); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps Air Station and IAM Lodge 2296</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-119.html">71 FLRA 630</a>, 632 (2020) (Member Abbott dissenting) ("Without the bar on attacking past certifications once the sixty&#8209;day deadline expires, every party that misses the filing deadline would be permitted to <span id="page_142"></span>evade it by filing a new representation petition, claiming that a previous certification decision contained an error."), <span class="Italic">recon. den.,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-182.html">71 FLRA 940</a> (2020).</p>
<p class="noindent">Reconsideration is not the stage to raise new issues or offer new evidence on the facts. Under 5 CFR 2422.31 (2022):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">When do you file an application for review of a Regional Director Decision and Order?</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Contents</span>. An application for review must be sufficient for the Authority to rule on the application without looking at the record. However, the Authority may, in its discretion, examine the record in evaluating the application. An application must specify the matters and rulings to which exception(s) is taken, include a summary of evidence relating to any issue raised in the application, and make specific references to page citations in the transcript if a hearing was held. An application may not raise any issue or rely on any facts not timely presented to the Hearing Officer or Regional Director.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under 5 CFR 2429.5 (2022):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Matters not previously presented; official notice.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority will not consider any evidence, factual assertions, arguments (including affirmative defenses), requested remedies, or challenges to an awarded remedy that could have been, but were not, presented in the proceedings before the Regional Director, Hearing Officer, Administrative Law Judge, or arbitrator. The Authority may, however, take official notice of such matters as would be proper.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">SSA ODAR and Armstrong</span>, 67 FLRA 299, 300-301 (2014), determined that a reconsideration request is untimely if it seeks to challenge in a regional proceeding a final determination in another region earlier challenged by the petitioner or if it seeks to provide evidence to FLRA that was not presented at the regional level:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The San Francisco RD's decision excluding the ALJs from the bargaining unit became final sixty days after it was issued because no party filed an application for review. Although the petitioner attempted to challenge that decision through an application for review filed twenty months after the San Francisco RD issued her decision, the Authority dismissed the petitioner's application because it was untimely. And, in <span class="Italic">SSA, Office of Disability Adjudication &#x0026; Review, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, the Authority denied the petitioner's motion requesting reconsideration of that dismissal. The Chicago RD, therefore, did not err by enforcing the San Francisco RD's decision, which was final and binding, against the petitioner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The petitioner argues that the San Francisco RD's decision "was based upon an erroneous interpretation of the Statute." According to the petitioner, the San Francisco RD "misapplied the law" because "cases construing" &#x00A7; 7120(e) of the Statute hold that supervisors may be in a bargaining unit as long as their inclusion does not create a conflict of interest with the duties of other bargaining-unit employees. Because the petitioner is challenging the San Francisco RD's application of precedent, we construe his claim as an argument that the San Francisco RD failed to apply established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the San Francisco RD's decision excluding the ALJs from the bargaining unit is final and binding. The petitioner may not now challenge the legal sufficiency of the San Francisco RD's decision through his application for review of a <span class="Italic">different</span> decision. Thus, we find that the petitioner is precluded, through this application, from challenging whether the San Francisco RD properly applied established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The petitioner argues that the Chicago RD's decision should be set aside because the Agency issued a new position description for his position that is identical to those of Agency ALJs that are in the bargaining unit. The record does not indicate that the petitioner presented this argument to the Chicago RD. Section 2429.5 of the Authority's Regulations precludes the Authority's consideration of "evidence, factual assertions, [or] arguments...that could have been, but were not, presented in the proceedings before the [RD]."Section 2422.31(b) similarly states that "[a]n application may not raise any issue or rely on any facts not timely presented to the...[RD]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is unclear whether the Agency created the position description before or after the Chicago RD issued his decision.&#x2003;Assuming the position description existed before the Chicago RD issued his decision, the petitioner had an opportunity to present his argument to the RD. Because the petitioner could have raised his argument at that time, but failed to do so, he may not raise it now.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, even if the position description was not created until after the Chicago RD issued his decision, the petitioner is still precluded from relying on it in his application. In this regard, the Authority held that, under a previous, but identical, version of &#x00A7; 2422.31(b), parties were prohibited from raising facts that arise after an RD issues his or her decision because "the Authority may consider only the facts that were before the RD."[26] Thus, even if the position description was not created until after the Chicago RD issued his decision, because the position description was not presented to the RD, the petitioner may not rely on it now.[27]</p>

Similarly, &#x00A7; 2429.5 of the Authority's Regulations precludes a party from raising, to the Authority, 'arguments...that could have been, but were not, presented in the proceedings before the [RD].'").</p>
<p class="noindent">Although an incorrect instruction from the regional director concerning the filing deadline was inexcusable, FLRA determined that "[w]hile the circumstances of this case are regrettable," it would not excuse a late filing. The parties were charged "with knowledge of and are bound by statutes and lawfully promulgated regulations despite reliance to their pecuniary detriment upon incorrect information received from Government agents or employees." <span class="italic">DHUD and AFGE Local 476</span>, 34 FLRA 307, 309 (1990). <span class="Italic">VAMC Hampton and NAGE</span>, 63 FLRA 593, 595 (2009), made plain the point that in reconsideration requests, late filings are not excused based on incorrect information from FLRA employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her affidavit, the law clerk stated that she called the telephone number for CIP that is listed on the Authority's web site in order to learn where to file the opposition because Union counsel found the filing instructions in &#x00A7; 2422.31(d) of the Authority's Regulations "vague." The law clerk further stated that the CIP employee who answered the phone informed her that the Union only had to file its opposition with the WRO and send copies to the RD and the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority issued an Order directing the Union to show cause why its opposition should not be dismissed as untimely.&#x2003;The Order stated that the opposition was considered filed on July 9, when CIP received the opposition from the WRO by hand-delivery, and therefore appeared to be untimely. <span class="Italic">See</span> Order to Show Cause at 2 (citing <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Computer &#x0026; Telecomms. Command, Headquarters, Wash, D.C.,</span> 42 FLRA 1265, 1266 (1991)). In response to the Order, the Union did not contend that the opposition was timely. However, the Union incorporated the above argument and affidavit and again argued that its error should be excused because it received inaccurate filing information. Further, the Union asserted that nothing prevented the WRO from informing the Union of its mistake or delivering the opposition to CIP earlier.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority may waive any expired time limit, with exceptions not relevant here, in "extraordinary circumstances." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.23(b). For the reasons that follow, we find that the Union has not established extraordinary circumstances warranting waiver of the expired time limit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, &#x00A7; 2422.31(d) of the Authority's Regulations is not vague. To the contrary, the Regulation clearly states that "[a] party may file <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">the</span> <span class="Italic">Authority</span> an opposition[.]" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.31(d) (emphasis added). This language clearly establishes that any party desiring to file an opposition must do so "with the Authority[,]" rather than any regional office. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). Second, the Authority has consistently held that a party's filing error may not be excused, even if an Authority agent provides a party with inaccurate filing information. A party is responsible for having knowledge of the filing requirements set forth under the Statute and the Authority's Regulations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dep't of Veterans Affairs, John J. Pershing Med. Ctr., Poplar Bluff, Mo.,</span> 45 FLRA 791, 792 (1992) (<span class="Italic">DVA</span>) (Authority did not accept untimely application for review even though it was established that RD provided party with the wrong filing deadline); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Def, Def. Logistic Agency,</span> <span class="Italic">Def. Depot Memphis, Memphis, Tenn.,</span> 44 FLRA 1602, 1603 (1992) (union's exceptions were dismissed as untimely filed even though Authority employee provided union with incorrect filing date). Therefore, even if an Authority agent provided the Union with inaccurate filing information, the Union's error may not be excused. <span class="Italic">See DVA,</span> 45 FLRA at 792. Third, the Union has cited no authority which establishes that Authority agents are responsible for correcting a party's filing error. Thus, it is not relevant whether the WRO could have hand-delivered the opposition to CIP earlier. Accordingly, we will not consider the Union's untimely opposition.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another case dismissing an application for review of a regional director's decision and order on a union petition to clarify a bargaining unit determined that it was regrettable, but legally immaterial, that the decision incorrectly stated the filing date for the review application was three days beyond the 60-days allowed by statute, <span class="Italic">VAMC Hampton and NAGE,</span> 64 FLRA 391, 391-92 (2010) (Member DuBester's dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7105(f) of the Statute provides that an application for review <span id="page_143"></span>of the Regional Director's Decision and Order must be filed with the Authority within sixty days. In &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2422.31(a) and 2429.23(d) of its Regulations, the Authority has established that this provision of the Statute may not be extended or waived. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.31 (a) ("The sixty (60) day time limit provided for in 5 U.S.C. 7105(f) may not be extended or waived."); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.23(d) (The "time limit[&#8197;] established in 5 U.S.C. 7105(f)...may not be extended or waived under this section."). As a result, the Authority has not tolled the time limit set forth in &#x00A7; 7105(f) of the Statute based on equitable considerations. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Housing &#x0026; Urban Dev., Wash., D.C.</span>, 34 FLRA 307, 309 (1990) (<span class="Italic">HUD)</span>; <span class="Italic">cf. U.S. Dep't of Housing &#x0026; Urban Dev., </span>27 FLRA 852, 853 (1987) (finding same for &#x00A7; 7122(b) of the Statute). The Authority, accordingly, consistently has dismissed as untimely applications for review in circumstances like those presented here. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 310; <span class="Italic">Dep't of Veterans Affairs, John J. Pershing Med. Ctr., Poplar Bluff, Mo</span>., 45 FLRA 791, 792 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, as in <span class="Italic">HUD</span>, (1) the Agency "is well acquainted with the Authority's Rules and Regulations and the Statute; (2) the Regional Director stated in his decision that the application for review had to be filed within 60 days of the date of his decision and cited [2422.31]...; and (3) all of the information necessary for the Agency to satisfy timely filing requirements was readily available." 34 FLRA at 310.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, although this situation is regrettable, and we certainly do not condone an FLRA employee providing incorrect information to a filing party, "we are without authority to modify our existing Rules and Regulations by merely issuing a decision." <span class="Italic">HUD</span>, 34 FLRA at 309. Accordingly, we dismiss the application for review as untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent">Postmarks on mail, or on certified mail receipts, constitute the day of filing; lacking a postmark, the filing is presumed to be five days prior to the date the material is received by FLRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 44 FLRA 538, 540 (1992). A personal declaration of a mailing date appears to be insufficient to counter the date that the mailing presumably occurred when a document is received by FLRA without a postmark. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOD, Stateside Dependents Sch. and Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 49 FLRA 393, 395 (1994) (untimely application for review of unit determination: "The Authority consistently has held that personal affidavits, standing alone, are insufficient to establish the date of service or mailing of documents."); <span class="Italic">DOD, Stateside Dependents Sch. and Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 48 FLRA 1389, 1390 (1994) (envelope containing application for review was mailed but did not have postmark; if no postmark is evidence, filing is presumed to have been mailed five days prior to its receipt).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA realistically considers reconsideration applications as to conformity with requirements for pleadings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VA, St. Louis Healthcare System and AFGE</span>, 70 FLRA 247, 248 (2017) ("The Union argues that the Agency's application is insufficient as it fails to cite to the record or summarize the evidence, and it 'only contains two sentences from the [RD's decision] with which the Agency takes exception.' Further, the Union argues that the application is insufficient for the Authority to rule on without referring to the record. We find that the content of the application satisfies the Authority's regulatory requirements. Because the application states the ground on which the Agency seeks review of the RD's decision and cites evidence to support its argument, we find the application sufficient to resolve on the merits. As a result, we deny the Union's request to dismiss the application.").</p>
