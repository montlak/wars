<p class="Body-Text">Of interpretations of settlement agreements, under <span class="Italic">Raxter v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 248 Fed. Appx. 177, 179 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Settlement agreements are contracts, and its construction presents a question of law that this court reviews <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See Connant v. Off. Of Pers. Mgmt,</span> 255 F.3d 1371, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The question of whether there has been a material breach of a settlement agreement is a mixed question of law and fact. <span class="Italic">See Gilbert v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 334 F.3d 1065, 1071 (Fed. Cir. 2003). We review the Board's factual findings for substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See Parker v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 819 F.2d 1113, 1115 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kent v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 660 Fed. Appx. 916, 918 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP), added:</p>

Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 142 F.3d 1463, 1467 (Fed. Cir. 1998).

Dep't of the Navy</span>, 130 F.3d 1031, <span id="Page_5245"></span>1033 (Fed. Cir. 1997). If it is, we enforce the contract according to its terms. <span class="Italic">Pagan v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 170 F.3d 1368, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 1999). If any ambiguity exists, we interpret the contract to reflect the intent of the parties at the time the agreement was made. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wilson v. USDA</span> (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">A reviewing court need not defer to the Board's interpretation of a contract, e.g., a settlement agreement, <span class="Italic">King v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 130 F.3d 1031, 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The interpretation of a settlement agreement is an issue of law. <span class="Italic">See Mays v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 995 F.2d 1056, 1059 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In interpreting a written agreement, we first ascertain whether the written understanding is clearly stated and was clearly understood by the parties. If ambiguity is found, or if ambiguity has arisen during performance of the agreement, the judicial role is to implement the intent of the parties at the time the agreement was made.

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is plain from the face of the agreement that in exchange for dismissing his appeal, the agency agreed to allow Hernandez to be enrolled in the PPP for a one-year period after the effective date of the agreement. As part of the settlement agreement, the agency agreed (a) that it would remove a reprimand from Hernandez's record, (b) that "[b]ecause of the removal of the Decision of Reprimand, the appellant is now eligible to be re-considered for registration" in the PPP under the agency's regulations, and (c) that Hernandez would be "re-considered for placement in the PPP for a period of one year beginning 7 calendar days after the last signature on this Agreement." Hernandez received no other consideration under the agreement. Construing the settlement agreement as giving the agency the option not to enroll Hernandez in the PPP would come close to rendering the settlement agreement illusory.[1] Such a construction is disfavored. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 Margaret N.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the Federal Circuit did not make an explicit finding as to whether the agency's breach of the settlement agreement was material. A material breach relates to a matter of vital importance or goes to the essence of the contract. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 124 F.3d 1439, 1442 (Fed. Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">Wells v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 228, &#x00B6; 18 (2001). We find that the agency's obligation to enroll the appellant in the PPP for 12 months after the effective date of the settlement agreement was a matter of vital importance to the contract, and we therefore conclude that the agency committed a material breach.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When one party commits a material breach of a settlement agreement, the other party is entitled to either enforce the settlement agreement or to rescind it and to reinstate his or her appeal. <span class="Italic">Mullins v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 206, &#x00B6; 12 (1998). Although it appears that the appellant has been seeking enforcement of the settlement agreement rather than rescission, he should have the opportunity to reconsider that choice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that this does not appear to be a case in which enforcement of the agreement would be impossible or ineffective. <span class="Italic">See Diehl v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 620, &#x00B6; 14 (1999) (where the agency had paid the appellant all of the money he was due under the settlement agreement and the agency's breach of a nondisclosure provision had already occurred, an order of enforcement would not have been an effective remedy). It appears that the agency could retroactively enroll the appellant in the PPP for the period between July 3, 2007, the day after the agency cancelled the appellant's enrollment, and February 24, 2008, exactly 1 year and 7 days after the last signature on the settlement agreement. The agency has already taken essentially the same action for the period between February 20 and July 2, 2007, and the agency conceded at oral argument before the Federal Circuit that it could have enrolled the appellant in the PPP for a period extending beyond 1 year after his separation, <span class="Italic">see Hernandez</span>, 325 Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Jacqueline L. Washington-Thomas seeks review of the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board dismissing her appeal as settled<span class="Italic">. Washington-Thomas v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> No. AT0752010577-I-1 (MSPB Aug. 28, 2002). Because the record and the findings of the board are insufficient for us to determine whether an oral settlement agreement was entered into, we vacate the decision and remand the case to the board for further consideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's Initial Decision stated that she was "present through all of the discussions when the settlement was reached.... " The agency does not dispute, however, that she was absent from part of the afternoon proceedings and the record before us does not indicate what transpired during her absence. The parties dispute the consequences, if any, that the administrative judge's absence had on settlement negotiations. Washington-Thomas claims negotiations broke down after the administrative judge's departure and that the parties reached an insurmountable impasse with respect to some material issues. The government disagrees, and the board does not address this facet of the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board also does not address other aspects of the case that appear to be material. The record is devoid of any discussions of the alleged pending EEO complaints. The agency argues that Washington-Thomas failed to point to any evidence in the record that she had filed her EEO complaints with the board or that the board had jurisdiction to consider such complaints. Standing alone, the absence of findings with respect to the EEO complaints would likely not sway our decision. But the board also fails to address the administrative judge's absence, and at least one other aspect of the alleged agreement. Washington-Thomas contends that either the agency misrepresented the type of disability benefit available, or the agency was in doubt about the benefits for which she would be eligible. The board did not decide whether this term was material or whether the parties lacked a mutual understanding about the benefits. If the term was material, and the parties had not yet reached a final understanding, then mutuality of assent may have been lacking. Without addressing the underlying factual issues, the board expressed the ultimate conclusion that the parties entered into a binding settlement agreement terminating all aspects of the dispute. The formation of a contract requires "a bargain in which there is a manifestation of mutual assent to the exchange and a consideration." Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 17(1) (1981).

Where, as here, the facts are undisputed, the determination of whether there has been material non-compliance with the terms of a contract, and hence breach, necessarily reduces to a question of law. <span class="Italic">See Carborundum Co. v.
