<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-76"><span class="space">e.</span> Belated Receipt of OSC Closeout Notice</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 CFR 1209.5 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">General rule</span>. The appellant must seek corrective action from the Special Counsel before appealing to the Board unless the action being appealed is otherwise appealable directly to the Board and the appellant has elected a direct appeal. (See &#x00A7; 1209.2(d) regarding election of remedies under 5 U.S.C. 7121(g)). Where the appellant has sought corrective action, the time limit for filing an appeal with the Board is governed by 5 U.S.C. 1214(a)(3). Under that section, an appeal must be filed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;No later than 65 days after the date of issuance of the Special Counsel's written notification to the appellant that it was terminating its investigation of the appellant's allegations or, if the appellant shows that the Special Counsel's notification was received more than 5 days after the date of issuance, within 60 days after the date the appellant received the Special Counsel's notification; or,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;At any time after the expiration of 120 days, if the Special Counsel has not notified the appellant that it will seek corrective action on the appellant's behalf within 120 days of the date of filing of the request for corrective action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Equitable tolling; extension of filing deadline</span>. The appellant's deadline for filing an individual right of action appeal with the Board after receiving written notification from the Special Counsel that it is terminating its investigation of his or her allegations is subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling, which permits the Board to extend the deadline where the appellant, despite having diligently pursued his or her rights, was unable to make a timely filing. Examples include cases involving deception or in which the appellant filed a defective pleading during the statutory period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Appeals after a stay request</span>. Where an appellant has filed a request for a stay with the Board without first filing an appeal of the action, the appeal must be filed within 30 days after the date the appellant receives the order ruling on the stay request. Failure to timely file the appeal will result in the termination of any stay that has been granted unless a good reason for the delay is shown.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Belated receipt by the appellant of the OSC closeout notice appears to extend the period for filing an appeal, if the conditions of the governing regulation are met, <span class="Italic">Walsh v. SSA</span>, 93 MSPR 617, 619-21 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7 (2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An IRA appeal must be filed "no more than 60 days" after "notification was provided" that OSC terminated its investigation of the appellant's complaint, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(A), or, where the appellant "has not been notified," any time after 120 days have passed from the filing of the OSC complaint, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(B). The Board's regulation implementing this statute provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Where the appellant has sought corrective action [from OSC], the time limit for filing an appeal with the Board is governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3). Under that section, an appeal must be filed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;No later than 65 days after the date of issuance of the Office of Special Counsel's written notification to the appellant that it was terminating its investigation of the appellant's allegations or, if the appellant shows that the Special Counsel's notification was received more than 5 days after the date of issuance, within 60 days after the date the appellant received the Special Counsel's notification; or,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;If the Office of Special Counsel has not notified the appellant that it will seek corrective action on the appellant's behalf within 120 days of the date of filing of the request for corrective action, at any time after the expiration of 120 days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(a). The appellant bears the burden of proving that this appeal was timely filed. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(ii) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(B)].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision finds that the timeliness question is controlled by subsection (1) of section 1209.5(a). The initial decision appears to have taken as true, for purposes of analysis, the appellant's allegation that he did not receive a termination letter from OSC before filing this appeal, and that he was told in a telephone call in September 2001 that OSC terminated its investigation on July 25, 2001; the initial decision then concludes that the filing period began to run on July 25, 2001. We disagree with this approach because it is inconsistent with the plain language of the regulation. Section 1209.5(a)(1) provides that the IRA filing deadline is determined by the date OSC's termination letter was issued, <span class="Italic">unless</span>, as alleged by the appellant, the appellant did not receive it within 5 days of issuance, in which case the appeal is due within 60 days the appellant's receipt of OSC's "notification." If the appellant's account is credited, and assuming solely for the sake of argument that a telephonic contact as the appellant claims occurred in the present case could constitute "notification" under the regulation, the earliest the appellant could be considered to have received such notification was September 13, 2001, fewer than 60 days before his October 1, 2001 filing of this appeal. The appeal was thus timely filed. As set forth in the appellant's alternative argument, if the IRA filing deadline under section 1209.5(a)(1) is not triggered until receipt of OSC's <span class="Italic">written</span> termination notice, and if the appellant's account is credited, then the 60-day filing period never began to run and the appeal was timely filed under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our analysis is consistent with the purpose underlying section 1209.5(a)(1). Prior to 1997, the regulation provided simply that an IRA appeal was due within 65 days of the date of issuance of OSC's letter terminating its investigation or, absent termination, any time after 120 days from the filing of the OSC complaint. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(a) (1996). As explained in <span class="Italic">King v. Department of Health &#x0026;,</span> <span class="Italic">Human Services,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 22, 30-31 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">By specifying [in the regulation] that the filing period begins on the date of issuance [of OSC's termination letter], rather than on the date of mailing or on the date of receipt, the Board was not indicating that the latter two events are unnecessary. If OSC "issues" a notification letter, but does not mail it to an employee, or if OSC issues and mails a notification letter to an employee, but the Postal Service never delivers it, the employee could not be said to have been provided with notification as required by the statute, and the 60-day filing period provided by the statute would not begin to run.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">King</span> decision thus presaged the Board's 1997 amendment to section 1209.5(a), in which the proviso was added that if OSC's "notification" was received more than 5 days after the date of issuance, an IRA appeal is due within 60 days after the date of receipt. <span class="Italic">See</span> 62 Fed. Reg. 59,992 (1997). The regulatory amendment was "intended to ensure that an appellant has the full 60 days required by law to file after being provided notification by the Special Counsel that an investigation has been terminated." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In furtherance of that intent, we decline to hold, as the initial decision does, that the 60-day filing period began to run on July 25, 2001, 50 days before the earliest date the appellant can be deemed to have been notified that OSC had terminated its investigation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_3775"></span>Not cited in <span class="Italic">Walsh</span> were a couple earlier decisions that seemed to reject a delay in proper notification of appeal rights from OSC as a basis for extending the time for initiating an appeal<span class="Italic">. Machulas v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3017), determined that the Board's regulation permitting waiver of time limits for some appeals does not extend to IRA appeals:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A petition for an IRA must be filed within sixty-five days after the Office of Special Counsel ("OSC") notifies the petitioner that it is terminating the investigation of his allegations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1209.5(a) (1998); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3) (1994). The parties agree that Machulas did not file his IRA appeal within this time period. Machulas argues, however, that the board should have excused his tardiness because the OSC failed to notify him of his appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See Shiflett v. United States Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Serv.</span>, 839 F.2d 669, 674 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (holding that the agency's failure "to give notice to petitioner of her appeal rights constituted good cause for the late filing').</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In certain types of cases, the board may waive appeal time limits when the petitioner shows good cause for the delay. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.22(c) (1998). Section 1201.22(c) applies to all appeals governed by 5 CFR pt. 1209. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 1209.3. Although part 1209 includes IRA appeals, the board held that section 1201.22(c) does not apply to Machulas' appeal because the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16 (codified in scattered sections of 5 USC) (WPA), "not only created the right to file an IRA appeal, but also set a statutory deadline for the filing of such an appeal, without making any provision for the acceptance of late filings."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree that the WPA precludes waiving the filing deadline for good cause. The statute states that an IRA appeal may be filed if "no more than 60 days have elapsed since notification was provided to [the] employee...that [OSC's] investigation was terminated." 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3). This language unambiguously does not allow for extensions of the filing deadline for good cause. <span class="Italic">Cf. id</span>. &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1) (allowing extensions to a 30-day filing deadline for good cause). Interpreting sections 1201.22(c) and 1209.3 to authorize a good cause waiver for tardy IRA appeals would create a conflict between these regulations and the statute. Because this type of conflict must be avoided, <span class="Italic">see Bendure v. United States</span>, 695 F.2d 1383, 1386-87 (Fed. Cir. 1982), the board correctly held that a good cause waiver was unavailable to Machulas. Although the statute uses a sixty day period and the regulation uses a sixty-five day period, we need not address at this time whether the regulation impermissibly modifies the statute by extending the filing deadline by five days because Machulas met neither deadline. According to the board, the phrase "notification was provided" in 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3) "could be subject to more than one interpretation. It could refer to the date OSC issued its termination notice, the date it mailed this notice to the employee, or to the date the employee received the notice." <span class="Italic">Wood v. Department of Air Force</span>, 54 MSPR 587, 591 (1992). The implementing regulation was meant "to clarify that the time for filing an individual night of action appeal...begins to run from the date of issuance of the Special Counsel's written notification to the appellant and to increase the time limit for filing from 60 to 65 days to allow for mailing time." <span class="Italic">Practices and</span> <span class="Italic">Procedures for Appeals and Stay Requests of Personnel Actions Allegedly Based on</span> <span class="Italic">Whistleblowing</span>, 55 Fed. Reg. 28,591, 28,592 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board also found that Machulas failed to allege any facts that would bring him within the doctrine of equitable tolling, even assuming it applies in this context. This finding is not clearly erroneous....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although <span class="Italic">Machulas</span> was a nonprecedential decision, it was cited with approval in <span class="Italic">Bauer v. Dept. of Army</span>, 88 MSPR 352, 354-55 &#x00B6; 7 (2001), determining that failure of the OSC to notify the appellant of his MSPB appeal rights and of the time for filing his appeal does not excuse an untimely filing following the OSC closeout letter. <span class="Italic">Bauer</span> did not reach equitable tolling.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OSC sends two final letters to a complainant: a letter containing an analysis of the reasons for closure of the case and a letter, without analysis, informing the appellant that the case was closed and that the appellant has 65 days to appeal. The receipt of the termination letter started the clock in <span class="Italic">Stussy v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> SF-1221-14-0068-W-1 n.5 (NP 6/23/2015), despite the failure of OSC to provide the second letter containing appeal rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[5] One of OSC's two close-out letters did not include notice of the appellant's right to appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> November 25, 1997 letter without notice of appeal rights, <span class="Italic">with</span> September 29, 1998 letter containing notice of appeal rights. However, the deadline for filing an IRA appeal cannot be waived for good cause shown, even if an appellant did not receive notice of appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See Bauer v. Department of the Army</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 352, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2001); <span class="Italic">see also Wood v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 587, 592 (1992) (the time limit for filing an IRA appeal cannot be waived for good cause shown); <span class="Italic">Machulas v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, No. 99-3017, 1999 WL 128874 (Fed. Cir. Mar. 5, 1999) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>) (agreeing with the Board that, even though OSC failed to provide Board appeal rights, the statutory language unambiguously did not permit waiver of the filing deadline for good cause). The only requirement for triggering the 60-day time limit for filing an IRA appeal in the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) is OSC's notification that it has terminated its investigation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(A)(ii); <span class="Italic">Bauer</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 352, &#x00B6; 7. The WPA does not make any provision for the acceptance of late filings. <span class="Italic">See Bauer</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 352, &#x00B6; 8. These rules regarding filing deadlines for IRA appeals did not change under the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (WPEA), Pub. L. No. 112-199, 126 Stat. 1465.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, assuming without finding that the doctrine of equitable tolling is available in appropriate circumstances to excuse an untimely filed IRA appeal, we find that the appellant here has alleged no facts that would bring him within the doctrine of equitable tolling. <span class="Italic">See Alexander v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, No. 2014-3215, 2015 WL 1769622, at *2 (Fed. Cir. Apr. 20, 2015) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>) (although "the time limit for filing an IRA appeal cannot be waived for good cause," the Board may inquire as to whether equitable tolling may excuse an untimely filed IRA appeal) (citing <span class="Italic">Pacilli v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 404 F. App'x 466, 469 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>)); <span class="Italic">see also Wood</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. at 591-93 (finding no circumstances to suggest that equitable tolling, even if it could be applied, warranted a waiver of the filing deadline). Consequently, the lack of notice in one of OSC's close out letters does not change our finding regarding the timeliness issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Stussy,</span> after OSC closes out a case, subsequent correspondence from OSC not specifically stating that the case is reopened will not likely toll the IRA filing period:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the appellant contends that he reopened his prior OSC complaints by referencing them in the Form OSC-12 that he submitted to OSC's Disclosure Unit, we disagree. The August 28, 2013 close-out letter from OSC's Disclosure Unit did not indicate that OSC was reopening the appellant's prior complaints, but instead, merely advised him that OSC would take no further action regarding the allegations set forth in his Form OSC-12.</p>
