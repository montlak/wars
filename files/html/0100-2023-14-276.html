<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-277"><span class="space">C.</span> DELAYS IN IMPLEMENTATION PENDING LITIGATION, NOTICE</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2185 and Tooele Army Depot</span>, 31 FLRA 45, 57-60 (1988), disapproved a proposal that the drug testing program not be implemented until all related lawsuits were resolved challenging the underlying Executive Order. The proposal allowed the union to control the date of implementation of the program through the institution and control of litigation. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1999 and AAFES, Dix-McGuire Exch.</span>, 2 FLRA 153 (1979), was distinguished as involving delays resulting from the use of a joint grievance procedure. Advancing its reasoning a tad, FLRA implicitly ruled nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">IAM Local Lodge 830 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Ordnance Station, Louisville</span>, 40 FLRA 354, 354, 358 (1991), a proposal that drug testing be held in abeyance until the Supreme Court ruled on the constitutionality of drug testing programs in the federal sector. That Court, because of its discretionary review authority, might never rule on the issue, meaning that the agency could be prevented entirely from implementing its program. FLRA did not preclude the possibility that a better structured proposal might be negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 446 and Dept. of Interior, Nat'l Park Serv., Blue Ridge Parkway</span>, 43 FLRA 836, 845, 852-54 (1991), a segment of Proposal 2C, preventing testing until challenges were resolved concerning designation of sensitive status was rejected as nonnegotiable because the provision excessively interfered with the agency's ability to determine its internal security practices:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is by now well established that drug testing of designated employees constitutes an exercise of management's right to determine its internal security practices.... Additionally, section 3(a) of Executive Order 12564 mandates the establishment of agency drug testing programs to test for the illegal use of drugs by employees occupying sensitive positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This portion of the proposal, although procedural in form, would have a substantial effect on the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2185 and Tooele Army Depot, Tooele, Utah</span>, 31 FLRA 45, 59 (1988) (<span class="Italic">Tooele Army Depot</span>) (proposal that would have prevented the agency from subjecting employees to drug testing until all union or unit employee challenges to Executive Order 12564 and various regulations were resolved directly and excessively interfered with the agency's right to determine its internal security practices). Thus, the fourth sentence of the instant proposal would immunize employees, all of whom had been designated as having sensitive status, from testing during the pendency of an appeal. In our view, the ability to test employees in sensitive positions is of paramount concern to an agency's internal security. This view is compelled by section 3(a) of Executive Order 12564, which mandates the establishment of drug testing programs to detect illegal drug use by employees in sensitive positions and also by the very nature of sensitive positions and the duties performed by employees occupying such positions. The clear import of a scheme to test employees in sensitive positions is to detect illegal drug use among those whose illegal drug use may endanger the public health or safety or the national security. <span class="Italic">See</span> section 5(c) of Executive Order 12564.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fourth sentence of the proposal is distinguishable from proposals that simply require the suspension of actions pending resolution of an appeal through a negotiated grievance and arbitration procedure.&#x2003;For example, in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1999 and Army-Air Force Exchange Service, Dix-McGuire Exchange, Fort Dix, New Jersey</span>, 2 FLRA 153 (1979)...the Authority found negotiable a proposal that required the stay of disciplinary actions until completion of an appeal through the negotiated grievance and arbitration procedure. However, such proposals are not categorically negotiable. Subsequent to <span class="Italic">Dix-McGuire</span>, the Authority found that where an agency would be prevented from taking disciplinary actions that are prescribed by law, a proposal to stay such disciplinary actions directly and excessively interfered with the agency's right to discipline<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Council 214 and U.S. Department of the Air Force</span>, 38 FLRA 309, 320 (1990).... Significantly, the proposal here would place an absolute prohibition on the Agency's ability to test employees in sensitive positions during the appeal process. Nothing in the plain language of the proposal itself or the Union's explanation of the proposal would permit the Agency to make any exception to the prohibition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the fourth sentence of the proposal is distinguishable from a proposal seeking to delay the implementation of drug testing pending completion of negotiations.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 128 and U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation</span>, 39 FLRA 1500, 1504-06 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Bureau of Reclamation</span>). In <span class="Italic">Bureau of Reclamation</span>, we found that the proposal would only require the agency to meet its bargaining obligation under the Statute and would not prevent the agency from exercising its rights under the Statute. We explained that the proposal would not prevent the agency from implementing changes where those changes were consistent with the necessary functioning of the agency or once the matters before the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and/or the Federal Service Impasses Panel were resolved. Thus, while recognizing that delay in the implementation of an agency's drug testing program is negotiable, we noted that the agency would retain flexibility in exercising its rights under the Statute. Here, by contrast, the Agency's ability to test employees in sensitive positions would be completely proscribed during the pendency of an appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the proposal would excessively interfere with the exercise of management's right to determine its internal security practices. Thus, while the proposal would constitute a significant benefit to employees, the benefit would be obtained at the cost of protecting the security of the Agency's property, personnel, and operations from the effects of possible illegal drug use by employees occupying sensitive positions. Thus, the burden imposed on the Agency by its inability to test those employees until a challenge is resolved could result in a substantially increased risk to the Agency's security and, on balance, outweighs the benefit to employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">Reviewed in <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 3097 and DOJ, Justice Mgmt. Div.</span>, 42 FLRA 412, 436, 438-40 (1991), was Proposal 9, that "[t]he individual notice of drug testing shall not be sent to employees until at least 60 days after their receipt of the general notice of drug testing." The proposal was negotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Executive Order 12564 and FPM Letter 792-19 provide, respectively, that general and special notices concerning drug testing be sent to employees. Section 4(a) of the Executive Order requires, with an exception not relevant here, that "[s]ixty days prior to the implementation of a drug testing program pursuant to this order, agencies shall notify employees that testing for use of illegal drugs is to be conducted...." FPM Letter 792-19, section 4.b., provides that "[a]gencies should ensure a specific notice is given, in writing, to each employee in a TDP [testing designated position] no later than thirty days before testing commences."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the proposal would require that employees be given 60-day individual notices in addition to the required 60-day general notice. Similarly, the Union refers to the proposal as encompassing an "additional 60 days...." We disagree, however, and find for the following reasons that these assertions are inconsistent with the plain wording of the proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 9 prevents the Agency from sending the specific, or individual, notice informing employees that they are in TDPs until 60 days after they have received the general notice required by the Executive Order. That is, as plainly worded, Proposal 9 addresses only the timing of the receipt of the specific notice. The proposal does not establish, implicitly or explicitly, the length of the individual notice period itself. Moreover, there are no assertions in the record that the parties otherwise have agreed that employees would receive any more individual advance notice than the 30 days required by section 4.b. of FPM Letter 792-19. We assume, therefore, for the purposes of this decision, that Proposal 9 would require the Agency to wait until the 61st day after an employee's receipt of the general notice to provide the specific notice and that, consistent with the FPM Letter, the specific notice would provide 30 days' notice. In practical effect, the proposal would preclude the Agency from implementing a random testing program for 30 days beyond that required by law and regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's assertion that, by precluding the Agency from implementing testing on the 61st day after issuance of the general notice, Proposal 9 conflicts with section 4(a) of the Executive Order as well as the "spirit" of the FPM Letter.... Nothing in section 4(a) of the Executive Order or in FPM Letter 792-19 requires that testing begin on the 61st day following issuance of the general notice. Indeed, section 4.a. of the FPM Letter provides that agencies must "ensure that <span class="Italic">at least</span> sixty days elapse between a general one-time notice...and the beginning of actual drug testing." (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that there is no basis for the Agency's assertion that Proposal 9 would directly interfere with management's right to discipline employees by preventing testing based on reasonable suspicion or accident/unsafe practice during the individual notice period. Nothing in the plain language of Proposal 9, or the Union's statement of intent regarding it, would affect drug testing based on reasonable suspicion or an accident/unsafe practice during that period or during the 60-day general notice period. We note, in this regard, that the individual notice encompassed by the FPM Letter relates only to random drug testing. Moreover, the Union's arguments relate only to random testing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency's use of random testing as a part of its drug testing program constitutes an exercise of management's right to determine its internal security practices. <span class="Italic">Fort Leavenworth</span>, 38 FLRA at 1203, 1207. Consistent with the interpretation of the proposal we previously adopted, Proposal 9 would require the Agency to provide employees with 30 days' specific notice of random testing. In practical effect, the proposal would preclude the Agency from implementing a random testing program for 30 days <span id="page_815"></span>beyond that required by law and regulation. It is not clear, in this regard, that the proposal directly interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 3732 and U.S. Department of Transportation, United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York</span>, 39 FLRA 187, 202-07 (1991) (provision requiring agency to provide employee with notice before effective date of adverse action held not to directly interfere with agency's rights to assign work or to direct, discipline, or remove employees) <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1214 and Department of the Army, Health Services Command, Moncrief Army Community Hospital, Fort Jackson, South Carolina</span>, 40 FLRA 1181, 1187 (1991) (proposal preventing the agency from implementing new qualification standards until specified date held to directly interfere with agency's rights to assign work and employees). However, in the circumstances of this case, and consistent with the Union's argument that the proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement, we will assume such interference for the purposes of this decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the question of whether Proposal 9 excessively interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices, we find that the proposal would benefit employees by giving them additional time to locate and enter drug treatment programs. The Agency recognizes that providing employees with opportunities to enter such programs is beneficial by noting that the individual notices provide "employees...an additional incentive to quit <span class="Italic">and</span> an opportunity to enter the 'safe harbor' program...<span class="Italic">before</span> they became subject to random testing."... This is a significant benefit to employees and one which is consistent with an overall goal of the drug testing program: "to offer drug users a helping hand and, at the same time, demonstrating...that drugs will not be tolerated in the Federal workplace." Executive Order 12564 (Preamble).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the negative effect on management's right to determine its internal security practices, the proposal would delay the implementation of random testing of unit employees for 30 days beyond that required by law and regulation. The Agency's rights to conduct other types of drug testing would not be affected by the proposal, however. In particular, the Agency would be free to investigate accidents or unsafe practices and, in addition, to act on reasonable suspicions that individual employees were using illegal drugs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Balancing the benefit to employees against the burden imposed on the Agency by Proposal 9, we conclude that the proposal would not excessively interfere with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. Accordingly, we conclude that Proposal 9 constitutes an appropriate arrangement and is within the Agency's duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent">For similar reasons, FLRA saw no negotiability impediment in <span class="Italic">IFPTE Local 89 and Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Grand Coulee Project Office</span>, 48 FLRA 516, 524, 525 (1993), to Proposal III.A, soliciting agreement that "[a]t least 30 days prior to implementation of the agency's drug testing program, the employer shall inform each bargaining unit employee occupying a testing designated position (TDP) in writing" of elements of the drug testing program. The proposal did not call for 30 days' advance notice of a drug test. Section 4(a) of Exec. Order 12564 requires 60 days' notice to employees before implementation of an agency drug testing program.</p>
