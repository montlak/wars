<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-275"><span class="space">a.</span> Failure to Honor Arbitration Award</h5>
<p class="noindent">As to the date initiating the six-month ULP filing period, an arbitration award does not become final, in the judgment of one court, until 30 days (the time allowed for exceptions) from its date of issuance. A ULP charging a failure to comply with a final award may be filed within six months of the date the award becomes final. Because of the statutory right to file exceptions, it was immaterial that a contract stated that the arbitrator's award would be final and binding. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force v. FLRA</span>, 775 F.2d 727, 732-33 (6th Cir. 1985). The analytical problem occurs when events relating to enforcement or compliance with the award occur after its finality date.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a line of reasoning that was largely rejected by, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 392 F.3d 498 (D.C. Cir. 2004), <span class="Italic">post</span>, FLRA concluded that the failure of an agency to honor an arbitration award is not a continuing violation; the ULP charge must be filed within six months of the date of finality of the award, measured from the last date for filing exceptions to the award if no exceptions are filed, or there must be extenuating circumstances justifying equitable tolling of the limitation period. The theory of a continuing violation of the statute arising from an agency's failure to abide by an arbitrator's award was considered, and rejected, in <span class="Italic">EEOC and AFGE Local 3637</span>, 53 FLRA 487, 492-501 (1997), considering both the nature of the "continuing violation" theory and the doctrine of equitable tolling:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons explained below, we find that the charge upon which the complaint was based was filed outside the time limitations of section 7118(a)(4) of the Statute. Therefore, we dismiss the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In so concluding, we first find that the limitations period for filing the ULP charge began when the award became final and binding on February 23, 1994. As the charge was not filed until December 30, 1994, it was filed beyond the 6-month period prescribed in section 7118(a)(4). Having concluded that the complaint was not timely filed, we then analyze whether the failure to comply with the arbitrator's award constituted a "continuing violation," or whether, in the circumstances of this case, the limitations period of section 7118(a)(4) should be equitably tolled.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Limitations Period Commenced on February 23</span>, <span class="Italic">1994</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7122, an arbitration award becomes final and binding after the period for filing exceptions expires and no exceptions have been filed or after timely filed exceptions have been denied by the Authority. <span class="Italic">DHHS</span>, 41 FLRA at 765-66. Analogously, in cases such as this one arising under section 7121(f) of the Statute, an arbitration award becomes final and binding after completion of the appeal process provided at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(d). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 767 (citing <span class="Italic">United States Army</span>, <span class="Italic">Adjutant General Publications Center, St. Louis, Mo.</span>, 22 FLRA 200, 207 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Adjutant General Publications Center)</span>). The appeal process is complete upon the expiration of the 30-day period in which to appeal where no appeal is taken, <span class="Italic">Adjutant</span> <span class="Italic">General Publications Center</span>, 22 FLRA at 207-208, or upon final judicial action on appeal, <span class="Italic">DHHS</span>, 41 FLRA at 767-68. No appeal of Lazar's award was taken to the Federal Circuit in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span>, the Authority determined that an agency's obligation to comply with an arbitrator's award begins when the award becomes final and binding (citing <span class="Italic">United States Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force, Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force</span> <span class="Italic">Base</span>, Ohio, 15 FLRA 151, 153 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 775 F.2d 727 (6th Cir. 1985)). <span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span>, 24 FLRA at 1025. The Authority further held that the 6-month period for filing a ULP charge alleging noncompliance with the arbitrator's award also commences at that time. 24 FLRA at 1025; <span class="Italic">accord Department of the Air Force v. FLRA</span>, 775 F.2d 727, 732-33 (6th Cir. 1985).</p>

<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Case Precedent and Rationale</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to considering whether the "continuing violation" theory is applicable here, we review precedent developed under the Statute and examine the rationale supporting the "continuing violation" theory under an analogous provision of the NLRA.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Authority Precedent</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding that the Respondent's failure to comply with Lazar's award was a continuing violation, the Judge relied on <span class="Italic">Portsmouth Naval Shipyard</span>, the only case in which the Authority applied such a theory. There the Authority adopted, without comment, the Judge's recommended decision and order, including his finding that "failure to comply with an arbitration award constitutes a continuing violation; thus, the six month statute of limitations cannot bar an action against the [Respondent]." 21 FLRA at 204 n.1<span class="Italic">. Portsmouth</span> <span class="Italic">Naval Shipyard</span> was subsequently reversed on other grounds by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v. FLRA</span>, 815 F.2d 797 (1st Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority next addressed the application of section 7118(a)(4) in the context of an alleged refusal to comply with an arbitrator's award in <span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span>. There, however, the Authority declined to apply a continuing violation theory. The Judge in that case had relied on a continuing violation theory to find the charge was not time barred even though it was filed more than 6 months after the arbitrator's award became final and binding. <span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span>, 24 FLRA at 1035-1040. On exceptions, however, the Authority found the charge to be timely filed on different grounds, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that in the circumstances of that case, the limitations period was equitably tolled. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1024-25.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although it did not specifically address the Judge's use of a continuing violation theory, the Authority implicitly rejected such a theory in analyzing section 7118(a)(4)'s application in noncompliance cases. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. As noted earlier, the Authority concluded that an agency's obligation to comply with an arbitrator's award begins when the award becomes final and binding; as a result, the 6-month period for filing a ULP charge alleging noncompliance with the arbitrator's award also commences at that time. <span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span>, 24 FLRA at 1025.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has not subsequently applied a continuing violation theory in ULP cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Precedent and Rationale Supporting the "Continuing Violation" Theory Under the NLRA</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As previously recognized by the Authority, section 7118(a)(4) is substantially identical to the limitations provisions of section 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 USC 160(b), and the Authority has looked to private sector precedent for guidance in applying section 7118(a)(4). <span class="Italic">U.S. Army Armament Research Development and Engineering Center, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey</span>, 52 FLRA 527, 533-34 (1996) (<span class="Italic">Picatinny Arsenal</span>). Although the National Labor Relations Board ("NLRB" or "Board") has applied a "continuing violation" theory to permit prosecution of certain ULP charges where the initial statutory violation occurred outside the limitations period, <span class="Italic">see e.g., NLRB v. Anchor Rome</span> <span class="Italic">Mills</span>, 228 F.2d 775 (5th Cir. 1956), recent Board precedent has disfavored its use.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court has recognized two policies underlying section 10(b) of the NLRA. These dual policies are to: (1) bar litigation over distant events; and (2) to stabilize existing bargaining relationships. <span class="Italic">Machinists Local 1424 v. NLRB</span>, 362 U.S. 411, 419 (1960) (<span class="Italic">Machinists Local 1424</span>). The Board has found that extending the period in which ULP charges may be filed through the application of a continuing violation theory undermines these policies. <span class="Italic">Chambersburg County Market</span>, 293 NLRB 654, 655 (1989) (refusal to execute a collective bargaining agreement is not a continuing violation); <span class="Italic">A &#x0026; L</span> <span class="Italic">Underground</span>, 302 NLRB 467, 468-69 (1991) (repudiation of a collective bargaining agreement is not a continuing violation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board first found that a rule which tolerates delay in filing charges tends to impair the adjudication process.&#x2003;"[A] respondent's ability to prepare a defense is increasingly prejudiced as those circumstances [giving rise to the charge] become more distant in time and pertinent evidence grows increasingly stale." <span class="Italic">A &#x0026; L Underground</span>, 302 NLRB at 468-69 (citing <span class="Italic">Machinists Local 1424</span>, 362 U.S. at 419). This is because as time passes "records have been destroyed, witnesses have gone elsewhere, and recollections of the events in question have become dim and confused." <span class="Italic">Machinists Local 1424</span>, 362 U.S. at 419.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, according to the Board, applying a continuing violation theory injures the stability of collective bargaining relationships because the enforceable rights and obligations of the parties are allowed to remain an open question indefinitely. <span class="Italic">A &#x0026; L Underground</span>, 302 NLRB at 468. In that regard, a party has an interest in being able to conclude that its actions have passed without challenge and is, therefore, able to act accordingly. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. As the Board has concluded, the continuing violation theory "fails to foster a climate in which both parties to a collective bargaining relationship are able to assess their obligations to each other expeditiously and with reasonable certainty, and it thereby impairs the statutory goal of stabilizing collective bargaining relationships<span class="Italic">." Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Respondent's Failure to Comply With the</span> <span class="Italic">Arbitrator's Award Is Not a Continuing Violation</span> <span class="Italic">Subject to the Limitations Period of Section</span> <span class="Italic">7118(a)(4</span>)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Supreme Court and the NLRB's interpretation of section 10(b) of the NLRA is sound and, as we have recognized in the past, germane to the application of section 7118(a)(4)(A). As a result, we conclude that section 7118(a)(4) of the Statute, like section 10(b) of the NLRA, is designed to effectuate the dual policies of stability of collective bargaining relationships and avoidance of stale litigation. We agree with the NLRB that application of a continuing violation theory tends to <span id="page_1560"></span>undermine these policy goals. Indiscriminately applying a continuing violation theory to instances of noncompliance with an arbitrator's award could subject a noncomplying party with indefinite liability. As the NLRB noted, stability is furthered when after a definite period a party may be assured that its conduct is no longer subject to legal challenge. <span class="Italic">A &#x0026; L</span> <span class="Italic">Underground</span>, 302 NLRB at 468.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, strict application of section 7118(a)(4) in noncompliance cases does not work undue hardship on the party seeking compliance. A party has the right to expect compliance with an arbitrator's award once it becomes final and binding. If a party believes that compliance is not being effectuated, it may take appropriate action. Options include filing a ULP or inquiring of the other party concerning the status of the arbitrator's award. If this latter course were chosen, a noncomplying party could not escape liability by assuring future compliance while letting the 6-month period run without effectuating compliance. Such conduct on the part of the noncomplying party would constitute concealment of its noncompliance and would be grounds for tolling the limitations period under section 7118(a)(4)(B). In this way, and under other appropriate circumstances, as discussed below, the 6-month limitation period of section 7118(a)(4) is subject to tolling where the balance of the equities so require.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For these reasons, we conclude that the Respondent's failure to comply with Lazar's award is not a "continuing violation" of the Statute.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;As noted above, we believe that <span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span> effectively overruled <span class="Italic">Portsmouth Naval Shipyard</span> with respect to the applicability of a continuing violation theory. Nonetheless even if <span class="Italic">Portsmouth Naval Shipyard</span> has any viability, it will no longer be followed to the extent it is inconsistent with the decision here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Equitable Tolling</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Case Precedent and Rationale</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union's charge was filed December 30, 1994, more than 10 months after the award became final and binding. Accordingly, unless the 6-month limitations period is tolled, the charge was untimely filed. The doctrine of equitable tolling permits suspension of a statute of limitations under appropriate circumstances. Prior to deciding whether to apply the doctrine of equitable tolling in this case, we analyze equitable tolling cases decided under the Statute and consider Supreme Court and other precedent articulating the policies and purposes of equitable tolling.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Authority Precedent</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Authority precedent establishes that the time limit in section 7118(a)(4)(A) is a statute of limitations and subject to equitable tolling. <span class="Italic">E.g., Picatinny Arsenal</span>, 52 FLRA at 533-34. The Authority treated section 7118(a)(4)(A) as a statute of limitations in <span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span>, the only case in which the Authority has applied the doctrine of equitable tolling. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 533 n.4 (discussing <span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span>, 24 FLRA at 1025-26).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span> the Authority found that the statute of limitations should have been tolled because the union did not "sleep on its rights," but diligently sought to have the arbitrator's award enforced through appropriate mechanisms. 24 FLRA at 1026. The Authority found that the union was prevented, through no fault of its own, from filing an actionable charge within the statutory time frame.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The facts in <span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span> were, in the Authority's words, "unique." 24 FLRA at 1026. The union had filed a ULP charge well within the 6-month period commencing on the date the award became final and binding. That charge was ultimately dismissed on the ground that agency exceptions to the award were pending before the Authority. The union continued to pursue the agency's compliance with the award through "numerous requests, meetings and ULP charges<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. However, through a series of events, none of which were within its control, the union was "left without an actionable charge" filed within the 6-month period. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Authority held that under these circumstances the limitations period should be equitably tolled and found the union's last ULP charge to be timely filed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Precedent and Rationale Supporting the</span> <span class="Italic">Equitable Tolling Theory</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Burnett</span>, the Supreme Court discussed the competing policy interests at work in the application of the doctrine of equitable tolling. The Court found that statutes of limitations are primarily designed to ensure fairness to defendants by "preventing surprises through the revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared." 380 U.S. at 428 (internal quotations omitted). According to the Court, "even if one has a just claim it is unjust not to put the adversary on notice to defend within the period of limitation and...the right to be free of stale claims in time comes to prevail over the right to prosecute them<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. (internal quotations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, a defendant's right to be free of stale claims is "frequently outweighed...where the interests of justice require the vindication of the plaintiff's rights." <span class="Italic">Burnett</span>, 380 U.S. at 428. Courts have applied the doctrine of equitable tolling and suspended statutes of limitations "where strict application (of the statute of limitations] would be inequitable." <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Heine</span>, 984 F.2d 489, 491, (D.C. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically addressing the statute of limitations found in section 10(b) of the NLRA, the First Circuit has stated that equitable tolling is "appropriate only when the circumstances that cause a plaintiff to miss a filing deadline are out of his [or her] hands." <span class="Italic">Kelley v. NLRB</span>, 79 F.3d 1238, 1248 (1st Cir. 1996) (<span class="Italic">Kelley</span>) (quoting from <span class="Italic">Heidemen v. PFL, Inc.</span>, 904 F.2d 1262, 1266 (8th Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 498 U.S. 1026 (1991). In <span class="Italic">Kelley</span>, the court identified five factors that "Courts generally weigh" in assessing claims for equitable tolling. 79 F.3d at 1248. Those factors are: (1) lack of actual notice of filing requirements; (2) lack of constructive knowledge of filing requirements; (3) diligence in pursuing one's rights; (4) absence of prejudice to the defendant and (5) a plaintiff's reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the notice requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Factors 1, 2, and 5 all concern plaintiff's knowledge (actual or constructive) of the filing requirements. With respect to those factors, courts generally impute constructive knowledge to plaintiffs who consult with an attorney. <span class="Italic">Kelley</span>, 79 F.3d at 1249. Further, the general rule is that "those who deal with the Government are expected to know the law....&#8197;<span class="Italic">Heckler v. Community Health Services</span>, 467 U.S. 51, 63 1984). Factor 3 addresses how assiduously a plaintiff pursued his or her rights in a given case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Lastly, factor 4 is to be considered "once [another] factor that might justify such tolling is identified, [but, the lack of prejudice to a defendant] is not an independent basis for invoking the doctrine and sanctioning deviations from established procedures." <span class="Italic">Kelley</span>, 79 F.3d at 1250 (quoting <span class="Italic">Baldwin County Welcome Center v. Brown</span>, 466 U.S. 147, 152 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Circumstances of This Case Do Not Warrant</span> <span class="Italic">Tolling of the Limitations Period</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Filing a Related Action in a Forum That</span> <span class="Italic">Clearly Lacks Jurisdiction Will Not Toll</span> <span class="Italic">the Limitation Period of Section 7118(a)(4</span>)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge's rationale for equitably tolling the 6-month limitation period was that through the District Court action, filed within the relevant time frame but dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, the Union sought appropriate relief and put the Respondent on notice of its intent to litigate the matter. The Judge cited <span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span> in support of his conclusion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span> is distinguishable from the instant case. Specifically, in <span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span> the union diligently pursued its remedy in the proper forum, but through no fault of its own was prevented from filing a charge within the limitations period. In tolling the limitations period in <span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span>, the Authority relied on the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Burnett</span>. There the Supreme Court found equitable tolling appropriate where a plaintiff sought relief timely in a court having jurisdiction, but where the suit was dismissed for improper venue. 380 U.S. at 434-35. In contrast, here, the Union sought relief in a forum that was without jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court has not decided a case where equitable tolling was sought because an action was filed in a forum without jurisdiction.&#x2003;However, those courts of appeal that have addressed the issue have generally concluded that commencement of an action in a forum that "clearly lacks jurisdiction" will not toll a statute of limitations. <span class="Italic">Shofer v. Hack Co.</span>, 970 F.2d 1316, 1319 (4th Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">Shofer</span>); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Silverberg v. Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.</span>, 787 F.2d 1079, 1082 (6th Cir. 1987) (<span class="Italic">Silverberg); Fox v. Eaton Corp.</span>, 615 F.2d 716, 719 (6th Cir. 1980), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span> 450 U.S. 935 (1981) (<span class="Italic">Fox); cf. U.S. v. Maryland Casualty Co.</span>, 573 F.2d 245, 247 (5th Cir. 1978) (filing of federal claim in state court did not interrupt federal statute of limitations). In both <span class="Italic">Shofer</span> and <span class="Italic">Fox</span>, the courts expressly distinguished <span class="Italic">Burnett</span> on the ground that the alternate forum in <span class="Italic">Burnett</span> had jurisdiction over the matter at issue but the case had been dismissed for improper venue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Noting virtual unanimity in the Circuits which have considered the issue, we hold that filing a related action in a forum that clearly lacks jurisdiction will not toll the limitations period of section 7118(a)(4) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the District Court clearly lacked jurisdiction over the Union's action to enforce Lazar's award. Accordingly, we find the Union's charge, filed more than 10 months after the arbitrator's award became final and binding, was barred by section 7118(a)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent">The reasoning of <span class="Italic">EEOC </span>was reaffirmed in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 59 FLRA 282, 287-89 (2003) (vacated and remanded by <span class="Italic">NTEU v.

<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Authority's decisions in<span class="Italic"> EEOC </span>and Luke <span class="Italic">AFB</span>, and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in <span class="Italic">Dep't of the AF</span> have previously established that the 6-month period for filing a ULP charge alleging noncompliance with an arbitrator's award commences on the date the award becomes final and binding pursuant to &#x00A7; 7122(b) of the Statute. The Authority has made it clear that the language of &#x00A7; 7122(b) requires an agency to <span id="page_1561"></span>take actions required by an arbitrator's award only after the award has become final and binding. <span class="Italic">Wyoming Air Nat'l Guard, Cheyenne, Wyo.</span>, 27 FLRA 759, 762 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reaffirm the Authority's findings in <span class="Italic">EEOC </span>and <span class="Italic">Luke AFB </span>and find as noted by the Authority in <span class="Italic">EEOC </span>that "[b]oth the language of the Statute and established Authority precedent lead us to conclude that the limitations period for filing a ULP charge for failure to comply with an arbitrator's award commences on the date the award becomes final and binding. Such a rule puts all parties to the arbitration proceedings on notice as to their respective rights and obligations." 53 FLRA at 493. This rule effectuates the purpose of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7118(a)(4) and 7122 of the Statute because through its application parties are able to assess their obligations to each other expeditiously and with reasonable certainty, which fosters "stability of collective bargaining relationships." <span class="Italic">EEOC</span>, 53 FLRA at 495 ("[S]ection 7118(a)(4) of the Statute, like &#x00A7; 10(b) of the NLRA is designed to effectuate the dual policies of stability of collective bargaining relationships and avoidance of stale litigation.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaffirming <span class="Italic">EEOC</span>, we reject the GC's assertion that <span class="Italic">EEOC </span>is not applicable because the cases, including <span class="Italic">Dep't of the AF</span>, relied on by the Authority to determine the limitation period for filing a ULP charge for noncompliance with an award did not concern the issue involved here. In <span class="Italic">Dep't of the AF</span>, the agency argued that the union's ULP charge, alleging that the agency had failed to implement an award, was "time-barred under...&#x00A7; 7118(a)(4)(A)" of the Statute. 775 F.2d at 731. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals first determined that the ULP charge was not time-barred. The court stated that an agency is only required under &#x00A7; 7122 of the Statute "to 'take the actions required by an arbitrator's final award[.]'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 732. Further noting that the Authority had held that a failure to implement an award pending resolution of timely filed exceptions is not a ULP, the court determined that "the limitation period for filing [a ULP] charge based on a refusal to implement an arbitration award begins to run on the date an award becomes final pursuant to &#x00A7; 7122(b)." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 732-33.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, as to the General Counsel's assertion that application of the rule established in <span class="Italic">EEOC </span>should not mandate a finding of untimeliness because an award may require a series of actions before a determination is made on whether an agency is going to comply, similar arguments have been considered previously by the Authority. In <span class="Italic">EEOC</span>, the Authority considered the effect of a noncomplying party's actions on a strict application of the limitation period in &#x00A7; 7118(a)(4) of the Statute. The Authority stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A party has the right to expect compliance with an arbitrator's award once it becomes final and binding. If a party believes that compliance is not being effectuated, it may take appropriate action. Options include filing a ULP or inquiring of the other party concerning the status of the arbitrator's award. If this latter course were chosen, a noncomplying party could not escape liability by assuring future compliance while letting the 6-month period run without effectuating compliance. Such conduct on the part of the noncomplying party would constitute concealment of its noncompliance and would be grounds for tolling the limitations period under section 7118(a)(4)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">53 FLRA at 496 (footnote omitted)<span class="Italic">. See also, United States Dep't of Health and Human Serv., Health Care Financing Admin.</span>, 35 FLRA 491, 496-97 (1990) (Authority discussed party's obligation to comply with an award during pendency of a request for reconsideration and course of action taken by the Authority if later determined that agency did not commit a ULP). In this case, concealment is not present.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the above, we find that neither the General Counsel nor the Charging Party has presented arguments that warrant a departure from our precedent finding that the limitation period for filing a ULP charge over the failure to comply with an arbitrator's award commences on the date the award becomes final and binding. Accordingly, we find that the GC and the Charging Party have not established that the Judge erred in applying <span class="Italic">EEOC</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">a.&#x2003;The Judge Did Not Err by Finding that the Time Period for Filing the ULP Charge Was Not Equitably Tolled</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"[E]quitable tolling is 'appropriate only when the circumstances that cause a plaintiff to miss a filing deadline are out of his [or her] hands.'" <span class="Italic">EEOC</span>, 53 FLRA at 498 (quoting <span class="Italic">Kelley v. NLRB</span>, 79 F.3d 1238, 1248 (1st Cir. 1996)). Courts generally weigh five factors in assessing claims for equitable tolling. Those factors are: (1) lack of actual notice of filing requirements; (2) lack of constructive knowledge of filing requirements; (3) diligence in pursuing one's rights; (4) absence of prejudice to the defendant and (5) a plaintiff's reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the notice requirement<span class="Italic">. See EEOC</span>, 53 FLRA at 498-99. The Charging Party challenges the Judge's finding that it did not exercise diligence in pursuing its rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Charging Party asserts that it exercised diligence, the facts as found by the Judge do not support that contention. The Judge found that neither the GC nor the Charging Party argued that the Respondent's filing of the petition in court tolled the running of the limitation period. Further, even the GC acknowledged that the time limit for filing the charge "began to run when [Justice] filed its petition...on January 24, 2002 and [Respondent] clearly notified" the Charging Party that it would not comply with the Authority's decision. However, the Charging Party did not file the charge until February 21, 2002. The Charging Party's statement in its affidavit concerning the Respondent's January 31 letter advising the Charging Party of its noncompliance with the award also indicates that the Charging Party was aware that the Respondent "'did not intend to comply with the Vitaro award...'" before the limitation period ended. These facts demonstrate that had the Charging Party exercised diligence, it could have filed its charge in a timely manner before the limitation period elapsed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, we reject the Charging Party's claim in this case that it lacked notice of the Respondent's intent not to comply with the award. The Respondent's actions, including the Respondent's letter of January 31 informing the Charging party that it had filed a petition with the court and that it was not going to comply with the award were not an indication of future compliance, but instead clearly indicated that the Respondent had not complied with the award and did not intend to comply with it in the future. The Charging Party had the right to expect compliance with an award once it became final and binding. The Respondent did not conceal its noncompliance but informed the Charging Party of it. Therefore, the Charging Party had notice and could have timely filed the charge before the limitation period expired. Consequently, we find that the Charging Party has not established that the Judge erred by finding that the limitation period was not equitably tolled.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, neither the GC nor the Charging Party has established that the Judge erred in finding that the charge was untimely because the six month period for filing a ULP charge under &#x00A7; 7118(a)(4) of the Statute expired on February 17, 2002, and that the late filing was not the result of failure or concealment on the part of the Respondent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">b.&#x2003;The Judge Did Not Err by Rejecting the Clear and Unequivocal Notice Standard</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">EEOC</span>, the Authority set forth the standard by which to measure the timeliness of the ULP charge in this case. The Authority concluded that the 6-month period for filing a ULP charge alleging noncompliance with an award commences at the time the award becomes final and binding<span class="Italic">. See EEOC</span>, 53 FLRA at 493 (citing <span class="Italic">Luke AFB and Wright-Patterson</span>). As previously found, the Charging Party has not demonstrated a reason to overrule or modify <span class="Italic">EEOC</span>. Accordingly, we conclude that the Judge did not err by rejecting the clear and unequivocal notice standard and, therefore, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit rejected the notion that the ULP filing period runs from the finality date of an award rather than from the time that performance under the award is to occur. The court determined in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 392 F.3d 498, 500-01 (D.C. Cir. 2004)) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 61 FLRA 146 (2005), <span class="Italic">post, enforced, Dept. of Treasury, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 521 F.3d 1148 (9th Cir. 2008)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7118(a)(4), the six-month filing period for ULP charges starts at the time the "alleged unfair labor practice...occurred." In this case the alleged ULP consisted of the failure to comply with the arbitrator's award. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7116(a)(8), 7118(a)(4)(A). The plain language of the statute thus requires that the filing period cannot begin at least until there has been a failure to comply with an arbitration award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority argues that, because the agency has an obligation to comply with an award as soon as it becomes final, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(b), and because the IRS never took the actions mandated by the award, the failure to comply occurred when the award became final on August 17, 2001. This reading confuses the onset of the obligation with the onset of the failure to fulfill that obligation. If an award orders an action that will take place in the future, a party may fail to comply with the award in two ways. First, it may expressly reject its obligation under the 6 award at any time. Second, it may simply not take the steps ordered by the award, but it cannot be said to have done this at least until the deadline for taking action has passed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case before us, the arbitrator's award imposed two major obligations on the IRS. First, it enjoined the IRS from "failing or refusing to implement [commuting compensation under the collective bargaining agreement] as to covered employees." Nothing on the record indicates whether the IRS complied with this section of the agreement. The second obligation thus forms the basis for the ULP charge: the IRS was required to submit a list of employees affected by the location transfers so that they could be compensated. This list was due on October 1, 2001, 45 days after the award became final. Thus the first opportunity for the IRS to fail to comply with the award was on October 1, when it missed the deadline to submit names to NTEU. It is impossible to find an unfair labor practice <span id="page_1562"></span>occurring before this point because there cannot have been a failure to comply with the award before then. While the IRS arguably could have triggered the limitations period earlier by affirmatively rejecting its obligations under the award, it did not do so until IRS Area Counsel wrote as much to NTEU's counsel on January 31, 2002.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the facts of this case, then, the earliest possible date that a ULP can be said to have occurred is October 1, 2001. Because NTEU's charge was filed on February 21, 2002, it was well within the six-month filing period and was timely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority characterizes NTEU's interpretation of the filing period as a "discovery rule." Under a discovery rule, "a cause of action accrues when the injured party discovers--or in the exercise of due diligence should have discovered--that it has been injured." <span class="Italic">Sprint Comm. Co., L.P. v. FCC</span>, 76 F.3d 1221, 1228 (D.C. Cir. 1996). NTEU's interpretation is not such a rule. The period begins running in October not because that is the first time NTEU could have known that the IRS was failing to comply with the award, but because that was the first time the IRS could have failed to comply by inaction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If we were to accept the Authority's interpretation, we would be left with the absurd situation of charges that could never be filed because the limitations period would expire before they became ripe. If, for example, an arbitrator's award on January 1 required the agency to take action within seven months after the award became final, a charge of inaction would not be ripe until seven months later on August 1. But under the Authority's interpretation the limitations period would start running as soon as the award became final, making the period expire six months later on July 1--before the claim became ripe. This is neither supported by the statutory language that requires that a ULP actually <span class="Italic">occur </span>before the limitations period can begin to run, nor is it a workable policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons given above we grant the petition for review, vacate the decision below, and remand for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent">On remand, FLRA adopted the reasoning of the D.C. Circuit and determined that the period for filing a ULP charge runs the later of either from the date of finality of the award or the date set in the award requiring an act by a party. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 61 FLRA 146, 146-50 (2005) (<span class="Italic">enforced, Dept. of Treasury, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 521 F.3d 1148 (9th Cir. 2008)), stated the rule but also noted that the circumstances triggering the ULP filing period will depend on the facts:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;Background</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Facts</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Charging Party is the exclusive representative of a nationwide consolidated unit of employees, including employees at the Respondent's facilities at Seattle, Tacoma, Bellevue and Everett, Washington. The Respondent and the Charging Party are parties to a national collective bargaining agreement (CBA). Article 29, Section 3E of the CBA provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">When an employee travels from his/her residence to a point of destination within his/her official duty station, he/she should not be required to leave home any earlier or arrive home any later than he/she does when he/she travels to and from his/her usual assigned place of business.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the 1998 fiscal year, the Respondent directed Revenue Officers and Revenue Agents whose posts of duty were in certain offices within a 40 mile radius around the Seattle Washington Headquarters Office to report on a recurring basis to the Seattle Headquarters. Some employees' commute times increased as a result. The Charging Party sought compensation for these employees based on Article 29, Section 3E, which the Respondent denied. The Charging Party then filed a grievance which the Respondent denied and the matter was submitted to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Arbitrator Samuel A.&#x2003;Vitaro issued his award (Vitaro award) on July 24, 2000. The Respondent filed exceptions to the award which were denied on August 17, 2001 in <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 57 FLRA 444 (2001) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring) (<span class="Italic">IRS I</span>). The Respondent filed a motion for reconsideration that was denied in <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 57 FLRA 592 (2001) (<span class="Italic">IRS II</span>). [n2] In denying the motion, the Authority noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he Arbitrator addressed the stipulated issue of whether application of the agreement provision to the employees' temporary assignment would violate law, rule, or regulation, including 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.422. The Arbitrator concluded that the agreement provision conflicted with law and regulation, including 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.422, but was nevertheless enforceable under the Portal-to-Portal Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254 (the Act), which contains exceptions to the general prohibition on compensation for commute time. The Arbitrator found that the exception allowing compensation for commute travel where authorized by an express provision of a written contract was applicable here because the parties' agreement contained an "express provision" within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">IRS II</span>, 57 FLRA at 592-93 (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On January 24, 2002, the Department of Justice, on behalf of the Respondent, filed a petition for review (petition) of the Authority's decision with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On February 21, 2002, the Charging Party filed the ULP charge before us in this case alleging that the Respondent violated the Statute by refusing to comply with the Vitaro award. On March 5, 2002, the Court of Appeals granted a motion for voluntary dismissal of the petition. On July 24, 2002, the General Counsel issued the ULP complaint described above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complaint, in part, states that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">9.&#x2003;In his award, Arbitrator Vitaro directed Respondent to take certain affirmative actions, including identifying employees who were affected by Respondent's breach and compensating employees who meet standards of 5 C.F.R. 551.208 (c)(1)-3 in accordance with the parties' [CBA] and the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">12.&#x2003;Since January 24, 2002 and continuing to date, Respondent has failed and refused to take any of the actions directed by the Arbitrator's order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Judge's Decision at 4 (quoting complaint, Exhibit A). In its answer, the Respondent "admitted" the "allegations set forth in paragraph 9 [and]...paragraph 12 of the Complaint." Judge's Decision at 4 and Exhibit B.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, the General Counsel filed a motion for summary judgment and the Respondent filed, among other things, an opposition to the General Counsel's motion and a cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"[B]ecause the parties agreed that there are no factual issues in dispute," the Judge issued an order notifying the parties that this matter would be decided on motion for summary judgment. Judge's Decision at 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Administrative Law Judge's Decision</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Relying on Authority precedent,<span class="Italic"> </span>including<span class="Italic"> Equal Opportunity Commission, Wash., D.C.</span>, 53 FLRA 487 (1997) (<span class="Italic">EEOC</span>), the Judge found that the Authority's decision on the Respondent's exceptions to the Vitaro award was final on August 17, 2001, and that as a result the six-month period for filing a charge, pursuant to &#x00A7; 7118(a)(4)(A) of the Statute, expired on February 17, 2002. The Judge concluded that because the charge was filed (February 21, 2002) more than six months after the period for filing a charge under &#x00A7; 7118(a)(4)(A), and as there was no reason to toll the limitation period, the charge was untimely. The Judge thus denied the General Counsel's motion for summary judgment; granted the Respondent's cross-motion, and recommended that the complaint be dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;Authority's Decision in 59 FLRA 282</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority, among other things, rejected the General Counsel's and the Charging Party's assertion that the time period for filing the ULP charge alleging noncompliance with an award should commence when the noncompliance occurs, not when the award was issued. The Authority noted, in this regard, that its decisions in <span class="Italic">EEOC </span>and<span class="Italic"> Dep't of the Air Force, Headquarters, 832d Combat Support Group, DPCE, Luke Air Force Base, Ariz., </span>24 FLRA 1021 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span>) and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force v. FLRA,</span> 775 F.2d 727 (6th Cir. 1985), have established that the 6-month period for filing a ULP charge alleging noncompliance with an arbitrator's award commences on the date the award becomes final and binding. The Authority reaffirmed its findings in <span class="Italic">EEOC</span> and <span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span> and found as noted by the Authority in <span class="Italic">EEOC</span> that "[b]oth the language of the Statute and established Authority precedent lead us to conclude that the limitations period for filing a ULP charge for failure to comply with an arbitrator's award commences on the date the award becomes final and binding. Such a rule puts all parties to the arbitration proceedings on notice as to their respective rights and obligations." <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 59 FLRA at 288 (quoting <span class="Italic">EEOC</span>, 53 FLRA at 493).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaffirming <span class="Italic">EEOC</span>, the Authority rejected the General Counsel's assertion that <span class="Italic">EEOC </span>was not applicable in the circumstances of this case and found that neither the General Counsel nor the Charging Party had presented arguments that warranted a departure from its precedent. Accordingly, the Authority found that the General Counsel and the Charging Party had not established that the Judge erred in applying <span class="Italic">EEOC</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority thus found, based on the holding in <span class="Italic">EEOC, </span>that the limitation period for filing the ULP charge for the Respondent's failure to comply with the award commenced on the date the award became final and binding, which was August 17, 2001, the date the Authority issued its decision on the exceptions. Accordingly, the Authority found that the time limit for filing the charge expired on February 17, 2002. After considering other arguments raised by the General Counsel and the Charging Party, the Authority concluded that the ULP charge was untimely because the Charging Party did not file the charge until February 21, 2002, four days late. Therefore, the Authority dismissed the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;The D.C. Circuit's Decision</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1563"></span>Examining &#x00A7; 7118(a)(4) of the Statute, the court stated that under this section, the "six-month filing period for ULP charges starts at the time the 'alleged unfair labor practice...occurred.'" <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 392 F.3d at 500. Noting that the alleged ULP consisted of the failure to comply with the arbitrator's award, the court found that the "plain language of the [S]tatute thus requires that the filing period cannot begin at least until there has been a failure to comply with an arbitration award." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court rejected the Authority's finding that, "because [an] agency has an obligation to comply with an award as soon as it becomes final, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(b), and because the [Agency] never took the actions mandated by the award, the failure to comply occurred when the award became final on August 17, 2001." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>The court stated that this "reading confuses the onset of the obligation with the onset of the failure to fulfill that obligation." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>The court further stated that:</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The court found that in this case the Arbitrator's award imposed two major obligations on the Agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">First, it enjoined the [Agency] from "failing or refusing to implement [commuting compensation under the collective bargaining agreement] as to covered employees."

<p class="noindent-1">Based on these obligations, the court found that the first opportunity for the Agency to fail to comply with the award was on October 1, when it missed the deadline to submit names to NTEU.

<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The ULP Was Timely Filed</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the court's opinion discussed above, we find that the ULP charge in this case was timely filed. In so finding, we adopt the court's approach for determining whether a ULP charge challenging the failure to comply with an arbitrator's award is timely under &#x00A7; 7118(a)(4)(A) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addressing the timeliness of the ULP charge, the court stated that "[u]nder &#x00A7; 7118(a)(4), the six-month filing period for ULP charges starts at the time the 'alleged unfair labor practice...occurred.'" <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 392 F.3d at 500. As the ULP charge here concerns the failure to comply with the Arbitrator's award, the court found that the "plain language of [&#x00A7; 7118(a)(4)(A) of] the [S]tatute...requires that the filing period cannot begin at least until there has been a failure to comply with an arbitration award." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We adopt the court's approach, and we will no longer follow prior Authority decisions to the contrary. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>,<span class="Italic"> Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n, Wash., D.C.</span>, 53 FLRA 487 (1997) (<span class="Italic">EEO</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this and future cases alleging a failure to comply with an arbitration award, as in other types of alleged ULPs, the focus under &#x00A7; 7118(a)(4)(A) will be on, as the court stated, when the "'alleged [ULP]...occurred.'" <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 392 F.3d at 500. A determination under &#x00A7; 7118(a)(4)(A) as to when a party has failed to comply with an arbitration award will involve a case-by-case determination based on what the award requires and what the party's actions are following the award. In making this determination, we will be guided by the approach taken by the court:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If an award orders an action that will take place in the future, a party may fail to comply with the award in two ways. First, it may expressly reject its obligation under the award at any time. Second, it may simply not take the steps ordered by the award, but it cannot be said to have done this at least until the deadline for taking action has passed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 500-01.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the court's reasoning, the six-month statutory filing period for filing a ULP charge may be triggered: (1) when a party expressly notifies a party that it will not comply with the obligations required by an award, or (2) when an award establishes a deadline for implementing obligations required by the award and the deadline passes without the party taking any action to implement the award. We also recognize that there may be situations where there has been no express declaration of noncompliance or no deadline established by the award. In such situations, the facts of each case, based upon what an award requires and what a party's actions have been following the award, will determine whether a party has failed to comply with an arbitration award and hence when the time period under &#x00A7; 7118(a)(4)(A) has begun to run. For example, it would be reasonable to look at what is necessary to effect compliance in terms of time and effort. It also would be reasonable to consider the efforts by one or both sides to communicate with the other to inquire about or relate the status of compliance activities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In setting forth the above guidance, we remind the parties that these considerations are not intended to be all-inclusive. As the court's decision reflects, the circumstances of each case before the Authority that involve a timeliness issue must be considered in determining when a ULP can be said to have "occurred." Additionally, in order for parties to arbitration proceedings to assess with reasonable certainty their obligations to each other, we strongly encourage parties and arbitrators to request and establish, respectively, deadlines for compliance with the requirements of an award. The establishment of deadlines could eliminate many of the problems parties experience in determining whether and when an award has been implemented.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, based on the above, we find that the ULP charge challenging the failure to comply with an arbitrator's award is timely under &#x00A7; 7118(a)(4)(A) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Federal Circuit followed the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 61 FLRA 146, 146-50 (2005), reviewing a decision of the Office of Compliance, responsible for adjudication of ULPs in the legislative branch under the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, <span class="Italic">U.S. Capitol Police v. Office of Compliance</span>, 913 F.3d 1361, 1638-69 (Fed. Cir. 2019):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An unfair labor practice charge must be filed within 180 days of the occurrence of the alleged unfair labor practice.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 2 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1351(c)(2) (incorporating 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7118(a)(4)(A)). The Union charged that the Police committed an unfair labor practice when it failed to implement the May 13, 2014 arbitrator's award that had been supplemented and clarified by the arbitrator's June 17, 2015 final order. The Union's charge, filed July 28, 2015, was challenged by the Police as untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The limitations period for filing an unfair labor practice charge is triggered in one of two ways: "(1) when a party expressly notifies a party that it will not comply with the obligations required by an award, or (2) when an award establishes a deadline for implementing obligations required by the award and the deadline passes without the party taking any action to implement the award." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury Internal Revenue Serv.

<p class="noindent">When an agency attempts to implement an arbitration award, and it is made clear to the union on a certain date that implementation cannot occur (in a situation involving modifications to a payroll system that could not and would not be made by the payroll agent, DFAS), the six month filing period then begins. It is not postponed because an arbitrator continues to monitor implementation and issue supplementary instructions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DODEA and FEA</span>, 70 FLRA 654 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting) (remanded, <span class="Italic">FEA v.

Examining the course of dealings between the parties, the court determined that the evidence demonstrated the agency did not reject, but instead attempted to implement, the award, extending the time for filing a ULP when implementation was unsatisfactory to the union:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...As we have observed in the past, when an unfair labor practice charge arises out of an arbitration award, "[t]he plain language of the statute...requires that the filing period cannot begin at least until there has been a failure to comply with [the] award." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union v. FLRA</span>, 392 F.3d 498, 500 (D.C. Cir. 2004). When "an award orders an action that will take place in the future, a party may fail to comply with the award in two ways": either by "expressly reject[ing] its obligation under the award" or by "simply not tak[ing] the steps ordered by the award." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 500-01. <span id="page_1564"></span>If the latter, however, the Agency cannot be said to have failed to comply "at least until the deadline for taking action has passed" without any compliance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 501.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has adopted this circuit's approach to determining when a party has failed to comply with an arbitration award. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS</span>, 61 F.L.R.A. 146, 150 (2005). Reiterating the two routes to anticipatory noncompliance--express rejection or failure to timely commence compliance--the Authority also recognized that some cases fit neither mold. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. "In such situations, the facts of each case, based upon what an award requires and what a party's actions have been following the award, will determine whether a party has failed to comply with an arbitration award." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Authority and the Agency rely on the express-rejection route identified in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union</span>. The Authority found that, in May 2010, "the Agency expressly notified the Union that it could not, and would not, fully comply with the awards," and that by August 2010, "the Union expressly acknowledged that the Agency had not complied with the awards." In the government's framing, the fact "[t]hat the Union chose not to heed the Agency's express statements of its inability to comply...does not toll the deadline for filing [an unfair labor practice] charge."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That conclusion, however, is unsupported by substantial evidence. The record as a whole cannot sustain the determination that the Agency expressly rejected its obligations under the awards on either of the two dates in 2010 identified by the Authority. Nor did the Agency's "actions...following the award," <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS</span>, 61 F.L.R.A. at 150, reveal that it had failed to comply with its obligations. It was not until May 2015, when the Agency told the arbitrator that further changes would not be made and asked him to deem it in compliance with the awards, that the Agency expressly rejected its obligations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's May 2010 letter did not expressly reject the Agency's obligations. Rather, it suggested that the Agency was already largely in compliance with the awards and would continue to work on meeting their terms. Specifically, the Agency stated that the Smart LES system already had "most of the structure and functions...require[d]" by the awards, and explained that DFAS was in the process of making additional changes. Importantly, when the Agency forwarded DFAS' response to the Union, it omitted the assertion that DFAS did not view itself as bound to make any changes. The portions of DFAS' response that the Agency did forward--in which DFAS stated that certain changes were "not available" or "not allowed"--did not expressly reject the Agency's obligations. Those responses were somewhat discouraging in the short term, but never foreswore compliance with the awards. To the contrary, the Agency expressed its apparent determination to work with DFAS to make the required changes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record of communications at the parties' August 2010 meeting with the arbitrator and the representative from DFAS also fails to support the Authority's express-rejection determination. As the government tells it, because the Union representative himself demonstrated at the meeting that the Smart LES system did not meet the terms of the awards, the Union necessarily knew that the Agency was rejecting its obligations. But the record shows that the Agency's position at the meeting was that Smart LES met the terms of the awards, and the Agency's own witness testified before the administrative law judge that the DFAS representative told the Agency and the Union at the meeting "that pretty much anything [the Agency] wanted [it] could do in the [S]mart LES," provided it could get approval and could pay for it. At no point during the meeting did the Agency refuse to engage in further discussion or repudiate its obligation to make changes to comply with the award, and the Union's behavior cannot reasonably be read to acknowledge any such rejection.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even in communications outside the arbitrator's presence--where the Agency would presumably have had less incentive to put a positive spin on its efforts--the Agency did not seem to think that compliance was impossible. In June 2011, for example, the Agency and DFAS went back and forth via email about a potential cost estimate for implementing the remaining changes. The Agency expressed eagerness to get an estimate so that it could "allocate money for the...upgrades." DFAS provided a rough estimate and noted that it might be "quite a while" before some of the changes could be implemented. The Agency responded that it wanted to "put together a plan (even if the plan [was] an incremental roll out) so" that it could tell the arbitrator "when changes will start to appear." The thrust of the exchange was that making the changes might take a long time and require significant coordination, but that they were achievable and the Agency remained committed to full compliance. Of course, communications that were unknown to the Union could not undermine an otherwise-express rejection. But evidence that the Agency had not in fact given up on making the required changes at the time of the supposed rejection tends to support our conclusion that nothing in the record communicated that it had.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Agency did not expressly reject its obligations under the arbitration awards either in its May 2010 letter or at the August 2010 meeting. Rather, when viewed in light of the record as a whole, the Agency's communications reflected its continuing efforts to implement the required changes. The Authority's finding that the Agency had openly refused to make certain changes as of 2010 is thus not supported by substantial evidence. It was not until May 2015, when the Agency told the arbitrator that the remaining changes would not be made, that the Agency expressly rejected any further requirements of the awards. Measured from that May 2015 rejection, the Union's October 2015 unfair labor practice charge was timely.</p>
