<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-211"><span class="space">e.</span> Promotion, Placement Consideration; Priority Consideration</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An interesting decision concerning promotion arose as to a settlement. <span class="Italic">Myers v. USDA</span>, 29 MSPR 395, 397 (1985), involved construction of an agreement that the appellant be granted "strong" consideration for vacancies within his qualifications. The agency then gave the appellant no greater consideration than others being considered for the positions. The Board found a violation of the settlement. "Strong" consideration was the same as priority consideration, a "term of art" that "generally means that an employee will receive <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> consideration by the selecting official before any other candidate is referred for consideration, that he will not be considered in competition with other candidates, and that he will not be compared with them," citing <span class="Italic">Lou v. Heckler</span>, 38 FEP Cases 835, 837 n.3 (D.C. Cir. 1985). The agency was directed to reconstruct its selection records and promote the appellant if he would have been selected after receiving strong consideration for the position. The agency efforts were subsequently deemed insufficient by the Board, and the agency was directed to provide more specific information concerning the selection procedures for several vacancies that had been filled. <span class="Italic">Myers v. USDA</span>, 30 MSPR 371, 372 (1986). <span class="Italic">Myers</span> reappeared after the agency failed to place the appellant and gave no convincing explanations for its actions. The Board undertook an analysis of the various positions he applied for, ascertained he was not given "strong consideration," refused to permit the agency to add belated conditions to the settlement agreement, and directed the agency to place the appellant into one of the positions, with back pay. <span class="Italic">Myers v. USDA</span>, 31 MSPR 312, 316-17 (1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agreements that do not call for priority consideration, but provide some lesser assurance, e.g., that the agency "will provide every reasonable assistance...in finding [a] position," do not guarantee selection if the employee has been given consideration for positions within the scope of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hull v. VA</span>, 69 MSPR 570, 572 (1996). If the settlement agreement calls for serious consideration for placement if the agency has vacancies or placement opportunities, the agency does not violate the agreement if, lacking vacancies, it does not consider the appellant for a position. <span class="Italic">Cooper v. USPS</span>, 56 MSPR 328, 332-33 (1993); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Boyce v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 96-3335) (settlement that called for consideration of appellant "if and when" a position became vacant was not violated when agency did not fill the position at all; agreement did not require the agency to fill all of positions that became vacant). The agency did not violate a settlement agreement that provided for reemployment placement and priority consideration when the agency informed the employee of a position but did not place him in it when the appellant responded to the agency's notice by expressing no interest in the position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Richardson v. EPA</span>, 13 MSPR 114, 115 (1982); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. DOJ</span>, 84 MSPR 685, 691 &#x00B6; 11 (2000) (remanding for analysis of agency's obligations under a settlement to provide reemployment rights to appellant who recovered from compensable injury).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency met its obligations in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Army</span>, 45 MSPR 240, 242 (1990), involving an agreement calling for 90 days of priority consideration for positions within the appellant's qualifications (none being found within that time):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts in his petition for review that the agency did not diligently search for a position for him under the settlement agreement and that the agency improperly considered his physical limitations and, thus, deprived him of consideration for jobs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that the evidence supports the administrative judge's finding that the agency diligently searched for a position for the appellant. The agency submitted documentation that it evaluated all vacancies which occurred during the three-month settlement period, in terms of the appellant's abilities and experience. The evidence shows that he was non-competitively referred for five positions but was disqualified on his documented physical disability. The appellant has submitted no evidence in support of his bare allegation of noncompliance. His new assertion, that he had been working since 1981 with the same lifting restriction in positions with the same lifting requirements as those for which he was now disqualified, was not raised below and will not be considered now. <span class="Italic">Banks v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 4 MSPR 268, 271 (1980). We find no error in the administrative judge's conclusion on the reasonableness of the 25-pound restriction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A decision involving priority consideration conferred by a settlement, <span class="Italic">Perry v. Dept. of Army</span>, 54 MSPR 45, 48-50 (1992) (rev'd, <span class="Italic">Perry v. Dept. of Army</span>, 992 F.2d 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1993), <span class="Italic">post</span>), determined there was no breach, but added as to interpretation and administration of priority consideration:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Here the agreement does not define what the parties meant by priority promotion consideration. However, it is a term that is generally understood to mean "that an employee will receive <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> consideration by the selecting official before any other candidate is referred for consideration and that the employee will not be considered in competition with other candidates and will not be compared with them." <span class="Italic">Myers v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 29 MSPR 395, 397 (1985), citing <span class="Italic">Loe v. Heckler</span>, 768 F.2d 409 (D.C. Cir. 1985). Thus appellant was simply entitled to be considered for promotion to one of the specified positions <span class="Italic">before</span> anyone else was considered. Priority consideration does not mean that appellant was entitled to have her qualifications enhanced or that she was entitled to be selected. Nor does it create any special treatment or benefit in the event of her nonselection for the position to which she received priority consideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the settlement agreement does not require the agency to advise the appellant of the reasons for her nonselection. In this regard, it is also important to look at the agency's regulation which governs priority consideration. Army Regulation 690-300, Chapter 335, sets forth the requirements for priority consideration. It does not require either the agency or the selecting official to document or explain the reasons for nonselection. That this is deliberate can be readily discerned from the fact that the same regulation states in parenthetical comment "(Note that section [29 CFR] 1613.271 requires reasons for nonselection to be recorded.)" Thus employees who are provided priority consideration as a remedy for EEO complaints are, by regulation, entitled to an explanation for their nonselection, while others are not. Accordingly, the agency was not obligated to document or explain the reasons for its nonselection of the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant also argues that the agency acted in bad faith in refusing to promote her. There is no dispute that an agency must act in good faith in fulfilling its obligations under a settlement agreement. Appellant's argument fails, however, for lack of proof. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McIver</span>, 49 MSPR 64, 67 (1991) (party alleging breach of settlement agreement bears the burden of proof).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, appellant contends that bad faith is shown because the agency refused to promote her despite the fact that she was qualified for the position and was the only candidate. Essentially, she is arguing that bad faith exists solely because she was not selected. However, priority consideration does not require selection and, as a result, bad faith may not logically be inferred from the agency's refusal to select her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, the appellant argues that bad faith is shown by the facts that the selecting official acted on her application on the same day as the referral and did not give an explanation for the nonselection. However, a quick response is no indication of bad faith, especially where the appellant was the only candidate on the register. Further, as noted earlier, there is no requirement that the selecting official document or explain his action. In any event, the deciding official did give a reason. By requesting area wide consideration, he made it clear he wanted to look at additional candidates. Absent proof that this was not the real reason, appellant fails to carry her burden of proving a breach of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, there is no evidence in the record that shows or even infers bad faith. There is no evidence that the selecting official knew the appellant, was aware of either the disciplinary action against her or the settlement agreement, or had any other reason to act in bad faith (or in retaliation) with respect to her referral as a candidate for priority consideration.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appeal advanced to the Federal Circuit, <span class="Italic">Perry v. Dept. of Army</span>, 992 F.2d 1575, 1578-80 (Fed. Cir. 1993). The Board's decision was reversed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Essential to the question of compliance in this case is the construction of the term "priority promotion consideration" as used in the settlement agreement. The construction of this term in the agreement is a question of law that this court reviews <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Bonner v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 781 F.2d 202, 205 (Fed. Cir. 1986). We must "determine the intent of the parties at the time they contracted, as evidenced by the contract itself." <span class="Italic">Greco</span>, 852 F.2d at 560; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Firestone Tire &#x0026; Rubber Co. v. United States</span>, 444 F.2d 547, 551, 195 Ct. Cl. 21 (1971).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board held and both parties agree that the term "priority promotion consideration" means generally "that an employee will receive <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> consideration by the selecting official before any other candidate is referred for consideration and that the employee will not be considered in competition with other candidates and will not be compared with them." <span class="Italic">Perry v. Department of the Army</span>, at 48 (quotations omitted) (citing <span class="Italic">Loe v. Heckler</span>, 768 F.2d 409, 413 n.3 (D.C. Cir. 1985)); <span class="Italic">see</span> Army Regulation 690-300, para. 1-5.c(7)(b) ("Priority consideration may be granted only once for each time proper consideration in a competitive promotion action was not given. It is important, therefore, that the candidate is given a <span class="Italic">bona fide consideration</span> before consideration is given to candidates under competitive procedures.") The board also held and the parties agree that <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> consideration does not require that the Army actually select the candidate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5091"></span>Perry argues that the Army must explain its reasons for not selecting her in order for consideration to be <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>. On the other hand, the Army argues that, under its regulations, it need not give reasons for not selecting Perry. Moreover, it contends that <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> consideration requires only that the Army refer a candidate for a position for which she is qualified prior to referring anyone else.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Army Regulation 690-300, paragraph 1-5.c(8), expressly notes that the Army must give reasons for not selecting an applicant if consideration is given as a remedy for a discrimination complaint, while paragraph 1-5.c(7), governing other priority considerations such as the one involved here, is silent in this respect. According to the Army, this means that it need not give reasons for not selecting an applicant....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are convinced that the meaning of <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> priority promotion consideration lies between the extremes asserted by the Army and by Perry. In construing contracts, we assign to words their "ordinary and commonly accepted meaning unless it is shown that the parties intended otherwise."...Thus, priority and <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> consideration is consideration that precedes that of other candidates and that is "real, actual, genuine, and not feigned." <span class="Italic">See</span> Black's Law Dictionary, 160 (5th ed. 1979). Whether such consideration was given must be reviewed based on the totality of the circumstances. Perry's argument that the Army must offer an objective reasonable explanation for its failure to select her construes the agreement too strictly against the Army. Employment decisions often involve subjective factors, and we see no reason to require a statement of reasons, in the absence of a rule or regulation, such as is present in discrimination cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Army's argument is that there is an inference or presumption of the required consideration from the mere fact of a noncompetitive referral. Such a rule would have the effect of reading the necessary <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> consideration out of the settlement agreement's requirement. Therefore, we conclude that the agency must show not only that the prior noncompetitive referral was made but also that the recipient supervisor who is charged with filling the position has actually considered and evaluated the applicant's qualifications.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In deciding this case, the board assumed that the Army gave good faith consideration from the mere fact of referral; the board then found that Perry failed to prove bad faith or disingenuousness. However, as our prior analysis makes clear, the question is not whether Perry proved that the Army acted in bad faith, but rather whether the Army sufficiently showed that its selecting supervisor genuinely considered and evaluated Perry's qualifications.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board found that the selecting supervisor did not know Perry personally, and there is no evidence that the supervisor interviewed or had any contact with Perry. The sole evidence produced by the Army of any consideration by the supervisor of Perry's referral is the completed DA 2600 referral form, stating "REQUEST AREA WIDE CONSIDERATION." The manner in which this form was filled out indicates a lack of attention by the supervisor to the referral instead of supporting a good faith consideration of Perry's qualifications.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore are unable to conclude that substantial evidence supports the board's decision that the Army complied with the settlement agreement. Indeed the limited evidence presented by the Army trends the other way, <span class="Italic">viz.</span>, that Perry did not receive <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> priority consideration from the selecting supervisor who received her referral. The decision of the MSPB is reversed and the case is remanded to ensure, consistent with this opinion, that the Army complies with the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sauser v. VA,</span> PH-300A-09-0431-X-1 (NP 1/23/2012), applied <span class="Italic">Perry</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To afford <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> priority consideration, the agency was required to: (1) refer the appellant's application for consideration by itself, without competition or comparison with other candidates, and (2) afford "real, actual, genuine, and not feigned" consideration of his qualifications. <span class="Italic">Perry</span>, 992 F.2d at 1579. Whether priority consideration "was given must be reviewed based on the totality of the circumstances." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Priority consideration does not guarantee selection. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Sauser, supra,</span> the Board considered the selecting official's five stated determinants for nonselecting the appellant, and the Board found two of them invalid. Nonselection was still upheld:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we find that the selecting official appropriately considered appellant's experience as she understood it from his application, her prior interactions with him, and her prior observations of his behavior. Contrary to the appellant's claims, neither her consideration of these criteria nor her non-selection of appellant demonstrates that she failed to make a "real, actual, genuine, and not feigned" evaluation of the appellant's application. <span class="Italic">Perry</span>, 992 F.2d at 1579. Accordingly, we find that under the totality of the circumstances, the agency has now afforded the appellant <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> priority consideration.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Priority consideration was again interpreted in <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 69 MSPR 268, 271-74 (1996), directing the agency to reconstruct its selection processes. The agency gave too narrow a construction to its settlement commitments:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement is a contract, the interpretation of which is a question of law. <span class="Italic">Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). The Board looks to the terms of the agreement itself in order to determine the intent of the parties at the time they contracted. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Dati v. Department of the Navy</span>, 41 MSPR 397, 400 (1989). In construing settlement agreements, we assign to words their ordinary meaning unless it is shown that the parties intended otherwise. <span class="Italic">Perry v. Department of the Army</span>, 992 F.2d 1575, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has found that "priority consideration" is a term of art which means that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an employee will receive <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> consideration by the selecting official before any other candidate is referred for consideration and that the employee will not be considered in competition with other candidates and will not be compared with them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Myers v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 29 MSPR 395, 397 (1985) (citing <span class="Italic">Loe v. Heckler</span>, 768 F.2d 409, 413 n.3 (D.C.

See also Perry</span>, 992 F.2d at 1579 (citing <span class="Italic">Loe</span> and Army Regulation 690-300, para. 1-5.c(7)(b)).[2] Priority consideration does not require that the applicant's qualifications be enhanced, or that the applicant actually be selected. <span class="Italic">Perry v. Department of the Army</span>, 54 MSPR 45, 48-49 (1992), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 992 F.2d 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Thus, priority consideration requires that the agency refer the applicant to the selecting official for consideration once the agency determines that the applicant meets the minimum qualifications. <span class="Italic">See Caddell v. Department of Energy</span>, EEOC No. 01943930, slip op. at 4 (Feb. 27, 1995) (a settlement agreement providing for priority consideration required the agency to "give appellant priority consideration for the next vacant...position...for which appellant was determined qualified"). <span class="Italic">Cf. Perry</span>, 992 F.2d at 1575 (noting that the Army interpreted its regulations governing priority consideration to require that it refer the applicant for a position for which she is qualified before referring anyone else).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cf. Mattila v. US Postal Service</span>, EEOC No. 01951379, slip op. at 3-4 (May 30, 1995) ("priority consideration means that the appellant must be considered before any formal action to recruit for the vacancy, and must be given <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> consideration on his own merit, without competition with other potential candidates.")</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the language in the settlement agreement providing that "it is [the appellant's] responsibility to...be referred" does not demonstrate that the parties intended to modify the ordinary meaning of "priority consideration" to require that the agency refer the appellant for priority consideration only after it has determined, by comparing her with other applicants, that she is among the best qualified applicants. The relevant portion of the settlement agreement states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Appellant understands that it is her responsibility to identify positions for which she wants to exercise her priority consideration. Further, Appellant understands that it is her responsibility to apply for said positions, be qualified, and be referred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When read together, this provision requires the agency to refer the appellant for priority consideration when she identifies a position for which she would like to exercise her priority consideration, applies for the position, and is determined to be qualified for the position. The language of the agreement does not require that the appellant be among the best qualified, only that she "be qualified." In the absence of a clear indication that the parties so intended, we decline to construe "be referred" to mean "make the referral list after being compared with other applicants" and thereby insert into the agreement a requirement at odds with the generally understood meaning of "priority consideration." <span class="Italic">See Perry</span>, 992 F.2d at 1579 (words in a contract are assigned their commonly accepted meanings unless it is shown that the parties intended otherwise)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency acknowledges that it did not refer the appellant for priority consideration for the Supervisory Medical Clerk position even though it determined that she met the minimum qualifications for the position because she was not one of the best qualified applicants. Therefore, we find that the agency did not provide the appellant priority consideration for that position in accordance with the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency states that it did not refer the appellant for priority consideration for the Secretary position because the position was filled through priority placement before the closing date of the announcement. The agency has submitted an excerpt from its Recruitment and Placement Plan which provides that priority consideration will precede other efforts to fill a vacant position by other means, except when another employee has a right to priority placement. Fort Bragg Recruitment and Placement Plan, &#x00A7; 4-4(b). Thus, another applicant's right to priority placement would represent a valid basis for the agency not to refer the appellant for priority consideration. However, the agency has not submitted evidence in support of its claim that the employee who was placed in the Secretary <span id="Page_5092"></span>position was entitled to priority placement. Accordingly, we are unable to determine whether the agency violated the settlement agreement in regard to the Secretary position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">ORDER</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency is ORDERED to reconstruct the selection process for the Supervisory Medical Clerk position and to determine if the appellant would have been selected for that position had she been given priority consideration. <span class="Italic">See Myers</span>, 29 MSPR at 398. If the appellant would have been selected, the agency is ordered to retroactively place the appellant in the Supervisory Medical Clerk position or an equivalent position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In the event that such proof of compliance indicates that the appellant would not have been selected for the position, the agency's proof of compliance must show that the selecting official actually considered and evaluated the appellant's qualifications. <span class="Italic">See Perry</span>, 992 F.2d at 1579-80.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's submission also must include proof that the employee who was placed in the Secretary position was entitled to priority placement. If that employee was not entitled to priority placement, the agency must reconstruct the selection process for that position in accordance with the instructions above.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pope v. FCC</span>, 311 F.3d 1379, 1381-84 (Fed. Cir. 2002), reversed the Board for unduly limiting priority consideration. The agency and the Board attempted to distinguish "priority consideration referral" from priority consideration, but the court found the difference semantic. The agency denied the employee the benefit of the bargain:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FCC agrees with Mr. Pope, as indeed it must, that the term "priority consideration" is a term of art in the jargon of federal employment law. It is settled law that, as a term of art, "priority consideration" means</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">that an employee will receive <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> consideration by the selecting official before any other candidate is referred for consideration and that the employee will not be considered in competition with other candidates and will not be compared with them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Perry v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 992 F.2d 1575, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Furthermore, in order for an agency to demonstrate <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> consideration, the record must show that a "prior noncompetitive referral was made [and] that the recipient supervisor who is charged with filling the position has actually considered and evaluated the applicant's qualifications." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1580.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a nutshell, "priority consideration" requires the deciding official treat the priority candidate as "first in line, up or down," since the priority candidate gets a decision made on his application before any other application is considered. There of course is no assurance that a priority candidate will be picked for the open job, but there is assurance that the priority candidate will not have his application compared with the applications of others, and he is not in competition with others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appointing official who receives a referral for a priority consideration candidate needs to know that the candidate enjoys that status, else how will the official know that the applicant must receive the "first in line, up or down" consideration? That is why our precedent demands that a <span class="Italic">"noncompetitive</span> referral" be made to the appointing official.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the facts of this case, as set forth above, it is certain that the FCC did not afford "priority consideration" to Mr. Pope, according to the settled meaning of the term of art. This is so because it is clear that Mr. Pope did not receive the requisite "first in line, up or down" treatment required when priority consideration is given. Why, then, is this case here? Because the FCC, both before the Board and before this court, argues that "priority consideration referral"--the term used in the settlement agreement--and "priority consideration" as a term of art are entirely different things.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the FCC, a "priority consideration referral" is a referral to the hiring official of a single name on a Referral List. So long as the hiring official attests to having reviewed the application and made a decision on it (both of which were done in this case), and Mr. Pope's name was referred on a Referral List that contained no more information than his name standing alone, the FCC contends that the definition of "priority consideration referral" has been met. According to the FCC, a "priority consideration referral" has nothing to do with the referent being given priority consideration over other applicants.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board accepted the FCC's argument that "priority consideration referral" has a radically different meaning than the "priority consideration" term of art. Interpreting the settlement agreement as a matter of law, the Board favored the FCC's interpretation, and accordingly denied Mr. Pope's petition for enforcement of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In this case we have only a question of law, which is how to interpret the term "priority consideration referral" as found in the settlement agreement. On the facts, each side would prevail under its favored interpretation of the contract terms, so the pure legal question controls the outcome of the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FCC grounds its contract interpretation argument in two portions of the settlement agreement. In one portion, the agreement states that the "application shall then be forwarded to the selecting official for separate consideration." In the other portion, the agreement states that "priority consideration referral requires the selecting official to review and make a determination on Appellant's application on its own merits." According to the FCC, these two portions of the settlement agreement create the definition for a "priority consideration referral."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, according to the FCC, since only Mr. Pope's name was on the Referral List for the two opportunities, and since both applications were reviewed and decided, then Mr. Pope has exhausted two of his priority consideration referral opportunities, and the agency is in full compliance with the terms of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Pope argues here, as before the Board, that the term of art meaning of "priority consideration" is embraced in the settlement agreement and that the portions to which the FCC points are merely partial explanations of what is required by way of a priority consideration referral. Of course, the candidate must receive a referral to the deciding official in order to receive a "separate consideration," else how can he be treated first in line and not in competition or comparison with others? And equally of course, priority consideration itself and priority consideration upon a referral <span class="Italic">requires</span> the selecting official to make the decision on the "own merits" of the application apart from competitive or comparative considerations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FCC's argument overlooks clear precedent. When priority consideration is to be given, it <span class="Italic">requires</span> a <span class="Italic">referral</span> to the deciding officer who is to engage in the process embraced by the defined term. Priority consideration thus requires a referral. <span class="Italic">Perry</span>, 952 F.2d at 1579. The term of art requires the agency to refer the appellant for priority consideration. Consequently, a priority consideration referral cannot mean a referral for something other than priority consideration. The FCC further overlooks the requirement in <span class="Italic">Perry</span> that a noncompetitive referral be made to the deciding official. Furthermore, as Mr. Pope notes, the FCC's view of "priority consideration referral" would mean that the very purpose of priority consideration is avoided simply by using the term "referral" to describe the action taken in order to satisfy a priority consideration duty. Mr. Pope is correct in his view that the language to which the FCC points in the settlement agreement is not a separate definition of "priority consideration" but instead is simply a partial description of what occurs when priority consideration is given.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rather than face its obligation to deal forthrightly with the precedent, the FCC prefers to argue on the basis of another settlement agreement from another case that is not in the record in this proceeding. Mr. Pope rightly objects to the FCC's reliance on a document that was never part of the record nor mentioned at any stage of the proceeding below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We of course interpret the settlement agreement, a contract, as a matter of law without deference to the decision of the Board on the issue. Here, we are certain the Board erred. A priority consideration action requires the agency to make a noncompetitive referral to the deciding official who must perform the "first in line, up or down" assessment of the priority consideration referent's application. That was not done in this case, as the Referral List makes no mention of the obligations imposed on the deciding official by the agreed meaning of the term of art. "Priority consideration referral" is the same thing as "priority consideration."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the FCC has breached the settlement agreement. Mr. Pope for relief seeks an order requiring the FCC to afford him three priority consideration opportunities over a reasonable period of time. The FCC does not object to Mr. Pope's request for relief, and in particular does not inform us--in the event we were to reject its interpretation of the settlement agreement--of what a reasonable period of time would be from its perspective. Therefore, we must decide that issue ourselves.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the settlement agreement requires "priority consideration" as that term is defined as a term of art, and because the agency twice breached the agreement, we reverse the final decision of the Board. We remand the case with instructions that the Board order the FCC to afford Mr. Pope three priority consideration opportunities to be exercised within one year from the date the mandate issues from this court on this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On remand, <span class="Italic">Pope v. FCC</span>, 93 MSPR 475, 476 &#x00B6; 5 (2003), the Board directed a remedy and defined priority consideration:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Priority consideration, a term of art, shall be given its ordinary meaning under accepted Board precedent, namely, that the appellant will receive <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> consideration by the selecting official before any other candidate is referred for consideration and will not be considered in competition with other candidates or be compared with them. Although priority consideration does not require that the appellant's qualifications be enhanced, or the he actually be selected, priority consideration does require that the agency prefer the applicant to the selecting official for consideration once the agency determines that the applicant meets the minimum qualifications.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Weber v. USDA</span>, 86 MSPR 25, 28-30 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-10 (2000), presented another problem concerning the scope of priority consideration. The issue was whether the <span id="Page_5093"></span>agency was required to provide the appellant only one offer, or whether the appellant could, for the period that priority consideration was in effect, take an offer and then seek priority consideration for a better job. The settlement was ambiguous. The case was remanded for the AJ to receive parol evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The relevant provisions of the settlement agreement in the instant appeal are as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">The Agency Agrees</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1)&#x2003;To provide appellant with priority consideration at grade 11 or below for any vacant position, for which he is qualified, in the counties of Hocking, Athens, Vinton, Ross, Pickaway, Fairfield, and Perry, Ohio for a period of two years from the date of this agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">For purposes of this agreement, priority consideration means that appellant will be placed in a vacant position for which he is qualified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">The Appellant Agrees</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">2)&#x2003;That the agency's offer of priority consideration as previously described, is a one-time offer, and that if he declines any position for which he is qualified that all entitlement to priority consideration beyond the initial offer and declination is voided.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that, because the agency offered the appellant a GS-9 Soil Conservationist position on September 2, 1999, and because the agency was required to make only a "one-time offer," the agency had discharged its obligation under the agreement. Thus, he essentially found the question of whether the agency was required to offer the appellant the GS-11 District Conservationist position to be moot. The appellant argues that the AJ erred because the language of the agreement requiring the agency to offer the appellant "any" position for which he was qualified at or below the GS-11 level in the specified counties did not include any limitations, and therefore the agency's September 2, 1999 offer of the Soil Conservationist position did not remedy its failure to offer him the GS-11 District Conservationist position when it became available in July 1999. The agency has argued throughout the proceedings that the term "any" in the agreement here was intended to allow it to select one particular position it wanted the appellant to assume, and was not intended to mean "every" position that became available.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we find that the appellant is correct that, if the agreement is interpreted as he claims it should be, such that the agency was required to offer him the GS-11 District Conservationist position because it was required to offer him "every" vacant position at GS-11 or below for which he was qualified in the specified counties, then his later acceptance of the GS-9 position does not preclude a finding of noncompliance. Under those circumstances, a finding that the agency is in compliance simply because it eventually made "an" offer would, in essence, give effect to one term in the agreement (paragraph 2 above) while ignoring another term (paragraph 1) in violation of the rules of contract interpretation. <span class="Italic">See Saunders v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 75 MSPR 225, 232 (1997) (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts, &#x00A7; 202(2) (1979) (in interpreting the meaning of one term of an agreement, that provision must be read in conjunction with the rest of the agreement)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we must address the question of whether the agreement required the agency to offer the appellant the GS-11 District Conservationist position. To do so, we must attempt to determine what meaning the parties intended to give the word "any" in the phrase "any vacant position." In construing a settlement agreement, we assign to words their ordinary meaning, unless it is shown that the parties intended otherwise. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Department of the Army</span>, 69 MSPR 268, 271 (1996). Here, Black's Law Dictionary points out that there are a number of definitions for the word "any," and that the word "may be employed to indicate 'all' or 'every' as well as 'some' or 'one.'" <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span> 94 (6th ed. 1990). Thus, the inclusion of a clause in the agreement requiring the agency to offer the appellant "any" vacant position (within certain other requirements) could be read to mean that it was to offer "every" vacant position, as the appellant claims. Likewise, the clause could mean that the agency was only required to offer the appellant "one" vacant position within the two year period, in accordance with the agency's understanding of the agreement. The appellant's interpretation appears reasonable, given the unlikelihood that he would agree to allow the agency 2 years to select one position to offer him while he remained unemployed and other positions for which he was qualified became vacant and were filled. At the same time, the fact that the agreement made it clear that the priority consideration was a "one-time offer" lends some support to the agency's argument that it had only to select one position of its choice, because if the parties meant otherwise, they could have indicated that the appellant was to receive "the first" position that met the other specified criteria. Accordingly, since the settlement agreement is susceptible of differing, reasonable interpretations, we find that it is ambiguous. <span class="Italic">See Gullette v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 70 MSPR 569, 573 (1996).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For additional discussion of priority consideration in a settlement of an appeal by an employee who alleged denial of restoration following a compensable injury and involving interpretation of 5 CFR Part 353, refer to <span class="Italic">Beard v. DOD</span>, 57 MSPR 355 (1993) (directing a specific placement remedy).<span class="Italic"> Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Langston v. Dept. of Army</span>, 84 MSPR 597, 601 &#x00B6; 11 (1999) (defining priority consideration as a term of art meaning that an employee will receive priority consideration from the selecting official before the referral of any other candidate, the employee will not be considered in competition with or compared to other candidates; priority consideration does not mean that the appellant's qualifications will be enhanced or that he will actually be selected; priority consideration requires the agency to refer the applicant to the selecting official for consideration once the agency determines that the appellant meets the minimum qualifications (citing <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 69 MSPR 268, 271 (1996))).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A settlement agreement may bind the agency to assist the appellant in placement efforts. The agency that agrees to assist in placement must use its best efforts. It should at the least, take those steps offered to other, favored, employees who seek positions within or outside the employing activity. Review of potential positions should not be hampered by artificial distinctions in positions, e.g., those with and without promotion potential. <span class="Italic">Pearson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 38 MSPR 255, 259-60 (1988). In <span class="Italic">Pearson</span>, the Board was not complimentary of the agency's compliance efforts as to an agreement that, in exchange for appellant's acceptance of a demotion, called for the agency to "use its best efforts to help the appellant apply for other federal positions, including affording him priority placement, if possible":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reveals several efforts the agency could have taken, but which it failed to make on somewhat questionable bases. The administrative judge himself noted that "the personnel department could have monitored the vacancy announcements from other facilities for Engineering Technician and Construction Inspector positions within a range between GS-7 and GS-11 (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, positions with promotion potential)." The agency's argument--that it monitored only incoming notices of positions outside of YPG without promotion potential because the cancelled demotion was from such a job--reflects an unnecessarily restrictive reading of the terms of the settlement agreement. No such restriction is specified or implied in those terms. Further, promotion potential is simply that; no guarantee of upward mobility is made to the incumbent of such a position. <span class="Italic">See generally Lange v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Transportation,</span> 2 MSPB 110, 1 MSPR 700, 702, 703 (1980) (an employee's reassignment from a position with known promotion potential to one without such expectancy does not constitute an appealable reduction in grade, because, even where all the conditions for promotion are met, a federal employee has no absolute right to promotion).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its response to the appellant's petition for enforcement, the agency states that it placed the appellant on a "special consideration list" so that he would be automatically referred for any GS-8 positions at the YPG.... Even accepting this explanation, the agency, at the very least, should have given the appellant similarly special consideration for jobs, with or without promotion potential, at any facility within the state.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the administrative judge noted that one of the agency's personnel officers testified that the agency has a policy of contacting other Army facilities and federal agencies directly to inquire about potential vacancies, "if any employee requests such assistance." Obviously, the purpose of such an inquiry is to notify the agency of the employee's desire for such assistance, and to thereby trigger the agency's policy. Having pledged itself in a formal settlement agreement to make "best efforts" to assist the appellant, the agency's explanation that it did not contact other facilities because the appellant did not specifically request that it do so is disingenuous at best, and arguably borders on bad faith<span class="Italic">. Compare Shirley v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 31 MSPR 640, 643 (1986) (in order to demonstrate that an agency's efforts to comply were in fact bad faith efforts to avoid compliance, an appellant must show that the agency's actions were something other than a reasonably vigorous defense of its interpretation of relevant statutes, regulations, or policies). <span class="Italic">See also Hart v. Department of Commerce,</span> 20 MSPR 494 (1984) (the Board has jurisdiction on a petition for enforcement to assure that the agency's efforts to comply with a Board order are <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency violated a settlement clause allowing an appellant to bid on positions without consideration of the adverse action that the agency rescinded. Agency officials involved in the removal action declined to refer the appellant to a promotion board because of their personal involvement in the prior action. The agreement provided no exceptions to the appellant's right to bid on jobs. The agreement was rescinded. Appellant's appeal was reinstated. <span class="Italic">Halsey v. USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 176, 179-80 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9 (1999). Another settlement allowed for the appellant to move into a vacant supervisory position of her choice. When that choice was denied to the appellant, the Board ordered a remedy that included retroactive placement with back pay. <span class="Italic">Fowler v. USPS</span>, 103 MSPR 80, 86-87 &#x00B6; 18, 2006 MSPB 239 (2006).</p>
