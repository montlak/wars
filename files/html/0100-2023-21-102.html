<h3 class="h3" id="sec14-101"><span class="space">F.</span> SURVIVOR ANNUITIES</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">The Congressional Research Service describes survivor annuities in its report, "Survivor Benefits for Families of Civilian Federal Employees and Retirees" (April 2014) [footnotes omitted] <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RS/RS21029">https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RS/RS21029</a>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Death of Current Civilian Federal Employee</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Spouse Survivor Benefits</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under CSRS, the surviving spouse of a federal employee who dies after having completed at least 18 months of service is eligible for an annuity, provided that the couple had been married for at least nine months or that the survivor is the parent of a child born of the marriage. The nine month requirement is waived if the worker's death was accidental. A divorced spouse of a federal employee may be eligible for a survivor benefit if the employee elected a survivor annuity for the former spouse or under a state court decree of divorce, annulment, or separation. The survivor annuity under CSRS is 55% of the retirement benefit that the deceased employee had accrued at the time of death, but without any reduction for being under the age of 55. The annuity is guaranteed to be no smaller than 55% of the lesser of (1) 40% of the average of the employee's highest three consecutive years of pay or (2) the annuity that would result from projecting the employee's years of service to age 60.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an employee participating in FERS dies after having completed at least 18 months of service, but fewer than 10 years of service, his or her spouse is eligible for a lump-sum survivor benefit equal to one-half of the employee's annual basic pay plus a lump sum payment (approximately $31,768 in 2014). This benefit can be paid as a single lump-sum, or in equal installments over 36 months (with interest) at the option of the surviving spouse. If the employee had at least 10 years of service, the spouse receives a lump sum and an annuity equal to 50% of the retirement annuity that the deceased employee had earned at the time of his or her death. Survivor annuities under CSRS and FERS terminate if the surviving spouse remarries before the age of 55 (unless the marriage to the federal employee lasted at least 30 years). If the subsequent remarriage ends in death, divorce, or annulment, the annuity restarts in the same amount.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Child Survivor Benefits</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under CSRS, a monthly annuity is paid to the surviving children of a deceased employee, as long as they are under the age of 18 and not married, or under age 22 if still in school. A child survivor enrolled full-time in school and whose 22nd birthday occurs before July 1 or after August 31 can continue to receive benefits while enrolled as a student through the following July 1. A surviving child is eligible for benefits regardless of age if he or she is incapable of self-support because of a physical or mental disability incurred before the age of 18. If a deceased federal employee is survived by a spouse or former spouse who is the <span id="Page_4216"></span>biological or adoptive parent of the employee's surviving child(ren), each child receives the smallest of these three annual amounts:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--60% of the employee's high-3 average pay, divided by the number of children,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--$6,024 (in 2014, indexed annually to the Consumer Price Index), or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--$18,072 (in 2014, also indexed to the CPI) divided by the number of children.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In most cases, the benefit will be $6,024 per year (indexed to the CPI). If the deceased employee is not survived by a spouse or former spouse who is the biological or adoptive parent of the surviving child(ren), then each child receives the smallest of these amounts:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--75% of the employee's high-3 average pay, divided by the number of children,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--$7,224 (in 2014, indexed annually to the Consumer Price Index), or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--$21,684 (in 2014, also indexed to the CPI) divided by the number of children.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In most cases, the benefit will be $7,224. If a married couple dies, both of whom were federal employees covered by CSRS, each child is eligible for two survivor annuities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Children of deceased federal employees who were covered by FERS may be eligible for Social Security benefits, according to the laws governing that program. If the benefit that the children would have received under CSRS would have been greater than the Social Security benefit alone, FERS will pay a monthly benefit that in combination with Social Security will equal the CSRS benefit. In most cases, however, the Social Security benefit alone will exceed the benefit that would have been payable under CSRS. Nevertheless, because Social Security survivor benefits end when a child reaches the age of 18 (or 19 if the child is still in high school), FERS pays a benefit equal to a CSRS benefit for as long as the child is unmarried, under age 22, and enrolled full-time in post-secondary education.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Spouse Survivor Benefits</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Married federal employees who retire under either CSRS or FERS automatically receive a <span class="Italic">joint and survivor annuity</span> unless both husband and wife decline it in writing, in which case the worker will receive a <span class="Italic">single-life annuity.</span> Under CSRS, if a worker receives a joint and survivor annuity, the annual benefit is reduced by an amount equal to 2.5% of the first $3,600 plus 10% of the annuity above that amount. In return for this reduction, the worker's spouse is entitled to a survivor annuity equal to 55% of the worker's full annuity <span class="Italic">before the reduction</span> is taken into account. Alternatively, a worker retiring under CSRS and his or her spouse can elect a smaller survivor annuity, in which case the worker's annuity is reduced by 2.5% of the first $3,600 and 10% of the annuity above this amount, up to the limit that he or she specifies as the base upon which the survivor benefit is to be calculated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under FERS, if a worker receives a joint and survivor annuity, the retiree's annual benefit is reduced by an amount equal to 10% of the annuity that would otherwise be paid. In return for this reduction, the worker's spouse is entitled to a survivor annuity equal to 50% of the worker's full annuity <span class="Italic">before the reduction</span> is taken into account. Alternatively, the couple may elect that the survivor benefit is to be based on one-half of the retiree's annuity, in which case the retired worker's annuity is reduced by 5% and the survivor benefit would be equal to 25% of the retiree's unreduced annuity. The reduction in the benefits of workers who elect a joint and survivor annuity is sufficient to cover only about half of the cost of the FERS survivor annuity and less than half of the cost of the CSRS survivor annuity. Consequently, survivor benefits under both CSRS and FERS are partially subsidized by the federal government.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the marriage of a retiree who had elected a joint and survivor annuity ends, his or her annuity is increased to the full amount payable under a single-life annuity. If the retired worker marries or remarries after retirement, he or she has a maximum of two years during which to elect survivor coverage for a new spouse, and the retiree's annuity is reduced accordingly. The election for a joint and survivor annuity must be made within two years of the date of marriage. To elect survivor coverage for a spouse married after the date of retirement, a lump-sum payment (plus 6% interest) must be made to cover the period preceding the post-retirement marriage during which no survivor reduction was in effect. This payment is necessary to preserve equity between couples who are married continuously throughout retirement and those who marry after retiring, because in both cases the survivor benefit is the same percentage of the retired worker's annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Child Survivor Benefits</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under both CSRS and FERS, survivor benefits are paid to children of deceased federal retirees in the same amounts and under the same eligibility criteria as apply to the children of deceased federal employees. Retired workers who are the parents of unmarried dependent children who might qualify for child survivor benefits are not required to take a reduction in their retirement annuities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Spouse Survivor Benefits under Deferred Retirement</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal employees are fully "vested" in (entitled to) a retirement annuity after completing five years of service. Vested employees who resign from federal employment before they are eligible to retire can defer receipt of their benefits until they reach the age of eligibility. Under CSRS, a deferred annuity can begin no earlier than the age of 62. Under FERS, an unreduced deferred annuity can start at the age of 62 for those with 5 to 19 years of service, at 60 for those with 20 to 29 years of service, or at 56 (increasing to 57 for employees born in 1970 or later) for those with 30 or more years of service. A reduced deferred FERS annuity is available at the age of 55 for those with 10 or more years of service. If the former employee dies after having begun to receive a retirement annuity, the surviving spouse is eligible for a survivor annuity under the rules applicable to CSRS or FERS, as described above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If a former employee who had been covered under CSRS dies before reaching the age of 62 and commencing his or her deferred annuity, no survivor benefit is paid. Instead, the surviving spouse receives a refund of the employee's contributions to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. If the former employee was covered under FERS, the surviving spouse may elect to receive an annuity or a lump-sum payment. If a former employee dies before having begun to receive a deferred annuity, no child survivor benefits are payable (although they may be payable under Social Security). If the employee dies after beginning to receive a deferred annuity, the surviving dependent children are eligible for survivor benefits under CSRS or FERS, as described above.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress first included a provision allowing retiring Federal employees to elect a reduced annuity with a spouse's survivor annuity in 1948. <span class="Italic">See</span> Civil Service Retirement Act-Amendment, Pub. L. No. 80-426, 62 Stat. 48 (1948). This right was limited to employees retiring under specific provisions of the Civil Service Retirement Act.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress extended the eligibility to elect a survivor annuity to employees entitled to deferred annuities in the 1956 Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> Federal Executive Pay Act of 1956, Pub.

OPM</span>, 587 F.3d 1111, 1113-15 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (Judge Newman dissenting):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Alice Dorsey appeals the October 8, 2008 decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board ("Board") affirming the Office of Personnel Management's ("OPM's") denial of her request for a survivor annuity benefit based on the federal service of her late spouse, Mr. James C. Blood. Because the Board's determination that Mr. Blood failed to elect a survivor annuity benefit during the two-year window provided for by statute is supported by substantial evidence, we affirm.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I.&#x2003;BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Blood retired from federal service on June 30, 1991. At that time, he was not married and did not elect either a survivor annuity benefit or life insurance coverage under the Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance ("FEGLI") Program. On October 25, 2002, Mr. Blood married Ms. Alice Dorsey. About a year later, Mr. Blood received from OPM Standard Forms 2808 and 2823, both of which he filled out and returned. These forms designated Ms. Dorsey as Mr. Blood's beneficiary under both the Civil Service Retirement System and FEGLI.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Blood passed away on February 2, 2008, and in March of that year Ms. Dorsey filed a request with OPM for a survivor annuity benefit. OPM denied the request, however, because Mr. Blood did not elect to <span id="Page_4218"></span>provide a survivor annuity benefit for Ms. Dorsey within two years of their marriage. On appeal, the Board concluded that the record supported the agency's conclusions that OPM satisfied its obligation to notify Mr. Blood of his right to elect a survivor annuity and that Mr. Blood did not make an election. Accordingly, it affirmed the agency's decision. Ms. Dorsey filed a timely appeal in this court. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">II.&#x2003;DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A federal employee who is unmarried at the time he retires but later marries has the right to irrevocably elect to provide a survivor annuity for his spouse. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2)(A). In order to exercise this right, the employee must submit to OPM a signed writing showing his intent to provide a survivor annuity within two years of the date of marriage. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> No particular form is required; any signed writing that manifests the annuitant's intent to make an election will suffice. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2469603543924533162&q=587+F.3d+1111&hl=en&as_sdt=2,47">985 F.2d 549</a>, 550 (Fed. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Dorsey raises several arguments on appeal. First, she argues that the evidence clearly shows that Mr. Blood intended to provide a survivor annuity for her, even though he did not file an election. According to Ms. Dorsey, Mr. Blood's submission of Standard Forms 2808 and 2823, combined with his desire to take care of his family, demonstrates that he intended for Ms. Dorsey to receive a survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the Board's determination that Mr. Blood did not elect to provide a survivor annuity for Ms. Dorsey, as required by statute. The forms submitted by Mr. Blood relate to other benefits and do not elect a survivor annuity benefit. Standard Form 2808 provides for the designation of a beneficiary to receive a lump-sum benefit under the Civil Service Retirement System, and specifically states that "[t]his Designation of Beneficiary form is used to designate who is to receive a lump-sum payment which may become payable after your death. It does not affect the right of any person who is eligible for survivor annuity benefits. Do not confuse this form with designation forms used for other types of benefits...." Standard Form 2823 provides for the designation of a beneficiary under the Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance program. The form repeatedly refers to "the Insured" and asks the person filling out the form whether he is the "Insured" or an "Assignee." Thus, even if Mr. Blood erroneously believed that the forms he submitted would provide a survivor annuity for Ms. Dorsey, the forms themselves do not demonstrate an intent to elect survivor annuity benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that Mr. Blood received general notice regarding his right to elect a survivor annuity as part of his Notices of Annuity Adjustment in 2002 and 2003. Those notices explained that to elect a survivor annuity benefit for the first time, the annuitant would need to make a deposit, the amount of which OPM would calculate following election. Failure to pay the deposit would result in cancellation of the election. The notices also informed Mr. Blood that upon electing a survivor annuity benefit, his own annuity would necessarily be reduced. Ms. Dorsey provided no evidence that OPM calculated a deposit amount, that Mr. Blood received a notice regarding his required deposit, or that Mr. Blood paid a deposit. Ms. Dorsey also does not claim that Mr. Blood's annuity was decreased in the five years following Mr. Blood's purported election. This provides further support for the Board's conclusion that Ms. Dorsey failed to prove that Mr. Blood intended to elect a survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We cannot hold otherwise. To do so, we would have to infer that a loving husband necessarily intends to procure every benefit available to him for his next of kin, even in the absence of evidence to that effect. Given that Ms. Dorsey carries the burden of proving that she is entitled to a survivor annuity benefit, we cannot draw that inference. <span class="Italic">Barnes v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10166103290115337468&q=587+F.3d+1111&hl=en&as_sdt=2,47">980 F.2d 708</a>, 713 (Fed. Cir. 1992). Further, we cannot lose sight of the fact that we have limited review in this case. The Board weighed the evidence and determined that "[n]othing in this record shows that Mr. Blood elected a survivor annuity for [Ms. Dorsey] within the time allowed." Because that conclusion is supported by substantial evidence, we must affirm.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, Ms. Dorsey argues that Mr. Blood was suffering from Alzheimer's disease for the last ten years of his life and was unaware that the forms he received from and returned to OPM would not provide a survivor annuity for her. The two-year window during which a recently married retiree may elect for a survivor annuity, however, is provided for by statute and applies even in cases of mental deficiency. <span class="Italic">Schoemakers v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9496523177942480571&q=587+F.3d+1111&hl=en&as_sdt=2,47">180 F.3d 1377</a>, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 1999). This court simply does not have the authority to ignore a statutory requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Ms. Dorsey argues that Mr. Blood never received a personal notice from OPM informing him that he only had two years after the date of their marriage during which he could elect to provide a survivor annuity for her and that the forms he had submitted did not make the election. To prove that it provided adequate notice, OPM must establish both "that the notice was actually sent....[and] the contents of the annual notice." <span class="Italic">Brush v. Office of Pers.

Although OPM has an obligation to provide annual notice to annuitants informing them that they have the right to elect a survivor annuity, OPM may satisfy that obligation by sending a general notice announcement rather than providing each annuitant with a personalized notice letter. <span class="Italic">Hairston v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15619315872761489073&q=587+F.3d+1111&hl=en&as_sdt=2,47">318 F.3d 1127</a>, 1130 (Fed. Cir. 2003). In this case, OPM provided a declaration by Cyrus S. Benson in which he stated that he sent out annual notices to all annuitants, including Mr. Blood, in December 2002 and 2003. The Board reviewed the notices and found that OPM properly notified Mr. Blood of his right to elect a survivor annuity. As discussed above, for instance, the notices provided Mr. Blood information regarding how to make an election, the time-frame within which he needed to do so, and the consequences of choosing a survivor annuity benefit. Thus, we agree that the notices were adequate. Finally, as to Ms. Dorsey's claim that OPM had an obligation to inform Mr. Blood that he failed to make an election, we cannot agree. The Board concluded that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the preponderance of evidence shows that the notices were properly mailed, and that Mr. Blood and/or [Ms. Dorsey] received those notices....that the notices contained an adequate explanation of Mr. Blood's right to elect a survivor annuity....[and that n]othing in this record shows that Mr. Blood elected a survivor annuity for [Ms. Dorsey] within the time allowed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we credit the Board's determination, we cannot conclude that OPM should have known of and acted upon Mr. Blood's alleged intent to elect a survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the Board's conclusion that Mr. Blood did not elect a survivor annuity benefit for Ms. Dorsey is supported by substantial evidence. As a result, we must affirm the Board's decision.</p>
