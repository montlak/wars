<h4 class="h4" id="sec4-18"><span class="space">2.</span> Unrequested Allegation</h4>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's regulations construing 5 USC 7117(c) provide that only an allegation of nonnegotiability in response to a written request for the allegation starts the clock running on the 15-day period for filing a negotiability petition for review (also referred to as a negotiability appeal) with FLRA. The written allegation must be of a specific nature. The time limit for filing a negotiability appeal is not begun when the agency advises the union orally or in writing that a proposal is not negotiable. The procedure required by 5 CFR 2424.11 (2022) is specific: the time limit begins to run only after the agency responds, in writing, to a written union request for an allegation of nonnegotiability. The rule preserves the union's right to appeal until it requests an allegation. The union may first propose alternatives or bargain over agency counterproposals as a means of resolving the dispute without involving FLRA. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3385 and Fed. Home Loan Bank Bd., Dist. 7, Chicago</span>, 7 FLRA 398, 400-01 (1981). FLRA's regulation, designed to avoid a "fruitless cycle of agency objection and appeal," is a permissible construction of the Statute. <span class="Italic">NRC v. FLRA</span>, 859 F.2d 302, 306 (4th Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">An unrequested allegation of nonnegotiability by an agency does not trigger the period for a union negotiability appeal. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1533 and Naval Supply Ctr., Oakland</span>, 8 FLRA 33, 34 n.3 (1982). If a union is served with an unrequested allegation of nonnegotiability, it may: (1) continue its attempts to reach agreement with the agency as to the matter in dispute; (2) submit a written request to the agency for another allegation and then file a petition for review of the negotiability issues; or (3) file an appeal from the unrequested allegation. If the last route is chosen, the appeal must be filed within the mandatory time limit. If the appeal from the unrequested allegation is untimely, the dismissal is without prejudice. The union may request another allegation and file a timely petition for review. <span class="Italic">Prod., Maint. and Pub. Employees Union Local 1276 and DLA, Defense Depot Tracy</span>, 9 FLRA 919, 920 (1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1735 and Dept. of Navy, Pub. Works Dept., Naval Air Station Kingsville, Tex</span>., 28 FLRA 771, 771-72 (1987) ("Where, as in the present case, a union is served with an activity's written allegation of nonnegotiability that has not been specifically solicited by the union in writing, the union may exercise its right to submit a written request to the activity for another allegation, and then file a petition for review of the negotiability dispute with the Authority in accordance with section 2424.3 of the Rules when the activity subsequently responds (or fails to respond); or file a timely petition for review of the unsolicited allegation of nonnegotiability."); <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l GSA Council, Local 1497 and GSA Region 3</span>, 24 FLRA 928, 929 (1986) ("An unrequested allegation of nonnegotiability offered by an agency does not trigger the time limits for the filing of a negotiability issue."); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1931 and Naval Weapons Station, Concord, Cal.</span>, 24 FLRA 512, 513 (1986) ("it is well established that a union is not required to file a petition for review in response to an allegation of nonnegotiability made by an agency in the context of a FSIP proceeding...the union may ignore such unsolicited allegation and instead elect to request in writing a written allegation of nonnegotiability from the Agency").</p>
<p class="noindent">According to <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 779 and Dept. of Air Force, Sheppard AFB</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-227.html">71 FLRA 1190</a>, 1191 (2020) (Member Abbott dissenting), an unrequested declaration of nonnegotiability would include an agency's assertion that a proposal is negotiable only at the election of the agency. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 779</span> added that an unrequested allegation (and the associated time for filing a negotiability appeal) would run from a statement in an agency's brief to FSIP that a proposal was nonnegotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7117 of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute), and &#x00A7; 2424.2 of the Authority's Regulations, the Authority will consider a petition for review of a negotiability dispute only when it has been established that the parties are in dispute as to whether a proposal is inconsistent with law, rule, or regulation. A union may file a petition for review with the Authority: (1) within fifteen days after receiving a written allegation concerning the duty to bargain from the Agency; or (2) after ten days if the Union requests that the Agency provide it with a written allegation concerning the duty to bargain and the Agency does not respond. Absent either condition, the petition is not properly before the Authority and must be dismissed.[9]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record does not show that the Union requested that the Agency provide it with a declaration that its proposal was non-negotiable. However, in the November email, the Agency alleged that the Union's proposal concerned the Agency's right to determine the technology, methods, and means of performing work, a permissive subject of bargaining under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. The Authority has held that, under the Authority's Regulations, "when an agency contends 'that a proposal is bargainable only <span class="Italic">at its election</span>,' '[a] <span class="Italic">negotiability dispute exists</span>.'" [10] Therefore, we find that the November email was an unsolicited allegation that the Union's proposal concerned a permissive subject of bargaining. Consequently, the Union could file a petition to challenge that allegation.[11]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1998</span>, 71 FLRA 417, 420 (2019) (Member Abbott dissenting in part) (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.2(c)).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The remaining question is whether the Union's petition is timely. Under &#x00A7; 2424.11(c) of the Authority's Regulations, a union is not required to file a negotiability petition in response to an agency's unsolicited allegation of nonnegotiability, but if it chooses to do so, it must file within fifteen days. Therefore, the Union was not required to file its petition after receiving the November email and could instead elect to ignore the Agency's unsolicited allegation and continue bargaining.[13]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that the parties continued the collective-bargaining process by participating in proceedings before the Panel. The Authority has found that an agency's unrequested allegation "made in a...brief in the context of a Panel proceeding and served upon the union...could constitute an 'allegation' for the purpose of appeal to the Authority." [14] It is unclear from the record when the Agency submitted its post-hearing brief containing its allegation of nonnegotiability to the Panel, but that brief must have been submitted before the Panel issued its decision on April 4, 2019. Thus, the Union's petition, filed on May 10, 2019, was clearly filed more than fifteen days after it received the Agency's unsolicited allegation of nonnegotiability during the Panel proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[14]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Local 1858</span>, 10 FLRA at 500 (citing <span class="Italic">Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, AFL-CIO, Local 121</span>, 10 FLRA 198, 199 (1982) (stating that "impasse resolution procedures of the Panel operate as one aspect of the collective bargaining process" and therefore, "the [a]gency and the [u]nion herein were involved in the collective bargaining process when the Agency submitted its allegation of nonnegotiability" in its pre-hearing brief).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the Union's petition is untimely and must be dismissed. However, under Authority precedent, the dismissal is without prejudice to the Union's right to refile. That is, if the matter proposed to be negotiated continues to be in dispute between the parties, the Union may request that the Agency provide it with a written allegation of nonnegotiability and may then file a petition for review in accordance with &#x00A7; 2424.21 of the Authority's Regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">A contract provision calling for early identification of negotiability objections does not alter the ordinary rule that a union may ignore an unrequested declaration that a proposal is nonnegotiable, <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1998 and Dept. of State, Passport Serv.</span>, 69 FLRA 586, 587-88 (2016) (Member Pizzella concurring and dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 2424.11(c) of the Authority's Regulations, a union is not required to file a negotiability petition in response to an agency's unsolicited allegation of nonnegotiability.[16] Rather, a union may ignore the unsolicited allegation and instead elect to request a written allegation from the agency.[17] If a union requests, and the agency provides, a written allegation of nonnegotiability, the union must file its petition for review within fifteen days of service of the agency's written allegation of nonnegotiability.[18]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[16]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.11(c); <span class="Italic">see AFGE, Local 3928</span>, 66 FLRA 175, 175 (2011) (<span class="Italic">Local 3928</span>) (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.11(c); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3369</span>, 49 FLRA 793, 794 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Local 3369</span>)).</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[18]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.21(a)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Union maintains that it did not request the Agency's August 12, 2015 allegations of nonnegotiability. Record evidence shows that the August 12, 2015 allegations of nonnegotiability were made in response to the Union's June 17, 2015 request to bargain over the proposals at issue. In this regard, the Union's request to bargain did not include a request for <span class="Italic">allegations of nonnegotiability</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the Agency asserts that the August 12, 2015 allegations were in response to a request by the Union, because Article 12, Section 14 of the parties' agreement constitutes a "standing request" for allegations of nonnegotiability. Article 12, Section 14 states: "If [m]anagement believes a written Union proposal is nonnegotiable, it will raise the issue of negotiability early, so that attempts can be made to correct the problem." The Agency alleges that this provision is "a standing request by the Union that the Agency provide allegations of nonnegotiability promptly upon receipt of any Union proposal it believes to be nonnegotiable." In support of this argument, the Agency cites to <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> (<span class="Italic">PTO Arlington</span>).[24]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[24]&#x2003;48 FLRA 919 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency misconstrues <span class="Italic">PTO Arlington</span>. In that case, the parties' agreement included an appendix listing several specific proposals that the agency had determined to be nonnegotiable, and that the union had contemplated appealing as of the date the agreement was executed.[25] The Authority held that, because the parties acknowledged that the agency considered the proposals to be nonnegotiable, and because the union indicated its intent to file a petition for review over the proposals as of the execution of the agreement, this provision of the parties' agreement constituted a written request by the union for an allegation of nonnegotiability.[26]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[25]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 923.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[26]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 922-23.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Those circumstances are clearly distinguishable from the circumstances in this case. Article 12, Section 14 of the parties' agreement does not list any proposals that the Agency had declared nonnegotiable. It merely states that the Agency will raise the issue of negotiability "early" after deeming any Union proposals to be nonnegotiable. The Agency fails to support, through relevant case law or facts, its argument that this provision constitutes a standing request for allegations of nonnegotiability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, the Union was free to ignore the August 12, 2015 allegations and subsequently to request written allegations of nonnegotiability regarding its proposals, which the Union did on September 8, 2015. The Agency responded on September 10, 2015. Under &#x00A7; 2424.21 of the Authority's Regulations, the timeliness of the Union's petition is measured from that date. There is no dispute that the Union's petition was filed within fifteen days of the Agency's September 10, 2015 response.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the alternative, the Agency argues that even if its allegations were unrequested, under &#x00A7; 2424.11(c) the Union was required to "continue to bargain" as demonstrated by "one or more affirmative acts" until it submitted its written request to the Agency. The Agency asserts that the Union took no "affirmative" action to bargain over Appendix N before filing its petition, and was therefore prohibited from filing its petition for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Agency cites no case law to support this interpretation of &#x00A7; 2424.11(c). Section 2424.11(c) provides, in pertinent part, that "[i]f an agency provides an exclusive representative with an unrequested written allegation concerning the duty to bargain, then the exclusive representative may either file a petition for review..., or continue to bargain and subsequently request in writing a written allegation concerning the duty to bargain, if necessary." The Authority has previously construed &#x00A7; 2424.11(c) to mean that a union may "ignore" an unsolicited allegation.[35] The Authority has never held that &#x00A7; 2424.11(c) requires a union to undertake an "affirmative act" indicative of bargaining between its receipt of unrequested allegations and its subsequent written request, and we decline to do so in this case.</p>

<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 422 and Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Colo. River Agency</span>, 34 FLRA 721, 723-24 (1990), the union's letter to the agency discussing clarification of its proposals, alleged to be nonnegotiable by the agency in proceedings before the FSIP, did not serve as a request for a declaration of nonnegotiability. The union could have ignored the agency's allegation. But when the union elected to file its petition with FLRA as a result of the agency's assertion of nonnegotiability, the union was required to do so within 15 days of the unrequested allegation from the agency to FSIP. The union's untimely petition was dismissed without prejudice to its refiling following a request to the agency for a written allegation of nonnegotiability. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3006 and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Idaho</span>, 47 FLRA 155, 156-57 (1993) (union could ignore unsolicited allegations of nonnegotiability; time for filing appeal ran from date of agency response to union request for allegation of nonnegotiability); <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council, Local 2544 and DOJ, INS, Border Patrol</span>, 46 FLRA 930, 932-33 (1992) (union could wait until second unsolicited allegation of nonnegotiability and then file its appeal, but if it elected to do so, it must file appeal within time limit set by statute and FLRA regulations); <span class="Italic">Wash. Area Metal Trades Council and Dept. of Navy, Naval Research Lab.</span>, 44 FLRA 733, 736 (1992) (union petition was timely when it ignored first unsolicited declaration of nonnegotiability but filed timely negotiability appeal after agency sent union second unsolicited declaration of nonnegotiability); <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 42 FLRA 599, 601-02 (1991) (rejecting agency's argument that agency's statement of position before FSIP was written allegation of nonnegotiability that triggered union's obligation to file negotiability appeal).</p>
<p class="noindent">Generally there is no confusion as to whether the union has requested an allegation of nonnegotiability. On occasion, however, FLRA must review the parties' correspondence to determine the nature of the transactions, a situation that occurred in <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 83 and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 35 FLRA 398, 402 (1990), concluding that a request for a discussion of ground rules concerning negotiability issues did not, though coupled with transmission of specific proposals, constitute a request for a declaration of nonnegotiability of any of those proposals. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2430 and VAMC, Ft. Lyon</span>, 36 FLRA 245, 247 (1990), the union submitted a petition for review of negotiability issues and conditioned its request on an Authority finding that the exchanges between the parties constituted a request for a negotiability allegation by the union and an allegation of nonnegotiability by the agency. The correspondence between the parties did not rise to that level and FLRA dismissed the petition with leave for the union to file a petition for review when the requisite formalities were satisfied. In <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council and DOJ, INS</span>, 42 FLRA 599, 602 (1991), a statement of nonnegotiability in an agency's submission to the FSIP constituted an unrequested declaration <span id="Page_407"></span>of nonnegotiability that was insufficient to trigger the union's time for requesting the Authority to review the negotiability issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-109 and VAMC, Newington</span>, 47 FLRA 651, 651-52 (1993) ("[W]e reject the Agency's contention that the petition for review should be dismissed for failure to include a written allegation of nonnegotiability by the Agency. The record reveals that an allegation of nonnegotiability by the Agency was made in a letter to the Federal Service Impasses Panel...").</p>
