<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kissel v. USPS</span>, 42 MSPR 154, 158 (1989), explained an exception to the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An exception to the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> exists, however, where there has been mistake, fraud, concealment, or misrepresentation by the defendant.... The Restatement Second of Judgments states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A defendant cannot justly object to being sued on a part or phase of a claim that the plaintiff failed to include in an earlier action because of the defendant's own fraud.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The result is the same when the defendant was not fraudulent, but by an innocent misrepresentation prevented the plaintiff from including the entire claim in the original action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Restatement (Second) Of Judgments &#x00A7; 26 comment j (1980). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also Harnett v. Billman</span>, 800 F.2d 1308, 1313 (4th Cir. 1986) ("[A]n exception to the general principle that lack of knowledge will not avoid the application of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> rules is found in cases where fraud, concealment, or misrepresentation have caused the plaintiff to fail to include a claim in a former action"), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 480 U.S. 932, 107 S. Ct. 1571, 94 L. Ed.2d 763 (1987); <span class="Italic">McCarty v. First of</span> <span class="Italic">Georgia Ins. Co.,</span> 713 F.2d 609, 612-13 (10th Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">res judicata</span> does not shield blameworthy defendants from the consequences of their own misconduct). <span class="Italic">See also United States v. Pueblo of Taos,</span> 207 Ct. Cl. 53, 515 F.2d 1404, 1406 (1975) (the bar of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> is not absolute and "can be lifted by an 'independent action' in another tribunal if the original decision alleged as a bar was unconscionable <span id="Page_1582"></span>because it was obtained by fraud on the court, or for various other reasons in the same family").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sarhan v. DOJ</span>, 610 Fed. Appx. 985, 986-87 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP), described the fraud exception to <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Res judicata</span> prevents parties from litigating claims that were brought or that could have been brought in a prior action. <span class="Italic">Carson v. Dep't of Energy</span>, 398 F.3d 1369, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Peartree v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 332, 337 (1995). The doctrine applies if: (1) the prior judgment was rendered by a forum with competent jurisdiction; (2) the prior judgment was a final judgment on the merits; and (3) the same cause of action and the same parties were involved in both cases. <span class="Italic">Carson</span>, 398 F.3d at 1375.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An exception to the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> exists where there has been fraud, concealment, or misrepresentation by a party. <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 341, 349 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 949 F.2d 404 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (unpublished table decision). But the fraud must "change substantially the posture of the case" in order to provide a basis for revisiting the appeal. <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. at 355. The preclusive effect of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> cannot be avoided by merely invoking arguments with a different legal basis. <span class="Italic">Dichoso v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 238 Fed. Appx. 600, 601 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing <span class="Italic">Foster v. Hallco Mfg. Co.</span>, 947 F.2d 469, 478 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (same "cause of action" for <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> means same "facts giving rise to the suit," not merely same argument or assertion)); <span class="Italic">see also Morton v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 174 Fed. Appx. 563, 566 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (finding claim of fraud committed in connection with removal precluded under doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> because appeal of removal involved same operative facts).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sarhan argues that his claim of fraud on the court is a new cause of action and therefore falls under an exception to <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. He asserts that the final decision in the prior appeal was tainted by fraud because the Board rejected his allegations that the Bureau's witness committed perjury, thereby depriving him of the opportunity to address the "deciding official" for his removal. Sarhan further asserts that the Bureau committed fraud on the court by concealing evidence of a witness's illegal behavior and an e-mail from his wife. Moreover, due to the late production of that evidence, he could not have raised the issue before.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government responds that the cause of action in both the prior appeal and the current appeal is Sarhan's removal, and Sarhan thus is attempting to relitigate the agency action. The government argues that Sarhan's evidence of fraud concerns the credibility of the Bureau's witnesses, which was previously litigated and is fully within the discretion of the AJ. The government also asserts that the claims about improperly withheld evidence are wrong and irrelevant. Although some of the evidence was not produced until the hearing, the government notes that Sarhan's counsel did not request any additional time to review the documents or otherwise indicate any prejudice from their late production.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the government that the Board did not err in finding that the appeal was barred by <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. As noted by the Board, many of Sarhan's assertions go to the merits of the Bureau's removal action, and either were raised or could have been raised in the prior proceeding. We also agree that Sarhan has not explained how the alleged perjury or the allegedly concealed evidence would have changed the outcome of the prior proceeding. <span class="Italic">See Anderson</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. at 355. We find no error in the Board's findings that Sarhan's new allegations of fraud did not substantially change the posture of the case and thus did not provide a basis for reversing the initial decision. Merely asserting a new legal claim of fraud on the court does not allow Sarhan to relitigate the same operative facts that were at issue in the removal action. <span class="Italic">See Dichoso</span>, 238 Fed. Appx. at 601. Moreover, we note that Sarhan admitted that, aside from his claim of fraud, his case is barred by <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. Because we agree with the Board that the fraud exception does not apply in this situation, the appeal was properly dismissed.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Although <span class="Italic">Kissel</span> did not clearly link the law with the facts, the Board was attempting to explain that if an individual has the basis for an appeal to the Board and then litigates it, and if the agency concealed another basis for the appeal, the appellant may file another appeal (assuming that the timeliness of the appeal is excused by the agency's concealment). In <span class="Italic">Kissel</span>, the Board was concerned with rights to priority consideration for restoration following recovery from a compensable injury. Following <span class="Italic">Kissel</span>, the Board determined in <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 46 MSPR 341, 349-51 (1990), that it could reopen its proceedings, even after Federal Circuit review, if the Board determined that the result it reached was secured through fraudulent documentary evidence introduced by an agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gilmore v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 94-3608) (to avoid a bar of prior litigation, there must be a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> claim of fraud: "Gilmore is simply relitigating his prior appeal under a guise of fraud.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Following his March 13, 2004 removal from his PS-4 Mail Handler position in the Postal Service, the appellant filed an appeal. Because the appellant did not indicate on his appeal form whether he was entitled to veterans' preference, the administrative judge ordered the appellant to establish the Board's jurisdiction by showing that he was a preference eligible; the administrative judge also informed the appellant that his appeal appeared to be untimely and ordered the appellant to establish good cause for the apparent delay. The administrative judge subsequently issued an initial decision finding that the appellant did not have appeal rights to the Board because he had not shown that he was a preference eligible. Accordingly, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and found it unnecessary to address the timeliness issue. The appellant did not file a petition for review, and the initial decision became final on July 2, 2004.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 20, 2005, the appellant again filed an appeal of his 2004 removal. This time, he indicated on the appeal form that he was entitled to veterans' preference. He also attached to his appeal form a PS Form 50 processed on May 20, 2004. Line 11 of the PS Form 50, titled "Veterans Preference," indicated the appellant's veterans' preference code as "2-5 points," and the "Remarks" section explained: "changes vet pref code from 1 [no preference] to 2 per DD-214." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (capitalization omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing that the appellant was not a preference eligible, and submitted a PS Form 50 issued in 1999, which listed his veterans' preference code as "1--no preference." The administrative judge ordered the appellant to submit evidence and argument showing that he was a preference eligible or otherwise had Board appeal rights. He also ordered the appellant to submit evidence and argument showing why he should not be collaterally estopped from relitigating the jurisdictional issue. In response, the appellant contended that he "served in the U.S. Army during and after the Gulf War and...was honorably discharged in 1997." He also re-submitted a copy of his May 2004 PS Form 50 indicating that he was a preference eligible and submitted a copy of his DD Form 214.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge issued an initial decision dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction based upon the doctrine of collateral estoppel. He determined that the appellant's present appeal involved the same action that was the subject of his earlier appeal and concluded that the four requirements for applying the collateral estoppel doctrine were met. Although the administrative judge indicated that he did consider the appellant's jurisdictional response, he did not explain why he chose to apply the collateral estoppel doctrine despite the May 2004 PS Form 50 indicating that the appellant is a preference eligible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant timely filed a petition for review in which he complains that the agency did not recognize his veterans' preference status until after his removal, as evidenced by the May 2004 PS Form 50. As to the administrative judge's decision to dismiss the appeal on collateral estoppel grounds, the appellant states that he <span class="Italic">seek</span>s the opportunity to "prove [his] case and not have it dismissed for a technicality."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction is not plenary; it is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985). To establish Board jurisdiction, a Postal Service employee must show that he has completed one year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions and that he was a preference eligible, a management or supervisory employee, or an employee engaged in personnel work in other than a purely non-confidential clerical capacity. <span class="Italic">Bolton v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 154 F.3d 1313, 1316 &#x0026; n.2 (Fed. Cir. 1998). In this case, the appellant, a PS-4 Mail Handler, was neither a supervisor or manager nor engaged in personnel work. Accordingly, for the Board to have jurisdiction over his appeal, he must be a preference-eligible employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, is appropriate when:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1) The issue is identical to that involved in the prior action; (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior action; (3) the determination on the issue in the prior action was necessary to the resulting judgment; and (4) the party against whom issue preclusion is sought had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior action, either as a party to the earlier action or as one whose interests were otherwise fully represented in that action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">McNeil v. Department of Defense</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 146, &#x00B6; 15 (2005); <span class="Italic">see Kroeger v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 865 F.2d 235, 239 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Because the jurisdictional issue in the present appeal was identical to that in the prior appeal and was actually litigated in that appeal, the first two criteria for the application of collateral estoppel are satisfied. The third criterion is likewise satisfied because the jurisdictional determination in the prior appeal was necessary to the resulting dismissal of that appeal. Finally, the appellant, as a party to the prior appeal, had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in that appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1583"></span>The Board may refrain, however, from applying collateral estoppel, even though these requirements have been met, if its application would result in injustice or compromise public policy. <span class="Italic">Fisher v. Department of Defense</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 509, 516 (1994); <span class="Italic">Montalvo v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 48, 50 n.3 (1991); <span class="Italic">Payer v. Department of the Army</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. 534, 538 (1984). Collateral estoppel will not preclude relitigation of an issue in a subsequent action between the parties where "[T]here is a clear and convincing need for a new determination of the issue...because the party sought to be precluded, as a result of the conduct of his adversary or other special circumstances, did not have an adequate opportunity or incentive to obtain a full and fair adjudication in the initial action." Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#x00A7; 28(5)(c) (1982). A party may not have had a fair opportunity to litigate in the initial action where the opposing party conceals information that would materially affect the outcome of the case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at cmt. J. We have previously found a similar exception applicable in cases involving the related doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kissel v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 154, 158 (1989) (noting that an exception to the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> exists in instances of mistake, fraud, concealment, or misrepresentation by one of the parties). This exception applies even in instances where a party made an innocent misrepresentation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the May 2004 PS Form 50 reflects that the agency changed the appellant's preference eligibility status from none to a five-point veterans' preference based upon his DD Form 214. The PS Form 50 was processed on May 20, 2004, but the parties have not addressed when it was sent to or received by the appellant. The appellant was removed in March 2004, however, and it is likely he did not receive the PS Form 50 before the administrative judge issued the initial decision in the prior appeal on May 28, 2004. If the appellant did not have access to the PS Form 50 at the time the prior appeal was pending, he was indeed denied a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue of whether he was a preference eligible. Further, if he mistakenly believed that he was not a preference eligible and that the Board thus lacked jurisdiction over his appeal, he lacked an incentive to pursue the jurisdictional issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, while the appellant could have filed a petition for review of the earlier initial decision rather than allowing it to become final, it is not clear that he was timely informed of the agency's change in its official records. In <span class="Italic">Jackson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 20 (1997), the Board excused the appellant's failure to submit to the administrative judge more recent military records in support of his contention that he was a preference eligible. There, although the appellant submitted the more recent records with his petition for review, the Board declined to apply the rule that evidence submitted for the first time on petition for review will not be considered. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 23. The Board's refusal to consider the evidence first presented on petition for review would have allowed the erroneous initial decision to stand and negated appeal rights that the appellant clearly possessed. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 22-24. Similarly, in the present appeal, precluding the appellant from relitigating the issue of whether he is a preference eligible would negate appeal rights he clearly possesses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, the agency clearly had possession of the May 20, 2004 PS Form 50 before the administrative judge issued the initial decision in the prior appeal. The agency nonetheless never apprised the administrative judge that it had changed its records; rather, the agency sat by silently as the administrative judge dismissed the appeal. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 144, 148-49 (1997) (criticizing the agency for its "gamesmanship" in arguing that an appeal was untimely filed when the agency possessed evidence in the form of a postal return receipt which conclusively demonstrated that the appeal was timely filed). In the present appeal, the agency has studiously avoided addressing the May 2004 PS Form 50, while maintaining that the appellant is not a preference eligible. Under these unusual circumstances, we decline to apply the collateral estoppel doctrine because we conclude that doing so would result in injustice or compromise public policy. <span class="Italic">See Montalvo</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. at 50 n.3 (refusing to apply collateral estoppel to a penalty determination that was "facially incorrect...and would result in injustice and compromise of public policy"). Because the record before us is sufficiently developed on the issue, we shall now resolve the question of whether the appellant is a Postal Service employee with appeal rights to the Board.</p>
