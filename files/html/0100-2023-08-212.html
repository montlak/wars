<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-210"><span class="space">c.</span> Correction of Pay, Grade</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Defined as adverse actions under 5 USC 7512, are:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;a reduction in grade;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)&#x2003;a reduction in pay;...</p>
<p class="Body-Text">According to 5 USC 7511:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;"grade" means a level of classification under a position classification system;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)&#x2003;"pay" means the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee;...</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To establish Board jurisdiction in an appeal from a reduction in grade or pay, the appellant must prove that the agency's action is one that is appealable to the Board, not solely the correction of an error. <span class="Italic">Kimzey v. USPS</span>, 94 MSPR 457, 462 &#x00B6; 14 (2003). With the qualification under <span class="Italic">Hudlow v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 8 MSPR 467, 469 (1981), that an agency is to act quickly after an error is made, the Board is without jurisdiction to consider a proper correction in a pay rate. The theory is that the agency has the authority, without adverse action procedures, to correct an error it made in setting pay because the Board's jurisdiction over a reduction in pay under 5 USC 7512(4) assumes a correct pay rate based on the definition of "pay" at 5 USC 7511(a)(4): "the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee." But a reduction in pay is likely appealable if the reduction is contrary to law or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Henderson v. OPM</span>, 102 MSPR 488, 492 &#x00B6; 9, 2006 MSPB 147 (2006).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Comparing the terms "pay" and "grade" for jurisdictional analysis, <span class="Italic">Fouks v. VA</span>, 122 MSPR 483, 486-87 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8, 2015 MSPB 37 (2015), offered:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the appellant was "demoted" within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.203 when he accepted the GS-12 position. That regulation, contained in the part of the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM's) regulations concerning pay under the GS scale, defines a demotion as a change from one GS grade to a lower GS grade, while continuously employed, with or without a reduction in pay. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.203. Thus, that definition notes a distinction between "grade" and "pay" and recognizes that a change in one does not necessarily require a change in the other. The adverse action procedures established in 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 similarly differentiate between a "reduction in pay" and a "reduction in grade."[1] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. Under chapter 75, "grade" is defined as "a level of classification under a position classification system." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(3). It is noteworthy that this definition does not include any explicit reference to pay. The statute separately defines "pay" as "the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(4). We find that the statutory language clearly provides that chapter 75 may apply when there has been either a reduction in grade or a reduction in pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The more general term, "demotion," does not appear in 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, subchapter II.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's action was undeniably a reduction in grade for the appellant. He was reduced from a GS-13 to a GS-12 because the agency determined he could not retain the higher grade while appointed to the new GS-12 position. Although he also received a corresponding reduction in his pay, that reduction was consequential to the reduction in grade. There is no general statutory or regulatory exclusion from the chapter 75 process for reductions in grade intended to correct an "administrative error," as the agency characterizes its error in this case. The exclusion contained in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15) is specific to a reduction in an employee's "rate of basic pay" only, and we do not find a valid basis for extending it to the circumstances of the appellant's reduction in grade, particularly given the statutory and regulatory distinctions between "grade" and "pay" discussed above.[2] The Board has recognized an exception from chapter 75 for a reduction in grade resulting from the merits of a classification decision. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Quinlan v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 118 M.S.P.R. 362, &#x00B6; 9 (2012). But, in this appeal, it appears that the appellant's position was at all times correctly classified at a GS-12 grade, and thus that exception would not apply. Therefore, we conclude that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15) does not preclude the application of chapter 75 to the appellant's reduction in grade.[3] [4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The exclusion might have applied had the agency reduced the appellant's rate of basic pay to a rate equivalent to the GS-12, step 10 level, without a reduction in grade, and it was only the appellant's rate of basic pay that was contrary to law or regulation. According to OPM's pay tables, GS-13, steps 1, 2, and 3 had salary rates lower than GS-12, step 10 in the appellant's locality pay area for fiscal year 2013.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;We have considered the appellant's arguments on review that his appointment at the GS-13 level was not an administrative error because the Standard Form 50 documenting his demotion also documents his conversion to a career appointment, a number of agency officials approved his grade, and the error came to management's attention via an equal employment opportunity complaint. We have considered these arguments but find that they are immaterial to the issue of the Board's jurisdiction.</p>

However, a reduction in pay "from a rate contrary to law or regulation" is not an appealable adverse action. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15). In this context, "pay" is defined as "the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by the employee, that is, the rate of pay before any deductions and exclusive of additional pay of any kind." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(f); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(4) (defining "pay" for purposes of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 as "the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee"). The appellant bears the burden of establishing jurisdiction over his appeal, and may make a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction by establishing that his rate of basic pay was reduced. <span class="Italic">Kile v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 49, &#x00B6; 17 (2006).

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant cites case law in support of her argument, but we are not persuaded.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Vega</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, noted that the requirement of pay correction or adjustment by law, rule, or regulation (to avoid an adverse action) does not include internal agency guidance or directives not rising to the level of regulations. An exception is made for provisions of negotiated agreements, considered under some circumstances to equate to agency regulations. Under <span class="Italic">Vega</span>, If the pay adjustment is not made in accordance with law, rule, or regulation, the agency must then establish whether the appellant was given due process rights as to the pay reduction and the Board must consider the merits of the agency action and any associated affirmative defenses. <span class="Italic">See Burkwist v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Effective May 2014, the appellant accepted a voluntary downgrade from an Executive and Administrative Schedule (EAS) 25 position to an EAS-24 position, with 1-year saved salary. He subsequently applied for a promotion back to a different EAS-25 position. The selecting official selected him and proposed to offer him a 5% salary increase. The concurring official approved the selection and the 5% salary increase, to be effective January 10, 2015. On December 30, 2014, the agency offered the appellant the position, with the 5% salary increase, which he accepted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon receipt of his Reassignment/Promotion Postal Service Form 50, the appellant noticed that his salary was unchanged from his 1-year saved pay rate. The agency argues that it did not implement the salary increase because it violated its Employee and Labor Relations Manual (ELM), section 415.3(a)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board generally has jurisdiction to review an appeal of a reduction in grade or pay. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(4); <span class="Italic">Levy v.

To establish jurisdiction over the agency's failure to effectuate a promised increase in pay in conjunction with a promotion, an appellant must establish that (1) the increase in rate of basic pay actually occurred; that is, it was approved by an authorized official aware that he was granting the pay increase; (2) the appellant took some action denoting acceptance of the increase in rate of basic pay; and (3) the increase in rate of basic pay was not revoked before it became effective.[4] <span class="Italic">See Levy</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 619, &#x00B6; 10 (applying these factors to the cancellation of a promotion). Thus, by alleging that the agency offered, and he accepted, a 5% salary increase, the appellant has made nonfrivolous allegations as to (1) and (2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In finding that the Board may have jurisdiction over the cancelation of a pay increase in these circumstances, we do not suggest that the cancelation of a pay increase, absent an accompanying promotion, is appealable to the Board. It is not. <span class="Italic">See Caven v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 392 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (explaining that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the denial of a promotion and the accompanying increase in pay). The alleged circumstances differ here because the appellant is alleging that the agency actually promoted him and granted him an accompanying pay increase but that it later canceled only the pay increase.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has presented argument and evidence that could potentially rebut any <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction that the appellant may make as to his reduction-in-pay claim. The agency alleged that it denied the appellant's 5% salary increase because it violated ELM section 415.3(a). Contrary to the general rule, a reduction in a rate of basic pay is not an appealable action when an agency reduces an employee's basic pay "from a rate that is contrary to law or regulation." <span class="Italic">Dekmar v. Department of the Army</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 512, &#x00B6; 8 (2006); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15).

Thus, if the appellant meets his jurisdictional burden, the administrative judge should hold a hearing at which the parties may address the issue of whether the agency's alleged pay reduction was the correction of a prior rate that was contrary to its ELM.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To the extent that the appellant is alleging that his race and age were the true reasons for the alleged pay reduction, and not a violation of ELM section 415.3(a), he may present evidence in support of this claim at the jurisdictional hearing. However, if the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's alleged reduction in pay, it cannot separately adjudicate his discrimination claims. <span class="Italic">See Rosario-Fabregas v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board implied that a reduction in pay to conform with OPM requirements negates a constructive adverse action appeal based on the appellant's reliance on an incorrect statement by the agency of the level of pay that the appellant would receive when the appellant applied for and accepted a position, but the agency has the burden of establishing the propriety of the final pay rate, <span class="Italic">Walderman v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 103 MSPR 456, 458-61 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-15, 2006 MSPB 284 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, an Aircraft Overhaul Supervisor, WS-10, applied for and was appointed to the position of Equipment Specialist, GS-11, Step 8, effective June 26, 2005. The rate of pay for the appellant's new GS position was $62,334.00. The agency subsequently informed the appellant that it had miscalculated his pay in the Equipment Specialist position and it reduced him from GS-11, Step 8, to GS-11, Step 4, with his rate of pay reduced to $55,595.00.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appealed to the Board, claiming that the agency had improperly reduced him in pay or grade. The agency responded that, as a result of the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM's) May 31, 2005 interim regulations, which were made retroactively effective to May 1, 2005, implementing the Federal Workforce Flexibility Act of 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-411, 2004 U.S.C.C.A.N (118 Stat.) 2305 (the Act), the appellant's rate of pay had to be reduced by lowering his step. The agency argued that, although the Board generally has jurisdiction over reductions in pay or grade, the Board does not have jurisdiction in those instances where the agency reduced an employee's basic pay "from a rate that is contrary to law or regulation." The agency argued that the appellant's pay reduction was therefore not appealable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ responded that the appellant had essentially argued that his reduction in pay should be "deemed a 'constructive demotion' (reduction in grade or pay) based upon the agency's material misinformation." The AJ ordered the agency to file an additional response to address whether the appellant was constructively demoted. The AJ subsequently canceled the appellant's requested hearing, stating that, during a telephonic status conference, the appellant "agreed to withdraw [his] hearing request and have the case decided on the basis of stipulated facts." The AJ further stated, "[B]ased upon the oral representations of the parties as to what the stipulated facts would be, I intend to find that the [appellant was] constructively demoted and order the agency to restore [him] to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency submitted a stipulation of facts in which it stated, in part, "Prior to applying...for the Equipment Specialist, GS-1670-11, position, the appellant read and relied upon the vacancy announcement which provided that [the] retain[ed] pay rules applied and that the salary includes locality pay." The AJ subsequently issued an initial decision in which he determined that the appellant had been constructively demoted based upon "material misadvice [sic] from the agency." The AJ reversed the agency's action and ordered the agency to restore the appellant "to the position and grade of Aircraft Overhaul Supervisor, WG-8801-10...."...</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction to review an appeal of a reduction in grade or pay. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. "Grade" is defined as "a level of classification under a position classification system." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ determined below that the appellant was reduced in grade and therefore constructively demoted. Specifically, the AJ concluded that the vacancy announcement published by the agency for the Equipment Specialist position "provided misinformation to the appellant" and that his resultant "detriment is obvious and needs no further discussion."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, however, was <span class="Italic">not</span> reduced in grade. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(3). The initial decision is therefore VACATED. Rather, the agency reduced the appellant's step resulting in a loss of pay. The issue before the Board, therefore, is whether it has jurisdiction to consider the appellant's reduction in pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Pay" is defined as "the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(4).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that the appellant's rate of basic pay was reduced from $62,334.00 to $55,595.00.

Department of the Navy</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 163, 168 (1995) (statements of a party's representative in a pleading do not constitute evidence). In addition, the SF-50 that purports to show the agency's correction of the appellant's pay cites "Reg 335.102 Comp" as legal authority for the change. The agency has not provided any explanation of this reference. If, for example, the agency is referring to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.102, which concerns an agency's general authority to promote, demote, or reassign certain employees, it is not clear how this provision supports the agency's contention that the appellant's pay was initially set at a rate contrary to law or regulation.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Warren v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 19 MSPR 560, 563 (1984), determined that Board jurisdiction could not be established by equitable estoppel over a change in agency pay policy:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In their petitions for review, appellants assert that the agency should be estopped from changing its pay policy as to them and from asserting the absence of subject matter jurisdiction. In support of this contention, the appellants allege that the agency was charged with knowledge of the relevant pay provisions and affirmatively misrepresented appellants' salaries, inducing appellants to move to Alaska and accept agency positions on the strength of these misrepresentations. Since none of the appellants alleged in the proceeding below that they affirmatively relied on the agency's salary offer to move to Alaska, we find that these allegations amount to a claim of detrimental reliance which is not supported oy the record and which appellants raise for the first time in their petitions for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that it would be reasonable to infer that the appellants so relied, we conclude that none of the cases cited by appellants support their theory that subject matter jurisdiction may be conferred on this Board based on a theory of equitable estoppel. Most of the cases cited by appellants stand for the general proposition that the United States may be estopped "where justice and fair play require it." <span class="Italic">See e.g., United States v. Lazy FC Ranch,</span> 481 F.2d 985, 988 (9th Cir. 1973). A review of the two cases which appellants cite as directly on point discloses that those cases are inapposite to the instant case. In <span class="Italic">DiFrischia v. New York Central Railroad,</span> 279 F.2d 141 (3rd Cir. 1960), the court found that the district court erred in dismissing for lack of diversity jurisdiction where the defendant had previously admitted to facts which were the basis for diversity. In <span class="Italic">Greenbaum v. United States,</span> 360 F. Supp. 784 (E.D. Pa. 1973), the court found that dismissal for lack of jurisdiction was inappropriate where the defendant's prior conduct amounted to an admission of a fact upon which jurisdiction could be based. These cases are clearly distinguishable from the instant case. Here, there are no facts upon which jurisdiction can be based and, additionally, jurisdiction is clearly precluded by 5 CFR &#x00A7; 752.401(c)(11), based on the legal conclusion that appellants' initial rate of pay was contrary to law....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency, not the appellant, must prove the propriety of the correction, as was explained (without mentioning when a hearing is required in a pay correction case) in <span class="Italic">Lomax v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue is whether paying the appellant at the GS-5, Step 10 rate was contrary to law or regulation. Board decisions have been inconsistent regarding which party bears the burden of proof on this issue. In <span class="Italic">Hall</span>, the agency reduced the appellant's pay by revoking a within-grade increase, for the stated reason that he had already received an equivalent increase during the relevant period; the appellant was required to prove that he had not received an equivalent increase, and that accordingly the granting of the within-grade increase was not contrary to law or regulation. 73 MSPR at 255. In <span class="Italic">Lemon</span>, the agency reduced the appellant's pay from the GS-12, Step 10 level to the GS-12, Step 7 level; the Board dismissed the appeal upon finding that "the agency ha[d] established" that setting the appellant's pay at the Step 10 level was contrary to regulation. 44 MSPR at 47. In <span class="Italic">Massey v. General Services Administration,</span> 10 MSPB 144, 11 MSPR 166, 167 (1982), the Board dismissed an appeal upon finding that "[t]he record demonstrates" that the appellant's pay was reduced to correct a legal error in setting his pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, an appellant bears the burden of establishing that his or her appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(1)(i)] . We hold that an appellant makes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction by establishing that his or her rate of basic pay was reduced, since by statute, such an action is appealable. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512(4). If the agency reduced the appellant's pay to correct what it believes was an error in setting pay--that is, if the agency believes that the appeal falls within the regulatory exception to the rule that a reduction in pay is appealable, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15)--then consistent with <span class="Italic">Lemon</span>, the agency bears the burden of showing that it set the appellant's pay at a rate contrary to law or regulation. An appellant should not be forced to prove that the agency did not make an error in setting his or her pay, <span id="Page_339"></span>since the agency is in a much better position to know why it originally set the appellant's pay as it did and what later led it to conclude that it made an error. <span class="Italic">Cf. Williams v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,</span> 75 MSPR 144 (1997) (although the appellant bears the ultimate burden of persuading the Board that his or her appeal was timely filed, if the agency contends that an appeal was filed late and has evidence in its possession that bears on the issue, the agency must produce that evidence); <span class="Italic">Clark v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 MSPR 552, 562, 565 (1997) (although the appellant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion on a disability discrimination claim, the agency is expected to respond to a facial showing of discrimination by demonstrating that the accommodation articulated by the appellant is unreasonable or unduly burdensome; the appellant is not required to prove that specific job modifications are reasonable to make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, because the agency "is generally expected to know more about...job duties and its ability to make modifications" than the appellant).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lomax</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Royster v. DOD</span>, 80 MSPR 356, 359-61 &#x00B6; 9-11 (1998), involving an appeal following a reduction in pay, taken without adverse action procedures, after the agency's payroll audit of agency employees revealed errors in the appellant's pay:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the administrative judge issued his initial decision in this case, the Board clarified the allocation of the burden of proof in cases of alleged reduction in pay. In <span class="Italic">Lomax v. Department of Defense,</span> 78 MSPR 553 (1998), the Board held that an appellant makes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction by establishing that his rate of basic pay was reduced, since, by statute, such an action is appealable, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512(4), and that if the agency reduced the appellant's pay to correct what it believes was an error in setting pay, then the agency bears the burden of showing that it set the appellant's pay at a rate contrary to law or regulation. 78 MSPR at 559-60. The Board explained that an appellant should not be forced to prove that the agency did not make an error in setting his pay, since the agency is in a much better position to know why it originally set the appellant's pay as it did and what later led it to conclude that it made an error. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the burden of proof as newly announced in <span class="Italic">Lomax</span>, we find that the appellant has made a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, as it is undisputed that his rate of basic pay was reduced. Although the agency claims that his pay was originally set at a rate contrary to regulation, that claim is largely in the form of assertions by the agency representative. Such assertions, however, do not constitute evidence<span class="Italic">. Hendricks v. Department of the Navy</span>, 69 MSPR 163, 168 (1995). Nor do the documents the agency has submitted support the assertions. For example, the SF-50 which purports to show a correction of the appellant's current pay from $78,799 to $75,314 offers, as legal authority for the change "5 USC 552A(E)(5)." That provision (actually, 5 USC &#x00A7; 552a(e)(5)) states only that each agency that maintains a system of records shall maintain those records "with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual...." Further, while the agency relies on the regulatory definition of "transfer" to support its position that the appellant's pay could not have been increased, the definition makes no mention of pay. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 531.202. In addition, although the agency asserts that there was no statutory or regulatory basis or authority for the $4,000 increase in the appellant's pay, the question is whether paying him at the higher amount was contrary to law or regulation. <span class="Italic">Lomax</span>, 78 MSPR at 556-57. In this regard, we note that the agency did not submit the audit which revealed, and presumably explained, the alleged pay error. In sum, we cannot find on this record that the agency set the appellant's pay at a rate contrary to law or regulation at the time of his transfer. Nor can we make any findings regarding the propriety of the alleged cancellation of the within-grade increase since the record is devoid of any documentation in support of that action reducing the appellant's pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the administrative judge did not have the benefit of <span class="Italic">Lomax</span>, the appeal must be remanded. On remand, the agency must show that the appellant's pay was reduced from a rate that was contrary to law or regulation. This showing must address the matter of the cancellation of the within-grade increase. Since the appellant bears the ultimate burden of proof on the issue of jurisdiction, however, he must be allowed the opportunity to counter any showing that the agency might make. <span class="Italic">Cf. Clark v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 MSPR 552, 559 (1997) (once the appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination, the burden of production shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action; if the employer satisfies this burden of production, then the appellant must introduce evidence to show that the proffered explanation is pretextual). In this regard, the administrative judge should consider anew the appellant's motion to compel discovery and his request for a hearing, both of which the administrative judge had earlier granted. And, if he concludes that the agency did reduce the appellant's pay to correct an error based on its having initially set the pay at a rate contrary to law or regulation, the administrative judge shall consider the appellant's argument, raised below, that 5 CFR &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15) itself is invalid as contrary to law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf. Walderman v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 103 MSPR 456, 458-61 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-15, 2006 MSPB 284 (2006) (agency has the burden of establishing the propriety of the final pay rate); <span class="Italic">Mulligan v.

<p class="Body-Text">After the issuance of <span class="Italic">Royster</span> and <span class="Italic">Mulligan</span>, <span class="Italic">Lomax</span> returned from remand, and the Board affirmed the appellant's reduction in pay, lamenting the appellant's plight. The appellant was relegated to an attempt to obtain waiver of an overpayment from her agency or the rather unlikely (or very arduous) process of obtaining relief (presumably a private bill) through Congress, <span class="Italic">Lomax v. DOD</span>, 88 MSPR 585, 586-89 &#x00B6; 4-10 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the agency submitted additional evidence regarding the jurisdictional issue. The administrative judge again dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, holding that in the absence of any statute providing for a higher rate of pay, the agency was required to set the appellant's pay at the minimum rate of the appropriate grade, GS-5, and that the agency's correction of the appellant's pay was therefore not an action that was appealable to the Board. Because of her jurisdictional determination, the administrative judge did not address the timeliness of the appeal. The appellant timely petitions for review of the administrative judge's remand initial decision....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A reduction in an employee's rate of basic pay is generally appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. H 7511(a)(4), 7512(4), 7513(d). An exception to this general rule is when an agency reduces an employee's basic pay "from a rate that is contrary to law or regulation." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15). Such an action is not appealable. <span class="Italic">Id; see Hall v. Department of the Navy,</span> 73 MSPR 251, 254 (1997). When an agency reduces an employee's pay to correct what it says was a pay-setting error, the Board, in determining whether the employee has a right of appeal, must decide whether the agency initially set the employee's pay at a rate contrary to law or regulation<span class="Italic">. See Worthington v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 43 MSPR 620, 624 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contended on remand that "Congress did not provide any statute which would allow the setting of the pay of an individual at a higher rate [than that applicable to new appointees, when the individual is] transferring from a nonappropriated fund entity with more than three days break in service." The administrative judge concluded that the agency correctly argued that the only statute under which the appellant could have been appointed is 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5333. We agree. Section 5333 states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">New appointments shall be made at the minimum rate of the appropriate grade. However, under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management which provide for such considerations as the existing pay or unusually high or unique qualifications of the candidate, or a special need of the Government for his services, the head of an agency may appoint, with the approval of the Office in each specific case, an individual to a position at such a rate above the minimum rate of the appropriate grade as the Office may authorize for this purpose.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under this general rule, the agency was required to appoint the appellant at the minimum rate of her grade, GS-5, unless she met the requirements of one of the statutory or regulatory exceptions to this rule. <span class="Italic">See Huston v. United States,</span> 956 F.2d 259, 262 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (the requirement of section 5333 that a new appointment be made at the minimum pay rate is mandatory). There is no evidence in the record that the appellant received an appointment at a higher rate based on her superior qualifications under the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) regulations implementing section 5333. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 531.203(b)(4) (agency documentation is required for a superior qualifications appointment). In fact, the OPM guidance that the agency followed when it appointed the appellant, Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Letter 315-30, stated that NAFI employees who moved to positions in the agency were not eligible for superior qualifications appointments. There is also no evidence that the agency set the appellant's pay in 1994 based either on her "existing pay" at the time or on a "special need of the Government" for her services.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Portability of Benefits for Nonappropriated Fund Employees Act of 1990 (the Portability Act) also provides an exception to the general rule of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5333. The Portability Act states that employees who move, on or after January 1, 1987, without a break in service of more than 3 days, from a NAFI position to a DOD position may have their initial rate of basic pay fixed at the minimum rate of the appropriate grade or at any step of such grade that does not exceed the highest previous rate of basic pay received by that employee during the employee's NAFI service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5334(f); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 531.206(a). Here, the appellant's break in service was approximately 2 months. Thus, she did not meet the requirements of the Portability Act in order to be appointed at higher than the minimum rate of her grade.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Portability Act and its implementing regulations do not address the <span id="Page_340"></span>computation of pay for former NAFI employees such as the appellant who have greater than a 3-day break in service. This silence does not support a determination that the appellant's pay could properly be set at the Step 10 level. Such reasoning would be contrary to the maxim of statutory interpretation, expressio <span class="Italic">unius est exclusio alterius,</span> i.e., the expression of one thing is the exclusion of others. <span class="Italic">See King v. Briggs,</span> 83 F.3d 1384, 1388 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Under this maxim, where a statute enumerates an exception to a general rule, other, unenumerated exceptions are excluded. Following this maxim, the Portability Act's silence regarding NAFI employees with a greater than 3 day break in service should be construed to place those employees, including the appellant, under the general rule of appointment stated in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5333. The appellant therefore should have been appointed at the GS-5, Step 1 level and the agency's action setting her pay at a higher step was contrary to section 5333. <span class="Italic">See Worthington</span>, 43 MSPR at 624.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we affirm the determination of the administrative judge in the remand initial decision to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.[3] Given that the appeal was properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, the administrative judge correctly declined to address the timeliness issue. <span class="Italic">See Popham v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 50 MSPR 193, 197 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The appellant's situation is sympathetic. The agency did not realize its error in setting the appellant's pay for more than 3 years. In fact, it was the appellant herself who inadvertently brought the matter to the agency's attention when she made an inquiry regarding another personnel matter. As a result, the agency significantly reduced the appellant's pay through no fault of her own and then informed her that she owed more than $5,000. While, as discussed above, we find that the setting of the appellant's pay at the step 10 level was contrary to law, the inequities of this case are relevant to the agency's determination of whether to waive recovery of the appellant's overpayment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5584(a). In addition, we note that the appellant may wish to bring her reduction in pay to the attention of Congress, which may offer a potential means of recourse. <span class="Italic">See Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond,</span> 496 U.S. 414, 424, 110 S. Ct. 2465, 110 L. Ed.2d 387 (1990) (no money can be paid out of the Treasury unless it has been appropriated by an act of Congress).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency may not act unilaterally to correct a pay rate if, in fact, the appellant was promoted into the position mandating payment at that rate; then the action is an appealable demotion, that is, a change to lower grade or pay, <span class="Italic">Barnes v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 337, 340 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge erroneously relied upon <span class="Italic">Lemon</span> in dismissing this appeal. <span class="Italic">Lemon</span> involved the correction of a pay error; the erroneous setting of a within-grade step following termination of a temporary promotion. Such error resulted in pay established contrary to law and regulation and its correction was required by law and regulation. Under those circumstances, the Board held that such a pay reduction was not appealable as an adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Lemon</span>, 44 MSPR at 47-48; 5 CFR 752.401(b)(15) (describing exceptions to adverse actions, including correction of a pay error).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the instant case involves a "demotion"--a change to a lower grade or a lower rate of pay--not merely a change in pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 210.102(b)(4); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 USC 7512(3), (4). Moreover, the demotion here was discretionary with the agency, not required by law or regulation as was the within-grade step change in <span class="Italic">Lemon</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Clark v. Department of the Interior</span>, 68 MSPR 453, 457 (1995), the Board set forth the test for jurisdiction in a case involving an alleged demotion after cancellation of a promotion. In order to establish Board jurisdiction in an appeal from the cancellation of a promotion, the appellant must raise a nonfrivolous allegation that the promotion actually occurred; that is, that the promotion was approved by an authorized appointing official aware that he was making the promotion, and that some action denoting acceptance of the promotion was taken. The promotion must not have been revoked prior to the appellant's performance in the higher grade. <span class="Italic">See also Watts v. OPM</span>, 814 F.2d 1576, 1580 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">Notwithstanding all of the law concerning the ability of an agency to correct an employee's pay without creating an appealable action, the agency should act promptly to correct a pay error, although there are no strict guidelines defining intolerable delay. Under <span class="Italic">Hudlow v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 8 MSPR 467, 469 (1981), an eight-week delay in correcting a pay error did not establish an appealable reduction in pay:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established that an agency is vested with the power to correct its errors provided it does so within a reasonable period of time<span class="Italic">. See Mazaleski v. Treusdell</span>, 562 F.2d 701, 721, (D.C. Cir. 1977); <span class="Italic">Gratehouse v. United States</span>, 512 F.2d [1104, 1109, 206 Ct. Cl. 288] (Ct.

In determining what would be considered a "reasonable" period of time, the court in <span class="Italic">Gratehouse, id</span>., while recognizing that interpretations of the term "reasonable" will differ from case to case, nevertheless concluded that the time period should be measured in weeks and not years.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Morris v. Dept. of Army</span>, SF-3443-09-0296-B-1 (NP 3/22/2012) ("We find that the totality of the circumstances show that the agency actually appointed the newly hired employee to the position of YA-02 SOO effective May 27, 2008, that the initial SF-50 documenting that appointment contained an administrative error regarding the actual position classification, and that, upon recognition of the administrative error, the agency issued a June 9, 2008 SF-50 documenting the correct position classification. We further find that the agency's correction of the administrative error within 2 weeks of the new employee's entrance on duty occurred within a reasonable period of time. <span class="Italic">See Batchelder</span>, 11 M.S.P.R. at 530-31; <span class="Italic">Hudlow</span>, 8 M.S.P.R. at 469.

<p class="Body-Text">If a pay correction action is belated, and the Board then has jurisdiction, what is the remedy? The answer was implied though not provided in <span class="Italic">Gratehouse v. United States</span>, 512 F.2d 1104, 1109-110 (Ct. Cl. 1975), not involving a pay correction but cited in <span class="Italic">Hudlow</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We have many times held that an agency has the inherent power to reconsider and change a decision if it does so within a reasonable period of time. Recently, in fact, we applied this rule specifically to the CSC. <span class="Italic">Bookman v. United States</span>, 453 F.2d 1263, 197 Ct. Cl. 108 (1972). In <span class="Italic">Bookman</span> we noted at 111 (453 F.2d at 1265) that "reconsideration is often the sole means of correcting errors of procedure or substance." We stated further:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...this court will sustain the reconsidered decision of an agency, as long as the administrative action is conducted within a short and reasonable time period....[453 F.2d at 1265, 197 Ct. Cl. at 112-13.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">What is a short and reasonable time period will vary with each case, but absent unusual circumstances, the time period would be measured in weeks, not years. A correction of an error within a reasonable time period will have retroactive effect, or, in other words, will preclude any cause of action based on the original error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where reasonable time for reconsideration has expired, there is no longer an opportunity to correct the procedural error retroactively. <span class="Italic">Vitarelli v.

United States</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. This is true because, generally speaking, separation of an employee in violation of procedural regulations is illegal and void, except where it is harmless error. The employee in effect was never separated, and never stopped drawing his pay. <span class="Italic">Service v. Dulles</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Jones v. United States</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. In sum, where a prejudicial procedural error has been committed, and a reasonable time for reconsideration has run, the purpose of a correction of that error can only be to determine the merits of the dispute prospectively.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, defendant's offer of a CSC hearing 2 years after a hearing could have been held was far too late to qualify as reconsideration.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A complex set of events led to a reduction in pay appeal and a determination that the agency action was reversed because, given the delay by the agency in making its correction, it was required to but failed to provide notice and due process rights when it reduced the appellant's pay following a temporary promotion and improper application of a highest previous rate of pay rule, <span class="Italic">Munoz v.

During the period of his deployment, he was given a temporary promotion from GS-11, Step 2, to GS-12, Step 1. The appellant was granted a within-grade increase to GS 12, Step 2 while he was deployed. Upon his return to his regular position, the agency changed the appellant's pay from GS-12, Step 2, to GS-11, Step 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After being placed at the GS 11, Step 9 level, the appellant questioned whether his pay was correctly set and, the appellant's supervisor, Alan Hand, sent the following e-mail inquiry to Catherine Erickson, the agency's designated point of contact for personnel and payroll problems: "Mr. Munoz has reported that he is being paid at the GS-11-Step 9 rate. Please double check and make sure this is correct." Ms. Erickson responded to Mr. Hand's question as follows: "Mr. Munoz is being paid as a GS 11/09, and this is in DCPDS (Personnel System) so it is correct."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_341"></span>The appellant volunteered for a second temporary overseas deployment for more than 12 months, in Afghanistan this time, from June 22, 2008, until July 18, 2009. During the period of his deployment, he was given a temporary promotion from GS-11, Step 9, to GS-13, Step 1. The appellant received a within grade increase to GS-13, Step 2, while deployed. Upon his return home to his regular position, the agency set the appellant's pay from GS-13, Step 2, to GS-11, Step 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a January 26, 2010 memorandum, the agency notified the appellant that, upon his return from his first overseas deployment, his pay was erroneously set based on his deployed GS-12, Step 2 rate, instead of his pre-deployment rate of GS-11, Step 2. The notice informed him that corrections would be made to his personnel actions, and that the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) may seek to recoup any overpayment that results from the corrections. As a result of the various changes made to his personnel actions, the appellant's pay is currently set at GS-11, Step 5. The appellant has submitted evidence showing that DFAS is currently offsetting his pay to collect approximately $33,000.00 in salary overpayments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an August 19, 2010 appeal, in which he claimed that the agency had notified him on March 17, 2010 that it had taken a January 26, 2010 reduction in pay adverse action and that the agency did not provide him with any notice of his rights in regard to the action....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserted that the appellant's pay was "set <span class="Italic">incorrectly</span>" upon his return from his first temporary overseas deployment, as a result of an administrative pay setting error. The agency asserted that the appeal should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because the agency's "correction of an error in setting pay at a rate contrary to law or regulation does not fit any of the enumerated grounds for MSPB jurisdiction." The administrative judge found that the agency established that its January 26, 2010 action reducing the appellant's pay was taken due to an "'administrative processing error,' as argued by the agency," and thus, it was done to correct the fact that his pay had been set "at a rate that was contrary to regulation." Accordingly, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The appellant has filed a petition for review and the agency has filed a response in opposition to the petition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has adverse action jurisdiction to review an appeal of a reduction in grade or pay. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. The general rule is that a reduction in an employee's rate of basic pay is appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a)(4), 7512(4), 7513(d). However, an exception to this rule is when an agency reduces an employee's basic pay "from a rate that is contrary to law or regulation." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15). Such an action is not appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Gessert v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 329, &#x00B6; 8 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency contends that it reduced an employee's pay to correct what it believes was an error in setting pay, the agency bears the burden of showing that it set the employee's pay at a rate contrary to law or regulation. <span class="Italic">Gessert</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 329, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">see Lomax v. Department of Defense</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 553, 559-60 (1998). There is no dispute in this case that the appellant has suffered reductions in pay as a result of the agency's January 26, 2010 corrections to all of his pay-related personnel actions from November 12, 2006, through October 25, 2009, the date his pay was set at its current GS-11, Step 5 rate. Thus, the appellant has made a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Lomax</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 560.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the administrative judge erred in dismissing his appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the agency has repeatedly acknowledged that upon his return from Iraq it set his pay to correspond with the rate of pay he earned during his temporary overseas promotion, which was his highest previous rate of pay. The appellant notes that setting his pay to correspond to his highest previous rate of pay (in his case from GS-12, Step 2, to GS-11, Step 9) was authorized and not contrary to the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM's) pay setting regulations under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 531.221 and .222, and was consistent with the agency's written pay setting guidelines. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's pay setting regulations provide that when an employee is returned to his lower grade following the end of a temporary promotion, "the agency must set the employee's payable rate of basic pay in the lower grade as if he or she had not been temporarily promoted, unless the agency sets pay at a higher rate under the maximum payable rate rule in &#x00A7; 531.221." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.215(c). 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.221(b) provides in relevant part that an agency may use the maximum payable rate rule to set an employee's pay by taking the employee's highest previous rate of pay and using that rate to determine the new GS step level within the GS grade level in which the employee's pay is currently being set. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 531.222(a)(1)(ii) provides in relevant part that an employee's highest rate of pay is the highest GS grade and step level previously held by the employee. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 531.223(b) provides in relevant part that an employee's highest previous rate of pay may not be based on the rate of pay an employee received during a temporary promotion that lasted less than 1 year. In combined effect, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 531.221, .222 and .223 authorize an agency to use an employee's highest previous rate of pay received during a temporary promotion of 1 year or longer to set the employee's rate of pay following the expiration of the employee's temporary promotion. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 531.221(a)-(b), .222(a)(1)(ii), and .223(b). Thus, as the appellant asserts, when the agency demoted him from his GS-12, Step 2 temporary promotion rate of pay to his previous GS-11 rate of pay, the agency had the discretion to use the maximum payable rate rule to set his pay by placing him in the lowest GS-11 step level that was equivalent to his highest previous rate of pay--his GS-12, Step 2 temporary promotion rate of pay--which resulted in his rate of pay being set at GS-11, Step 9. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.211(b). Therefore, the agency lawfully set the appellant's pay at the GS-11, Step 9 level upon the expiration of his temporary promotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Chief of the appellant's Division and the Savannah District Commander asserted that they had not authorized the use of an employee's highest previous rate of pay in setting an employee's pay upon the employee's return from an overseas deployment and that it was not the Savannah District's policy to authorize such use. The agency did not, however, provide any evidence of a law or agency regulation regarding the policy. The appellant, however, submitted a 2008 Memorandum from the Department of the Defense's Under Secretary for Personnel and Readiness and a 1986 agency regulation regarding civilian pay administration which show that setting an employee's pay under OPM's maximum payable rate rule, by using the employee's highest previous rate of pay, was within the agency's discretion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed previously, although the Board generally has jurisdiction over a reduction in an employee's rate of basic pay, an exception exists when an agency reduces an employee's basic pay "from a rate that is contrary to law or regulation." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15); <span class="Italic">see Gessert</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 329, &#x00B6; 8. When an agency reduces an employee's pay to correct what it says was a pay setting error, the Board, in determining whether the employee has a right to appeal the reduction in pay, must decide whether the agency initially set the employee's pay at a rate contrary to law or regulation. <span class="Italic">Lomax v. Department of Defense</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 585, &#x00B6; 5 (2001); <span class="Italic">see Warren v. Department of Transportation</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. 560, 565 (1984) (an agency action which corrected the appellant's pay from one contrary to law or regulation to one permitted by law or regulation was specifically excluded from the Board's jurisdiction under the OPM regulations).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as discussed above, the appellant's pay was not set at a level contrary to law or regulation. Rather, the agency had the discretion to set the appellant's pay as it initially did. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 531.215(c), .221(a)-(b). The Board has held that unless the agency proves that the employee's pay actually violated a law or regulation, the employee's pay is not "contrary to law or regulation" and the exception to the Board's jurisdiction does not apply. <span class="Italic">See Vega v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13, 18 (2008); <span class="Italic">compare</span>,<span class="Italic"> Gessert,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 329, &#x00B6; 10 (reduction in pay was required because the agency lacked the authority to promote the appellant to the GS-14 level under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 362.204(d)(1) following his completion of the Presidential Management Fellows Program); <span class="Italic">Lomax</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 585, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (the agency was required to reduce the appellant's rate of pay from GS-11, Step 5, to GS-11, Step 1, because the appellant did not satisfy the requirements of any statutory or regulatory provision that could authorize the agency to set her pay above the minimum Step 1 level of pay). The Board has also held that the "contrary to law or regulation" exception to its jurisdiction does not apply where the reduction in pay was the result of the agency's correction of a discretionary action. <span class="Italic">See Barnes v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 337, 339-40 (1996) (the appellant established the Board's jurisdiction where the agency's corrective action in demoting him from EAS-23 to EAS-21 was discretionary and was not required by law or regulation). In sum, although it may have been contrary to the Savannah District's policy and practice to authorize the setting of a returning employee's pay by using the employee's temporary promotion based highest previous rate of pay, doing so was not contrary to law or regulation and thus the "contrary to law or regulation" exception to the Board's jurisdiction over a reduction in basic rate of pay is not applicable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's precedent provides that an agency may correct a pay action that is not contrary to law, rule, or regulation but nonetheless reflects an "administrative processing error" and its corrective action will not fall within the Board's adverse action jurisdiction if the agency takes the corrective action within a "reasonable period of time." <span class="Italic">See Batchelder v. Department of the Army</span>, 11 M.S.P.R. 529, 530-31 (1982); <span class="Italic">Hudlow v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 8 M.S.P.R. 467, 469-70 (1981). A "reasonable" period of time should be measured in weeks and not years. <span class="Italic">See Hudlow</span>, 8 M.S.P.R. at 469. Here several years passed between the agency's asserted administrative pay setting error and its corrective action. Furthermore, the appellant specifically informed the agency of a possible pay setting error in 2006. Thus, we find that the agency's January 26, 2010 correction of its November 12, 2006 administrative processing error was not taken within a reasonable time and is therefore within the Board's adverse action jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's January 26, 2010 notice that it was correcting an <span id="Page_342"></span>administrative pay setting error fails to notify the appellant of his constitutional due process rights as set forth under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b). An agency must afford a tenured employee their constitutional due process rights of notice and an opportunity to respond in taking an adverse action as to which the employee has appeal rights. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b); <span class="Italic">see Steinhoff v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6; 7 (2006). The agency's January 26, 2010 notice failed to provide the appellant with the notice and opportunity to respond required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b), and its reduction in pay action must therefore be reversed. <span class="Italic">See Steinhoff</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6; 7. Accordingly, we REVERSE the initial decision, we ORDER the agency to CANCEL its administrative correction of its November 12, 2006 pay setting action and all of the other reduction in pay actions that resulted from that corrective action, and we ORDER the agency to cancel the overpayment determination, any collection of the asserted overpayment, and to pay the appellant the amount of any refunded overpayment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant appeals a pay reduction and the agency responds with an argument that the reduction was not really an adverse action but was instead, for example, the restoration of a permanent pay rate, the AJ should convene a jurisdictional hearing if the appellant's evidence, although disputed by the agency, suggests that an adverse action may have occurred. <span class="Italic">See Ferdon v. USPS</span>, 60 MSPR 325, 330 (1994); <span class="Italic">cf. Riley v. NASA</span>, 79 MSPR 505, 508-10 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-11 (1998) (<span class="Italic">Henry v. DOD</span>, 33 MSPR 562 (1987), does not apply when an employee appeals administrative error resulting in demotion, i.e., change to lower grade or lower rate of pay); <span class="Italic">cf.
