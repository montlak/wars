<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-233"><span class="space">2.</span> Substantial Impact on Law</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit broadly interprets OPM's authority to seek reconsideration of MSPB decisions interpreting civil service laws. <span class="Italic">Horner v. Schuck</span>, 843 F.2d 1368, 1371-74 (Fed. Cir. 1988), considered whether OPM could obtain judicial review through the reconsideration process of an issue involving interpretation of provisions of a Postal Service collective bargaining agreement. The Federal Circuit, contrary to MSPB arguments, concluded that review is available:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, contains no express definition of a "civil service law."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The inclusion of preference eligible employees of the Postal Service in the definition of "employee" affords them the procedural rights set forth in Subchapter II of Chapter 75 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code, relating to "Removal, Suspension for more than 14 days, Reduction in Grade or Pay, or Furlough for 30 days or less."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of the breadth of these provisions, there can be little doubt that preference eligible employees of the Postal Service are to be treated the same as civil service employees. It is arguable that the PRA should be considered a civil service law because of the language of 39 USC &#x00A7; 1001(b). We need not decide this, however, because it is clear that the board interpreted a civil service law by deciding whether it had authority under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511 to apply CSRA principles to the placement of petitioners in a nonpay, nonduty status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Postal employees are bound by the terms and conditions of employment set forth in a collective bargaining agreement negotiated pursuant to the PRA. 39 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1206 and 1209 (1982). The agreement contains a grievance arbitration process by which disputes as to the interpretation of the agreement may be resolved. Inasmuch as the board considered the scope of its authority to interpret the collective bargaining agreement in light of CSRA principles and the PRA's provisions for dispute resolution, its decisions in <span class="Italic">Schuck</span> and <span class="Italic">James</span> involved interpretation of a civil service law. Moreover, in deciding that the agency actions constituted furloughs or reductions in force, the board determined the applicability of 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a)(5), 7512 and 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 351.201(a)(2), 351.202(a)(1) and in doing so was engaged in the interpretation of civil service laws and regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB contends that even if the board decisions involved interpretation of a civil service law, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701 (1982) and the legislative history of section 7703 demonstrate that the Director lacks authority to seek review unless the law is one that OPM is "responsible" for administering.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7701(d)(1) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In any case in which--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;the interpretation or application of any civil service law, rule, or regulation, <span class="Italic">under the jurisdiction of</span> the Office of Personnel Management is at issue in any proceeding under this section; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;the Director of the Office of Personnel Management is of the opinion that an erroneous decision would have a substantial impact on any civil law, rule, or regulation <span class="Italic">under the jurisdiction of</span> the Office; the Director may as a matter of right intervene or otherwise participate in that proceeding before the Board, (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, &#x00A7; 7701(e)(2) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Director may petition the Board for a review...only if the Director is of the opinion that the decision is erroneous and will have a substantial impact on any civil service law, rule, or regulation <span class="Italic">under the jurisdiction of</span> the Office. (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB notes that the Director must allege misinterpretation of a civil service law <span class="Italic">under the jurisdiction of</span> OPM in order to participate in board proceedings under section 7701 and must intervene in those board proceedings or petition the board for reconsideration before judicial review is requested. The MSPB argues that section 7703(d), therefore, at least implicitly, requires that the civil service law at issue must be one which is under the jurisdiction of the OPM. To interpret section 7703(d) otherwise, according to the MSPB, would be illogical since it would permit the Director to seek judicial review in cases where she could not intervene or request board reconsideration, even though these actions are prerequisites to judicial review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree. The Director's statutory right to seek judicial review is circumscribed only by the terms of section 7703(d) and the court's discretion to evaluate the Director's request for judicial review. <span class="Italic">Devine v. Levin</span>, 739 F.2d 1567, 1569 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Section 7703(d), unlike section 7701, contains no requirement that the law, rule or regulation be one which is "under the jurisdiction of OPM." The MSPB's restrictive interpretation of section 7703 would invest the MSPB with a power not granted to it by Congress--that of determining which civil service laws, rules or regulations are the responsibility of OPM. The Director's interpretation, permitting petitions for review regardless of whether the law, rule or regulation at issue is one specifically under the purview of OPM, would, in contrast, comport with the intent of Congress that the Director play an important role in federal civil service matters. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1103(a)(5) (1982). There are sound reasons for Congress to establish in sections 7701 and 7703 different standards for the Director's participation. Under section 7701, the Director's participation before the board is in addition to the respondent agency's participation. Under <span id="Page_1808"></span>section 7703(d), the Director has sole authority to seek judicial review of a board decision that is unfavorable to an agency. The Director acts under section 7703 to protect the interests of the respondent agency or to protect the interests of the civil service as a whole.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, in its opposition to OPM's petition for review, the MSPB contends that even if the Director has properly raised a question involving an erroneous interpretation of a civil service law, rule, or regulation, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the board's decisions as to three petitioners, Schuck, Washington and James, because theirs are "mixed cases" involving claims of discrimination. The board bases this argument on <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 715 F.2d 1485, 1491 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">in banc</span>), in which this court stated that "where jurisdiction lies in the district court under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2), the entire action falls within the jurisdiction of that court and this court has no jurisdiction, under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1), over such cases." The <span class="Italic">Williams</span> case, however, was expressly "limited to situations in which the <span class="Italic">employee</span> is challenging judicially the board's determinations of both the discrimination and the nondiscrimination issues (emphasis added). Here jurisdiction is sought pursuant to section 7703(d), not section 7703(b). Section 7703(d) allows the Director to petition for review of an decision of the board, so long as it involves a potentially erroneous interpretation of a civil service law, rule, or regulation and so long as that interpretation will have a "substantial impact." Section 7703(d) provides that this court is the sole forum in which the Director may seek review of board decisions. Whether, under the rationale of <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, OPM could be deprived of its right to judicial review under section 7703(d) in a case in which discrimination is involved is a question which we need not decide in this case because the board's determinations of handicap discrimination have not been appealed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1990 the Federal Circuit decided <span class="Italic">Newman v. Lynch</span>, 897 F.2d 1144 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Earlier, <span class="Italic">Lynch v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 39 MSPR 319, 323-24 (1988), decided that OPM was not entitled to seek reconsideration before the Board of the Rehabilitation Act mixed case decision in <span class="Italic">Lynch v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 37 MSPR 12, 15-16 (1988). The earlier decision, involving what the Board determined to be interpretation of an EEOC regulation, did not involve a civil service law; therefore, the Board decided, OPM lacked authority to petition for reconsideration. The circuit court reversed, concluding that MSPB has no authority to review the Director's exercise of discretion in seeking reconsideration of an MSPB decision, and that the MSPB must consider the Director's petition on the merits. <span class="Italic">Lynch</span> cast doubt on the various restrictions previously imposed by the Board on the right of OPM to obtain reconsideration of Board decisions adjudicated beyond the regional level. According to <span class="Italic">Lynch</span>, 897 F.2d at 1146-47:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the statutory scheme of the Civil Service Reform Act...Congress provided for judicial review of MSPB decisions by an aggrieved employee, but withheld such right of appeal by the affected agency. Only under special circumstances may a decision adverse to an agency be judicially reviewed, that is, when the Director of OPM, in his or her discretion, decides that an issue in a case is so important in the overall management of personnel matters that the case warrants review by this court and this court agrees to hear an appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Horner v. Schuck</span>, 843 F.2d 1368, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 1988), this court held that "[t]he Director's statutory authority to seek judicial review is circumscribed only by the terms of section 7703(d) and the court's discretion to evaluate the Director's request for judicial review." Clearly the statute contains no express provision granting the MSPB authority to review the discretionary determinations of the Director, which are a predicate to OPM seeking review. In contrast, such authority was given to this court by section 7703(d), which provides: "The granting of the petition for judicial review shall be at the discretion of the court of appeals." MSPB's authority would have to emanate from its express authority to <span class="Italic">deny</span> the Director's petition. We conclude that statutory provision does not extend to denial of an OPM petition on the ground that the Director improperly exercised his or her discretion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB argues that this court in <span class="Italic">Horner v. Burns</span>, 783 F.2d 196 (Fed. Cir. 1986), recognized that section 7703(d) "contemplates that the Board had discretion whether to grant reconsideration."...<span class="Italic">Burns</span> dealt with two issues (1) the right of OPM to raise issues which the agency had not raised in a cross-petition for review; and (2) the Board's ruling that the presiding official's (AJ's) decision was non-precedential. We disagree that <span class="Italic">Burns</span> controls our decision here. Unquestionably the Board has discretion to make its own rules of procedure which OPM must follow. Further, the <span class="Italic">Burns</span> court upheld the Board's determination that decisions not reviewed by the full Board are not binding precedent and it articulated sound reasons for ruling out petitions on those decisions.... We did not recognize the broad authority now asserted by the Board to pass judgment on the propriety of the Director's exercise of discretion in seeking reconsideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The provisions of section 7730(d) requiring a petition for reconsideration where OPM has not previously intervened provides this court with the benefits of the Board's review of the petition only if the Board considers the petition on the merits. The portion of section 7703(d) granting OPM the right to seek reconsideration by the Board would be emasculated if the Board may refuse reconsideration without addressing the merits of the substantive issues raised by OPM.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The circuit's 1990 decision in <span class="Italic">Newman v. Lynch, supra,</span> was to be followed by <span class="Italic">King v. Lynch</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/1994110521f3d10841918">21 F.3d 1084</a> (Fed. Cir. 1994), addressing the question not examined in the 1990 decision--whether OPM could obtain review in the Federal Circuit of an EEO issue decided by the Board, and the court decided that would not occur. [Refer below to the section, "<a href="0100-2023-12-239.html#sec5-238">Discrimination Law, Rule, or Regulation</a>," for discussion of the 1994 decision in <span class="Italic">King v. Lynch.</span>]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1991 the Board decided <span class="Italic">Hammond v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 174 (1991), <span class="Italic">following</span> <span class="Italic">Hammond v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 35 MSPR 644, 649 (1987). In the earlier decision, the Board ruled that the appellant did not voluntarily resign his position and that the agency's action could not be sustained. The Board declined to consider the agency's response to the appellant's PFR because the agency had not properly designated its representative. The Director of OPM filed a petition for reconsideration contending that the agency fully complied with MSPB procedures governing designation of representatives and that the Board erred as to the voluntariness of the resignation. The reconsideration decision, <span class="Italic">Hammond v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 37 MSPR 531, 537-38 (1988), denied the petition because OPM did not attempt to show how the Board's ruling on the procedural issue could meet the "substantial impact" test; the Board also determined that OPM did not show how the "substantial impact" test could be met as to the decision on the involuntary resignation--a decision closely tied to the case facts. OPM took its cause to the Federal Circuit, and that court remanded the case at the Board's request to permit the Board "to resolve an apparent conflict in its decisions concerning the Board's authority to apply the 'substantial impact' test to petitions for reconsideration by OPM." On remand, the Board affirmed its original decision, granting in part the OPM reconsideration decision and concluding in its 1991 <span class="Italic">Hammond</span> decision, nonprecedential Board decisions aside, the Board may not question OPM's authority to seek reconsideration of a Board decision, 50 MSPR at 178-80:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board first addressed the standard governing when it will reconsider a final decision at OPM's request in <span class="Italic">York v. USPS</span>, 18 MSPR 505 (1983).... The Board noted that the legislative history indicates judicial review may be denied if the court determines the issue raised by the Director will not have a substantial impact, but that there is no reference to such a determination by the Board in connection with a petition for reconsideration....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Under section 7701(d), the Director may intervene "as a matter of right" in any Board proceeding when "of the opinion" that an erroneous interpretation of the laws or regulations under OPM's jurisdiction would have a "substantial impact." Because the section 7703(d) reconsideration procedure is a functional substitute for OPM's right to participate in Board proceedings granted by section 7701(d), <span class="Italic">York</span> concluded that the Board was not intended to review the Director's "substantial impact" determination before granting reconsideration....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following <span class="Italic">York</span>, the Board has reconsidered at OPM's request and determined whether its decision misconstrued civil service law without addressing whether the alleged error identified by OPM's petition would have substantial impact.... The only exception stated in <span class="Italic">York</span> to its ruling that OPM is entitled to have the Board consider whether its decision misinterpreted civil service law as alleged was its recognition that OPM is not entitled to reconsideration of a nonprecedential decision....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In subsequent cases, however, the Board ruled that section 7703(d) does not entitle OPM to seek reconsideration of the Board's factual findings or require the Board to reweigh the evidence at OPM's request.... Later decisions also adopted a narrow view of the civil service laws which are within the scope of OPM's authority to request reconsideration. For example, in <span class="Italic">Lynch v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 39 MSPR 319 (1988), the Board determined that OPM was not entitled to reconsideration on the basis that the law at issue in the Board's decision, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, was a discrimination law and not a civil service law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit, however, vacated and remanded the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Lynch</span>, holding that the Board had improperly restricted OPM's discretion to seek reconsideration. <span class="Italic">Newman v. Lynch</span>, 897 F.2d 1144 (1990). Noting its previous decisions which had rejected restrictive interpretations of OPM's authority to seek reconsideration under section 7703(d), the court concluded that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the Board may not refuse to consider the Director's petition on the merits because it disagrees with the Director's discretionary determinations which the Director is required to make before filing the petition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Therefore, in accordance with the court's decision, we hold that, with the exception of petitions for reconsideration of nonprecedential decisions, the Board may not question the authority of the Director of OPM to seek reconsideration of a Board decision, but must consider the Director's petition on the merits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1809"></span>The Board's decision on an OPM reconsideration request need not be elaborate. The Board may summarily deny the OPM request, leaving OPM to decide whether to pursue the issues raised before the Board to the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit found no objection to the Board's refusal to issue an elaborate opinion, <span class="Italic">King v. Briggs</span>, 83 F.3d 1384, 1389 (Fed. Cir. 1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The OPM also contends, on a point of procedure, that the Board "should not be permitted to unilaterally insulate a previously issued precedential decision from judicial review by ultimately disposing of the case via a non-precedential final order which summarily denies the appealing agency's petition for review without addressing the merits of any issue properly raised by the OPM in its intervention brief." As our decision in this very case illustrates, the Board's use of an unpublished opinion in a case in which the OPM has intervened simply does not "unilaterally insulate a previously issued precedential decision from judicial review."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The OPM also argues that its right to intervene in Board proceedings under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(d)(1) "will be rendered meaningless" if the Board "may summarily deny the agency's petition for review without addressing the merits of the substantive issues raised by the OPM" in a published decision. We should, according to the OPM, prevent this result by requiring the Board to issue published decisions with point-by-point analysis of the OPM's contentions in appeals in which the latter properly intervenes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the requirement to issue a published decision might represent better public policy, the Board contends that we lack the power to impose such a requirement. We agree. It is true that we have construed 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(d), a companion provision to section 7701(d), to preclude the Board from dismissing a petition for reconsideration filed by the OPM without considering it on the merits. <span class="Italic">Newman v. Lynch</span>, 897 F.2d 1144, 1146-47 (Fed. Cir. 1990). In the instant case, we know that the Board considered and rejected the OPM's position on the merits, and thus complied with <span class="Italic">Lynch</span>, because the Board said as much in its December 1994 order. There is, however, nothing in either the statutes creating and governing the Board and the OPM or the statutes giving this court the power to review the Board's decisions that gives us the power to require that the Board publish its decision in a given case or class of cases. In addition, the closing sentence of section 7701(d)(1), on which the OPM would ground this publication requirement, commands that "[n]othing in this title shall be construed to permit the [OPM] to interfere with the independent decision-making of the [Board]." This command surely extends to the Board's electing to issue an unpublished, rather than a published, decision in a case in which the OPM has intervened. As we had occasion to note in <span class="Italic">Newman v. Corrado</span>, "[a]ny policy arguments OPM musters for its suggested [publication] requirement are irrelevant. This court cannot impose requirements not grounded in the statute solely because they may represent sound public policy." 897 F.2d 1579, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board raised the issue whether provisions of the Whistleblower Protection Act constitute a civil service law, rule or regulation under the jurisdiction and affecting personnel management for purposes of OPM's intervention, reconsideration, or judicial review right. The Federal Circuit reviewed the case. <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 71 MSPR 607, 617 n.5 (1996), <span class="Italic">on reconsideration</span>, 78 MSPR 38 (1998), <span class="Italic">rev'd and remanded on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">LaChance v. White</span>, 174 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM could not seek reconsideration of a Board summary opinion affirming an initial decision; the initial decision had no precedential value and therefore could have no substantial impact on civil service laws. <span class="Italic">McCabe v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 21 MSPR 85, 86-87 (1984). The Federal Circuit affirmed that initial decisions are nonprecedential, beyond the review contemplated for OPM reconsideration requests, <span class="Italic">Horner v. Burns</span>, 783 F.2d 196, 201-02 (Fed. Cir. 1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's treatment of unreviewed initial decisions of administrative judges as non-precedential is based upon sound policy considerations and is a reasonable and appropriate practice for the Board to utilize in handling its heavy volume of cases. The Board operates under a system of discretionary appellate review by which it reviews only the relatively small percentage of initial decisions that present important issues or other sound reasons indicating that the initial decision should not remain unreviewed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schaffer v. MSPB</span>, 751 F.2d 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1985). If all initial decisions of [administrative judges] were binding Board precedents, the practical effect would be to require the Board to review a far greater number of those decisions than it now does. This would subject the Board to a substantial increase in its workload, which it might be unable to handle....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's practice of denying precedential effect to unreviewed decisions of its presiding officials, which are unreported, is comparable to the practice of this court in deciding cases that involve no important legal issues in an unpublished opinion that is not a citable precedent. A number of other circuits follow the same practice of issuing nonprecedential unpublished decisions....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At oral argument, the Director made the additional argument that however the Board may treat those initial decisions, the bar views them as significant precedents, since it sometimes cites them. That practice by the bar, however, does not establish that these decisions are or should be treated as binding precedents. It shows only that some lawyers improperly are ignoring the limited scope the Board gives to unreviewed initial decisions; that they decide the particular case but nothing more.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">DOJ expressed its view that it retains the authority to obtain Board review of a Board nonprecedential decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> September 13, 1999, DOJ Office of Legal Counsel Memorandum for the General Counsel, Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management Petitions for Reconsideration of Non-Precedential Merit Systems Protection Board Decisions</span>.<a href="https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/office-personnel-management-petitions-reconsideration-non-precedential-merit-systems">https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/office-personnel-management-petitions-reconsideration-non-precedential-merit-systems</a>.</p>
