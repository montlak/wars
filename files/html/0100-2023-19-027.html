<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-27"><span class="space">1.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Prima Facie</span></span> Case</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The burden of establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination is on the appellant. <span class="Italic">Polite v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 3 MSPR 410, 412, 3 MSPB 486 (1980). That burden, summarized in <span class="Italic">Thomas v. OPM</span>, 47 MSPR 369, 373 (1991), requires showing that (1) the appellant is a member of a protected class; (2) she was the object of an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal relationship between membership in the protected class and the adverse action that she suffered. The Board restated the analysis in <span class="Italic">Miller v. OPM</span>, 59 MSPR 539, 545 (1993) (retirement appeal), to include a burden to prove the following factors to show disparate treatment: that the appellant is a member of a protected group; that she was similarly situated to an individual who was not a member of the protected group; that she was treated more harshly or disparately than the individual who was not a member of her protected group; and that the difference in treatment was based on an intent to discriminate. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marbray v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 25 MSPR 224, 225 n.2 (1984) ("We conclude that the appellant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> because he produced evidence that he is a member of a minority group (black) and he was treated differently for the same offense when compared to the treatment given a white supervisor. <span class="Italic">See Metcalf v. Omaha Steel Castings Co.</span>, 507 F. Supp. 679, 25 FEP 16 (D.C. Neb. 1981).<span class="Italic"> Otis v. Inland Container Corp.,</span> 25 FEP 1280 (N.D. Ill. 1981)."). Applying the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</span> 411 U.S. 792 (1973), formulation to allegations of substandard performance, under <span class="Italic">Baqir v. Principi</span>, 434 F.3d 733, 742 (4th Cir. 2006), a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case may be established by the plaintiff's showing that (1) he is a member of a protected class, (2) he suffered an adverse employment action (such as discharge), (3) he was performing his job duties at a level that met the employer's legitimate expectations at the time of the adverse employment action, and (4) his position remained open or was filled by a similarly qualified applicant outside the protected class.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although "a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination varies depending on the circumstances, and an appellant's allegations should be broadly and liberally construed, particularly if the appellant is <span class="Italic">pro se</span>," <span class="Italic">Crawford v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 416, 424 (1996), the mere assertion of discrimination is insufficient to constitute a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Banez v. DOD</span>, 69 MSPR 642, 649 (1996); <span class="Italic">Mascarenas v. DOD</span>, 54 MSPR 303, 308 (1992) (restating the analytical approach); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 67 MSPR 500, 508 (1995) ("The administrative judge found that the appellant's mere assertion of race discrimination was insufficient to constitute a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination."). The appellant who raises a defense of mental disability discrimination must go beyond the bare allegation of discrimination in the appeal if he is to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. <span class="Italic">Graham v. Dept. of Army</span>, 41 MSPR 347, 348 (1989); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Romero v. EEOC</span>, 55 MSPR 527, 539 (1992) ("It is well-settled that an employee's mere assertion that he was treated differently from other employees, and that he believed it was due to discrimination, is insufficient to constitute a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of such discrimination."); <span class="Italic">Gamble v. VA</span>, 31 MSPR 649, 653 (1986) (a bare allegation was insufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that action against the appellant was the result of "prejudice, discrimination and a plot against the last old employees in the file room"); <span class="Italic">Montgomery v.

Thus, a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate treatment discrimination can be established by any proof of actions taken by the employer that shows a "discriminatory animus," where "in the absence of any other explanation it is more likely than not that those actions were bottomed on impermissible considerations." <span class="Italic">Schoenfeld</span>, 168 F.3d at 1268.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The order and allocation of proof on discrimination issues is well settled. First the employee has the burden of proving a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence.

Issues of discrimination may also be analyzed in these terms, but it is not necessary to follow this order of analysis in all cases.

See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c). Therefore, before the issue of discrimination is analyzed, the Board has already determined whether the agency has articulated a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In most appeals of adverse actions taken under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, the agency has already articulated a nondiscriminatory reason for its action, i.e., the charged misconduct.

Ct. 1775 (1989), defined the proper analysis of a mixed motive EEO case, that is, a case involving an action triggered by discriminatory and legitimate motivations. The case involved the failure of an accounting firm to promote or select an accountant for partnership in the firm. The plaintiff alleged sex discrimination. The Court declared, condemning sex stereotyping during the hiring process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In passing Title VII, Congress made the simple but momentous announcement that sex, race, religion, and national origin are not relevant to the selection, evaluation, or compensation of employees. Yet, the statute does not purport to limit the other qualities and characteristics that employers <span class="Italic">may</span> take into account in making employment decisions....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The critical inquiry...is whether gender was a factor in the employment decision <span class="Italic">at the moment it was made</span>....&#8197;Title VII [was] meant to condemn even those decisions based on a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate considerations....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...It is difficult for us to imagine that, in the simple words "because of," Congress meant to obligate a plaintiff to identify the precise causal role played by legitimate and illegitimate motivations in the employment decision she challenges. We conclude, instead, that Congress meant to obligate her to prove that the employer relied upon sex-based considerations in coming to its decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To say that an employer may not take gender into account is not, however, the end of the matter, for that describes only one aspect of Title VII. The other important aspect of the statute is its preservation of an employer's remaining freedom of choice. We conclude that the preservation of this freedom means that an employer shall not be liable if it can prove that, even if it had not taken gender into account, it would have come to the same decision regarding a particular person....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[O]nce a plaintiff in a Title VII case shows that gender played a motivating part in an employment decision, the defendant may avoid a finding of liability only by proving that it would have made the same decision even if it had not allowed gender to play such a role....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the employer's proof, in most cases, the employer should be able to present some objective evidence as to its probable decision in the absence of an impermissible motive....&#8197;An employer may not...prevail in a mixed-motive case by offering a legitimate and sufficient reason for its decision if that reason did not motivate it at the time of the decision. Finally, an employer may not meet its burden in such a case by merely showing that at the time of the decision it was motivated only in part by a legitimate reason. The very premise of a mixed-motives case is that a legitimate reason was present....&#8197;The employer instead must show that its legitimate reason, standing alone, would have induced it to make the same decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The courts below held that an employer who has allowed a discriminatory impulse to play a motivating part in an employment decision must prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have made the same decision in the absence of discrimination.

Ct. 1775. Different courts have taken various approaches to the question of how much evidence a plaintiff is required to submit before he is entitled to rely on <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span>. The Second Circuit has stated that a "plaintiff will be entitled to a burden-shifting instruction on the <span class="Italic">Price</span> <span class="Italic">Waterhouse</span> defense where the evidence is sufficient to allow the trier to find both forbidden and permissible motives." <span class="Italic">Rose v. New</span> <span class="Italic">York City Bd. of Educ.</span>, 257 F.3d 156, 161 (2d Cir. 2001) (quoting <span class="Italic">Ostrowski v. Atlantic</span> <span class="Italic">Mut. Ins. Cos.</span>, 968 F.2d 171, 181 (2d Cir. 1992)). Other courts have set out more stringent tests for direct evidence. In <span class="Italic">Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Florida Inc.</span>, 196 F.3d 1354, 1358-59 (11th Cir. 1999), the Eleventh Circuit stated that direct evidence must show a discriminatory or retaliatory attitude and "must indicate that the complained-of employment decision was motivated by the decision-maker's" discriminatory or retaliatory attitude toward the claimant. The court went on to note that "'only the most blatant remarks, whose intent could be nothing other than to discriminate'...will constitute direct evidence of discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1359 (quoting <span class="Italic">Earlay v. Champion Int'l Corp</span>, 907 F.2d 1077, 1081-82 (11th Cir. 1990)). The Eleventh Circuit has also defined direct evidence as a statement by the decisionmaker/employer that "reflects a discriminatory attitude" and "ties the discriminatory attitude to the relevant employment decision...." <span class="Italic">Wright v. Southland Corp.</span>, 187 F.3d 1287, 1294 (11th Cir. 1999). The Fifth Circuit has defined direct evidence as including "any statement or written document showing a discriminatory motive on its face." <span class="Italic">Portis v. First Nat'l Bank of New Albany</span>, 34 F.3d 325, 329 (5th Cir. 1994). Although this court has never squarely addressed the issue, we have noted that direct evidence is rarely available in retaliation cases and that it is usually necessary to rely on circumstantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See Webster v. Dept. of Army</span>, 911 F.2d 679, 689 (Fed. Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3347"></span>The evidence that Mr. Haddon sets forth as "direct evidence" of retaliation is not terribly direct at all, and does not qualify under any of the definitions of direct evidence....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...All the evidence pointed to by Mr. Haddon requires some inferences to get at a retaliatory motive for his discharge and does not qualify as direct evidence. Therefore it was not error to apply the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> approach rather than the Price <span class="Italic">Waterhouse</span> approach.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework, the plaintiff must first make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S. at 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817. In the context of a retaliation claim, this is done by showing that: (1) the plaintiff participated in a protected activity, (2) the defendant had knowledge of this participation, (3) the defendant took adverse action against the plaintiff, and (4) there was a "causal connection" between the plaintiffs protected activity and the defendant's adverse action against the plaintiff. <span class="Italic">Hollins v. Atlantic Co.</span>, 188 F.3d 652, 661 (6th Cir. 1999) (citing <span class="Italic">Christopher v. Stouder Mem'I Hosp.</span>, 936 F.2d 870, 877 (6th Cir. 1991)). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Webster</span>, 911 F.2d at 689. If the plaintiff is successful in showing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the burden then shifts to the defendant to show that there was a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the rejection. <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S. at 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817. Finally, the plaintiff is given the opportunity to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the stated reason is a mere pretext, and the real reason was prohibited discrimination. <span class="Italic">McKenna v. Weinberger</span>, 729 F.2d 783, 790 (D.C. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Buckler v. Fed. Retirement Thrift Inv. Bd.</span>, 73 MSPR 476, 496-98 (1997), determined that a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination does not require proof of intentional discrimination, although the appellant must ultimately prove that discrimination was the real reason for the challenged action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found, in reliance on Board precedent, that the appellant was required to show the following in order to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of age and sex discrimination: (1) He is a member of a protected group; (2) he was similarly situated to an individual who was not a member of his protected group; (3) he was treated more harshly or disparately than the individual who was not a member of his protected group; and (4) the difference in treatment was based on an intent to discriminate. <span class="Italic">See Richard v. Dept. of</span> <span class="Italic">Defense</span>, 66 MSPR 146, 152 (1995); <span class="Italic">Mascarenas v. Dept. of</span> <span class="Italic">Defense</span>, 54 MSPR 303, 308 (1992). This rule of law dates back at least to the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Fenn v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 35 MSPR 362, 366 (1987). <span class="Italic">Fenn</span> in turn relied on the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, a closer reading of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> reveals that the Court did not establish a rule of law requiring an employee to make a showing of discriminatory intent as part of his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S. at 801-03, 93 S. Ct. at 1824. Moreover, subsequent Supreme Court decisions confirm that an employee need not make a showing of intent to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers</span>, <span class="Italic">Corp.</span>, __ U.S. __, __, 116 S. Ct. 1307, 1309, 134 L. Ed.2d 433 (1996); <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502, 506-08, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 2747, 125 L. Ed.2d 407 (1993). We find, therefore, that an appellant may establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of prohibited discrimination by introducing preponderant evidence to show that he is a member of a protected group, he was similarly situated to an individual who was not a member of the protected group, and he was treated more harshly or disparately than the individual who was not a member of his protected group. A showing of discriminatory intent is not required to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. To the extent that <span class="Italic">Fenn</span> and its progeny are inconsistent with this holding, those decisions are hereby clarified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has made it clear that it remains the appellant's ultimate burden of proof to show that the agency's reason for taking an alleged discriminatory employment action is pretextual. In this regard, the appellant must show both that the agency's purported reason for the action was false or not the real reason for the action, and that discrimination was the real reason for the action. <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center</span>, 509 U.S. at 515-17, 113 S. Ct. at 2752; <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Boatman v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 66 MSPR 58, 63-64 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to introduce evidence showing that the agency's action was based on discrimination and that all evidence of record showed that the agency's reasons for taking action were non-discriminatory in nature, although its determination concerning the appellant's assignment rights ultimately proved to be incorrect. The appellant does not challenge the administrative judge's findings of fact in this regard. Moreover, he does not identify evidence of discrimination that the administrative judge failed to consider, and we discern none in the record. Therefore, the administrative judge's error in requiring the appellant to prove intent as part of his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights because the appellant failed to carry his ultimate burden of proof of discrimination....</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The appellant's failure to introduce any evidence in support of an allegation of discrimination results in a finding that he did not meet his burden of proof. <span class="Italic">Monahan v.

<p class="Body-Text">In some appeals the Board condenses the allocation of proof, determining that its AJs need not follow the established order of analysis in EEO cases: if an agency meets its burden on the merits by establishing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its personnel action, consideration of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is unnecessary; instead, the allegation of discrimination may be resolved by determining whether the appellant has shown the agency's reason to be pretextual. <span class="Italic">Vincent v.

<p class="Body-Text">Reduction in force appeals may present issues of discrimination that are not completely analogous to those raised in adverse action cases. In a RIF appeal asserting the appellant was discriminated against racially because, unlike others, qualification requirements were not waived for a job she sought through assignment, the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), analysis was adopted, requiring the following elements: the individual belongs to a minority group; she applied for and was qualified for a job the employer sought to fill through applications; she was rejected; and after the rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applications with the appellant's qualifications. Here the evidence demonstrated that although the agency waived qualification requirements for higher-level positions requiring experienced personnel, it did not waive the requirements as to personnel filling GS-7 positions. There was no showing that the agency sought to fill the position the appellant sought through assignment with applicants with qualifications similar to hers. A <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case was not established. <span class="Italic">Taylor v. DHUD</span>, 6 MSPR 177, 180, 6 MSPB 157 (1981).
