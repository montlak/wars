<p class="noindent">As to supplemental submissions, 5 CFR 2429.26 (2022) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2429.26 <span class="Italic">Other documents</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;The Authority or the General Counsel, or their designated representatives, as appropriate, may in their discretion grant leave to file other documents as they deem appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;A copy of such other documents shall be served on the other parties.</p>
<p class="noindent">A supplement to an opposition will not be considered a supplemental submission if it is filed within the time allowed for the opposition, <span class="Italic">IFPTE Local 77 and Dept. of Navy, Fleet Readiness Ctr. SW</span>, 65 FLRA 185, 187 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1838"></span>On March 16, 2010, the Agency filed a supplemental submission including a declaration of Agency counsel in support of its opposition. As this submission was filed within the time limit for filing the opposition, we consider this submission as part of the opposition. <span class="Italic">See Fed. Emps. Metal Trade Council</span>, 39 FLRA 3, 3 n.* (1991) (Authority considered addendum to opposition where it was filed within the time limit for filing the opposition).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1667 and VAMC Brooklyn</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v70/70-27.html">70 FLRA 155</a>, 156 (2016) (supplemental submission may be considered if filed within time allowed for filing the underlying exception; later submission will likely be rejected); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 446 and VAMC Asheville</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-7.html">72 FLRA 54</a> (2021) (Chairman Kiko concurring) (timely filed exception containing no rationale for the exception could not be supplemented to provide the rationale after the date passed for timely filing of the exception; union's explanation of a clerical error was insufficient to justify equitable tolling); <span class="Italic">cf. AFGE Local 2516 and Army Dental Activity, Ft. Bliss</span>, <span class="blue">72 FLRA 567</span>, 568 (2021) ("The Union maintains that it failed to attach the post-hearing brief to its exceptions because of 'a technical error.' However, the Union does not allege that the technical error was due to the Authority's eFiling system. Nor does it explain why it waited twenty days before attempting to correct the alleged error. Because the Union could have included its brief with its exceptions and the failure to timely file the attachment was caused by the Union's own 'clerical error' and 'technical difficulties,' we find that the Union has not established extraordinary circumstances warranting consideration of its supplemental submission.").</p>
<p class="noindent">A supplemental submission should be filed only after a party is given leave by FLRA to make the filing, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP, Border Patrol and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council, Local 2554</span>, 65 FLRA 752, 753-54 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2429.26 of the Authority's Regulations (the Regulations) requires a party filing a supplemental submission to request permission to do so. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.26; <span class="Italic">see also AFGE, Local 1061</span>, 63 FLRA 317, 317 n.1 (2009). In addition, a filing party must demonstrate why its supplemental submission should be considered. <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 98</span>, 60 FLRA 448, 448 n.2 (2004) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting as to other matters) (<span class="Italic">Chapter 98</span>). The Authority has granted permission to file motions to strike where a moving party alleges that evidence or arguments presented for the Authority's consideration were not presented in the proceedings before the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Nat'l Park Serv., Women's Rights Nat'l Historic Park, Ne. Region, Seneca Falls, N.Y.</span>, 62 FLRA 378, 379 (2008) (<span class="Italic">Interior</span>). The Agency's motion to strike alleges that certain parts of the Union's opposition to the exceptions were not presented before the Arbitrator. Thus, consistent with <span class="Italic">Interior</span>, we grant the Agency's motion for leave to file its motion to strike. <span class="Italic">See Chapter 98</span>, 60 FLRA at 448 n.2.

To the extent the Authority has granted leave to file additional submissions under &#x00A7; 2429.26, we note that the Authority <span id="page_1839"></span>has done so only in circumstances where issues were first raised after a party had submitted its brief to an arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Cong.

The Agency requests that the Authority review its supplemental submission because the Union raises a "new" argument in its opposition. The Agency claims that, for the first time in its opposition, the Union argues that the award cannot affect management's right to discipline because "the Arbitrator did not bar the Agency from imposing discipline...." Also, the Agency requests that the Authority review its supplemental submission because the Union makes two contradictory arguments in its opposition.

<p class="noindent">FLRA allowed a supplemental submission addressing the applicability of a Supreme Court case issued after the agency filed and the union responded to exceptions. <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons MCC Chicago and AFGE Local 3652</span>, 63 FLRA 423 n.1 (2009). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Indian Educators Fed. and Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs</span>, 53 FLRA 696, 703 (1997) ("Further, the Court's decision is readily discoverable through research and could be relied on by the Authority even if neither party cited to it."). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 22 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Base, Norfolk</span>, 48 FLRA 708, 708 n.1 (1993) (FLRA declined to consider supplemental submission citing recent FLRA decision, but FLRA noted that it was aware of decision). A supplemental submission was allowed and official notice was taken of a change in an OPM regulation issued after the arbitrator's award. <span class="Italic">SPORT and Dept. of Air Force, Edwards AFB</span>, 70 FLRA 274, 275 (2017) (recon. den., 70 FLRA 345 (2017)).</p>
<p class="noindent">A supplemental submission was permitted when the arbitrator issued a supplemental award clarifying the award that was the subject of exceptions, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 66 FLRA 712, 714 (2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency requested permission to file, and did file, a supplemental submission containing the Arbitrator's supplemental award that was issued after the Agency filed its exceptions. In his supplemental award, the Arbitrator clarified that, as a remedy, he awarded the grievant forty-eight hours of annual leave, with a corresponding charge of forty-eight hours of advance sick leave. The Union does not oppose the filing of the supplemental submission or the consideration of the Arbitrator's supplemental award contained therein. Although the Authority's Regulations do not provide for the filing of supplemental submissions, the Authority, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.26, may grant leave to file documents as the Authority deems appropriate. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Def., Def. Logistics Agency, Def. Supply Ctr., Columbus, Ohio</span>,60 FLRA 974, 975 (2005) (<span class="Italic">DLA</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Housing &#x0026; Urban Dev., Denver, Colo.</span>,53 FLRA 1301, 1309 n.6 (1998). Because the Arbitrator's supplemental award clarifies the remedy he awarded and affects the Authority's resolution of some of the Agency's exceptions, we consider the Agency's supplemental submission. <span class="Italic">See DLA</span>,60 FLRA at 976 (considering the parties' supplemental submissions concerning an Office of Personnel Management decision because the decision rendered the petitions moot); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Council of EEOC Locals No. 216</span>, 47 FLRA 525, 525 n.*, 529 (1993) (permitting the agency, under &#x00A7; 2429.26, to file a letter from the arbitrator issued after it filed its exceptions as supplemental evidence in support of its contention that the award was not interlocutory).</p>
<p class="noindent">If a party seeks to file a supplemental submission, but FLRA declines to consider the material, the other party's responsive submission will not be considered and the last submission is moot. Additionally, if a party responds to an FLRA deficiency order, FLRA may decline to consider the other party's reply to that submission. <span class="Italic">IFPTE Local 77 and Dept. of Navy, Fleet Readiness Ctr. SW</span>, 65 FLRA 185, 187-88 (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent">In lieu of a supplemental submission on a matter pertaining to FLRA jurisdiction, official notice may be taken of a matter brought to the attention of FLRA. <span class="Italic">See VAMC Kansas City and AFGE Local 910</span>, 65 FLRA 809, 811 n.5 (2011) (official notice taken of determination by Undersecretary of Health of Department of Veterans Affairs that had effect of removing from FLRA jurisdiction certain issues involved in arbitrator's award affecting compensation of Title 38 physician).
