<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-315"><span class="space">i.</span> Union Animus; Prohibited Personnel Practices; Discrimination and Reprisal</h5>
<p class="noindent">Although arbitrators are not bound by the substantive and procedural law governing adverse actions when they consider minor disciplinary actions, they should still apply affirmative requirements of law preventing management from acting on the basis of invidious discrimination in violation of civil rights laws, reprisal for protected activities under the labor relations laws, and personnel practices prohibited by the Reform Act and the Whistleblower Protection Act. Guiding arbitrators in their deliberations is the body of law that FLRA has established concerning protected activities. [Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-16-155.html#sec8-155">Reprisal and Discipline Causation Analysis</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">The right of management to discipline is limited by the prohibited personnel practice provisions of the Reform Act, <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-66 and VAMC, Memphis</span>, 40 FLRA 504, 512-14 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because a personnel action, such as a suspension, that is taken in reprisal for a protected disclosure constitutes a prohibited personnel practice, such a personnel action is not in accordance with law and cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Customs Service, Dallas, Texas and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 140</span>, 37 FLRA 1022 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>) (arbitrator revoked the grievants' change in work status because the change was in reprisal for disclosures protected under section 2302(b)(8); the Authority denied the agency's exception, which contended that the award was contrary to section 2302(b)(8)); <span class="Italic">Sowers v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 24 MSPR 492 (1984) (<span class="Italic">Sowers</span>) (employee's removal was reversed because the agency action was primarily caused by its desire to retaliate against the employee for his whistleblowing activities). Before the Merit Systems Protection Board in cases involving serious adverse actions covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, the agency must prove that: (1) the employee committed the act of misconduct for which the employee was disciplined (2) the discipline is for "such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a); and (3) the assessed penalty is appropriate....&#8197;Prior to the Whistleblowers Protection Act, if the agency established the merits of its case against the employee, the employee could raise the affirmative defense that the adverse action was not in accordance with law because the action was in reprisal for protected disclosures under section 2302(b)(8) and could not be sustained....&#8197;In <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, we recognized that, in order to find that a disclosure of information is protected against impermissible actions under section 2302(b)(8), it must be established that the employee is protected by the statute and that: (1) a protected disclosure was made; (2) the official accused of taking the retaliatory action knew of the disclosure; (3) the challenged action against the employee could have been retaliation; and (4) a nexus is established between the adverse action and the motive....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As indicated by <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, when exceptions to an arbitration award raise the question of whether an agency has committed a prohibited personnel practice by taking a personnel action in reprisal for, or because of, a protected disclosure under section 2302(b)(8), we will review the record in the case to determine whether the award is consistent with law. In this case, the issue of whether the grievant was suspended in reprisal for protected disclosures under section 2302(b)(8) was raised as an affirmative defense to the suspension by the grievant before the Arbitrator, but was not addressed or resolved by the Arbitrator in his award sustaining the suspension and denying the grievance. The award contains no findings, conclusions, or discussion on whether the suspension was not in accordance with law or whether it was an impermissible reprisal under section 2302(b)(8). The Union contends that the suspension cannot be sustained because it constituted an impermissible reprisal under section 2302(b)(8). The Agency in its opposition does not address this specific issue. The Agency argues only that whistleblower claims have no relevance in arbitration proceedings, a claim that we reject as totally without support.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record presented, we cannot determine whether the award is deficient because the Arbitrator sustained discipline that was in reprisal for disclosures protected under section 2302(b)(8)....&#8197;Accordingly, we will vacate the denial of the grievance and remand the case to the parties for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent">If a personnel action, e.g., a geographical reassignment, is alleged to be in <span id="page_2292"></span>reprisal for whistleblowing or for a prior EEO complaint, a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case may be made out by showing that the employer knew of the employee's protected activity and that the adverse personnel action occurred shortly after that activity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 704 and EPA Region 5</span>, 57 FLRA 468, 474 (2001) (EEO reprisal elements include employer's knowledge of employee's protected activity and adverse personnel action that occurred shortly after that activity); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 168 and Customs Serv., New Orleans Dist.</span>, 52 FLRA 1354, 1360-66 (1997) (sufficient for arbitrator to discuss evidence and draw conclusions about EEO and whistleblowing reprisal allegation without discussing applicable legal standards).</p>

The grievant was reassigned after he protested and grieved what he felt constituted improper management interference in his law enforcement activities as a district ranger. The arbitrator concluded that the agency committed no prohibited personnel practice. On review FLRA provided a synopsis of the anti-reprisal sections of the whistleblower statute, 53 FLRA at 1142-45:</p>

<p class="noindent-2">There are three steps in a complete analysis of an employee's whistleblower defense to an adverse personnel action: First, is the employee's disclosure a protected "whistleblowing" activity under [the WPA]? Second, was the disclosure a contributing factor in the personnel action? Third, can the agency prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the disclosure?</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1470 (citations omitted). In applying the steps set forth in the framework, we look to the MSPB's application of the WPA. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 168 and U.S. Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service, New Orleans District</span>, 52 FLRA 1354, 1365-66 (1997) (<span class="Italic">Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service, New Orleans</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If an employee demonstrates that the disclosure was a contributing factor to the challenged personnel action, corrective action will be ordered by the MSPB unless the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the disclosure. <span class="Italic">Watson v. Department of Justice</span>, 64 F.3d 1524, 1527 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (<span class="Italic">Watson</span>); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1) and (2). In determining whether an agency showed, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the whistleblowing, the MSPB considers the following factors: the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its personnel action; the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and any evidence that the agency takes similar action against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">Geyer v. Department of Justice</span>, 70 MSPR 682, 688 (1996) <span class="Italic">(Geyer); Braga v. Department of the Army</span>, 54 MSPR 392, 399 (1992), <span class="Italic">affirmed</span>, 6 F.3d 787 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table). In summary, the WPA requires only that an agency demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that it would take the same personnel action in the absence of the protected disclosure; it does not require that the adverse personnel action be based on facts completely separate and distinct from protected whistleblowing disclosures. <span class="Italic">Watson</span>, 64 F.3d at 1528.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator addressed the third step of the framework set forth above: whether the agency has established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the alleged whistleblowing activity. Because the WPA does not mandate any particular sequence of analysis for the 3-step framework, it was not necessary for the Arbitrator to first address steps 1 and 2. <span class="Italic">See Clark</span>, 997 F.2d at 1470; <span class="Italic">Geyer</span>, 70 MSPR at 688.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Arbitrator did not articulate the third step of this framework precisely as it is stated in <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, his findings, when read in context, show that the Arbitrator properly determined there was clear and convincing evidence that the Agency would have reassigned the grievant in the absence of the protected disclosures.<span class="Italic"> See Customs Service</span>, <span class="Italic">New Orleans</span>, 52 FLRA at 1364 (in determining whether an arbitrator applied the correct legal standard, the Authority read the arbitrator's use of certain terms in context).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator concluded that "by not accepting the grievant's resignation," the District Manager "demonstrated she held no animosity toward the grievant and <span class="Italic">did not direct</span> <span class="Italic">his reassignment because of his allegations of interference in</span> <span class="Italic">law enforcement or [his]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic"> grievance filing relative to</span> <span class="Italic">reorganization."</span> This conclusion was based on the Arbitrator's factual findings that: (1) the grievant became upset and resigned over what he perceived was management's interference in law enforcement issues; (2) the District Manager did not immediately accept his resignation but placed him on administrative leave; (3) the District Manager gathered information on the grievant's resignation; (4) the District Manager made a prudent administrative judgment; and (5) the District Manager determined that the grievant's "precipitous resignation was stark evidence of his unsuitability for continued assignment as a ranger<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. We agree that these findings, which have not been excepted to, establish that there is clear and convincing evidence that the Agency would have reassigned the grievant in the absence of the protected disclosures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">Marano</span> is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Marano</span>, the court stated that a whistleblower need not "demonstrate the existence of a retaliatory motive on the part of the employee taking the alleged prohibited personnel action <span class="Italic">in</span> <span class="Italic">order to establish that [a]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic"> disclosure was a contributing factor</span> to the personnel action. [.], <span class="Italic">Marano</span> at 1141 (emphasis added). In this case, the Arbitrator did not require the grievant to prove the existence of a retaliatory motive on the part of the District Manager in order to establish that the grievant's disclosure was a contributing factor to the personnel action. As discussed above, the Arbitrator considered evidence with respect to the Agency's motive to retaliate as a factor in his analysis of whether the Agency satisfied <span class="Italic">its</span> burden of proof. The Arbitrator did not impose any requirement on the grievant that was contrary to <span class="Italic">Marano</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Arbitrator's consideration of the grievant's post-reassignment performance provides no basis for finding the award contrary to the WPA. Considering this performance as additional evidence relevant to the Agency's motive to retaliate is permissible under the WPA. <span class="Italic">See Geyer</span>, 70 MSPR at 693 (in considering agency's retaliatory motive for employee's whistleblowing activities pertaining to a memorandum concerning scheduling practices, MSPB considered evidence that majority of employees signing the memorandum had been promoted since signing it).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the award is not deficient as contrary to the WPA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"To prevail on a contention of illegal reprisal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), a grievant has the burden of showing that the agency took action because of protected activity." <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 561 and U.S. Department of the Army, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile, Alabama</span>, 52 FLRA 207, 210 (1996) (<span class="Italic">Mobile</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">Keenan </span>v. <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service</span>, 62 MSPR 307, 309 n.2 (1994)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above...we concluded that the Arbitrator properly determined there was clear and convincing evidence that the Agency would have reassigned the grievant in the absence of the protected disclosures--which included his filing a grievance over a proposed reorganization. Based on this conclusion, the Union has not met its burden under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) of establishing that the Agency took action against the grievant because of protected activity. <span class="Italic">See Mobile</span>, 52 FLRA at 210. Accordingly, as the Union has failed to establish that the award is deficient in this respect, the exception provides no basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Cf. VA Pershing VAMC and AFGE Local 2338</span>, 72 FLRA 656 (2022) (Member Abbott concurring; Chairman DuBester dissenting in part) (sustaining an award mitigating a suspension but setting aside a finding of a WPA violation when whistleblowing reprisal was not part of the stipulated issue before the arbitrator and was not an issue that needed to be resolved to determine if just cause existed for the suspension).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We are not persuaded that the grievant was engaged in activities protected under the Statute when she availed herself of the opportunity provided by the Agency to complain to her supervisor about her individual concerns about her working conditions.&#x2003;There has been no contention made, or evidence presented, that the grievant was acting on behalf or with the authorization of the Union or any of her co-workers or that she was attempting to pursue any rights accorded her under the collective bargaining agreement. Even assuming that the grievant was engaged in activities protected under the Statute, an employee's involvement in union activities does not immunize the employee from discipline. <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2207</span>, 32 FLRA 777, 780-81 (1988). Management's right to take disciplinary action under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute includes the right to discipline a union representative or employee for activities which "are not specifically on behalf of the exclusive representative or which exceed the boundaries of protected activity such as flagrant misconduct." <span class="Italic">U.S. Air Force Logistics Command, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 916, AFL-CIO</span>, 34 FLRA 385, 388-89 (1990)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the circumstances of this case, the Arbitrator found that the grievant was not precluded from seeking a union steward to accompany her to the meeting with her supervisor. The Arbitrator further found that "[a]lthough an open door policy provides for a certain amount of confrontational <span id="page_2293"></span>conduct by an employee, such as argumentative language, this is not the same thing as discourteous, disrespectful behavior" in which the grievant had engaged. In view of the Arbitrator's findings, we conclude that the Union's argument constitutes mere disagreement with the Arbitrator's evaluation of the evidence and an attempt to relitigate the merits of the case before the Authority....</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA referenced cases defining "flagrant misconduct" as the basis for evaluation of statements of union representatives that lead to discipline, <span class="Italic">VAMC Richmond and AFGE Local 2145</span>, 63 FLRA 553, 553-56 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievant, the local Union president, attended the Agency's Laundry Operations (Laundry) monthly staff meeting as a Union representative. Approximately eighteen bargaining unit employees attended the meeting. At the meeting, the Laundry General Foreman (the foreman) invited the grievant to provide information concerning the Agency's Emergency Employee Disaster Relief Fund for victims of Hurricane Katrina. The grievant advised the employees to donate by check so that their donations would be tax deductible. An employee expressed concern that the grievant's suggestion would allow "a tax write-off on the backs of [his] folks." In response, the grievant stated that any tax deductions would come from the federal government, which had "left indigent African-Americans in New Orleans to die at the hands of Hurricane Katrina as contrasted with the government's reaction to Hurricane Ophelia in Nags Head populated by whites." The foreman informed the grievant that the relief effort was not a race issue and requested that she discontinue the discussion. After the grievant insisted on finishing her point, the foremen instructed her to be quiet and to sit down. When the grievant refused, the foreman adjourned the staff meeting early. The Agency subsequently suspended the grievant for fourteen days for disrespectful conduct and for disrupting the workplace to the point that a staff meeting had to be ended prematurely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Arbitrator, the parties agreed that the applicable standard for evaluating the grievant's rights was set forth in <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Grissom Air Force Base, Indiana,</span> 51 FLRA 7 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Grissom</span>). The Arbitrator stated that, under <span class="Italic">Grissom</span>, in determining whether an employee has engaged in flagrant misconduct, the Authority balances the grievant's right to engage in protected activity, which permits leeway for impulsive behavior, against the Agency's right to maintain an orderly workplace, by considering: (1) the place and subject matter of the discussion; (2) whether the employee's outburst was impulsive or designed; (3) whether the outburst was in any way provoked by the employer's conduct; and (4) the nature of the intemperate language and conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the grievant's comments were in direct response to an employee's objection that tax deductions would come off the "backs of [his] people," and were designed to demonstrate that the grievant "did not intend to encourage opportunistic behavior at t[h]e expense of African-American victims and to demonstrate her racial sensitivity." In so finding, the Arbitrator rejected the Agency's assertions that the grievant's comments were an attempt to engage in "race-baiting" or to "play[&#8197;] the race card." The Arbitrator also rejected the Agency's argument that the grievant created a "racially hostile environment^]" finding that the Agency's claim was "overstated."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically applying the <span class="Italic">Grissom</span> factors, the Arbitrator found that the grievant's comments were made at a staff meeting that she attended in her representational capacity. The Arbitrator further found that the grievant was invited to speak by the foreman, and that her comments were precipitated by the comments of an employee at the meeting. The Arbitrator also determined that the grievant's remarks "spontaneously evolved" from the employee's comment. In addition, the Arbitrator found that the grievant's language was not intemperate, and that her insistence on completing her comments was provoked by the foreman's behavior. Upon balancing these factors, the Arbitrator concluded that the grievant's comments did not constitute flagrant misconduct or otherwise "exceed the boundaries of protected activity."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this conclusion, the Arbitrator specifically rejected the Agency's assertion that the grievant "t[ook] charge of the meeting," because the grievant was invited to speak by the foreman, her statement was in direct response to an employee's concern, and a different supervisor might have allowed the grievant to finish her statement. The Arbitrator also rejected the Agency's argument that the grievant's conduct, even if not flagrant misconduct, demonstrated "an ongoing pattern of disruptive misconduct...that removes the shield of statutory protection."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency did not have just cause to suspend the grievant and rescinded the fourteen-day suspension.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7102 of the Statute guarantees employees the right to form, join, or assist any labor organization, or to refrain from such activity, without fear of penalty or reprisal. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102; <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Border Patrol Council,</span> 44 FLRA 1395, 1402 (1992). Consistent with &#x00A7; 7102, however, an agency has the right to discipline an employee who is engaged in otherwise protected activity for remarks or actions that: (1) constitute flagrant misconduct, or (2) otherwise exceed the bounds of protected activity. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Air Force, Aerospace Maint. &#x0026; Regeneration Ctr., Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Ariz.,</span> 58 FLRA 636, 636 (2003) (<span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan</span>). The Authority has clarified that "flagrant misconduct" is "illustrative of," but not the only type of, action that could justify removal from the protection of &#x00A7; 7102 of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force, 315th Airlift Wing v.

<p class="noindent-1">As stated by the Arbitrator, in <span class="Italic">Grissom,</span> the Authority outlined four factors to be considered in determining whether an employee has engaged in flagrant misconduct: (1) the place and subject matter of the discussion; (2) whether the employee's outburst was impulsive or designed; (3) whether the outburst was in any way provoked by the employer's conduct; and (4) the nature of the intemperate language and conduct. <span class="Italic">Grissom,</span> 51 FLRA at 12 (citing <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping,</span> 17 FLRA at 80-81). These factors need not be cited or applied in any particular way in determining whether conduct exceeds the bounds of the Statute's protection. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the Arbitrator erred when he applied the legal standard from <span class="Italic">Grissom</span> rather than from <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping.[</span>5] Contrary to the Agency's argument <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping </span>and <span class="Italic">Grissom</span> do not suggest two different standards.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Member Beck notes that the Statute contains no indication that Congress intended to protect employee misconduct of any kind In this regard, &#x00A7; 7102 of the Statute, as relevant, states that each "employee shall have the right to form, join, or assist any labor organization...freely[,] and without fear of penalty or reprisal, and each employee shall be protected in the exercise of such right" Although Congress intended to "protect[&#8197;]" employees when they "form, join, or assist any labor organization," 5 U S C &#x00A7; 7102, this language contains no indication that Congress intended to enact a law that "prohibits employers from seeking to maintain civility in the workplace" <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>, 294 F 3d at 201 (citation omitted) In accordance with this view, court and Authority precedent establishes that the concept of "uninhibited and robust debate" in labor/management relations does not "sanction every kind of insult or disparagement." <span class="Italic">Veterans Admin, Wash, DC,</span> 26 FLRA 114, 116 n 4 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 2031 v.

<p class="noindent-2">Careful scrutiny of the Arbitrator's findings reveals that what he effectively found is that, regardless of whether the grievant was acting in a representational capacity, she simply did not engage in behavior that could properly be characterized as misconduct</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that the Arbitrator did not consider the "law regarding union representatives disrupting a formal discussion[.]" Specifically, the Agency incorrectly argues that Authority precedent establishes that a Union representative may not "take charge of the proceedings or disrupt [a] meeting" Even assuming that these cases establish such a rule, the Arbitrator concluded that the grievant did not take charge of or otherwise disrupt the meeting....&#8197;Therefore, we find that the Agency has not demonstrated that the award is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent">A contract provision prohibiting reprisal for union activities constitutes an appropriate arrangement that an arbitrator may enforce to require management to stop interfering with employees' rights. In <span class="Italic">VAMC Coatesville and NAGE Local R3-35</span>, 56 FLRA 966, 970-71 (2000), an arbitrator properly directed management to rescind restrictions on the grievant's work assignments and building access. The arbitrator concluded that the restrictions were imposed on the employee because of the grievant's support of the union president. If a contract provision governing discipline is the basis for an award, FLRA will not set the award aside because it did not apply ULP law governing arguably protected activity, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3701 and DHUD Cleveland Area Office</span>, 66 FLRA 291, 293 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that the award is contrary to law because the Arbitrator failed to find that the grievant engaged in "flagrant misconduct or overstepp[ed] the bounds of protected activity." This claim is raised in cases where an agency is alleged to have violated &#x00A7; 7116 of the Statute by taking actions against an individual based on that individual's actions during the course of protected activity. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA</span>, 64 FLRA 365, 369 (2009) (Member Beck concurring). Specifically, where an agency is alleged to have committed an unfair labor practice (ULP) on this basis, "a necessary part of the [agency's] defense" against the ULP allegation is that the individual's actions "constituted flagrant misconduct or otherwise exceeded the bounds of protected activity." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(emphasis omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that arbitrators are required to apply statutory burdens of proof when resolving an alleged ULP.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. GSA, Ne. &#x0026; Caribbean Region, N.Y.C., N.Y.</span>, 60 FLRA 864, 866 (2005).

In addition, when an arbitrator is not required to apply a statutory standard, alleged misapplications of that standard do not provide a basis for finding the arbitrator's award deficient. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., SSA</span>, 65 FLRA 286, 288 (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record shows that the issue before the Arbitrator was whether the Agency had "just and sufficient cause" to suspend the grievant--not whether the suspension violated &#x00A7; 7116 of the Statute. Further, the record shows that the Union understood the issue before the Arbitrator was whether the Agency had "just and sufficient cause" to discipline the grievant. Thus, the issue before the Arbitrator was purely contractual. As such, the Arbitrator was not required to determine whether the grievant's conduct was flagrant or otherwise exceeded the bounds of protected activity. As a result, the Arbitrator's alleged failure to find such does not provide a basis for setting aside the award.[3] <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 2923</span>, 65 FLRA 561, 563 (2011); <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 65 FLRA at 288.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;Even if the award concerned a statutory claim, the Union's assertion that the grievant did not engage in flagrant misconduct or otherwise exceed the bounds of protected activity as a union official would not provide a basis for setting aside the award. Here, the Arbitrator found that the grievant's "total conduct" on the day of the move included "more than speech or aggressive conversation." <span class="Italic">See also id. </span>(noting that grievant's "words were far beyond 'locker room talk'"). The Arbitrator further noted that the grievant's conduct involved a "threat component" and "went on for a long enough time to bring about damaging results." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Such conduct exceeds the bounds of protected activity. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 987, </span>63 FLRA at 364 (finding that, even if employee was engaged in protected activity, employee's conduct exceeded the bounds of protected activity where nature of employee's conduct was intimidating and threatening, and caused at least one co-worker to apprehend that certain employee was at risk of being "beat up").</p>
<p class="noindent">The significance of a contract standard, rather than a ULP standard, applied by an arbitrator was emphasized when FLRA would not impose statutory ULP standards of analysis on a contractual "just cause" resolution of a disciplinary challenge, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 54 and Dept. of Army, Ft.

The decision explained the review standards that would be employed, depending on the arbitrator's rationale for modifying the discipline:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's role in reviewing arbitration awards depends on the nature of the exception raised by the appealing party. <span class="Italic">See United States Customs Service v. FLRA</span>, 43 F.3d 682, 686 (D.C. Cir. 1994). In <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 24</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995), the Authority stated that if the arbitrator's decision is challenged, as it is here, on the ground that it is contrary to any law, rule, or regulation, the Authority will review the legal question <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. In applying a standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1437</span>, 53 FLRA 1703, 1710 (1998). In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See id; see also, United States Dep't of Commerce, Patent &#x0026; Trademark Office</span>, 52 FLRA 358, 367 (1996); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, Lowry Air Force Base, Denver, Colo.</span>, 48 FLRA 589, 593 (1993) (discussing Supreme Court's articulation of deferential standard of review of arbitration awards in <span class="Italic">United Paperworkers v. Misco, Inc.</span>, 484 U.S. 29 (1987)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator did not clearly state the rationale for his decision. More specifically, it is not apparent from the award whether the Arbitrator was resolving the parties' dispute under the Statute or under the parties' collective bargaining agreement. As such, we are unable to determine which standard of review to apply in resolving the exception to the award, and we will remand the award to the parties for further action as specified below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the Arbitrator resolved the parties' dispute under the Statute, the Authority would review the matter <span class="Italic">de novo. NTEU, Chapter 24</span>, 50 FLRA at 332. In applying a standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. In making such a determination, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See NFFE, Local 1437, </span>53 FLRA at 1710.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review were appropriate in this case, the standards governing protected activity and flagrant misconduct would apply. In this regard, the Authority has recently held that where there is a challenge to an agency's discipline of an employee for conduct occurring during protected activity, "a necessary part of the [agency's] defense is that the conduct constituted flagrant misconduct or <span class="Italic">otherwise exceeded the boundaries of protected activity</span>." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, Aerospace Maint. &#x0026; Regeneration Ctr., Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Ariz.</span>, 58 FLRA 636 (2003) (emphasis in the original) (adopting<span class="Italic"> 315th Airlift Wing</span>, 294 F.3d 192). If conduct that exceeds the boundaries of protected activity is established, the conduct loses its protection under the Statute and can be the basis for discipline. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether an employee has engaged in flagrant misconduct, the Authority balances the employee's right to engage in protected activity, which "permits leeway for impulsive behavior,...against the employer's right to maintain order and respect for its supervisory staff on the jobsite." <span class="Italic">Dep't of Def., Def. Mapping Agency Aerospace Ctr., St. Louis, Mo., </span>17 FLRA 71, 80 (1985) (citation omitted). Relevant factors to be considered in striking this balance include: (1) the place and subject matter of the discussion; (2) whether the employee's outburst was impulsive or designed; (3) whether the outburst was in any way provoked by the employer's conduct; and (4) the nature of the intemperate language and conduct. <span class="Italic">See Grissom AFB, </span>51 FLRA at 12.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If, on the other hand, the Arbitrator resolved the dispute in this case based on his interpretation of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review would not be appropriate. Rather, the analysis would involve a determination of whether the Agency's action was consistent with the discipline provision of the parties' agreement. In this instance, the Authority applies the deferential "essence" standard of review that the federal courts apply in reviewing awards in the private sector. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Labor (OSHA)</span>, 34 FLRA 573, 575 (1990) (<span class="Italic">DOL</span>). In order for an award to be found deficient as failing to draw its essence from the agreement, it must be established that the award: (1) cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; (2) is so unfounded in reason and fact and so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the agreement as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of an arbitrator; (3) does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement; or (4) evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement. <span class="Italic">DOL</span>, 34 FLRA at 575. The Authority defers to arbitrators in this context "because it is the arbitrator's construction of the agreement for which the parties have bargained." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 576.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, in this case it is not clear from the award whether the Arbitrator was resolving the parties' dispute under the Statute or under the parties' agreement. As such, it is not clear which analytical framework <span id="page_2295"></span>to apply in resolving the exception. While the Arbitrator set forth much of the testimony that he heard, he did not make factual findings sufficient to either explain the basis for his actions, or to allow us to determine which standard of review to apply. In these circumstances, in the absence of a determination by the Arbitrator as to whether he was resolving a statutory or a contractual issue, and in the absence of sufficient factual findings, we are unable to resolve the exception before the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, we remand the award to the parties, absent settlement, for resubmission to the Arbitrator so that he can clarify the basis of his award. In clarifying the basis for his award, the Arbitrator should specify whether his award was resolving a dispute under the Statute or under the parties' agreement, and should apply the relevant principles discussed above. Moreover, the Arbitrator should set forth sufficient factual findings to support the award.</p>
<p class="noindent">Resolving a grievance involving an allegation of reprisal for union activities, the arbitrator does not err by failing to apply a "flagrant misconduct" standard if the union waives a statutory claim and proceeds under a "just cause" clause of the contract, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2923 and DHHS, Nat'l Inst. Of Env. Health Sciences</span>, 65 FLRA 561, 563 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The flagrant misconduct standard applies in cases where an agency is alleged to have violated &#x00A7; 7116 of the Statute by taking actions against an individual based on that individual's actions during the course of protected activity. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA</span>, 64 FLRA 365, 369 (2009) (Member Beck concurring). Specifically, where an agency is alleged to have committed an unfair labor practice (ULP) on this basis, "a necessary part of the [agency's] defense" against the ULP allegation is that the individual's actions constituted flagrant misconduct or otherwise exceeded the bounds of protected activity. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that arbitrators are required to apply statutory burdens of proof when resolving an alleged ULP.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. GSA, Ne. &#x0026; Caribbean Region, N.Y., N.Y.</span>, 60 FLRA 864, 866 (2005). By contrast, where an arbitrator resolves a claim under a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) rather than a statutory claim, "unless a specific burden of proof is required, an arbitrator may establish and apply whatever burden the arbitrator considers appropriate...." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>In this connection, the Authority distinguishes allegations that an agency lacked just cause for discipline under a CBA from allegations of unlawful interference with protected rights under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See NAGE, Local R3-32</span>, 59 FLRA 458, 459 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring) (where parties stipulated a just-cause issue, Authority declined to consider claim of alleged violation of &#x00A7; 7102(a) of the Statute that was not raised before arbitrator). In addition, when an arbitrator is not required to apply a statutory standard, alleged misapplications of that standard do not provide a basis for finding the arbitrator's award deficient. <span class="Italic">E.g., SSA</span>, 65 FLRA 286, 288 (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found, and there is no dispute, that the Union "waived" any statutory claims, and that the issue before the Arbitrator was whether there was "just and sufficient cause" for the suspension--not whether the suspension violated &#x00A7; 7116 of the Statute. As such, the Arbitrator was not required to apply statutory standards, and the Arbitrator's alleged misapplication of the flagrant misconduct standard does not provide a basis for setting aside the award. <span class="Italic">See SSA</span>, 65 FLRA at 288.</p>
<p class="noindent">The same approach, involving examination of whether the arbitrator's review of arguably protected conduct was protected by statute or assessed under a contractual "just cause" clause (not invoking statutory protections) was noted in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2018 and Marine Air Ground Task Force Training Command</span>, 65 FLRA 849, 851 (2011), involving suspension of a union vice president charged with falsely accusing a management representative of improper physical contact during a grievance meeting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Whether an employer allegedly took actions against an individual during the course of protected activity applies in cases where an agency is alleged to have violated &#x00A7; 7116 of the Statute. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA</span>, 64 FLRA 365, 369 (2009) (Member Beck concurring). Specifically, where an agency is alleged to have committed a ULP on this basis, "a necessary part of the [agency's] defense" against the ULP allegation is that the individual's actions constituted flagrant misconduct or otherwise exceeded the bounds of protected activity. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that arbitrators are required to apply statutory burdens of proof when resolving an alleged ULP.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. GSA, Ne. &#x0026; Caribbean Region, N.Y., N.Y., </span>60 FLRA 864, 866 (2005). By contrast, where an arbitrator resolves a claim under a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) rather than a statutory claim, "unless a specific burden of proof is required, an arbitrator may establish and apply whatever burden the arbitrator considers appropriate...." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>In this connection, the Authority distinguishes allegations that an agency lacked just cause for discipline under a CBA from allegations of unlawful interference with protected rights under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, VA Md.

In addition, when an arbitrator is not required to apply a statutory standard, alleged misapplications of that standard do not provide a basis for finding the arbitrator's award deficient. <span class="Italic">See Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., 65 FLRA 286, 288 (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>) (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record reflects, and there is no dispute, that the parties stipulated that the issue before the Arbitrator was whether there was "just cause" for the grievant's suspension, not whether the suspension violated &#x00A7; 7116. Because the issue before the Arbitrator was a contractual claim, the Arbitrator was not required to apply statutory standards, and the Arbitrator's alleged misapplication of the statutory standard concerning protected activity under &#x00A7; 7116 does not provide a basis for setting aside the award. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2923</span>, 65 FLRA at 563.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also excepts to the award on the basis that it is contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7503 because the Agency did not notify the grievant that his proposed suspension was based in part on his conduct at the meeting. For the reasons explained above, the Arbitrator was not required to apply statutory standards, and the Arbitrator's alleged misapplication of the statutory standard concerning notice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7503 does not provide a basis for setting aside the award. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2923</span>, 65 FLRA at 563.</p>
<p class="noindent">The distinction between analysis by an arbitrator under a "just cause" and a ULP standard was reiterated, <span class="Italic">VA North Florida/South Georgia VHS and AFGE Local 1976</span>, 66 FLRA 102, 104 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Authority has held that the flagrant misconduct standard applies in cases where an agency is alleged to have violated &#x00A7; 7116 of the Statute by taking actions against an individual based on that individual's actions during the course of protected activity. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2923</span>, 65 FLRA at 563. By contrast, where an arbitrator resolves a disciplinary-action claim exclusively under a collective bargaining agreement, an arbitrator may establish and apply whatever burden the arbitrator considers appropriate unless a specific burden of proof is required. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Army, U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs, St. Louis Dist., St. Louis, Mo.</span>, 65 FLRA 642, 645 (2011). In this regard, the Authority distinguishes allegations that an agency lacked just cause for discipline under a CBA from allegations of unlawful interference with protected rights under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, VA Md. Healthcare Sys.</span>, 65 FLRA 619, 621-22 (2011). In addition, when an arbitrator is not required to apply a statutory standard, alleged misapplications of that standard do not provide a basis for finding the arbitrator's award deficient. <span class="Italic">See Soc. Sec. Admin.</span>, 65 FLRA 286, 288 (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 284 and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 60 FLRA 230, 231-32 (2004), presented straightforward analysis of minor discipline imposed for protected activity--rudeness during the course of a grievance meeting--with the result that FLRA set aside discipline sustained by the arbitrator:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the grievant was engaged in protected activity during the meeting with his supervisor, and, as such, that his decision to leave the meeting, even if rude, was not sufficient to warrant discipline. For the following reasons we agree and modify the award to render it consistent with the law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In cases alleging discrimination, the Authority applies the framework in <span class="Italic">Letterkenny, </span>35 FLRA at 118. Under that framework, the party making such an assertion establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination by demonstrating that: (1) the employee against whom the alleged discriminatory action was taken was engaged in protected activity; and (2) such activity was a motivating factor in the agency's treatment of the employee. Once the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing is made, an agency may seek to establish the affirmative defense that: (1) there was a legitimate justification for the action; and (2) the same action would have been taken even in the absence of the protected activity. When the alleged discrimination concerns discipline solely for conduct that occurs during protected activity, a necessary part of the respondent's defense is that the conduct constituted flagrant misconduct or otherwise exceeded the boundaries of protected activity. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Ctr., Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Ariz</span>., 58 FLRA 636 (2003) (<span class="Italic">Monthan Air Force Base</span>). "[I]t is not legitimate for an agency to discipline [solely] for conduct occurring during the course of protected activity that [does not exceed the boundaries of protected activities]." <span class="Italic">Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Office of Internal Affairs, Wash., D.C.</span>, 53 FLRA 1500, 1516 (1998) (<span class="Italic">Prisons</span>). Under the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> framework, the agency has the burden of establishing its affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence.[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;In cases where discipline is based solely on conduct that occurs during protected activity, this framework recognizes that the second element of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case (discipline was motivated by protected activity) is inherently satisfied and the second element of the affirmative defense (respondent would have taken same action <span id="page_2296"></span>in the absence of protected activity) is inherently inapplicable. This is because, when a respondent takes an action based solely on conduct that occurs during protected activity, it is obvious that the respondent was motivated by the activity and could not have taken the action in the absence of it. This does not mean that the framework is being applied improperly or needs modification. Instead, it simply recognizes that, as with other multi-part tests, only those parts that apply need be evaluated. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Serv.</span>, 55 FLRA 892, 901-02 (1999) (Member Cabaniss dissenting on other grounds) (agency's affirmative defense that it was not obligated to bargain because union proposal was nonnegotiable does not apply where agency did not provide sufficient opportunity to bargain); <span class="Italic">see also Letterkenny</span>, 35 FLRA at 120 (in a pretext case, where the "motive asserted by a respondent to be lawful is found to be unlawful[,]" it is not necessary to determine whether respondent would have taken same action absent unlawful motive).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the foregoing we note that the Arbitrator determined that the grievant's supervisor called the grievant into her office May 7 "for a counseling session on the circulation of [the] memo" and that "circulation was the basis of [the grievant's] grievance[.]" Consistent with this finding, the May 7 meeting stemmed from and was premised upon the grievant's decision to file a grievance over the circulation of this memo. The Authority has previously found that pursuing a grievance, whether it be filing the grievance or attending grievance meetings, constitutes protected activity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Monthan Air Force Base</span>, 58 FLRA at 636 (upholding Judge's decision finding that employee participating in a grievance meeting was engaged in protected activity.) Therefore, the Arbitrator's factual findings support a conclusion that the grievant was engaged in protected activity during the May 7 meeting.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the record clearly reflects that the disputed discipline was "based on [the grievant's] conduct at the May 7" meeting, and, as such, that this protected activity was a motivating factor for the discipline. As the discipline was based on conduct occurring during protected activity, the grievant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination under <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>. <span class="Italic">See Prisons</span>, 53 FLRA at 1516 ("it is not legitimate for an agency to discipline for conduct occurring during the course of protected activity that is not flagrant misconduct").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, the grievant's conduct is subject to discipline only if it exceeded the bounds of protected activity. <span class="Italic">Monthan Air Force Base</span>, 58 FLRA at 636. Here, the Arbitrator found and there is no dispute that the grievant was merely "rude." This conduct is almost identical to the conduct in dispute in <span class="Italic">Monthan Air Force Base</span>, where an employee's act of leaving a grievance meeting without permission did not exceed the bounds of protected activity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, consistent with <span class="Italic">Monthan Air Force Base</span>, the grievant's conduct in this matter does not exceed the bounds of protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Arbitrator's decision to uphold the Agency's discriminatory discipline is contrary to law, and we will modify it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">V.&#x2003;Decision</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award is modified to direct the Agency to rescind the grievant's admonishment and make the grievant whole.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE and SSA Valrico</span>, 59 FLRA 767, 770-71 (2004) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring), sustained an award resolving to be appropriate (under a contract standard that referenced the antireprisal sections of 5 USC Chapter 71) a reprimand of a grievant whose conduct, the union contended, was protected activity that did not rise to the level of flagrancy (the grievant related to a supervisor that a union official "told me to tell you to kiss my ass"):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the alleged violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2) of the Statute concerns discipline for conduct occurring during protected activity, a part of a respondent's defense is that the conduct constituted flagrant misconduct or otherwise exceeded the boundaries of protected activity. For example, in <span class="Italic">Veterans Admin. Med. Ctr., Birmingham, Ala</span>., 35 FLRA 553, 560-61 (1990), the Authority found that a union representative was properly subject to discipline for remaining on a telephone call to discuss union business after having been ordered to work on a "life threatening" emergency situation. In <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, United States Marshals Service and United States Marshals Serv., Dist. of New Jersey</span>, 26 FLRA 890, 901 (1987), the Authority upheld an administrative law judge's decision holding that a physical response by either a union or management representative in the context of labor-management relations would be "beyond the limits of acceptable behavior." In that case, the Authority found that physical violence by a supervisor constituted an unfair labor practice. Additionally, in <span class="Italic">Veterans Admin., Washington, D.C., and Veterans Admin. Med. Ctr., Cincinnati, Ohio</span>, 26 FLRA 114 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 2031 v. FLRA</span>, 878 F.2d 460 (D.C. Cir. 1989), the Authority upheld the discipline of a union president for his racially inflammatory comments in a union newspaper article discussing a management official's activities in the workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, discipline of union representatives in such situations is permitted if their conduct exceeds the boundaries of protected activity. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, Aerospace Maint. &#x0026; Regeneration Ctr., Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Ariz., </span>58 FLRA 636 (2003)<span class="Italic"> citing Dep't of the Air Force, 315th Airlift Wing v. FLRA</span>, 294 F.3d 192 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (<span class="Italic">315th Airlift Wing</span>). In this regard, the court stated that "flagrant misconduct is a sufficient, but not necessary, condition for a loss of privilege under &#x00A7; 7102 [of the Statute]" and "is only illustrative of exceeding the boundaries of protected activities." <span class="Italic">315th Airlift Wing, </span>294 F.3d<span class="Italic"> </span>at 201, 202 (emphasis omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether an employee has exceeded the bounds of protected activity in the context of flagrant misconduct allegations, the Authority balances the employee's right to engage in protected activity, which "permits leeway for impulsive behavior,...against the employer's right to maintain order and respect for its supervisory staff on the jobsite." <span class="Italic">Def. Mapping Agency</span>, 17 FLRA at 80. Relevant factors in striking this balance include: (1) the place and subject matter of the discussion; (2) whether the employee's outburst was impulsive or designed; (3) whether the outburst was in any way provoked by the employer's conduct; and (4) the nature of the intemperate language and conduct. <span class="Italic">Def. Mapping Agency</span>, 17 FLRA at 80-81.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;However, it is not the words alone that are dispositive. Rather, it is the context, as established by other relevant factors, that determine whether the comment exceeds the bounds of protected activity. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of the Air Force, Grissom Air Force Base, Indiana</span>, 51 FLRA 7, 11-12 (1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Union alleged that the grievant was engaged in representational activity that was protected. The Agency maintained that the grievant was on duty and not using official time and that she was not engaged in representational activity. Further, the Agency contended that even if she was representing the Union rather than her individual interest, her actions exceeded the bounds of protected activity. The Arbitrator noted the contentions but applied a flagrant misconduct analysis without expressly resolving the issue of whether the grievant was engaged in Union representation that constituted protected activity. Upon <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of the record as a whole, as the Arbitrator implicitly found, we conclude that the grievant was engaged in representational activity at the time in question and resolve the case under that finding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the four factors, the Arbitrator found that the conversation in question occurred in the supervisor's private office, with the door open, and that the grievant used poor judgment in making the remark and could have made her point in a more professional manner. The Arbitrator further noted that while the grievant described the supervisor's failure to discontinue a telephone conversation as provocation, he found such provocation questionable. Finally, the Arbitrator considered the nature of the inappropriate language and found that the workplace was a professional setting--"an office of educated professionals whose main activity is dealing with the public." The Arbitrator determined that the grievant did not have to use language so offensive to make her point. Given these factual findings, which were not challenged, we hold that the Union failed to establish that the Arbitrator improperly found that the Agency had the right to discipline the grievant for use of inappropriate language that exceeded the bounds of protected activity. <span class="Italic">See Def. Mapping Agency</span>, 17 FLRA at 73 (employee told supervisor to "Get Screwed" and was reprimanded, judge found employee's remark was indefensible under the circumstances and constituted flagrant misconduct, thus justifying discipline as outside the protection of the Statute).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As these cases reflect, the Authority makes a determination as to whether alleged flagrant misconduct exceeds the bounds of protected activity on a case-by-case basis and upon the totality of the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Air Force Flight Test Ctr., Edwards Air Force Base, Cal</span>., 53 FLRA 1455 (1998). Here, based on the Arbitrator's findings of fact and the totality of the circumstances, we determine, upon <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, that the conversation between the grievant and the supervisor took place in a semi-private setting, but that the grievant's use of intemperate language was not provoked, or consistent with the professional nature of the workplace, or defensible under the circumstances. Although the Union official told the grievant to use the offensive phrase, the grievant should have known that the phrase was not appropriate. Further, while we find that the grievant was frustrated by not being able to speak with the supervisor immediately, such frustration does not equate to provocation by the Agency. In fact, any provocation in this case was presented by the Union official who told the grievant to utter the words to her supervisor in anticipation of their ultimate effect. In agreement with the Arbitrator, we find that the grievant could have made her point without resorting to such coarse, offensive language. Accordingly, we conclude, as the Arbitrator effectively did, that the grievant's conduct constituted flagrant misconduct and therefore exceeded the bounds of protected activity.</p>
