<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-58"><span class="space">G.</span> PROFICIENCY TRAINING; CROSS-TRAINING</h3>
<p class="noindent">A nonnegotiable proposal, considered in <span class="Italic">AFGE Int'l Council of Marshals Serv. Locals and DOJ, Marshals Serv.</span>, 4 FLRA 384, 386 (1980), required the agency to provide employees with the time, ammunition, and opportunity to practice with firearms at least every four months, or more when facilities and funds permitted, to maintain necessary proficiency. FLRA concluded that the proposal violated the right of management to assign work by contractually prescribing certain assignments at specified times for specific employees in the unit. FLRA commented that "were management to determine that periodic qualification and training on firearms were necessary then clearly the Union could negotiate on procedures which management officials of the Agency will observe with respect to such qualification and training." But an adverse effect of a management determination may involve a means of work performed by an employee. One agency's employees were required to carry firearms and, as a negotiable appropriate arrangement for the adverse effect of the requirement to carry arms, the agency was required to bargain over a proposal that it reopen and repair a gun range for employee practice. FLRA declined to conclude that the proposal interfered with the agency's right to determine the technology of performing work. The agency made no showing that use of or repair of a gun range interfered with a technical method used by the agency for accomplishing or furthering its work. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2272 and DOJ, Marshals Serv.</span>, 9 FLRA 1004, 1012 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent">A nonnegotiable proposal required management to supply employees with training to enhance their proficiency and to provide them with an opportunity to undertake assignments to permit evaluation of their ability to perform beyond their present grade. The proposal interfered with management's right to assign work by requiring the assignment of work permitting evaluation of higher-level duties. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 9 FLRA 983, 988 (1982). A proposal conflicted with the right to assign work that called on management to provide employees training to keep up with new technology in newly acquired equipment. <span class="Italic">IBEW Local 121 and GPO</span>, 8 FLRA 188, 189 (1982). Another proposal was nonnegotiable that the agency maintain a program of nursing education during duty hours and to release employees to attend those training sessions. <span class="Italic">Illinois Nurses' Ass'n and VAMC, Hines</span>, 28 FLRA 212, 241 (1987) (Proposal 9).</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable was a proposal for details to agency offices that permitted employees to maintain certification in a pilot weather briefing service. The proposal interfered with the right to assign employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A). The proposal was not an appropriate arrangement because there were less intrusive means to obtain the certification for employees needing it. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Weather Serv. Employees Org. and Dept. of Commerce, NOAA, Nat'l Weather Serv., Silver Spring, Md.</span>, 46 FLRA 49, 59 (1992) (Proposal 2). Another proposal was nonnegotiable that required the employer to provide state-mandated teacher effectiveness training. The provisions (Proposal 1 and 2) were nonnegotiable abridgements of the right to assign work and were not appropriate arrangements because they did not restrict the training requirement to only the employees who were required to obtain it. <span class="Italic">NEA and DODDDESS, Ft. Bragg</span>, 53 FLRA 898, 908-10 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NFFE Local 29 and Dept. of Army, Eng'r Dist., Kansas City</span>, 45 FLRA 603, 611-13 (1992), declared negotiable a section of Proposal 2 that management provide periodic update training to unit employees identified as a "procurement official":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second sentence of the proposal provides that employees identified as procurement officials will receive periodic update training.&#x2003;The Union states that the proposal applies only to bargaining unit employees. As explained by the Agency, the training concerns aspects of the procurement integrity process for which all procurement and contracting personnel are responsible, is directly related to the duties of employees, and directly affects their work performance. Thus, we find that the training encompassed by the second sentence is directly related to the duties of those bargaining unit employees who are identified as procurement officials. The Authority previously has held that proposals requiring agencies to provide training to employees consisting of instruction on their duties and responsibilities directly interfere with the right to assign work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping, Washington</span>, 39 FLRA at 560. As the second sentence requires the Agency to provide training for <span id="page_658"></span>employees relating to the performance of their duties, we conclude that the second sentence directly interferes with management's rights under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we further find that the second sentence is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we find that the second sentence is intended as an arrangement for employees who may be adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to assign work. As noted by the Agency, the procurement integrity provisions of the Procurement Act address various employee responsibilities and require that employees sign certain procurement integrity certification forms. The Agency acknowledges that an employee who fails to fulfill the certification responsibilities will be found to have violated law and Government-wide regulations. In this connection, we note that 41 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 423(h) provides that employees who engage in conduct prohibited by the Procurement Act "shall be subject to removal or other appropriate adverse personnel action pursuant to the procedures specified in chapter 75 of title 5 or other applicable law or regulation." 41 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 423(h)(2). By requiring the Agency to provide periodic update training to procurement officials, the second sentence of the proposal is designed to apprise employees of new or changed requirements relating to the performance of their duties. Thus, with the training, employees would be provided with the information needed to avoid the legal consequences of failing to fulfill the requirements of the Procurement Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find, after balancing the competing interests of the Agency in being able to assign work and the interests of employees in ensuring that they have appropriate training to perform the requirements of the Procurement Act, that the second sentence would not excessively interfere with the right to assign work. Periodic update training would afford obvious benefits to employees. For example, it would be easier for employees to keep abreast of changes in law or regulation that affect the performance of their duties if the Agency were to provide a systematic means of dispensing that information. Additionally, as a general matter, employees would benefit from such training by improving their knowledge, proficiency, ability, and skill in carrying out their official duties. It is also noteworthy that a logical consequence of improved individual performance would be the beneficial effect on the Agency's administration of its procurement program.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, the second sentence would require the Agency to take whatever measures are necessary to provide training for employees on a recurring basis. However, both the Procurement Act and its implementing regulations already require the head of each federal agency to establish training on procurement ethics. At a minimum, the Procurement Act and the implementing regulations require that the training program include the distribution of a written explanation of certain provisions of the Procurement Act. Thus, the second sentence simply requires the Agency to supplement the training that is required by law and regulation. In addition, the Agency would retain the discretion to determine the content, duration, and timing of the training. In this regard, the second sentence does not specify the type of training that the Agency will provide, such as formal classes or on-the-job training, nor does it dictate the schedule of training, its duration, or who will provide the actual training. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Patent Office Professional Association and Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark office</span>, 39 FLRA 783, 837-38 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Commerce, Patent Office</span>) (portion of proposal requiring that agency provide adequate training for examiners found not to excessively interfere with right to assign work insofar as agency retained discretion to determine the type of training, its schedule, duration, and who would conduct the training).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the burden imposed on the Agency to provide periodic update training is minimal when compared with the benefits afforded to employees by providing such training. Consequently, we conclude that the second sentence of Proposal 2 constitutes a negotiable appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Finally, we find that <span class="Italic">Army Research, Picatinny</span>, relied on by the Agency, is distinguishable. Although the Authority found that a proposal requiring the agency to provide training directly interfered with the right to assign work, a result we also reach here, the Authority did not address whether the proposal constituted a negotiable appropriate arrangement because that issue was not before the Authority. In contrast, the Union claimed that the second sentence constitutes a negotiable appropriate arrangement and, based on the foregoing analysis, we have concluded that it does.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 56 FLRA 69, 109 (2000), approved and disapproved various proposals designed to familiarize unit patent examiners with a new computerized patent search system. Separating the negotiable from the nonnegotiable proposals was the extent of management's discretion in tailoring the training to specific needs of employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the degree to which the proposals burden the exercise of management's right to assign work, the proposals differ in two significant respects. First, Proposal 35 requires the Agency to provide all unit employees with a particular minimum amount (12 hours) of classroom training, while Proposals 36 and 37 permit the Agency to determine the amount of training it deems necessary. That is, unlike Proposals 36 and 37, Proposal 35 constitutes a "one size fits all" approach requiring that all employees receive the same 12 hours of training and depriving the Agency of discretion to determine that particular examiners do not need this specified length of formal classroom training. Second, both Proposals 35 and 36 dictate a particular type of training to be provided: Proposal 35 requires "classroom training," and Proposal 36 requires "on-the-job training." Proposal 37, on the other hand, does not require a particular type of training. As such, unlike Proposal 37, Proposals 35 and 36 remove the Agency's discretion to determine that a different type of training would be better for individual examiners or groups of examiners.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A requirement that the Agency provide examiners with a minimum of 12 hours of classroom training does not appear excessive, particularly when measured against the potential adverse effects on examiners from inefficient use of the automated system. However, the blanket nature of the proposal would deprive the Agency of any discretion to deviate from a specified minimum number of hours. Moreover, Proposal 35 would constrain the Agency not only with regard to the duration of the training, but also with regard to the type of the training. In these circumstances, we conclude that Proposal 35's effect on management's right to assign work would be disproportionate to the benefits that employees would derive from it. Accordingly, Proposal 35 is not within the Agency's duty to bargain because it excessively interferes with management's right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike Proposals 35 and 36, Proposals 37 would merely require the Agency to provide "adequate" or "appropriate" training. The proposal provides the Agency discretion to determine when to provide training and how much training to provide. The Authority has previously held that proposals providing an agency with discretion to determine the extent to which training is required, and the amount and type of that training, do not excessively interfere with management's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">See POPA II, </span>39 FLRA at 837; <span class="Italic">American</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local</span> <span class="Italic">2317 and U.S. Marine Corps, Marine Corps Logistics</span> <span class="Italic">Base, Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentality, Albany,</span> <span class="Italic">Georgia, </span>29 FLRA 1587, 1605 (1987). Consistent with this precedent, we find that the benefits examiners would derive from Proposal 37 outweigh the minimal interference Proposal 37 would have on the Agency's right to assign work. Accordingly, Proposal 37 is within the duty to bargain as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NAGE Local R3-10 and Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 55 FLRA 839, 843-86 (1999), concluded that a proposal to extend to Air Traffic Assistants (ATAs) the benefits of the "National FAM Training Program," designed to train air traffic controllers by permitting them "cockpit" flights in commercial air carriers, was nonnegotiable because the ATAs did not require the training and the travel derived from the program would constitute a gift to the employees from the commercial sources in violation of government ethics regulations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the proposal is nonnegotiable because it is inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.202. Section 2635.202 prohibits a Government employee from, "directly or indirectly, solicit[ing] or accept[ing] a gift...[f]rom a prohibited source[,]" unless the item is excluded from the definition of a "gift" or falls within one of the exceptions provided in the regulation. As set forth below, we find that, under section 2635.202, the air carriers providing the travel pursuant to the proposed FAM program are a "prohibited source"; the travel is a "gift"; and the travel does not fall within one of the exclusions from the definition of "gift" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.203(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The Air Carriers Providing the Travel Under the Proposed FAM Program are a "Prohibited Source"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A "prohibited source" is defined, in relevant part, as any person who:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;Is seeking official action by the employee's agency; (2) Does business or seeks to do business with the employee's agency; (3) Conducts activities regulated by the employee's agency; [or] (4) Has interests that may be substantially affected by performance or nonperformance of the employee's official duties....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.203(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is not disputed that the air carriers on which the proposal would permit the ATAs to travel are controlled by, and subject to, the rules and regulations established by the Agency. Accordingly, the air carriers are a prohibited source as defined in section 2635.203(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that an air carrier providing the gift of travel is excluded from the definition of "prohibited source" in section 2635.203(d) by virtue of section 2635.203(b)(8). However, the Union's argument is not supported by the regulation. Section 2635.203(b)(8) is an exclusion from the definition of a "gift"--not to the definition of a "prohibited source." Section 2635.203(d) does not include any exclusions from the definition of the term "prohibited source."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_659"></span>Thus, we find that the air carriers constitute a source from which an ATA would be prohibited under section 2635.202 from soliciting or accepting a gift or item of monetary value.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The Proposed FAM Program Travel is Within the Definition of a "Gift" Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.203(b)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A "gift," within the meaning of the Standards of Ethical Conduct, is defined to include:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">any gratuity, favor, discount, entertainment, hospitality, loan, forbearance, or other item having monetary value. It includes services as well as gifts of training, transportation, local travel, lodgings and meals, whether provided in-kind, by purchase of a ticket, payment in advance, or reimbursement after the expense has been incurred.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.203(b). Section 2635.203(b)(8) specifically excludes from the definition of a "gift," "[a]ny gift accepted by the Government under specific statutory authority, including...gifts provided in-kind which have been accepted by an agency under its agency gift acceptance statute[.]" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.203(b)(8)(ii).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute that, absent an exclusion from the definition of "gift" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.203(b) or an exception to the prohibition on accepting gifts under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.204, air travel would constitute a gift of "travel" under the regulation. The Union does not claim that the air travel is excepted from the prohibition on accepting gifts under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.204. As discussed below, the Union claims only that the air travel is excluded from the definition of "gift" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.203(b)(8).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The Travel Is Not Excluded From the Definition of a Gift by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.203(b)(8)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the travel accomplished through the proposed FAM program would fall within the exclusion from the definition of "gift" under section 2635.203(b)(8) because the Agency would be accepting the travel under its gift acceptance statute, 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 326(a). The Agency disputes that it has such authority to accept the travel proposed by the Union. Accordingly, to determine whether the proposed FAM travel is excluded from the definition of a "gift" under the Standards of Ethical Conduct, we examine whether the Agency has the discretion to accept the travel under the authority set forth in section 326(a)<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2635.202(a), 2635.203(b) (8) (ii).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">i.&#x2003;Framework for Determining Whether the Agency May Accept the Travel Under 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 326(a)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has consistently held that matters concerning conditions of employment are subject to collective bargaining when they are within the discretion of an agency and are not otherwise inconsistent with law, applicable rule, or regulation<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Franklin Lodge No. 2135 et al. and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing,</span> 50 FLRA 677, 681-82 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>), <span class="Italic">aff'd mem. Sub nom. Bureau of Engraving and Printing v. FLRA</span>, 88 F.3d 1279 (D.C. Cir. 1996). Where an agency's discretion is limited by, for example, standards or procedures set forth in law or regulation, an agency may only bargain to the extent of that discretion<span class="Italic">. See Patent Office Professional Association and U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office</span>, 53 FLRA 625, 648-50, 690 (1997); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, National Border Patrol Council and U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service</span>, 51 FLRA 1308, 1330-31 (1996). A proposal concerning matters within the discretion of an agency is inconsistent with law or regulation and, thus, outside the duty to bargain, where it requires that an agency apply a standard that is contrary to a standard set forth in law or regulation<span class="Italic">. See U.S. Department of Defense, Office of Dependents Schools and Overseas Education Association</span>, 40 FLRA 425, 441 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">ii.&#x2003;The Agency Does Not Have Discretion Under 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 326(a) to Bargain Over the Proposal</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency and Union agree that under the National FAM Training program, the Agency accepts the gift of travel pursuant to its gift acceptance statute set forth in section 326(a). The Agency asserts, however, that it would be contrary to its authority under section 326(a) to agree to the union's proposal. Specifically, the Agency asserts that the authority of the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to "accept a gift of services in carrying out aviation duties and powers" extends only to a limited category of gifts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency concedes that it "can and does bargain over the implementation of its gift acceptance authority, as reflected in the [National] FAM [Training] program." However, the Agency argues that this bargaining is permissible because the training of ATCs falls within the statutory standard. The Agency asserts that ATAs--unlike ATCs--"do not require any training in air traffic control procedures." According to the Agency, its authority under section 326(a) does not extend to bargaining over securing free travel for its employees on non-duty time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 326(a) is a part of the statute creating the Department of Transportation and, among other organizational sub-administrations, the Agency<span class="Italic">. See</span> 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 101, 106. On its face, the statute provides that the Agency has the authority to accept a gift of services "in carrying out aviation duties and powers." The statute does not provide any definition or explanation of the phrase "aviation duties and powers." The only legislative history relevant to interpreting that phrase states that "[t]he words 'aviation duties and powers' [were] added [to section 326(a)] because the source provisions being restated only appl[y] to carrying out duties and powers related to the Federal Aviation Administration." 49 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 326 (Historical and Statutory Notes) (citing Detailed Explanation prepared by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel, 1982 U.S. Code Cong. And Adm. News, p. 4220).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency interprets the phrase "carrying out aviation powers and duties" as a limitation on the scope of gifts that it may properly accept. Specifically, with respect to training, the Agency interprets the phrase as limiting it to accepting as a gift only training that is directly related to "aviation duties." The Union does not contend that the Agency has the authority under section 326(a) to accept a gift of travel on non-duty time that does not have a training purpose and that is intended only to provide employees free travel. Rather, the Union argues that the proposed FAM program would provide ATAs the same benefits as ATCs enjoy under the National FAM Training program, and that section 326(a) encompasses gifts that would provide "performance enhancement and promotional opportunities" for Agency employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We rejected above, in our construction of the meaning of the proposal, the Union's argument that ATAs' job performance and promotional opportunities would be enhanced by participation in the proposed FAM program in the "same" manner that ATCs' participation in the National FAM Training program enhances their job performance and promotional opportunities....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Union has not established that the proposed FAM program has any purpose other than free travel on non-duty time, the Union's argument that the Agency can accept the proposed travel under section 326(a) fails. In these circumstances, we find that there is no basis for concluding that the Agency can accept under section 326(a) the travel set forth in the proposed FAM program.</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal that management cross-train employees was nonnegotiable. It directly interfered with the right to assign work. The proposal was not an appropriate arrangement, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2317 and Marine Corps Logistics Base, Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentality, Albany</span>, 29 FLRA 1587, 1604 (1987) (Provision 7):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Section 3 is (1) not focused on any particular exercise of a management right; and (2) not conditioned on any management right being exercised. Rather it is intended to generally broaden employee skills and qualifications in the hope that employees will thereby have more options available to them in the event that reorganizations and realignments occur in the future.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since, [sic] section 3 would apply regardless of whether any management right was ever exercised and since the exercise of the management rights which might be involved is purely speculative, we find no basis to conclude that section 3 is an "arrangement" for employees who are adversely affected by the exercise of a management right within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent">Cross-training was rejected in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1931 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Weapons Station, Concord</span>, 32 FLRA 1023, 1063 (1988) (Provision 34). The proposal was not saved by its limitation that the training would only be required if it were feasible and to the mutual benefit of the parties. The proposal directly interfered with the right to assign work. It was not an appropriate arrangement; it did not mitigate adverse consequences resulting from a management action. But <span class="Italic">NTEU and IRS, Dallas Dist.</span>, 13 FLRA 48, 49-50 (1983), approved negotiation of a proposal that required employees to be given the opportunity to perform different tasks required by their position descriptions so that they could maintain necessary proficiency.</p>
<p class="noindent">Nothing precludes negotiation of a proposal that allows an employee to determine his training needs. A proposal may call for the agency to counsel an employee concerning appropriate educational resources that may be of use to the employee in securing promotion. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Union of Hosp. and Health Care Employees, Dist. 1199 and VAMC, Dayton</span>, 28 FLRA 435, 446-47 (1987). Also negotiable were proposals for the employer to consider requested training, for the employer to make available information about known training opportunities, and requiring that nomination and selection in training and career development programs be made in a fair and impartial manner. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Dept. of Educ.
