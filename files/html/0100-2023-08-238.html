<p class="Body-Text">Aside from the Individual Right of Action initiated by an employee or a disciplinary or corrective action initiated by the Special Counsel, cases described in <a href="0100-2023-20-001.html#sec13-1">Chapter 13</a>, an allegation of a prohibited personnel practice does not, by itself, confer Board appellate jurisdiction over an agency action against an employee, although it may be invoked as an affirmative defense to an adverse action or performance-based action. 5 USC 2302(b) is not an independent source of appellate jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Saunders v. MSPB</span>, 757 F.2d 1288 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">see Mancinelli v. MSPB</span>, 395 Fed. Appx. 702, 704 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP) (whistleblower cases aside, an allegation of a prohibited personnel practice does not provide an independent source of Board appellate jurisdiction under 5 USC 7701); <span class="Italic">Miller v. MSPB</span>, 198 Fed. Appx. 943, 944 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP) (&#x00A7; 2302 is not an independent source of appellate jurisdiction and does not itself authorize an appeal); <span class="Italic">Cohn v. DOD,</span> DC-0752-14-0966-I-1 (NP 6/25/2015) ("Although the Board is empowered to hear and decide complaints for corrective or disciplinary action when an agency is alleged to have taken a prohibited personnel practice, this authority generally is limited to allegations of reprisal in the context of an individual right of action appeal, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a), and allegations of prohibited personnel practices coupled with independently appealable agency actions or decisions, <span class="Italic">Brodt v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 11 F.3d 1060, 1061 (Fed. Cir. 1993)."); <span class="Italic">Soto v. Dept. of Army</span>, 5 MSPR 353, 354, 5 MSPB 375 (1981) (citing <span class="Italic">Crary v. FAA,</span> 1 MSPR 453 (1980), for the principle that an allegation of a prohibited personnel <span id="Page_383"></span>practice alone, without being associated with an appealable action, does not provide appellate jurisdiction to the Board). Without an IRA appeal, the statutory prohibited personnel practice provisions are available only as a defense to an adverse action by an agency. <span class="Italic">Dowd v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1983 NP No. 83-907). If the Board lacks jurisdiction over a bare allegation of a prohibited personnel practice, the Federal Circuit, whose jurisdiction is no broader than the Board's, also lacks jurisdiction to consider the allegation. <span class="Italic">Maddox v. MSPB</span>, 759 F.2d 9 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board does have jurisdiction over a personnel action otherwise beyond its ordinary appeals jurisdiction if the Special Counsel can be persuaded that the action is a prohibited personnel practice. An OSC corrective action complaint concerning the action is within the original jurisdiction of the Board; similarly an Individual Right of Action case is within the Board's jurisdiction. A Chapter 43 performance rating, although not an appealable adverse action, is a personnel action for purposes of an OSC prohibited personnel practice case. <span class="Italic">Acting Special Counsel v. EEOC</span>, 5 MSPR 19, 21, 5 MSPB 101 (1981). Ordinarily the Board does not serve as a middleman to transmit allegations to OSC. If the employee has facts that he believes warrant the attention of OSC, the employee should present those facts to OSC himself. <span class="Italic">Blair v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 6 MSPR 375, 376 n.1, 6 MSPB 320 (1981). Employees do not have a private right of action to enforce OSC recommendations. OSC has the authority to determine when to issue a complaint. Only OSC can deal with noncompliance with its recommendations; those issues cannot be raised by the appellant in a Board appeal. An appellant does not have the right to compel OSC to seek Board enforcement of OSC recommendations. <span class="Italic">Patrick v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 6 MSPR 247, 250, 6 MSPB 213 (1981). Once a statutorily-covered employee exhausts Individual Right of Action remedies through OSC, an appeal may be taken to the Board on a covered personnel action that results from, or is threatened as a result of, whistleblower reprisal, a topic covered by <a href="0100-2023-20-001.html#sec13-1">Chapter 13</a>. [Refer to <a href="0100-2023-20-001.html#sec13-1">Chapter 13</a> for prohibited personnel practices, Individual Right of Action (whistleblower) cases, and OSC corrective action authority; refer to <a href="0100-2023-24-001.html#sec17-1">Chapter 17</a> for the few court cases involving challenges to OSC inaction.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Discrimination may constitute a prohibited personnel practice, but an EEO allegation alone does not confer Board jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Belyakov v. DHHS</span>, DC-3443-13-0373-I-1 (NP 9/30/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The existence of Board jurisdiction is a threshold issue in adjudicating an appeal, and the appellant bears the burden of establishing jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Covington v. Department of the Army</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 9 (2000). It is well-settled that the Board lacks jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 over an employee's non-selection for a position. <span class="Italic">E.g., Gryder v. Department of Transportation</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 564, &#x00B6; 9 (2005). To the extent the appellant argues that the Board possesses jurisdiction over his appeal based on his discrimination claims, we note that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b) is not an independent source of Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Wren v. Department of the Army</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 1, 2 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 681 F.2d 867, 871-73 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Further, to the extent that the appellant argues that the Board possesses jurisdiction over his appeal based on the notice of appeal rights provided by the agency at the conclusion of the EEO counseling process, which informed him of the procedures for filing a mixed-case Board appeal, we note that the mere fact that the agency informed the appellant that he may have a right of appeal to the Board does not confer jurisdiction on the Board. <span class="Italic">E.g., Morales v. Social Security Administration</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 583, &#x00B6; 5 (2008); <span class="Italic">Miles-Townsend v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 405, 407 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Standel v. Dept. of Transp.,</span> DC-3443-14-1085-I-1 (NP 6/3/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Because the Board generally lacks jurisdiction over a nonselection for a promotion, and because the appellant has failed to allege circumstances under which the Board could have jurisdiction over his claim, we find that he has failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Harrell</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 492, &#x00B6; 11. Furthermore, in the absence of an otherwise appealable action, we lack jurisdiction to review the appellant's contentions that the agency's action was in retaliation for his having filed an equal employment opportunity complaint or based on religious discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Wheeler v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 236, &#x00B6; 9 (2001) (an allegation that an agency retaliated against an employee because of the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation, does not provide an independent source of Board jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">see also Wren v. Department of the Army</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 1, 2 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 681 F.2d 867, 871-73 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (absent an otherwise appealable action, the Board lacks jurisdiction over an appellant's claim of prohibited personnel practices).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The unavailability of a direct Board appeal based solely on an allegation of reprisal for filing a prior Board appeal was noted in <span class="Italic">King v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 90 MSPR 341, 347 &#x00B6; 10 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Likewise, the Board has no independent authority to adjudicate the appellant's claim of retaliation for filing a previous Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See Wren v. Department of the Army,</span> 2 MSPB 174, 2 M.S.P.R. 1, 2 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 681 F.2d 867, 871-73 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b) is not an independent source of Board jurisdiction). If the administrative judge determines that the Board has jurisdiction over this restoration appeal, he shall also consider her claim that the agency denied her restoration in retaliation for filing an earlier appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reprisal for filing a Board appeal could be a prohibited personnel practice under 5 USC 2302(b)(9)(A), with a possible IRA appeal following resort by the appellant to the Office of Special Counsel. [Refer to Chapter 13 for discussion of IRA cases.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an appeal from an arbitration award, assuming the existence of a personnel action otherwise within its jurisdiction and allegations of race, sex, age, or other covered discrimination, the Board may also review alleged errors in civil service law. <span class="Italic">Grudzinski v.
