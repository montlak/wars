<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-22"><span class="space">b.</span> Election Between EEO and Direct MSPB Appeal; Treatment of EEO Complaint</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A binding election follows an informed choice among options. <span class="Italic">Agenci</span>es are supposed to assist employees in identifying appeal rights and the impact of election of remedies. Under 5 CFR 1201.21 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency issues a decision notice to an employee on a matter that is appealable to the Board, the agency must provide the employee with the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;Notice of the time limits for appealing to the Board, the requirements of &#x00A7; 1201.22(c) [relating to the timeliness of the appeal], and the address of the appropriate Board office for filing the appeal;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;A copy, or access to a copy, of the Board's regulations;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c)&#x2003;A copy, or access to a copy, of the MSPB appeal form available at the Board's Web site (http://www.mspb.gov), and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(d)&#x2003;Notice of any right the employee has to file a grievance or seek corrective action under subchapters II and III of 5 U.S.C. chapter 12, including:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;Whether the election of any applicable grievance procedure will result in waiver of the employee's right to file an appeal with the Board;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;Whether both an appeal to the Board and a grievance may be filed on the same matter and, if so, the circumstances under which proceeding with one will preclude proceeding with the other, and specific notice that filing a grievance will not extend the time limit for filing an appeal with the Board;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;Whether there is any right to request Board review of a final decision on a grievance in accordance with &#x00A7; 1201.155 of this part; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(4)&#x2003;The effect of any election under 5 U.S.C. 7121(g), including the effect that seeking corrective action under subchapters II and III of 5 U.S.C. chapter 12 will have on the employee's appeal rights before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(e)&#x2003;Notice of any right the employee has to file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or to grieve allegations of unlawful discrimination, consistent with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 7121(d) and 29 CFR 1614.301 and 1614.302.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(f)&#x2003;The name or title and contact information for the agency official to whom the Board should send the Acknowledgment Order and copy of the appeal in the event the employee files an appeal with the Board. Contact information should include the official's mailing address, email address, telephone and fax numbers. <span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">[Refer to Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-076.html#sec2-75">Lack of Notice of Appeal Rights</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency fails to inform an employee of the option to file an EEO complaint, and the employee files an untimely Board appeal and also files an EEO complaint, the Board apparently will accept the case when it has completed its cycle through the EEO process, the result in <span class="Italic">Peartree v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 332, 341-42 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For mixed cases, 5 USC 7702(a)(1)-(2) and its implementing regulations provide for an election between (1) filing a direct Board appeal, and (2) filing a formal EEO complaint with the agency, followed by a right to file a Board appeal upon exhaustion of the agency EEO procedure. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1613.403 (effective before October 1, 1992); 29 CFR 1614.302(b), (d) (effective from October 1, 1992); 5 CFR 1201.154(a), (b). Regardless of whether an employee elects to file a direct Board appeal under 5 CFR 1201.154(a), or elects to file a Board appeal after exhausting the agency EEO procedure under 5 CFR 1201.154(b), she is entitled to the same <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review before the Board, including the right to a hearing. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 5 USC 7702(a)(1)-(2). However, an employee may not file a Board appeal under 5 CFR 1201.154(b), upon exhausting the agency EEO procedure, if she has previously made a valid election of the direct Board procedure. <span class="Italic">See Wilson v. United States Postal Service</span>, 45 MSPR 499, 500, 502 (1990); <span class="Italic">Dawson v. United States Postal Service</span>, 45 MSPR 194, 196-97 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue then is whether this appellant made a valid election of the direct Board procedure, when she untimely filed the prior Board appeal. Regarding this issue, the EEOC has determined that the appellant's prior Board appeal did not constitute a valid election because the agency had not adequately notified the appellant of the election requirement and the consequences of such an election....&#8197;As the Board held in <span class="Italic">Dawson</span>, 45 MSPR at 196-97, we find it appropriate to defer to the EEOC's determination on this issue. We therefore find that the appellant's prior Board appeal did not constitute a valid election of the direct Board procedure precluding a subsequent Board appeal under 5 CFR 1201.154(b). <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The result in <span class="Italic">Peartree</span> was replicated by <span class="Italic">McCoy v. USPS</span>, 108 MSPR 160, 166-67 &#x00B6; 13-14, 2008 MSPB 37 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even though the appellant filed a Board appeal before filing a mixed-case complaint with his agency, the election requirement set forth at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(b) does not bar this appeal. The appellant did not respond, either orally or in writing, to the notice of proposed removal, and the agency's decision letter did not, in any event, provide him with notice of a choice between filing a mixed-case complaint and a mixed-case appeal. The appellant did not allege discrimination in his first Board appeal. (Summary of Telephonic Prehearing Conference). In fact, as set forth above, the appellant has alleged that the facts underlying his discrimination claim did not come into existence until 4 months after he withdrew his Board appeal. Shortly thereafter, the appellant sought EEO counseling and filed a mixed-case discrimination complaint with his agency. Under these circumstances, we find that the election requirement set forth at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(b) does not apply because the factual circumstances giving rise to the appellant's discrimination claim had not occurred when he filed his first Board appeal, and the appellant was not, therefore, informed that filing a Board appeal would preclude him from subsequently filing a mixed-case complaint with the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This determination is consistent with Board and EEOC decisions issued under somewhat similar circumstances. In <span class="Italic">Gomez-Burgos v. Department of Defense,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 245, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-4 (1998), the appellant filed a Board appeal of his removal, withdrew the appeal, and then filed a formal discrimination complaint regarding his removal. An EEOC AJ held that, because the agency's removal decision notice failed to apprise the appellant of his mixed-case rights of filing an appeal with the Board or a discrimination complaint with the agency, and the appellant filed his Board appeal without notice of his right to elect between forums, the appellant never made a valid election to appeal his removal to the Board, and the agency was required to issue a final agency decision affording the appellant an opportunity to file a new Board appeal.<span class="Italic"> Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 4. After the appellant filed a new appeal, the Board deferred to the EEOC's determination and held that the appellant's first appeal did not constitute a valid election of the direct Board procedure that would preclude his subsequent appeal of his removal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b). <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 10;<span class="Italic"> see Peartree v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. 332, 341-42 (1995). Similarly, the EEOC has held that, when an appellant is not informed of the election requirement, and was unaware that he could not file both a complaint and an appeal or that whichever he filed first would constitute an election of that forum, the appellant did not make an informed election to pursue an appeal to the Board, and an agency's rejection of a subsequent discrimination <span id="Page_3338"></span>complaint is improper. <span class="Italic">See Zuniga v. Runyon,</span> EEOC Request No. 05920857, 1992 WL 1371933 (Apr. 26, 1993); <span class="Italic">Lauderdale v. Stone,</span> EEOC Request No. 05910033, 1991 WL 1189009 (Feb. 15, 1991). Just as the appellants in the above cases did not make valid elections because their agencies did not notify them of their right to file either a mixed-case complaint or a mixed-case appeal, the appellant in this case could not have made an informed, valid election under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(b) because the facts underlying the basis of his discrimination claim had not yet come into existence.</p>

Dept. of Navy</span>, 87 MSPR 373, 377-78 &#x00B6; 9 (2000) (an agency decision letter did not inform the appellant of the mixed case election requirement; the election to appeal directly to the Board instead of pursuing the EEO process is not binding if it was not informed); <span class="Italic">French v. USPS</span>, 80 MSPR 171, 173 &#x00B6; 6 (1998) ("[F]or a complaint or appeal to be considered a valid election, the complainant or appellant must have been informed of his right to appeal to both forums"; the case was remanded for development of evidence concerning the election of remedies); <span class="Italic">Peltier v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gomez-Burgos v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has previously determined in cases such as this that, based on policy considerations of comity and cooperation with the EEOC as co-equal tribunals in the mixed-case process, the Board will defer to the EEOC's procedural determination of whether an appellant made a valid election between the Board appeal process and the EEO process. <span class="Italic">See Crawford v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 70 MSPR 416, 423 n.5 (1996); <span class="Italic">Peartree,</span> 66 MSPR at 342; <span class="Italic">Dawson</span> <span class="Italic">v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 45 MSPR 194, 196-97 (1990). We thus find that the appellant's prior Board appeal did not constitute a valid election of the direct Board procedure precluding his subsequent Board appeal of his removal under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(b)<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Peartree</span>, 66 MSPR at 342; <span class="Italic">Dawson,</span> 45 MSPR at 196-97.

<p class="Body-Text">If the employee is misinformed that the initiation of EEO counseling is a binding election of remedies and withdraws an MSPB appeal based on that incorrect belief, the Board may, upon the appellant's request, reinstate the Board appeal if the AJ failed properly to inform the appellant of the proper elements of the election scheme, depending upon the filing of an EEO complaint rather than upon the initiation of EEO counseling, <span class="Italic">Shapiro v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the above, it appears the appellant withdrew his appeal based on the belief that what had thus far been informal EEO activity constituted a binding election to proceed before the agency. Had the administrative judge inquired whether the appellant filed a formal mixed case complaint prior to his Board appeal, he could have corrected the appellant's misapprehension, but the administrative judge did not take that opportunity. Under these circumstances, we find that reinstatement of the appeal is appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Brooks</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. at 554 (reinstating a withdrawn appeal where the administrative judge was in a position to correct appellant's mistaken belief that she could appeal to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission); <span class="Italic">Scarboro</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. at 498 (reinstating a withdrawn appeal where the administrative judge had an opportunity to correct the appellant's mistaken belief that the Board lacked jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Dodd v.

USPS</span>, 100 MSPR 303, 306-07 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10 (2005), the appellant filed a timely appeal from an adverse action, withdrew his appeal to pursue an EEO complaint, the agency rejected the EEO complaint because of the prior Board appeal, and the Board declined to reinstate the appeal. The Board noted that the appellant did not attempt to rescind the withdrawal of the Board appeal soon after the agency rejected the EEO complaint. The Board declined to reinstate the appeal or reopen the appeal based on the appellant's arguments concerning negligence of his representative.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A binding election assumes that if the election to proceed with an MSPB appeal (rather than an EEO complaint) was made by a representative, the representative was authorized to proceed on the appellant's behalf. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 474, 477 (1996) (the appellant did not sign the appeal or the designation of representative, took no action to pursue an MSPB appeal, and retained a different representative to pursue his EEO complaint).

<p class="Block-Quote1">When an appellant raises a claim of disability discrimination in connection with an otherwise appealable action, the Board generally has jurisdiction to decide both the discrimination issue and the appealable action. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1); <span class="Italic">Hardy v.

Potter</span>, EEOC Hearing No. 520-2008-00053X (May 30, 2008), a class complaint pending before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Specifically, the agency argued that the appellant fits the definition of a <span class="Italic">McConnell</span> class member,[5] the appellant cannot opt out of the class, and the appellant should therefore be deemed to have made a binding election to proceed with her claim through the equal employment opportunity (EEO) process rather than through the Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The EEOC administrative judge recommended defining the <span class="Italic">McConnell</span> class as "All permanent rehabilitation employees and limited duty employees at the Agency who have been subjected to the NRP from May 5, 2006 to the present, allegedly in violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973." <span class="Italic">McConnell</span>, EEOC Hearing No. 520-2008-00053X at 23.
