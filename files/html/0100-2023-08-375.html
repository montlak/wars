<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-367"><span class="space">e.</span> Consideration for Position but Nonselection; Limitation on Consideration Imposed by the Applicant</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board ordinarily lacks jurisdiction over a VEOA appeal when the agency did not make a selection for the contested position at the time of the DOL complaint, <span class="Italic">Graves v. Dept. of Navy,</span> SF-3330-10-0788-I-1 (NP 4/30/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Graves</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 491, the Board recently dismissed another of the appellant's VEOA appeals for lack of jurisdiction because he failed to exhaust his remedy before DOL, noting that the agency did not make a selection for the vacancy at issue until more than 3 months after the appellant had filed his DOL complaint. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 11, 14. The Board cited <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Department of the Army</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 656 (2011), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 445 F. App'x 347 (Fed. Cir. 2011), as clarifying that a DOL complaint's reference to a specific vacancy announcement, by itself, was insufficient to inform DOL of particular alleged veterans' preference violations. <span class="Italic">Graves</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 491, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12. It stated that, although the Board uses a liberal pleading standard for allegations of veterans' preference violations in a VEOA appeal, evidence of the exhaustion requirement is mandatory under the statute and is not subject to the same liberal construction. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 11. In doing so, it distinguished <span class="Italic">Becker v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 29 (2010). It stated that, although Becker's DOL complaint preceded agency memoranda notifying him of his nonselection for one vacancy and the cancellation of another, he may have already been aware that he would not have been selected for the positions because he knowingly failed to appear for a scheduled interview. It found that, in contrast, the appellant did not allege, and the record did not indicate, that he was aware when he filed his DOL complaint 1 day after the vacancy announcement closed that he would not be selected for the position. <span class="Italic">Graves</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 491, &#x00B6; 12 n.2. The Board also distinguished other decisions in which it had adjudicated cases that were prematurely filed. It found that the appellant did not exhaust his DOL remedy because he filed his DOL complaint before any nonselection or other alleged violation had occurred and DOL did not therefore have an opportunity to conduct an investigation that might have led to corrective action before involving the Board. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we find that the appellant has failed to exhaust his DOL remedy with respect to Vacancy Announcements NEOA-0675-04-GROOO883-DE and SWO-0675-08-PD709681-DE for the same reasons set forth in <span class="Italic">Graves</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 491. The first vacancy announcement did not close until June 22, 2010, i.e., 1 day after the appellant filed his DOL complaint; the appellant did not specifically apply under this announcement and the June 30, 2010 certificate for the vacancy did not contain his name; the agency did not make a selection until July 29, 2010; and the selectee was not appointed until August 30, 2010. The second vacancy announcement did not close until July 15, 2010, i.e., nearly a month after the appellant filed his DOL complaint; the appellant did not specifically apply under this announcement and the August 2, 2010 certificate for the vacancy did not contain his name; and the agency did not make selections until September 2, 2010. Thus, we dismiss the appellant's VEOA appeal concerning those two vacancy announcements for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An individual who is considered for but not selected for a position ordinarily would not have a VEOA case, assuming that applicable preferences were applied and that passover requirements were not violated. <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. MSPB</span>, 417 Fed. Appx. 964, 966-67 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP), explained the limitations on VEOA jurisdiction, and the inapplicability of the Veterans Preference Act as a source of jurisdiction, if the claim is nonselection:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction is not plenary, but is limited to actions made appealable to it by law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Roche v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> 828 F.2d 1555, 1557 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(1). When an individual appeals to the Board, he or she has the burden of proving--by a preponderance of the evidence, i.e., the degree of relevant evidence that a reasonable person, considering the record as a whole, would accept as sufficient to find that a contested fact is more likely to be true than untrue--that the board has jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2), (c)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2), 1201.4(q)] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Burroughs claims that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal under the VPA. The provisions of the VPA provide qualifying veterans various preferences in applying for and maintaining civil service positions within the competitive and excepted services. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108, 3308-3320; 5 <span id="Page_692"></span>C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 302.101-302.403. Eligibility for veterans' preferences is governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108, while the preferences that veterans are entitled to are articulated in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3308-3320.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Mr. Burroughs argues that Section 14 of the VPA, as originally enacted, provides the Board with jurisdiction over his claim. The original statutory language of Section 14 established a right of appeal to the Civil Service Commission--the predecessor of the Board--for adverse actions such as discharge, suspension for more than thirty days, furlough without pay, reduction in rank or compensation, and debarment from future employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 58 Stat. at 390. Notably, this provision did not include a right of appeal for non-selection, which is the type of claim Mr. Burroughs is attempting to bring before the Board.[2] Further, appealable adverse actions are currently set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 and do not include non-selections and other hiring issues.[3] <span class="Italic">Cf. Prewitt v. Merit Syst. Protection Bd.,</span> 133 F.3d 885, 886-87 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Therefore, the Board does not have jurisdiction under either the original statutory provision or 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, where appealable adverse actions are currently codified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Mr. Burroughs references the phrase "debarred for future appointment" as the basis of his claim. But "debarment" refers to a prohibition on hiring. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Peters v. Hobby,</span> 349 U.S. 331, 337 (1955); <span class="Italic">Powers v. United States,</span> 169 Ct. Cl. 626 (1965). We do not believe that non-selection for a given position constitutes being "debarred for future appointment" as that phrase was used in the VPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The first 168 words of Section 14 of the VPA were initially codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 863. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 863 (1952). The codification was subsequently moved to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, with certain definitions set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511, and enacted into positive law. Act of Sept. 6, 1966, Pub. L. No. 89-554, 80 Stat. 378, 528; <span class="Italic">see also</span> H.R. Rep. No. 89-901, at 133 (1965). The remainder of Section 14 of the VPA was codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3315 and 7701. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 89-901, at 217. Section 14 of the VPA, as originally enacted, was repealed. 80 Stat. at 632, 652; <span class="Italic">see also</span> H.R. Rep. No. 89-901, at 209, 217.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Burroughs cites the panel opinion in <span class="Italic">Noble v. Tennessee Valley Authority,</span> 876 F.2d 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1989), in support of his position that the Board had jurisdiction under the VPA. In <span class="Italic">Noble,</span> the petitioner filed an appeal to the Board alleging that the Tennessee Valley Authority illegally failed to recognize his reemployment rights under the VPA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1581. But on rehearing <span class="Italic">en banc</span>, this court held that the Board did not have jurisdiction over the appeal because the petitioner "cited no 'law, rule, or regulation' authorizing an appeal to the MSPB...and none exists." <span class="Italic">Noble v. Tenn. Valley Authority,</span> 892 F.2d 1013, 1015 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). Like the petitioner in Noble, Mr. Burroughs does not cite any law, rule, or regulation authorizing his appeal, and therefore he failed to carry the burden of proving that the Board may exercise jurisdiction over his claim.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Mr. Burroughs also directs the court's attention to a case in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, variously identified as <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. United States</span> or<span class="Italic"> Burroughs v. Hampton,</span> No. 106-71-N, in support of his claim that the Board has jurisdiction under the VPA. Mr. Burroughs does not provide a citation to a published opinion, and the court was unable to locate the case in the electronic databases to which the court has access. Because the case is apparently unpublished, Mr. Burroughs was required to submit a copy of the associated "opinion, order, judgment, or other written disposition" with his brief. Fed. R. App. P. 32.1(b). Instead, Mr. Burroughs submitted only a "Certificate of Settlement" from the General Accounting Office that references the case that he cited. The court nevertheless contacted the clerk's office in the Eastern District of Virginia, but we were unable to locate any records regarding the cited case. Regardless, because an unrelated district court case is in no way binding upon this court, we do not think that our inability to review Mr. Burroughs's previous case is of practical significance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court has consistently held that authority for the Board to entertain claims of veterans' preference violations stems from 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a, a provision of the VEOA.<span class="Italic"> Patterson v. Dep't of Interior,</span> 424 F.3d 1151, 1155 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Campion v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 326 F.3d 1210, 1213 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Lapuh v. Merit. Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 284 F.3d 1277, 1279 (Fed. Cir. 2002). However, Mr. Burroughs's appeal is expressly premised on the VPA, and we conclude that he failed to carry his burden of proving the Board has jurisdiction under that statute.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">A preliminary error in the process of consideration for a position does not rise to the level of a VEOA violation if the candidate is ultimately considered for the job, <span class="Italic">McMillon v. DOJ</span>, 637 Fed. Appx. 600, 602 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DEA's error in proceeding initially without Ms. McMillon on a Best Qualified List was, as determined by the Board, harmless, because the person initially selected declined the job, leaving it open for Ms. McMillon to compete. And compete she did, by having her application considered and receiving an interview for the job. On the record before us, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the Board's determination that Ms. McMillon's VEOA right to compete was not violated.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Williams v. Dept. of Navy</span>, DC-3330-16-0292-B-1 (NP 8/25/2022) (VEOA violation not established when the agency may have failed to state in the vacancy announcement that the job was being filled under the expedited hiring authority for DOD contracting positions; appellant was considered, but he was not selected); <span class="Italic">cf. Avery v.

The Board will review the method used by an agency to fill a vacancy to determine if it is authorized when the use of an unauthorized method could have denied covered individuals the right to compete.

<p class="Body-Text">An individual who does not apply for a position cannot ordinarily fault the agency under VEOA when he is not selected, <span class="Italic">Pecard v. USDA</span>, 495 Fed. Appx. 90, 92-93 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, Pecard contends that his VEOA rights were violated when the agency failed to consider him for the 0154 position at the GS-6 level, the position to which it appointed Garza. However, the Board found that because Pecard had not applied for the 0154 position at the GS-6 level, it was not error to fail to consider him for the job. We agree. Because Pecard's name did not appear on the GS-6 certificate of eligibles from which Garza was chosen, Pecard was not improperly denied consideration, and no basis exists for the claim that his VEOA rights were violated. Pecard has not alleged that the agency prevented him from applying for the 0154 position at the GS-6 level, nor is there any suggestion that the agency's practice of preparing multiple certificates was designed to circumvent VEOA protections.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Tuchawena v. DHHS</span>, DE-3330-13-0291-I-1 (NP 6/13/2014), explained that the applicant's limitation on the level of position that he will accept precludes a VEOA claim based on the agency's competitive selection of another individual at a lower grade level:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant reasserts his argument that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3318 and 3319. Specifically, the appellant argues that, because the agency placed him on the GS-12 certificate in the Best Qualified category, the agency was required to obtain pass over authority to hire nonveterans on the GS-11 certificate, and the agency failed to do so. The appellant also appears to argue, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the agency was required to merge the candidates for the GS-11 and GS-12 levels, and that the agency had no authority to issue a certificate for each grade level....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's argument that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights by hiring nonveterans from the GS-11 certificate, without obtaining pass over authority, has no merit. Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.403, candidates are referred "for consideration by simultaneously listing a candidate on all certificates for which the candidate is interested, eligible, and within reach," barring certain exceptions inapplicable here.[4] The HR Specialist who issued the certificates and ranked the applicants complied with this requirement when she issued the GS-11 certificate without listing the appellant's name, because he removed himself from consideration by explicitly informing the agency that GS-12 was the lowest grade level that he would accept.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;OPM's Delegated Examining Operations Handbook also states that, under the dual certification process, agencies are required to certify eligibles "for all positions from the lowest grade or salary he or she is willing to accept to the highest-grade level for which he or she is qualified."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant did not establish that the agency violated any right under a statute or regulation relating to his veterans' preference rights by hiring from the GS-11 certificate exclusively, without merging the GS-11 and GS-12 candidates. An agency has the discretion to fill a vacant position by any authorized method, and the agency decided to fill the vacancies at the GS-11 level using the category rating and selection system authorized for competitive service positions by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3319. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.102, &#x00A7; 337.301-.304; <span class="Italic">see generally Dean v. Consumer Product Safety Commission</span>, 548 F.3d 1370, 1373 (2008) (citation omitted). The agency's decision to leave the GS-12 level position unfilled is not contrary to law or regulation.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Steck v. Department of the Interior</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 105, &#x00B6; 4 (1999), the Board found that an agency did not violate an appellant's reemployment rights where the agency advertised a vacancy at the GS-5/7/9 levels, the appellant indicated that the lowest grade level he would accept was a GS-11, and the agency hired a GS-5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_693"></span>Although the appellant argues that the agency had no authority to issue separate certificates for the GS-11 and the GS-12 grade levels, he has not proven that the agency's action violated his statutory or regulatory veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">See Dale</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 646, &#x00B6; 10. According to OPM's Delegated Examining Operations Handbook, dual certification is the normal method used to fill positions listed at multiple grade levels in a job announcement. The appellant has not shown that the agency's use of the normal dual certification process to fill the announced vacancies or his non-inclusion on the GS-11 certificate violated his veterans' preference rights despite his cursory allegation that the agency "ignored or circumvented" VEOA.</p>
