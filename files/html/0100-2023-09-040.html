<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-39"><span class="space">b.</span> Misfiled Mixed Case Appeal</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">There are exceptions to the routine requirements for processing appeals. The statute governing processing of mixed case appeals (those involving EEO affirmative defenses), 5 USC 7702, provides for the treatment of cases inadvertently initiated with the wrong agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;In any case in which an employee is required to file any action, appeal, or petition under this section and the employee timely files the action, appeal, or petition with an agency other than the agency with which the action, appeal, or petition is to be filed, the employee shall be treated as having timely filed the action, appeal, or petition as of the date it is filed with the proper agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Dearsman v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 16 MSPR 631, 634 (1983), the employee was demoted and filed an EEO complaint. After 120 days, she filed a complaint in district court alleging discrimination and raising issues of civil service law relative to her demotion. The district court dismissed from the complaint those counts alleging violations of civil service laws, but retained jurisdiction over the EEO issues. The district judge referred the civil service issues to the MSPB, where no appeal had yet been filed. Appellant then filed a Board appeal, more than a year after the demotion. The agency moved to dismiss the appeal. When the complaint of discrimination was first filed, however, 5 CFR 1201.154 then required that a Board appeal be filed either within 20 days after receipt of the agency resolution or final decision on the EEO case or, if no final decision was reached within 120 days after the EEO complaint was filed, not more than a year after the EEO complaint was filed. The appellant relied upon 5 USC 7702(f).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Determining that conscious election of a forum is not good cause for extending the time period for filing a Board appeal, the Board nevertheless concluded in <span class="Italic">Dearsman</span> that the AJ incorrectly dismissed the appeal as untimely. The <span id="Page_912"></span>Board observed that: (1) the district court appeared to want the civil service issues adjudicated; (2) the appeal had been filed promptly after the district court decision; (3) the statutory and regulatory provisions regarding choice of forum and governing time frames in mixed cases presented numerous difficult questions; (4) the agency faced no apparent prejudice; and (5) further delay required more judicial review or litigation, a result contrary to "the spirit of the Reform Act which admonishes the Board to decide such matters on their merits." <span class="Italic">Dearsman, supra,</span> 16 MSPR at 636. But <span class="Italic">Banks v. USPS</span>, DA-3443-15-0255-I-1 (NP 9/29/2016), reached a different result based on a clear notice of election of remedies in the agency's final EEO decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That the appellant filed a civil action in the U.S. district court about the same time that an appeal to the Board was due does not demonstrate good cause for his untimely filing with the Board. In <span class="Italic">Dearsman v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 16 M.S.P.R. 631 (1983), the Board acceded to the finding in the initial decision that the appellant showed good cause for his untimely Board appeal where he filed an action in U.S. district court challenging the agency action before filing a Board appeal. In so ruling, the Board considered the "potentially confusing procedures" for mixed-case appeals under the Civil Service Reform Act and relied in part on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(f), which provides that an appeal filed with the wrong "agency" shall be treated as filed with the correct agency. <span class="Italic">Dearsman</span>, 16 M.S.P.R. at 635-36. The Board added the following caveat to its decision: "We stress prospectively, however, that conscious election of forum will not be interpreted to constitute 'good cause' for waiver of our time limitations...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In <span class="Italic">Buckser v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 274 (1990), the Board held that a U.S. district court is not an "agency" within the meaning of section 7702(f) and that filing with the court did not excuse untimely filing with the Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 278-79.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's final decision on the appellant's formal discrimination complaint accurately informed the appellant of his options of filing a Board appeal or filing an action in U.S. district court. Thus, we find that the appellant made a conscious election of forum when he filed his action in court, and he has not established good cause for the untimely filing of his Board appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An otherwise timely appeal to the EEOC rather than to the Board was excused for an appellant who was challenging an arbitration decision and who made an error in the filing rather than a conscious election of a different forum. There was no evidence of a conscious election of EEOC: actual notice that the appeal should be filed with the Board was not given to the appellant by the arbitrator, the record did not reflect that the appellant knew that the appeal had to be filed with the Board. <span class="Italic">Marenus v. DHHS</span>, 39 MSPR 498, 502-04 (1989). <span class="Italic">But cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Cosio v. DOJ</span>, 60 MSPR 675, 677-78 (1994) (late appeal to the Board from an arbitration award was not excused by appellant's contact the with FLRA; she did not file a request for review with the Authority; her contact with the FLRA was not alleged to have been within the deadline for filing with the Board), <span class="Italic">rev'd,</span> <span class="Italic">Cosio v. MSPB</span>, 36 F.3d 1116 (Fed. Cir. 1994) ("However, a relevant document, viz., the Master Agreement between the union and the agency, did provide, albeit erroneously, that review could be had by filing within thirty-five days at the FLRA. Cosio did file her petition within that thirty-five day period at the proper tribunal, the board. We fail to see why a timely filing made in reasonable reliance on and in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement, albeit not within the board's regulations, does not satisfy the good cause standard.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Macias v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 54 MSPR 335, 336-37 (1992), provides an example of how the Board dealt with a mixed case appeal misdirected to the EEOC:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective October 21, 1988, the agency terminated the appellant's employment as a WG-6 Warehouse Worker (Forklift Operator), allegedly during his probationary period, for unsatisfactory performance and conduct. He filed an equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint with the agency regarding his termination, alleging discrimination based upon national origin (Hispanic) and sex (male).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency issued a final EEO decision on October 7, 1991, finding no discrimination. That decision also found that the appellant had completed his one-year probationary period prior to his removal. It also advised the appellant that an appeal could be filed with the Board, not the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), within 20 days of receipt of the decision. The appellant filed an appeal with the EEOC anyhow on October 17, 1991, and then filed his appeal with the Board on November 2, 1991.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial decision, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal as untimely filed. He found that the final agency EEO decision clearly and unambiguously advised the appellant of the correct time limit for filing an appeal with the Board, and that the appeal was not to be filed with the EEOC. The administrative judge found that the appellant's conscious election to pursue the matter with the EEOC did not invoke the provisions of 5 USC 7702(f) and did not establish good cause for waiver of the time limit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant reiterates his argument that the appeal was timely filed with the EEOC. He asserts that, although the agency advised him to file with the Board, he believed that he was terminated during his probationary period and the Board does not have jurisdiction over a termination of a probationary employee. He states that he had nothing other than the statement in the final agency decision to show that his probationary period had been completed. The appellant claims that, because of the uncertainty of Board jurisdiction and the confusion regarding his probationary status, his filing the appeal with the EEOC was not a conscious election of forum and 5 USC 7702(f) is therefore applicable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a general rule, initiating an action in another forum does not excuse a late filing with the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Grasty v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 438, 441 (1986); <span class="Italic">Shrider v. USPS</span>, 26 MSPR 238, 240 (1985). In "mixed cases," however, 5 USC 7702(f) requires the Board to consider timely a petition filed on time but with an agency other than the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Collett v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 38 MSPR 128, 130 (1988), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 868 F.2d 1278 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table); <span class="Italic">Dearsman v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 16 MSPR 631, 636 (1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his appeal to the Board, the appellant asserted that a probationary employee does not have appeal rights to the Board, and that he, his representative, and officials at Kelly Air Force Base were all uncertain as to where the appeal should be filed. We note that the appellant's confusion over where jurisdiction would lie is understandable in light of the agency's conflicting characterizations of his probationary status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, under these circumstances, that the appellant did not make a conscious election by timely filing his appeal with the EEOC rather than the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marenus v. DHHS</span>, 39 MSPR 498, 503 (1989); <span class="Italic">Collett</span>, 38 MSPR at 130; <span class="Italic">Dearsman</span>, 16 MSPR at 636. Rather he filed with EEOC by mistake. Thus, we conclude that the administrative judge erred in finding that section 7702(f) was not applicable. Because the appellant timely filed his appeal with the EEOC, it is timely filed with the Board under 5 USC 7702(f).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board excused a belated filing that was initiated with an agency EEO office that lacked jurisdiction to consider the discrimination allegations raised by the appellant, <span class="Italic">Livingstone v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 66 MSPR 36, 38-40 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's removal became effective on December 11, 1993. At that time, Board regulations required a petition for appeal to be filed within 20 days of the effective date of the action appealed. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.22(b) (1994). December 31, the twentieth day after December 11, was a federal holiday. By operation of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.23, the petition for appeal was due on January 3, 1994, the next business day. The appellant filed his appeal with the agency EEO office on December 28, 1993. He did not file his appeal with the Board until January 31, 1994.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged in his petition for appeal that the agency, in removing him, discriminated against him because he is not married and he has long hair. If either form of discrimination came within the coverage of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(B), the appellant's December 28, 1993 submission to the agency EEO office, made less than 20 days from the effective date of his removal, would be deemed a timely filing with the Board. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(f); <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 987 F.2d 1552 (Fed. Cir. 1993). [1] Neither marital status discrimination nor discrimination based on hair length is expressly prohibited under any of the authorities listed in section 7702(a)(1)(B), however. Further, although one of those authorities, i.e., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, prohibits sex discrimination, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16, discrimination against an unmarried person constitutes discrimination on the basis of sex only if the employer treats unmarried members of one sex differently than unmarried members of the other sex, <span class="Italic">see Jurinko v. Edwin L. Wiegand Co</span>., 477 F.2d 1038, 1044 (3d Cir.), <span class="Italic">vacated on other grounds</span>, 414 U.S. 970, 94 S. Ct. 293, 38 L. Ed.2d 214 (1973). The appellant has not alleged that the agency treated unmarried men differently than unmarried women. Finally, we note that discrimination based on hair length also does not constitute sex discrimination prohibited under Title VII. <span class="Italic">Willingham v. Macon Telegraph Publishing Co</span>., 507 F.2d 1084, 1088-93 (5th Cir. 1975). Thus, the administrative judge correctly found that the petition for appeal cannot be considered timely under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(f) because the appellant does not allege a form of discrimination covered by that provision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Section 7702(a)(1)(B) covers claims of discrimination prohibited under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16; section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 USC &#x00A7; 206(d); section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 USC &#x00A7; 791; sections 12 and 15 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 631, 633a; and any rule, regulation, or policy directive issued pursuant to these laws.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Again, the petition for appeal was due to be filed no later than January 3, 1994; it was not filed until January 31, 1994. The burden is on the appellant to show good cause for his untimely filing, by 28 days, <span class="Italic">see Alonzo v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 4 MSPB 262, 4 MSPR 180, 184 (1980), and he has not directly addressed the issue in his submissions to the Board. Still, as explained below, the undisputed evidence of record is sufficient for us to conclude that the filing deadline should be waived.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that the appellant submitted an appeal to the agency EEO office within 20 days of his removal would excuse his untimely Board filing, if <span id="Page_913"></span>he "filed with the Board as soon as he learned of his mistake." <span class="Italic">Sanford v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 61 MSPR 207, 210 (1994). On January 11, 1994, the agency EEO office mailed the appellant's submission back to him. The appellant does not say when he received the EEO office's mailing, but it can be presumed that he received it on January 18, 1994, the first business day within five days of January 11. Cf. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.4(l). Our <span class="Italic">Sanford</span> decision did not state specifically what constituted filing "as soon as" the filing party learned that he had misdirected his appeal. Without setting a bright-line rule, we conclude that, under the circumstances, the 13-day delay between the presumptive date that the appellant received the agency EEO office's mailing and his filing with the Board constituted filing "as soon as he learned of his mistake" under <span class="Italic">Sanford</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching this conclusion, we have considered that, shortly after this appeal was filed, the Board amended its regulation to provide a 30-day time limit for filing an appeal such as this one (which challenges an action that carried an express effective date). <span class="Italic">See</span> 59 Fed. Reg. 31,109 (1994) (amending 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)). If the amended regulation had been in effect when the appellant filed this appeal, and if the filing deadline were computed under the method the administrative judge explained as most favorable to the appellant, that is, assuming that the filing period stopped running when the appellant mailed his appeal to the agency EEO office on December 28, and did not begin to run again until he received the mailing from the EEO office on January 18--then the appeal would have been timely filed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Williams v. USPS</span>, 115 MSPR 318, 2010 MSPB 237, 321-32 &#x00B6; 10 (2010), directed processing of an appeal that began when the appellant was removed, sought to tack his removal onto a previously-filed EEO complaint, received an agency final decision on the EEO case that told him he should file his removal case with the Board, but then again filed his removal case with EEOC. After EEOC dismissed the matter based on the determination that the proper forum was MSPB, Williams filed with the Board. The Board, following dismissal of the appeal as untimely by the AJ because of the delay in the EEO system, remanded the appeal with the explanation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(f), it must consider timely an appeal in a mixed case that was filed on time but with an agency other than the Board. <span class="Italic">Brent v. Department of Justice,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 586, &#x00B6; 7 (2005), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 213 Fed. Appx. 993 (Fed. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">Wood v. Department of Defense,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 104, 106 (1996). Thus, under the circumstances of this case, we find that the appellant's submission of his appeal to the OFO on December 15, 2008 must be considered a timely filing with the Board of an appeal from the November 18, 2008 FAD. Thus, we reverse the initial decision finding the appeal untimely filed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Young v. USPS</span>, CH-0752-13-2103-I-1 (NP 6/6/2014) (appeal remanded to MSPB AJ when the appellant, following the issuance of a FAD telling him to appeal to MSPB, filed an appeal with EEOC OFO instead and EEOC then rejected the appeal because it should have gone to MSPB); <span class="Italic">Myvett v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">McGovern v. VA</span>, PH-0752-16-0455-I-1 (3/29/2023), declined to excuse a belated Board appeal under 5 USC 7702(f):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, the appellant argues that she erroneously filed her appeal with the Board--rather than with the EEOC--and that the Board therefore should remand her appeal for "review in light of 5 U.S.C. [&#x00A7;] 7702(f)." Section 7702(f) provides that, when "an employee is required to file any action, appeal, or petition under this section and the employee timely files the action, appeal, or petition with an agency other than the agency with which the action, appeal, or petition is to be filed, the employee shall be treated as having timely filed the action, appeal, or petition as of the date it is filed with the proper agency." The appellant appears to argue that, pursuant to this section, the Board should remand her appeal to the administrative judge for a determination that her appeal be deemed timely filed with the proper agency--the EEOC. However, the appellant filed her appeal with the Board--not with an agency other than the Board--and that appeal was deemed timely filed. Under these circumstances, section 7702(f) is inapplicable to the Board's processing of her appeal, and the Board is without authority to direct the EEOC's processing of her appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Early Board cases rejected as untimely appeals misdirected to offices of agency-employers. <span class="Italic">Phipps v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 45 MSPR 375, 379 (1990), <span class="Italic">overruled in part</span>, <span class="Italic">Sanford v. DOD</span>, 61 MSPR 207, 210 (1994); <span class="Italic">Miller v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit considered the Board's analysis in <span class="Italic">Miller</span> tenuous--too tenuous to survive review--in <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of Army</span>, 987 F.2d 1552, 1554-55 (Fed. Cir. 1993). The court rejected the Board's reasoning that the statute distinguishes between an appellant who is confused concerning filing options and an appellant who is not confused but who inadvertently sends the appeal to the wrong destination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7702, Title 5 of the United States Code, applies to cases involving any personnel action that is appealable to the Board by a federal employee who alleges that a basis for the action was unlawful discrimination. Under the statutory procedures established for such mixed cases, an aggrieved employee may either file an appeal with the Board, 5 USC 7702(a)(1) (1988), or seek relief from the agency involved, 5 USC 7702(a)(2) (1988). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Spears v. MSPB</span>, 766 F.2d 520, 523 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In deciding that section 7702(f) was not applicable to Ms. Miller's appeals, the Board too narrowly interpreted the statute's terms and severely restricted its scope by focusing on the cause of the employee's mistaken filing. The Board construed the provision as covering only an employee who had an intent to initiate an adjudication with the wrong agency under the mistaken belief that it was the proper forum to decide his or her case. Thus, according to the Board, an employee must have been legitimately mistaken or confused as to where to file his or her appeal in order for section 7702(f) to be applicable. Under that construction, mistaken filing as the result of inadvertent error, as in the instant case, falls outside the scope of the statute. We do not read the statute so narrowly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first step in interpreting a statute is to look to its language. <span class="Italic">MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. United States</span>, 878 F.2d 362, 365 (Fed. Cir. 1989). It is a long-standing rule of statutory construction that courts must treat the plain language of a statute as controlling absent clear legislative intent to the contrary....&#8197;Section 7702(f) is written broadly and its meaning is plain and straightforward: when an employee files his or her mixed-case appeal in a timely manner, but with the wrong agency, the proper agency must treat the appeal as having been timely filed there. Thus, the statute clearly mandates that the Board excuse a failure to file an appeal within the specified period when an appellant timely files it with another agency, irrespective of the cause for the error. Noticeably absent from the statutory language is any requirement that there be a specific reason (e.g., confusion or inadvertence) for an appeal having been initially filed with the wrong agency. All that is required to invoke section 7702(f) is that an appeal be timely filed with the wrong agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are unpersuaded by the "legislative history" upon which the government relies in support of its position. Although we agree with the government that nothing in the legislative history of section 7702(f) suggests that the provision was enacted to excuse simple negligence of an employee or his or her agent, neither does it suggest that the provision only applies where an employee was confused as to where to file his or her appeal. We find nothing in the sparse legislative history of section 7702(f) which causes us to conclude that the application of the statute as written will produce a result "demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters." <span class="Italic">Demarest v. Manspeaker</span>, 498 U.S. 184, 190, 111 S. Ct. 599, 604, 112 L. Ed.2d 608 (1991) (citation omitted). Moreover, "where, as here, the statute's language is plain, 'the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.' The language before us expresses Congress' intent...with sufficient precision so that reference to legislative history...is hardly necessary." <span class="Italic">United States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc.</span>, 489 U.S. 235, 241, 109 S. Ct. 1026, 1030, 103 L. Ed.2d 290 (1989) (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed.2d 694 (1984), argues that we should accord "great deference" to the Board's interpretation of the statutory provisions of section 7702(f). We disagree. The rule of deference enunciated in <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> is limited to situations in which statutory language has "left a gap" or is ambiguous. <span class="Italic">Glaxo Operations UK Ltd. v. Quigg</span>, 894 F.2d 392 (Fed. Cir. 1990). In section 7702(f), Congress left no gap and its intent is unambiguously manifested by clear language.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we hold that under section 7702(f), the Board was obligated to treat Ms. Miller's appeals as timely filed as a matter of law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Whittington v. MSPB</span>, 80 F.3d 471, 474-75 (Fed. Cir. 1996), reaffirmed <span class="Italic">Miller</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding Ms. Whittington untimely filed her appeal on November 23, 1994, the Board erred as a matter of law by failing to consider 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(f), the statutory savings provision for erroneous filings in mixed cases....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...This court has interpreted the statute broadly, stating that "irrespective of the cause for error...[a]ll that is required to invoke section 7702(f) is that an appeal be timely filed with the wrong agency." <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 987 F.2d at 1555. Therefore, if Ms. Whittington erroneously filed her appeal with EEOC within the time limit for filing with the Board, her appeal is considered timely filed with the Board. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 57 <span id="Page_914"></span>MSPR 203, 208 (1993) (An appeal of an arbitrator's sustaining an agency's removal of an employee "was timely filed with the Board as of the date it was timely, albeit mistakenly, filed with the EEOC."); <span class="Italic">see also, Means v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 60 MSPR 108, 111-12 (1993) (Good cause exists for waiving filing deadline where appeal was erroneously filed with EEOC, notwithstanding employee's failing to establish the appeal was filed with EEOC within the time limit for filing with the Board). Therefore, on remand, the Board should consider the timeliness of Ms. Whittington's appeal based on this statutory savings provision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit's <span class="Italic">Miller</span> decision is followed by the Board. If an appeal contains an allegation of discrimination and the employee timely appeals to the wrong agency, the employee shall be treated as having timely filed the appeal with the Board (once the appeal is actually submitted to the Board). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 71 MSPR 315, 317 (1996) (mixed case was timely filed when it was misdirected to the appellant's employer rather than to the Board). <span class="Italic">Miller</span> was controlling in <span class="Italic">Fuery v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 58 MSPR 111, 112-13 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In dismissing the appeal as untimely, the administrative judge relied on two Board decisions finding that an appeal which has been misdirected to the employing agency has not been filed within the meaning of the Board's regulations, and that the mistake in mailing does not establish good cause for an untimely filed appeal<span class="Italic">. See Miller v.</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of the Army</span>, 53 MSPR 471, 475 (1992); <span class="Italic">Phipps v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 45 MSPR 375, 379 (1990). Subsequent to the issuance of the initial decision, however, our reviewing court reversed the Miller decision. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 987 F.2d 1552, 1555-56 (Fed. Cir. 1993). In so ruling, the court relied on the language of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(f), applicable to mixed case appeals, which provides that where an employee timely files an appeal with the wrong agency, the employee shall be treated as having timely filed the appeal with the correct agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 987 F.2d at 1554-56.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged in his petition for appeal that he was the victim of race discrimination. This action is therefore a mixed case appeal, and the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Miller</span> is controlling. Because the appellant established that he filed his appeal with the agency within the Board's 20-day filing deadline, we find that the appeal was timely filed. Accordingly, we remand the case to the regional office for adjudication on the merits.</p>
