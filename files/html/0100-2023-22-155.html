<p class="Body-Text">The AJ is in the best position to evaluate attorney fee requests. <span class="Italic">Sowa v. VA</span>, 96 MSPR 408, 414 &#x00B6; 11 (2004). The reasonableness of requested fees is primarily determined by a review of the customary billing rate under a particular set of circumstances and the number of hours devoted to the case. Fair standards of efficiency and economy of time are imposed upon counsel. AJs are charged with the responsibility of scrutinizing hours and rates claimed by counsel and of cutting hours for duplication, padding, or frivolous claims. They may make necessary, reasonable adjustments in hours, rates, or fees, providing that they explain their rationale. <span class="Italic">Gubino v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 85 MSPR 518, 521-23 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-12 (2000) (AJ properly reduced the hours for the preparation and prosecution of an unsuccessful motion to disqualify an agency representative and for a motion for interlocutory appeal from the denial of a disqualification motion); <span class="Italic">Snyder v. DOJ</span>, 26 MSPR 324, 328-29 (1985) ("The Board has held that the reasonableness of requested fees is primarily determined by a review of the customary billing rate under a particular set of circumstances, and the number of hours devoted to the case, while imposing fair standards of efficiency and economy of time upon the moving counsel." AJs may make "any necessary and reasonable adjustments in claimed hours, billing rates, or fees, providing that they fully explain such adjustments in their addendum decision and their rationale for so doing."). [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-22-205.html#sec15-203">Obligation of Judge to Ensure Due Process</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-22-157.html#sec15-156">Notice to Counsel of Defect in Fee Motion</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The reasonableness of attorney fees is primarily determined by a review of counsel's customary billing rate and the number of hours devoted by the attorney to the appeal with an "eye toward imposing fair standards of efficiency and economy upon the attorney." The AJ who decided the appeal on the merits is in the best position to evaluate both the documentation submitted by counsel to determine whether the amount requested is reasonable and the quality of the representation afforded by counsel. <span class="Italic">Manley v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 67 MSPR 467, 474 (1995); <span class="Italic">Wiatr v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 50 MSPR 441, 447 (1991) (AJ was familiar with the documentary record as well as the quality and efficiency of representation). The Board qualified, or abandoned, its "best position" analysis, however, in <span class="Italic">Gubino v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 85 MSPR 518, 529 &#x00B6; 26 (2000), concerning the disposition of fee motions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge who decided the case on the merits is in the best position to evaluate the evidence submitted by counsel to determine the quality of representation and whether the amount requested was reasonable, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hodnick v. Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service,</span> 8 MSPB 182, 8 MSPR 508, 511-12 (1981), such deference is not required when the request at issue relates to "a fee motion, as to which no hearing was held...." <span class="Italic">See Howard v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 79 MSPR 172, 174-75 (1998)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At least as to its own judges, the Federal Circuit observed in <span class="Italic">State Indus., Inc. v. Mor-Flo Indus., Inc</span>., 948 F.2d 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1991), that "[j]udges have experience in determining what are reasonable hours and reasonable fees for the work lawyers perform and may rely on that experience to set an award." <span class="Italic">Beall v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 68 MSPR 231, 234 (1995), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The administrative judge who adjudicated the case on the merits is in the best position to determine whether the number of hours expended on the case is reasonable in light of the quality of representation provided by counsel and the complexity of the case. <span class="Italic">See Heath v. Department of Transportation</span>, 66 MSPR 101, 106 (1995); <span class="Italic">Sprenger v. Department of Interior</span>, 34 MSPR 664, 669 (1987). Absent a specific showing here that the administrative judge's evaluation was incorrect, we will not second-guess it. The fact that the appeal settled before hearing does not require a different result. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">D'Iorio v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 43 MSPR 531 (1990) (appellant's counsel was entitled to a fee award based on 254 hours of work in a case that settled before the hearing).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Yet in <span class="Italic">Wilson v. DHHS</span>, 834 F.2d 1011, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 1987), the court explained to the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The other of petitioner's specific grievances is that, though the attorney claimed eight hours for preparation of the fee motion, the presiding official allowed only five hours. Apparently the main objection was that counsel borrowed from other briefs on fees before the Board. Here, too, we hold the presiding official's conclusory holding to be unwarranted. The attorney represented that in fact he spent eight hours, and the presiding official could not properly determine that use of an earlier brief would so reasonably shorten that period that three hours of the time claimed was excessive. Without more detail than the initial decision gives we cannot upset the attorney's representation that he actually and reasonably spent eight hours.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not say that an administrative judge, who heard the case on the merits, cannot properly use her experience in evaluating fee requests, but here the particular request related to the fee motion (as to which no hearing was held) and the reasons given for the reduction verge on nit-picking.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore set aside the reduction and award fees for the full eight hours.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board, through its deference to its AJs, occasionally allows fee-cutting based more on intuition than analysis, <span class="Italic">Sailor-Nimocks v. OPM</span>, 66 MSPR 438, 443-44 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The administrative judge who decided the case on the merits is in the best position to evaluate the reasonableness of the hours requested. <span class="Italic">See Sprenger v. Department of the Interior</span>, 34 MSPR 664, 669 (1987). Here, the administrative judge correctly noted that the appellant's attorney had three years of experience practicing Federal sector labor law, that the legal issue involved was not complex, and that the orders the administrative judge furnished to the appellant at the start of her appeal set forth the <span id="Page_4701"></span>majority of the substantive legal principles and procedures necessary to successfully prosecute this type of appeal. Therefore, the appellant's counsel has not shown that the number of hours claimed for legal research was reasonable, or that the administrative judge's determination should be set aside. <span class="Italic">See Crumbaker v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 781 F.2d 191, 195 (Fed. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">modified</span>, 827 F.2d 761 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Wise v.

<p class="Body-Text">As long as the AJ provides what the Board considers to be a fair evaluation of the evidence before her, the AJ's decision on the reasonableness of time invested in the appeal will likely receive deference from the Board, <span class="Italic">Heath v.

By essentially disregarding the appellant's fee petition and supporting documentation, and instead conducting his own assessment of the amount of work performed by the attorney on the appellant's behalf based only on the documentation in the record, the administrative judge improperly analyzed this issue, and we vacate his analysis in this regard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reversing reduction of fees for time spent in document preparation, <span class="Italic">Howard v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 673 Fed. Appx. 987, 990-91 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP), observed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Some documents are short because they contain little content; others are short because the author has taken the time and effort necessary to concisely convey the complex ideas therein. The Board has broad discretion to determine that an attorney of Mr. White's experience spent an unreasonable amount of time preparing a document, but the document's length, on its own, cannot be the Board's only explanation for doing so. There must be some nexus between the time spent preparing a document and the content of that document.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board will reduce the amount of fees claimed if the record does not show that the expenditure of the claimed hours was necessary. Hours may be reduced if the numbers claimed are not outrageous or unprecedented, but there is insufficient evidence to establish that the numbers are reasonable. <span class="Italic">Rose v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 47 MSPR 5, 13-14 (1991) (finding arbitrary, however, the AJ's reduction by 2/3 of claimed time for some duplicative work). The appellant will not be penalized for inaction by the agency. If the agency could, but does not, timely notify appellant's counsel of significant developments in an appeal that would reduce the amount of time being invested by counsel, the agency will not be heard to object that the time invested by appellant's counsel is excessive. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wilson v. USPS</span>, 58 MSPR 653, 658-59 (1993).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board noted in <span class="Italic">Losure v. ICC</span>, 18 MSPR 388, 393 (1983), that the amount of time actually spent in litigation is not necessarily the amount of time reasonably spent. Of the 94.9 hours of work by law clerks on the PFR, the Board disallowed 20 hours as excessive. Additional hours were cut from the time claimed for preparing a submission to the Board on the issue of the timeliness of the fee petition. Time was reduced from about 12 hours to 6 hours for responding to the agency PFR on the fee petition. The Board did not find that the presence of two attorneys at the hearing was duplicative based only on flat assertions by OPM that it was unnecessary. It would not refuse to award fees for the hearing hours claimed by one senior and one junior counsel in a relatively complex case involving RIF regulations. The Board cautioned that it would not necessarily be appropriate in every case to award compensation for the presence of more than one attorney at the hearing. The total fee awarded was $17,247, reduced from $20,296 awarded by the AJ. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wilson v. DHHS</span>, 834 F.2d 1011 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">Time was reduced in <span class="Italic">Sowa v. VA</span>, 96 MSPR 408, 415 &#x00B6; 13 (2004), for what the Board characterized as "padding and inefficient work":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find no reason to disturb the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's counsel padded hours. The administrative judge found that counsel was inefficient and padded his fee request by billing an unreasonable number of hours, most of which were worked after he knew that his client would likely prevail and the agency would pay his fees. The administrative judge added that, even though counsel was a "newcomer" to employment litigation, justifying discounting his hourly rate, hours claimed were still excessive. The administrative judge further found that the total amount of fees claimed was far out of proportion to the degree of success and that he remained "convinced that [counsel's] total hours were padded." Finally, the administrative judge noted that, during discovery, counsel engaged in "contumacious misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice" and that, despite warnings, counsel "persistently violated orders designed to streamline the discovery process," thereby wasting time. We find that the administrative judge was in the best position to evaluate the quality of the appellant's counsel, that he imposed fair standards of efficiency and economy of time in assessing the reasonableness of the fee request, and that he properly cut requested hours for padding and inefficient work<span class="Italic">. See Gensburg</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 198 &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">Casali v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 347 &#x00B6; 19 (1999).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board admonished in <span class="Italic">Gibson v. DOJ</span>, 12 MSPR 436, 443, 11 MSPB 78 (1982), that the AJ is to scrutinize with due care the hours claimed by counsel. Without any explanation as to how it arrived at its decision, the Board disallowed approximately 33 hours of briefing time as "clearly excessive." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Logan v. DHUD</span>, 23 MSPR 345, 350 (1984) (allowing 25 of the 75 hours claimed for the preparation of a 44-page closing brief).

See Crumbaker</span>, 781 F.2d at 195. An attorney fee request is to be reduced as necessary to disallow hours for duplication or padding<span class="Italic">. Foley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 59 MSPR 413, 423 (1993). Thus, the amount of fees claimed is to be reduced where the record does not show that the expenditure of the claimed hours was necessary<span class="Italic">. Wright v.

An administrative judge may not, however, reduce claimed hours without first providing the attorneys with an opportunity to address any deficiencies found in their billing statements<span class="Italic">. See Wilson v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 834 F.2d 1011, 1012-13 (Fed. Cir. 1987).

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Driscoll v. USPS</span>, 116 MSPR 662, 670 &#x00B6; 14, 2011 MSPB 80 (2011), restored time spent by counsel obtaining testimony of a witness, even though that testimony was limited by the AJ:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Nor is a reduction warranted on the grounds that the administrative judge did not permit the full range of proffered testimony. The Board has disallowed as unnecessary time spent preparing for the examination <span id="Page_4702"></span>of witnesses who were not approved and did not testify at the hearing. <span class="Italic">See Freeman</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 132. Juszczak did testify, however, and it is unremarkable that an administrative judge would exercise her broad discretion to limit the examination of a witness. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Box v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 401, 405 n.2 (1991). To reduce the claimed hours under these circumstances would "verge on nit-picking." <span class="Italic">See Wilson</span>, 834 F.2d at 1013. Accordingly, we restore the 5.95 hours to the lodestar.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Driscoll</span> went on to grant other hours disallowed by the AJ, 116 MSPR at 670-72 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-19:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We discern no error in the administrative judge's decision to disallow 3.5 hours relating to a motion filed by Goffney to compel production of a paper copy of the agency file. At the time Goffney filed the motion and a supplement thereto, the agency had provided him with only a compact disc containing an electronic version of the file, which he was unable to open. The agency had also failed to serve a copy of the paper file on the appellant's former representative. The agency had, however, served a copy of the paper file on the appellant herself. Because Goffney already had, or should have had, access to the paper file, the time devoted to filing a motion to compel its production was unnecessary and therefore not compensable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also challenges the disallowance of 3.6 hours spent opposing the agency's motion to accept its late-filed petition for review. For purposes of the initial lodestar calculation, we agree. We note that in <span class="Italic">Meadows v. Department of the Navy</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 463 (1995), a case before the Board on the agency's petition for review of an addendum initial decision awarding attorney fees, the Board awarded additional attorney fees for time spent responding to the agency's petition, which was denied, but deducted an hour because the appellant did not succeed in her motion to dismiss the agency's petition as untimely filed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 465 (citing <span class="Italic">Boese v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 784 F.2d 388, 391 (Fed. Cir. 1986)). Such a reduction, however, would not take place until the second stage of the <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> analysis. At this stage, the question is whether the hours spent opposing the agency's motion were reasonably spent, without regard to the appellant's success or failure on that particular issue. Again, the administrative judge did not find that the 3.6 claimed hours were unreasonable <span class="Italic">per se</span>. Accordingly, we restore those hours to the lodestar.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further contends that the administrative judge erred in disallowing 25 hours claimed for "status memoranda" emails and "consultations" during the initial appeal and petition for review proceedings. We agree in part. First, the administrative judge's finding that the hours "appear to be excessive and reflect padding" is conclusory and does not constitute an adequate justification for their elimination. <span class="Italic">See Crumbaker</span>, 781 F.2d at 195 (the Board's remark that "the record suggests duplicative effort" was "wholly inadequate" under the required standard). Furthermore, the appellant has now offered some justification for the hours on petition for review:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[The 25 hours disallowed] included time expended by counsel to regularly apprise and consult with Appellant regarding various legal theories, strategies, responses and approaches to be taken during the course of prosecuting her appeal. Rather than utilizing near-daily phone conversations or office visits, Appellant and her counsel utilize[d] email extensively for most communication purposes. Counsel, as well as Appellant, chose the use of frequent written status reports and found such use invaluable as a means to collaboratively prosecute the appeal in an organized manner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held keeping a client informed of the status of her case is a legitimate activity related to the appeal. <span class="Italic">Ruble v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 44, &#x00B6; 12 (2004); <span class="Italic">Hooks v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 225, 228-29 (1989). Time reasonably spent on email communication as an alternative to in-person or phone consultation may also be compensable. <span class="Italic">Cf. Diehl v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 104, &#x00B6; 16 (2001) (allowing time spent by an attorney writing cover notes to the appellant "about matters relevant to the handling of the case" which "could have been put into a formal letter, which would have been much more time consuming and costly to prepare"). Based on the appellant's explanation, we find that she is entitled to fees for time reasonably spent on email status reports and consultations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The frequency of these activities and the hours charged, however, are excessive on their face. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hooks</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. at 229 (allowing 2 hours for telephone conversations with the appellant concerning the status of the appeal, which occurred at intervals of several months). The appellant implicitly concedes that additional documentation would be needed to support the full extent of the claimed hours, stating that "[p]roof of the necessary use of extensive email status reports and consultations can be shown, if requested, by an email index of the dates of all such communications." The appellant did not provide such evidence in her petition for review, however, and she has given no explanation for her failure to do so. In the absence of documentation that would justify an expenditure of 25 hours on status reports and consultations, we find it appropriate to restore 2 of the claimed hours to the lodestar. <span class="Italic">See Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 433 ("Where the documentation of hours is inadequate, the district court may reduce the award accordingly."); <span class="Italic">Hooks</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. at 229.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, as discussed above, we have reversed the administrative judge's finding that the appellant lacked prevailing party status with respect to her own cross-petition for review. Consequently, time reasonably spent in connection with that pleading should not on that account be excluded from the lodestar. Based on our review of the billing statement and the pleadings relating to the appellant's cross-petition, we find that Goffney reasonably spent 31.95 hours on the cross-petition and related motions on the following dates: March 26, May 5, June 26, June 28-30, and July 1-2, 2008. Accordingly, we include those hours in the lodestar calculation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Shoemaker v. DHHS</span>, 21 MSPR 14, 16 (1984), reversed the decision of an AJ to cut time back from 7.8 to four hours for interviewing witnesses and filing the appeal. The agency had not opposed the fee request and that there was nothing to indicate that the time was not necessary or reasonable. The Board mentioned, however, that it was not precluding AJs from cutting fee requests in other cases, and fee requests have been cut with Board approval. One AJ reduced preparation time from 74 hours to 18 hours, reduced hearing preparation from 30 hours to 25 hours, and reduced to one-quarter hour a phone call billed at half an hour because a five-minute letter would have served as well. Time spent in preparation of time charges and calculating fees was reduced from 2.5 hours to .5 hours. The task was clerical. <span class="Italic">McKinney v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 26 MSPR 267, 270 (1985). Another fee petition was reduced after the Board concluded that the appellant's PFR "although 22 pages long, in large part consists of background that has already been set forth repeatedly in the appellant's submissions, and mere argument concerning issues decided against the appellant." <span class="Italic">Wright v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 53 MSPR 427, 433 (1992). But counsel may charge (and recover for) time, if not excessive, spent periodically reviewing a file, even if the review is after the last required submission to the AJ. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stein v. USPS</span>, 63 MSPR 537, 542-43 (1994). If an attorney claims fees for an item but does not give the hours, the Board may assess the work and set an amount of time based on its experience with similar work. <span class="Italic">Weaver v. Dept. of Army</span>, 27 MSPR 371, 373 (1985).</p>
