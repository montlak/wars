<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-280"><span class="space">t.</span> Relocation Expenses; LQA and Post Differentials; Transportation Agreements; Severance Pay</h5>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator cannot order moving expenses to be paid as part of a remedy in a promotion case unless the award conforms to the requirements of a governing statute and the Federal Travel Regulations that the relocation be in the interest of the government and not primarily for the convenience of the employee or at the employee's request. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., Fed. R.R. Admin. and AFGE Local 2814</span>, 14 FLRA 240, 241 (1984). <span class="Italic">NATCA and Dept. of Transp., <span id="page_2242"></span>FAA Southwest Region</span>, 54 FLRA 706, 712-13 (1998), explained 5 USC 5724(h), governing relocation expense reimbursement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 5724(h) provides that an agency may not pay an employee's relocation expenses, if the move is primarily for the employee's benefit. The Arbitrator considered all of the relevant information in the record and concluded that the grievant's transfer was primarily for the employee's benefit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Comptroller General considers three "rules" with regard to determinations of whether under section 5724(h) a transfer is primarily in the interest of the Government or primarily for the convenience or benefit of the employee: (1) if an employee has taken the initiative in obtaining a transfer to a position in another location, then an agency usually considers such transfer as being made for the convenience of the employee or at his request; (2) if an agency recruits or requests an employee to transfer to a different location, then an agency will regard such transfer as being in the interest of the Government; or (3) if an agency orders the transfer and the employee has no discretion in the matter, then the employee is entitled to reimbursement of moving expenses. Comp. Gen. Decision B-199943 at 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator determined that the grievant initiated the action and that the transfer was primarily for the grievant's benefit. As the Arbitrator also found, the Agency did not recruit the grievant to transfer to Dallas nor did the Agency order the grievant transferred. Accordingly, consistent with the Comptroller General's construction of section 5724(h), the Arbitrator correctly determined that the Agency did not violate law when it denied the employee's request for reimbursement of his PCS expenses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, we find that, based on his factual findings to which we defer, the Arbitrator properly denied the grievance on the basis that the grievant had initiated the action, and that the transfer was primarily for the grievant's own benefit. As stated above, under section 5724(h), an agency may not pay an employee's relocation expenses, if the move is primarily for the employee's benefit. The Arbitrator found that because the grievant had initiated the action and because the transfer was primarily for the grievant's benefit, under section 5724(h), the Agency could not pay the grievant's relocation expenses. Because the Arbitrator's award is not inconsistent with section 5724(h), the exception provides no basis to find the award deficient under section 7122(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Council 163 and DCAA</span>, 54 FLRA 880, 886-89 (1998), synopsized considerations governing an arbitrator's review of an agency decision concerning entitlement to permanent change of station moving expenses:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The principles governing short-distance relocations of transferred employees are contained in the FTR, 41 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302-1.7(a), which constitutes a Government-wide regulation. It provides that when a change in duty station involves a short distance, transportation expenses for a relocation, i.e., a change of residence shall be authorized only when the agency determines that the relocation was incident to the change of official station. Factors to consider include: commuting time and distance between the employee's residence at the time of notification of transfer and his/her old and new posts of duty as well as the commuting time and distance between a proposed relocation site and the new post of duty. Section 302-1.7 states further that a relocation normally should not be considered as "incident to" a change in duty stations unless the one-way commuting distance from the old residence to the new duty station is at least 10 miles greater than from the old residence to the old duty station. Even then, circumstances surrounding a particular case may suggest that the move of residence was not incident to the PCS.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FTR, 41 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302-1.7(a), provides "guidelines" for agencies to follow in order to determine whether relocation expenses shall be payable as incident to a change of permanent duty station. Comp. Gen. Decision B-256350 at 1. The Comptroller General stated further that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[w]e have consistently held that this regulation does not establish fixed rules to be applied in all cases where the old and new duty stations are relatively close to each other. Rather, the regulation gives the agency broad discretionary authority to determine whether an employee's move from one residence to another is in fact incident to a change of official station.</p>

Unless an agency makes a "positive determination" of eligibility based on the various factors referred to in the regulation and relocation expenses are incurred, no basis for payment of a claim exists. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Comptroller General concluded that he will not overturn an agency's determination on this issue in the absence of a showing that it was "clearly erroneous, arbitrary, or involved an abuse of discretion." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section C4108 of the JTR, promulgated by the Department of Defense, provides further guidance within the Agency. The qualifications for payment of relocation expenses under Section C4108 include whether the transfer:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1) is in the interest of the Government; (2) is to a new [permanent duty station] which is at least 10 miles distant from the old [permanent duty station]; (3) is not primarily for the convenience or benefit of the employee or at his request; and (4) [is the cause of the] relocation of the residence....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">JTR Section C4108.&#x2003;The JTR also provides, as does section 302-1.7(a) of the FTR, that the Agency should look at such things as commuting time and the distance between the employee's residence and his old and new duty stations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, we conclude for the following reasons that the Arbitrator correctly held that the Agency's denial of PCS moving expenses is not contrary to the FTR and the JTR provisions at issue in this case. Accordingly, the award is not deficient as contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 302-1.7 of the FTR provides that PCS moving expenses can be paid "only when the agency determines" that the employee's move was incident to the transfer of permanent duty station. Beyond designating the employing agency as the entity to make this determination, however, this regulation goes on to identify certain factors that can be used by an agency in deciding PCS expense matters. This list of factors is suggestive, not exclusive. In our view, this language provides considerable discretion to an agency in making PCS payment determinations.[6] Thus, in concurrence with the Comptroller General's standard of review on this point, we will not set aside an arbitration award reviewing an agency's determination concerning PCS expenses unless it can be shown that the arbitrator ruled incorrectly on whether the agency's payment determination was clearly erroneous, arbitrary, or constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;The JTR provision at issue in this case essentially repeats the FTR factors for an agency to consider in exercising its discretion in making PCS moving expense determinations. The JTR provision does not, however, expressly set out the FTR language referenced in the text above, identifying the agency as the entity to make PCS moving expense determinations. We do not view this omission as indicating that the Agency is without discretion in making these determinations under the JTR. Agency regulations like the JTR must be construed consistent with Government-wide regulations like the FTR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Overseas Education Association, Inc. and Department of Defense, Office of Dependents Schools</span>, 27 FLRA 492, 505 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd as to other matters</span>, 858 F.2d 769 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (the FTR constitute Government-wide regulations); FTR &#x00A7; 301-1.2(a). Moreover, we have held that the JTR implements provisions of the FTR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1858</span>, 37 FLRA 476, 479 n.1 (1990); JTR Section C1001.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As indicated above, we find that the Arbitrator correctly ruled that the Agency's denial of PCS moving expenses was not clearly erroneous, arbitrary, or an abuse of discretion, and thus, the award is not inconsistent with law. In this regard, as the Arbitrator correctly held, the Agency properly exercised its discretion consistent with the appropriate guidelines for making determinations under the regulation about PCS moving expenses. As noted by the Arbitrator, the factors that the Agency used include the commuting time and distance between the employee's residence at the time of notification of transfer and his/her old and new posts of duty, as well as the commuting time and distance between a proposed relocation site and the new post of duty. The Agency made the calculations required under the FTR, based on the information supplied by the grievant. The Agency specifically found that the old and new duty stations were only 11 miles apart and were in the same commuting area.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Without a designated new home area, the Agency was unable to consider the location of the grievant's new home in assessing his request for PCS moving expenses. Therefore, the Agency substituted the old permanent duty station location for the new home area in determining whether the grievant was entitled to reimbursement for PCS expenses. We find that the Arbitrator correctly held that the Agency's substitution of the old permanent duty station for the new home area, in making this computation, was not clearly erroneous, arbitrary, or an abuse of discretion, in making its overall determination of whether the grievant was eligible for PCS entitlement. In this regard, because the grievant had voluntarily accepted a commute of 33 miles from Dudley to Marlboro, the Arbitrator correctly concluded that the Agency reasonably determined that the grievant stood in no different position from employees who lived and worked in Marlboro. Therefore, it was not an abuse of discretion to use Marlboro as the home area equivalent for measuring commuting distance. Thus, the Arbitrator found that had the Agency known of the grievant's choice of new home location, Shrewsbury, when it made the computation, the determination as to the grievant's eligibility for PCS entitlement would not have changed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we find that nothing in the FTR and JTR regulations cited by the Union required the Agency to reimburse the grievant for PCS expenses in these circumstances. We find that the Arbitrator correctly held that the Agency reasonably concluded, based on applicable FTR and JTR regulations, that the grievant's relocation of his residence was not <span id="page_2243"></span>incident to the transfer in permanent duty station. We also find that the Agency made the computations required under the regulations to the best of its ability, based on the information supplied by the grievant. Accordingly, the award does not conflict with the FTR and JTR regulations and, therefore, is not deficient under section 7122(a) of the Statute.</p>

<p class="noindent">Despite difficulties created by an improper reassignment, an arbitrator could not direct the agency to reimburse grievants for increases in travel expenses caused by the reassignment when the effect of the award was to require the agency to reimburse the grievants for home-to-work commuting expenses. 5 USC 5704 prohibits reimbursement for home-to-work travel. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Indianapolis and NTEU Chap. 49</span>, 49 FLRA 55, 58 (1994).</p>

<p class="noindent">The concepts of "home of record" ("HOR") and "renewal agreement travel" ("RAT") involved in allowances for travel expenses for employees returning home to take leave between overseas duty tours were explored in <span class="Italic">FEA and DODDS</span>, 54 FLRA 818, 826-30 (1998). <span class="Italic">DOD, Educ. Activity and FEA</span>, 56 FLRA 119, 122 (2000), explained 5 USC 5722 in the context of claims for reimbursement for travel at the end of school years:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 5722, when read in its entirety, provides for payment of travel expense for new hires from the United States to a post abroad, and then "return travel" to the United States at the time of separation. It does not expressly provide for travel in the reverse direction, that is, from a post abroad to the United States and then return travel to the post abroad. Nothing in its plain wording indicates that section 5722 applies to current employees already at posts outside the continental United States who are not returning to the United States at time of separation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When enacted in 1946, section 5722 was originally numbered section 73b-3 of title 5. Section 73b-3 authorized certain return travel and transportation expenses for new appointees assigned to overseas posts of duty. Those expenses were authorized only if "the person selected for the appointment shall agree in writing remain in the Government service for the twelve months following his appointment, unless separated for reasons beyond his control."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1950, section 763-3 was amended. As relevant here, the amendment added the following proviso:</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">[P]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic">rovided further, </span>That expenses of return travel and transportation <span class="Italic">upon separation from the service </span>shall be allowed whether such separation is for the purposes of the Government or for personal convenience, but shall not be allowed unless such persons selected for appointment outside the continental United States shall have served for a minimum period of not less than one nor more than three years prescribed in advance by the head of the department or agency concerned or unless separation is for reasons beyond the control of the individual and acceptable to the department or agency concerned.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Chapter 1010, Pub. L. No. 830 (1950) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Senate Report accompanying the 1950 amendment states that the amendment would "specify that employees selected for overseas service will be entitled to...return transportation regardless of the reasons of <span class="Italic">separation upon completion of the period of employment </span>specified in advance, not to exceed 3 years." Senate Report 2495, Aug. 30, 1950 (emphasis added). The Report also states that, "[u]pon completion of the agreed period of service return transportation would be allowed whether separation was for purposes of the Government or for personal convenience<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. This language indicates that Congress intended the authorized funds to be paid upon completion of the employee's contractual term of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 73b-3 was amended in 1961. The 1961 amendments left intact the "upon separation from the service" language that had been added by the 1950 amendment. However, when section 73b-3 was renumbered section 5722 in 1966, that language was excised. The historical and statutory notes accompanying 5 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 5722 state only that "standard changes" were made to the 1961 language, in order "to conform with...the style of" title 5. 5 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 5722, Historical and Statutory Notes at 201.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the legislative history, we conclude that section 5722 authorizes return travel and transportation expenses only at the end of an employee's term of employment. In this regard, the Court of Claims has held that section 5722 "is limited to travel at the beginning and end of a tour of duty....&#8197;A travel agreement's requirement that the employee remain in [F]ederal employment for a certain period of time only makes sense if section 5722 is limited to pre- and post-employment travel." <span class="Italic">Brown and Davis v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States, </span>230 Ct. Cl. 735, 737 (1982). Thus, section 5722 does not authorize the travel at issue in this case.</p>
