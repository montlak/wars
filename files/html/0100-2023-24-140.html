<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-136"><span class="space">6.</span> Back Pay Act</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Back Pay Act, 5 USC 5596, provides for recovery of back pay and interest (with the possibility of attorney fees) for an employee "who, on the basis of a timely appeal or an administrative determination (including a decision relating to an unfair labor practice or a grievance) is found by appropriate authority under applicable law, rule, or regulation, or collective bargaining agreement, to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action...." 5 USC 5596(b)(1). For discussion of the development of the Back Pay Act, refer to <span class="Italic">Davis v. USPS</span>, 64 MSPR 652 (1994). The Back Pay Act applies to covered personnel actions, not to all matters that may in some fashion be involved in subsequent, discrete personnel actions. <span class="Italic">Wells v. FAA</span>, 755 F.2d 804, 808 (11th Cir. 1984). <span class="Italic">Wells</span> involved the revocation of a federal employee's air transport pilot certificates. The agency action was not a personnel action for purposes of Back Pay Act; it was an enforcement action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Read v. United States</span>, 254 F.3d 1064, 1066-68 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (Back Pay Act suit was unavailable in Court of Federal Claims when MSPB had jurisdiction over removal but lacked the authority to restore the employee who temporarily lost a security clearance; CSRA grant of general jurisdiction to MSPB over employee removals precluded court jurisdiction of related claim for back pay when clearance was retroactively reinstated); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Zummer v. Sallet</span>, 37 F.4th 996 (5th Cir. 2022) (CSRA precluded jurisdiction in district court over suit by employee who lost his job when he lost his clearance and sought to litigate the constitutionality of the clearance revocation). The Back Pay Act is for employees; it does not apply to applicants for employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lewis v. GSA</span>, 54 MSPR 120, 123 (1992). The Act is now subject to a six-year recovery period. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Morgan v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 81 MSPR 48, 55-56 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-19 (1999) (discussing the effect of amendments to the Back Pay Act that were encompassed in the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Martin v. United States</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2023 NP), catalogued what the Claims Court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Back Pay Act is not an independent jurisdictional grant to the MSPB, <span class="Italic">Bosley v. MSPB</span>, 162 F.3d 665, 667-68 (Fed. Cir. 1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Back Pay Act...provides that when an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action is corrected on appeal to the Board, the employee is entitled to receive any pay that was denied to the employee by reason of the unlawful personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596(b). The Back Pay Act thus provides a remedy for unlawful personnel actions that are within the jurisdiction of the Board. But if the Board does not otherwise have jurisdiction over a particular personnel action, the Back Pay Act does not confer such jurisdiction on the Board. The Back Pay Act thus does not provide the Board with jurisdiction to adjudicate Mr. Bosley's claim regarding the denial of his quality step increase if that claim is not cognizable under the WPA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Back Pay Act, in itself, is not an independent jurisdictional grant for a court, according to <span class="Italic">Taylor v. United States</span>, 310 Fed. Appx. 390, 390-93 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP), dismissing a suit in the Court of Federal Claims to secure back pay claimed under an EEOC decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Taylor filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC" or "Commission") alleging that his employer, the Department of Homeland Security ("DHS"), had discriminated against him when it failed to select him for a GS-12 Supervisory Border Patrol Agent position. The EEOC Administrative Judge determined that the DHS did discriminate against Mr. Taylor and awarded him $35,000 in damages plus back pay with interest. The Administrative Judge also ordered the DHS to immediately promote Mr. Taylor to the position of Supervisory Border Patrol Agent at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The DHS appealed the Administrative Judge's decision to the EEOC's Office of Federal Operations ("OFO"), and in May 2006, the OFO affirmed the Administrative Judge's decision and award. In its order, the OFO notified Mr. Taylor that if the agency failed to comply with the award order, Mr. Taylor may petition the EEOC for enforcement or may file a civil action--either to enforce compliance with the award or, alternatively, based on the underlying complaint. The order also informed Mr. Taylor that if he wished to file a civil action, he should do so "in an appropriate United States District Court." <span class="Italic">Taylor I</span>, 80 Fed. Cl. at 378.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In November 2006, Mr. Taylor sent a letter to the EEOC and the DHS demanding that they comply with the Administrative Judge's order. In February 2007, the DHS paid Mr. Taylor $35,000 in damages, but Mr. Taylor states that he never received any back pay with interest and that he was not promoted to the position of Supervisory Border Patrol Agent. Thus, Mr. Taylor filed the present action in the Court of Federal Claims in July 2007. The Court of Federal Claims dismissed Mr. Taylor's claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, explaining that it has jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1491, only if the plaintiff identifies a valid money-mandating statute. The court determined that Mr. Taylor did not identify a valid money-mandating statute that would give it jurisdiction and thus dismissed his claim. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 379. Mr. Taylor then appealed to this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Taylor contends the Court of Federal Claims erred in dismissing his claim because it had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1491. However, for the following reasons, the Court of Federal Claims correctly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over this case and properly dismissed Mr. Taylor's claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Tucker Act gives the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over "any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress, or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort." 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1491(a)(1). However, while the Tucker Act waives the sovereign immunity of the United States, it does not create a substantive right to recover damages from the United States. As the Supreme Court has explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Tucker Act, of course, is itself only a jurisdictional statute; it does not create any substantive right enforceable against the United States for money damages. The Court of Claims has recognized that the Act merely confers jurisdiction upon it whenever the substantive right exists. We therefore must determine whether the two other federal statutes that are invoked by the respondents confer a substantive right to recover money damages from the United States.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">United States v. Testan</span>, 424 U.S. 392, 398 (1976) (internal citation omitted). <span class="Italic">Testan</span> instructs us regarding how to analyze the present case. As in <span class="Italic">Testan</span>, Mr. Taylor seeks neither to enforce a contract against the United States nor to recover money he has paid to the Government, and thus, "the asserted entitlement to money damages depends upon whether any federal statute can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government for the damage sustained." <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 400 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Tucker Act alone does not confer jurisdiction over Mr. Taylor's claim, we must determine whether Mr. Tucker has cited another statute that mandates compensation by the United States (i.e. a money-mandating statute). <span class="Italic">See id.; see also Worthington v. United States</span>, 168 F.3d 24, 26 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ("To fall within the Tucker Act's jurisdictional grant, a claim must invoke a statute that mandates the payment of money damages."). "If the court's conclusion is that the source as alleged and pleaded is not money-mandating, the court shall so declare, and shall dismiss the cause for lack of jurisdiction, a Rule 12(b)(1) dismissal--the absence of a money-mandating source being fatal to the court's jurisdiction under the Tucker Act." <span class="Italic">Fisher v. United States</span>, 402 F.3d 1167, 1173 (Fed. Cir. 2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Taylor contends that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805 and 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1614.501-.505 confer the required substantive right of recovery. We disagree. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805 is not a money-mandating statute; it merely provides instructions for calculating back pay.[2] The other regulations cited by Mr. Taylor, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1614.501-.505, more closely resemble money-mandating provisions, but as detailed below, they ultimately fail to give the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over Mr. Taylor's claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805 is an implementing regulation of the Back Pay Act. The Back Pay Act itself, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, also fails to confer jurisdiction upon the Court of Federal Claims. <span class="Italic">Spagnola v. Stockman</span>, 732 F.2d 908, 912 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501 states, "[w]hen an agency, or the Commission, in an individual case of discrimination, finds that an applicant or an employee has been discriminated against, the agency shall provide full relief." Although 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501 does appear to mandate compensation <span id="Page_5374"></span>when the EEOC finds discrimination, it does not explicitly confer jurisdiction to enforce EEOC decisions upon the Court of Federal Claims or any other court. Instead, the regulation cited by Mr. Taylor that discusses judicial enforcement of EEOC decisions simply indicates that jurisdiction is conferred by the underlying statute that provided the right to relief. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.503(g). In this case, that underlying statute is Title VII.[3] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The EEOC's decision stemmed from Mr. Taylor's complaint of racial and religious discrimination brought pursuant to Title VII, which prohibits employment discrimination based upon race, religion, sex, or national origin.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e to 2000e-17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court of Federal Claims has repeatedly held it has no jurisdiction over Title VII claims. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Osborn v. United States</span>, 47 Fed. Cl. 224, 232 (2000); <span class="Italic">Lee v. United States</span>, 33 Fed. Cl. 374, 378 (1995). Instead, district courts have original jurisdiction over a claim "to recover damages or to secure equitable or other relief under any Act of Congress providing for the protection of civil rights," 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1343(a)(4), and Title VII itself specifically states that district courts have jurisdiction over claims brought under that title, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(f)(3). Moreover, the district courts' jurisdiction is exclusive--Title VII "create[s] an exclusive, pre-emptive administrative and judicial scheme for the redress of federal employment discrimination." <span class="Italic">Brown v. Gen. Servs. Admin.</span>, 425 U.S. 820, 829 (1976). Because Title VII vests jurisdiction over discrimination claims exclusively in the district court, the Court of Federal Claims cannot exercise jurisdiction over those claims. The EEOC correctly notified Mr. Taylor that should he wish to bring a civil action, he should do so in an appropriate district court, <span class="Italic">Taylor I</span>, 80 Fed. Cl. at 378, but Mr. Taylor nonetheless filed his claim in the Court of Federal Claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, Mr. Taylor has not cited a money-mandating statute that gives the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over his claim under the Tucker Act. Because the Court of Federal Claims properly dismissed Mr. Taylor's claim for lack of subject mater jurisdiction, we affirm.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But the Back Pay Act constitutes a money-mandating statute within the meaning of the Tucker Act when the plaintiff asserted that she was denied pay during a period of federal employment that she was entitled to for court leave under 5 USC 6322. Although the plaintiff was removed for charges relating to her failure to report to duty when she took court leave, the MSPB lacked jurisdiction over the claim for a pre-removal loss of pay and a suit in the Court of Federal Claims was not preempted by the plaintiff's access to the Board to contest the removal, <span class="Italic">Hall v. United States</span>, 617 F.3d 1313, 1317-18 (Fed. Cir. 2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the government's position, an adjudication of the section 6322(a) claim would not necessarily resolve the removal issue. As an initial matter, the removal was a separate personnel action, and Ms. Hall was not required to challenge it in order to prosecute her claim for pre-removal back pay. While reinstatement is a necessary precondition for an employee to be entitled to post-removal back pay, it is not a precondition for an award of pre-removal back pay. Thus, if the agency violated Ms. Hall's rights under section 6322(a) and unlawfully denied her compensation for the days she was engaged in jury service, she was not required to seek reinstatement in order to obtain relief for that denial of compensation. <span class="Italic">See Bell v. United States,</span> 23 Cl. Ct. 73, 77 (1991) (finding jurisdiction where plaintiffs claimed entitlement to severance pay without contesting the merits of their separation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if Ms. Hall were to appeal the removal action before the MSPB, the outcome of that appeal would not necessarily resolve the merits of her section 6322(a) claim. For example, if the MSPB felt that removal was improper because Ms. Hall's interpretation of section 6322(a) was reasonable, it could grant reinstatement even if it concluded that the AWOL charge was valid. Conversely, the MSPB could deny reinstatement even if it found the AWOL charge to be erroneous, e.g., on the ground that her conduct in dealing with her supervisors regarding the AWOL issue was inappropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More importantly, even if the MSPB were to overturn the AWOL charge and rule in Ms. Hall's favor, it would be unable to award her the pre-removal pay she would have received absent the AWOL charge. In <span class="Italic">Mattern v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 291 F.3d 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2002), we held that the MSPB's "power to make an aggrieved employee whole under the Back Pay Act extends back only to the effective date of the [appealable] adverse action." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1371. Because the only appealable adverse action in this case is the removal action, the MSPB would be powerless to award any pre-removal back pay to Ms. Hall. For that reason as well, it is incorrect to say that Ms. Hall's claim for court leave is "inextricably intertwined" with her removal from federal service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government relies heavily on<span class="Italic"> Dachman v. United States,</span> 73 Fed. Cl. 508 (2006), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 230 Fed. Appx. 981 (Fed. Cir. 2007), in arguing that the Court of Federal Claims loses jurisdiction over a back pay claim arising from a charge of AWOL if the employee is subsequently removed based on the AWOL charge. Like Ms. Hall, Dr. Dachman contested her placement on AWOL prior to her removal, and she sought both pre-removal and post-removal back pay in an action brought in the Court of Federal Claims. The government sought to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction, asserting that the claims for back pay arose directly from the agency's decision to remove Dr. Dachman from federal service. The Court of Federal Claims simply adopted the government's representation that all of Dr. Dachman's claims for back pay, both pre-removal and post-removal, "emanate[d] from an underlying removal action." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 517. For the reasons outlined above, however, we find the premise of that decision to have been mistaken, and we therefore do not agree with the court's disposition in that case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having determined that the CSRA does not preclude the Court of Federal Claims from exercising jurisdiction in this case, we turn to the question whether Ms. Hall has identified a money-mandating source within the meaning of the Tucker Act. Ms. Hall met that burden by alleging that compensation of her forfeited pre-removal pay is mandated by the Back Pay Act based on a violation of section 6322(a). <span class="Italic">See Worthington,</span> 168 F.3d at 26 ("The Back Pay Act is...a 'money-mandating' statute when based on violations of statutes or regulations covered by the Tucker Act."). We conclude that the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction to determine whether Ms. Hall was entitled to paid leave under section 6322(a). Accordingly, we remand for a determination on the merits of that claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hall v. United States</span>, 677 F.3d 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (following remand to the Court of Federal Claims, reversing dismissal of pre-removal claims and affirming dismissal of post-removal claims).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Back Pay Act is not generally considered a grant of jurisdiction to the courts, the Act provides statutory authority for granting monetary relief and attorney fees when an "appropriate authority" determines a personnel action taken against a federal employee is "unwarranted or unjustified." The Act is construed conservatively because it operates as waiver of sovereign immunity, <span class="Italic">Donovan v. United States</span>, 580 F.2d 1203, 1206 (3d Cir. 1978):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A claim for back pay by a federal employee, in essence, amounts to a lawsuit against the United States for monetary damages. In order to determine if such a lawsuit is proper, we must assess whether the United States has granted a right to sue it for damages....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">By its terms, the Back Pay Act applies to any administrative procedure used by an employee to obtain reversal of a personnel action believed to be in error. The United States Claims Court, and its predecessor the Court of Claims, constituted an "appropriate authority" within the meaning of the Act. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Greenway v. United States</span>, 163 Ct. Cl. 72 (1963). However, in <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 108 S. Ct. 668 (1988), the Supreme Court questioned whether the Claims Court was an "appropriate authority" under the Back Pay Act if the employee's claim was in some fashion embraced by procedures established by the CSRA. The Back Pay Act was applied to direct enrollment of an employee of the judicial branch into a federal health insurance plan, construed to be a benefit of employment under 5 CFR 550.803 (1988). <span class="Italic">In re Golinski</span>, 587 F.3d 956, 959 (9th Cir. 2009). For discussion of the relation between the Back Pay Act and interest entitlements for employees who successfully challenge in court terminations based on age discrimination claims, refer to <span class="Italic">Adams v. Norton</span>, 636 F.3d 1190 (9th Cir. 2011).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It has been suggested that the Back Pay Act is not a jurisdictional grant; another statute must waive sovereign immunity by mandating payment that can then be recovered under the Back Pay Act. A case arriving at that result, <span class="Italic">Hambsch v. United States</span>, 857 F.2d 763 (Fed. Cir. 1988), was the subject of a petition for <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> to the Supreme Court. Although the petition was denied, three justices joined in dissenting to the denial of <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> to express the view, apparently shared by the Solicitor General, that the Back Pay Act is an independent grant of jurisdiction. Writing for the dissenters, Justice O'Connor stated in <span class="Italic">Hambsch v. United States</span>, 109 S. Ct. 1969, 1970-72 (1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit did not reach the merits of petitioner's claims....&#8197;Instead that court ruled that the Claims Court lacked jurisdiction over this action. Relying on our decision in <span class="Italic">United States v. Testan</span> [424 U.S. 392, 96 S. Ct. 948, 47 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1976)], the Court of Appeals held that "consent to suit against the United States for back pay must be 'unequivocally expressed' and...5 USC 6324 does not express such consent."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">United States v. Testan</span>, we dealt with a claim by Government employees that they had erroneously been classified in a pay grade lower than those who did substantially identical work in the same agency. We held that neither the Classification Act, 5 USC 5101...nor the Back Pay Act could trigger the Tucker Act jurisdiction of the former Court of Claims....&#8197;We noted that "the Back Pay Act, as its words so clearly indicate, was intended to grant a monetary cause of action only to those who were subjected to a reduction in their duly appointed emoluments or position."...&#8197;The plaintiffs in <span class="Italic">Testan</span> were not such employees because they were not claiming a right "to receive only the salary of the position to which [they were] appointed," rather they sought reclassification into a <span class="Italic">new</span> position and pay grade. Thus <span class="Italic">Testan</span> makes clear, and our subsequent cases have reaffirmed, that the Back Pay Act itself is an explicit consent to suit by the United States as to a claim by a federal employee that the pay or emoluments of his or her position have been wrongfully withheld in <span id="Page_5375"></span>violation of an "applicable law, rule, regulation, or collective bargaining agreement."...&#8197;It follows that the Court of Appeals erred in searching for an explicit waiver of immunity from suit in &#x00A7; 6324; that explicit waiver is found in the Back Pay Act itself. The Court of Appeals' interpretation of <span class="Italic">Testan</span> would render the Back Pay Act a nullity, for rarely if ever will an agency personnel regulation or collective bargaining agreement contain an express waiver of the sovereign immunity of the United States. The proper inquiry is simply whether the employee alleges the violation of a statute, rule, or provision of a collective bargaining agreement which has resulted in the unlawful withholding of compensation to which he or she would otherwise be entitled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In my view, the jurisdictional holding of the Court of Appeals is quite clearly wrong, and as the Solicitor General points out, this jurisdictional error will preclude review in a rather large class of cases falling within its scope.</p>

McLucas</span>, 537 F.2d 246, 248 (6th Cir. 1976) (ruling that the denial of interest on back pay implied a jurisdictional element to the Back Pay Act: "Since the Back Pay Act creates a cause of action against the sovereign which did not previously exist, a strict construction of the statutory remedy is generally held to be required"), <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">Boddie v.

The judgment was sought by a VA employee who challenged a personnel action sustained by an agency disciplinary appeals board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Administrative Procedure Act</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The APA entitles "person[s] suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute...to judicial review thereof" 5 USC 702. In 1976 Congress amended the APA to add the following language:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An action in a court of the United States seeking relief <span class="Italic">other than</span> money damages and stating a claim that an agency or an officer or employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official capacity or under color of legal authority shall not be dismissed nor relief therein be denied on the ground that it is against the United States or that the United States is an indispensable party.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis supplied). The Supreme Court has interpreted this legislative language as providing a valid waiver of sovereign immunity in cases covered by the amendment to the APA. <span class="Italic">See Bowen v. Massachusetts</span>, 487 U.S. 879, 891-92, 108 S. Ct. 2722, 2730-31, 101 L. Ed.2d 749 (1988). Hence, to the extent that Ward sought relief other than money damages--declaratory and injunctive relief--his claims were properly before the district court. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 893, 108 S. Ct. at 2731. But the APA does not waive sovereign immunity for money damages claims. Back pay, as a claim for money damages, falls outside the scope of the APA. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hubbard v. Administrator, EPA</span>, 982 F.2d 531, 533 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). Insofar as Ward's claim sought back pay, therefore, it was not properly before the district court unless Congress waived sovereign immunity for such claim in another statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">B.&#x2003;The Back Pay Act</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ward contends that such a waiver of sovereign immunity for back pay claims against the United States is found in the Back Pay Act of 1966, 5 USC 5596 (1988). That Act provides a federal government employee is entitled to back pay if "found by appropriate authority under applicable law, rule, regulation, or collective bargaining agreement, to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the pay, allowances, or differentials of the employee." <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1). The Supreme Court reads the Back Pay Act as a statute that mandates compensation by the federal government in a successful suit against the government. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bowen</span>, 487 U.S. at 905 n.42, 108 S. Ct. at 2738 n.42.

Hopkins</span>, 427 U.S. 123, 128, 96 S. Ct. 2508, 2511, 49 L. Ed.2d 361 (1976). Such a cause of action is limited by the terms of the Back Pay Act to employees who have been unlawfully "subjected to a reduction in their duly appointed emoluments or position." <span class="Italic">United States v. Testan</span>, 424 U.S. 392, 407, 96 S. Ct. 948, 957, 47 L. Ed.2d 114 (1976).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We read these binding cases as interpreting the Back Pay Act to provide an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity in cases covered by that Act. <span class="Italic">Accord Brown v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We think Ward's claim for back pay falls within the terms of the Back Pay Act. He has alleged that a federal government agency, the VA, has subjected him to a personnel action that has resulted in the withdrawal of his pay. If the agency action is determined to have been unwarranted, then Ward will be entitled to back pay and the Back Pay Act provides him the necessary consent to enforce this right in district court.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For a claim of allegedly unjustified deduction of state income taxes from the salaries of federal employees working in Puerto Rico, the Federal Circuit decided that the "Little Tucker Act" and the Back Pay Act provided jurisdiction to a district court to consider the suit, because the type of personnel action involved was not covered at all by the Reform Act for any employees, <span class="Italic">Romero v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants further seek to have the United States refund all monies withheld from their pay pursuant to the invalid withholding agreement. Jurisdiction for this monetary claim against the United States is asserted to lie under the Little Tucker Act, 28 USC 1346(a)(2). The Little Tucker Act by itself does not create any substantive right of relief enforceable against the United States. <span class="Italic">United States v. Testan</span>, 424 U.S. 392, 398, 96 S.

<p class="Block-Quote1">484 U.S. at 454, 108 S. Ct. at 677. The government argues that, according to this passage, district courts universally have no power to determine whether a "personnel action" by a federal employer is justified. The <span class="Italic">only</span> entity with such power in the government's view "is the employee's agency itself, the Merit Systems Protection Board, and then by appeal the Federal Circuit." "Only if a plaintiff is first armed with an adjudication that a personnel action is unjustified," goes the government's argument, "can the jurisdiction of the [Court of Federal Claims] or a district court be invoked to enforce a Back Pay Claim."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If Supreme Court cases were about creating legal rules through nifty bits and pieces of language, the government's argument might seem attractive. However, when the passage cited by the government is read in the context of the <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> case, the government's argument loses any of its facial appeal. <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> was a lawsuit by a "nonpreference eligible in the excepted service" challenging the merits of an agency's decision to remove him from the service. He could not litigate his removal in the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) because the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 954,54, 92 Stat. 1111 <span class="Italic">et seq....</span>provided no right of review to nonpreference eligibles in the excepted service. 484 U.S. at 446-447, 108 S. Ct. at 673. Having suffered defeat in the MSPB, Fausto sued the United States in the then-Claims Court under the Back Pay Act <span id="Page_5376"></span>making the same challenge he could not make in the MSPB. The Supreme Court held that the CSRA not only did not provide Fausto a right of review in the MSPB, but also <span class="Italic">precluded</span> a right of review in the district courts or the Claims Court under the Tucker Act and Back Pay Act. 484 U.S. at 448, 108 S. Ct. at 673. This explains the Court's statement in the cited passage that the district court is not an appropriate authority to make a personnel determination "<span class="Italic">under the...CSRA</span>."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> does not hold that the CSRA makes impermissible "judicial review of <span class="Italic">any</span> action affecting federal employees." <span class="Italic">Bosco v. United States</span>, 931 F.2d 879, 883 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Rather, <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> holds that the CSRA provides "the only means of review as to the types of adverse personnel action specifically <span class="Italic">covered</span> by the CSRA." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The present case involves a type of personnel action--withholding of pay for income tax purposes--that "is not covered at all by the CSRA, for any employees." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. There is no reason to suppose that the CSRA was intended to preclude this sort of action under the Back Pay Act and therefore <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> is inapplicable. Accordingly, we hold that appellants' claims for a refund are cognizable in the district court under the Little Tucker Act and Back Pay Act.</p>
