<h3 class="h3" id="sec5-56"><span class="space">A.</span> ACTING AT ALL</h3>
<p class="noindent">The rights/procedure dichotomy was first explored by FLRA in <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 6 and IRS</span>, 1 FLRA 897, 900 (1979), involving a proposal to establish criteria concerning management decisions on employees' requests to work out of their homes. The proposal was negotiable. It only involved the procedure that management would follow in exercising its right to direct and assign work and employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7106 of the Statute specifies, in subsection (a), various rights reserved to agency management. Subsection (b), however, provides that management's exercise of any rights contained in subsection (a) does not preclude negotiations on the procedures which management officials will observe in exercising such rights. The legislative history of the Statute reflects the intent, in regard to the duty to bargain on the procedures management will observe in exercising any reserved rights under the Statute, to authorize unions to negotiate fully on such procedures, unless negotiations would prevent the agency from acting at all.</p>
<p class="noindent">The "acting at all" criterion was reviewed in court in the significant decision of <span class="Italic">DOD, AAFES v. FLRA</span>, 659 F.2d 1140, 1151-52 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (<span class="Italic">Dix-McGuire</span>), involving a proposal that management stay disciplinary actions pending exhaustion of grievance procedures, and another proposal requiring that selection for defined details be based on seniority:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The difficulty arises, of course, because the distinction between procedure and substance is not always crisp. Union proposals establishing "procedures" for employee selection illustrate the uncertain boundary between the categories. Selection on the basis of seniority, for example, defines a procedure for the exercise of management's right to hire or promote. But it is equally true that a proposal requiring selection based on seniority both establishes the substantive criterion pursuant to which selection will occur and identifies the particular employee to be chosen. Unless procedure is to be permitted to swallow substance entirely, it therefore becomes necessary to inquire into the range of proposals to be deemed "procedural" within the contemplation of the statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite the inherent ambiguities of the distinction between procedure <span id="page_575"></span>and substance, and the attendant difficulties in its application, the intent of Congress cannot be ignored. It is the task of the FLRA, authorized by statute to "provide leadership" in implementing the labor-management chapter of the Civil Service Reform Act, to develop workable standards consistent with the Act's underlying policies and intent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, we think it appropriate to note what we perceive as a difference in kind among the cases calling for application of the statutory distinction between negotiable procedures and reserved substantive rights. There are, on the one hand, cases in which proposals cast in procedural language impinge on substantive management decisions by specifying the criteria pursuant to which decisions must be made. There are, on the other, more nearly "pure" procedures, which have less direct substantive repercussions--for example, procedures for use in determining which employees possess characteristics identified by management as appropriate criteria for choice.</p>
<p class="noindent">Turning to the "acting at all" rule, under <span class="Italic">Dix-McGuire</span>, <span class="Italic">id.</span> At 1153-54:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the FLRA recognized, the plain language of the statute strongly supports the union's position. Although Section 7106(a) asserts that nothing in the Reform Act "shall affect the authority of any management official" to hire, and take disciplinary action, it <span class="Italic">also</span> provides that the terms of subsection (a) are "<span class="Italic">[s]</span> <span class="Italic">ubject to subsection (b)</span>." And subsection (b) clearly states that "[n]othing in this <span class="Italic">section</span>"--which <span class="Italic">includes</span> subsection (a), on which management's argument is based--"shall preclude any agency and any labor organization from negotiating...procedures which management officials of the agency will observe in exercising any authority under this section...." The language of Section 7106 thus seems to establish a hierarchy, in which the terms of subsection (b) hold priority over those of subsection (a). And the union proposal in this case, involving procedures to be followed prior to the exercise of management's right to discharge and discipline employees, appears to fall plainly within the language of Section 7106(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note at the outset that the "acting at all" standard is a reasonable and natural construction of the statutory language, rendered by the agency given responsibility for administering the statute. The management power to act that is protected by Section 7106(a) may be limited by procedures under Section 7106(b), but only so far as the procedures do not have the effect of eliminating management authority by preventing its "acting at all."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the "acting at all" standard finds support in--even if it is not necessarily mandated by--the legislative history. In this regard it stands in marked contrast with the alternative standard advanced by the management parties, who contend that a proposal should be held nonnegotiable if its adoption might occasion "unreasonable delay" in the exercise of management rights.</p>
<p class="noindent">The distinction between a proposal that precludes the agency from acting at all and one that only constitutes a procedure used by the agency in the exercise of its authority arose when the union proposed that management could not document or record the results of its telephone monitoring program. The proposal also precluded the individual conducting the telephone monitor from interrupting the conversation with a taxpayer and providing the correct information. The proposal was nonnegotiable: without the means of documentation, tape-recording, and the ability to interrupt calls when improper information needed to be corrected, the monitoring program could not work. The procedural proposals would have destroyed the effectiveness of the program. The same was true as to a proposal that precluded the employer from using the results of the monitoring to evaluate the program. There were no other means to evaluate the work of the employees providing the telephone advice to taxpayers. <span class="Italic">NTEU and IRS</span>, 6 FLRA 522, 526-29 (1981).</p>
<p class="noindent">The "acting at all" standard became a cornerstone for future FLRA negotiability determinations. It was not, however, to escape judicial scrutiny. In <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 615 v. FLRA</span>, 801 F.2d 477, 480-83 (D.C. Cir. 1986), involving the negotiability of a proposal requiring investigations to be conducted within a fixed time following an event that might lead to discipline, the court observed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having decided this case pursuant to the law of this circuit binding upon the panel, we cannot avoid noting our deep suspicion that the FLRA, applying the same "acting at all" standard, could as readily have come out the opposite way and as readily have been affirmed. Experience under the "acting at all" standard since we approved its formulation causes this panel to doubt whether it is either theoretically sound or practically susceptible of principled application.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Its theoretical fragility is demonstrated by its principal corollary, which we have applied in the present case: A proposal is negotiable if it determines <span class="Italic">when</span> management rights may be exercised, but nonnegotiable if it determines <span class="Italic">whether</span> they may be exercised....&#8197;This distinction may seem, in most cases, to serve the evident statutory goal of leaving management in substantial control of those matters denominated "management rights." It separates, for example, a proposal creating a "statute of limitations" that would completely bar subsequent disciplinary action--<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, a requirement that the agency notify an employee within 24 hours of an infraction in order to base disciplinary action on that incident...--from a proposal simply requiring exhaustion of certain procedures prior to disciplinary action--<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, a requirement that disciplinary action be stayed pending the outcome of an administrative appeal through grievance procedures....&#8197;But the results of the test are not always sensible. For example, a requirement that disciplinary actions be initiated within ten years of the infraction would be nonnegotiable (though in practical terms a negligible restriction upon management prerogatives), while a requirement that disciplinary action be stayed for as long as the union wishes to investigate the matter, up to ten years, would be negotiable (though a massive practical impairment of management rights)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, while it would appear that the theoretical failings of the "acting at all" standard have been overcome in practice, this is only by virtue of the fact that the standard lends itself to completely unprincipled and inconsistent application. Consider, for example, the FLRA's treatment of proposals requiring that certain types of work be scheduled in advance. The Authority has found that a proposed requirement of ten workdays' notice of any change in duties or work assignments, though it unquestionably delays management's exercise of its right to assign work, does not prevent management from "acting at all" and is thus bargainable....&#8197;In another case, however, the FLRA has found that a proposal requiring thirty days' advance scheduling for firefighting training drills is nonbargainable, because it "would prevent management from acting at all to assign certain types of training...." It should be evident, by contrasting these two holdings, that a delay provision (or a cutoff provision, such as that in the present case) can readily be characterized as preventing the agency from "acting at all" or as not preventing the agency from "acting at all," <span class="Italic">depending upon what one chooses to define as the agency action</span>. It is the latter if the agency action is the assignment of drills; the former if the agency action is the assignment of drills <span class="Italic">without prior notice</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To take another interesting pair of cases: The FLRA has held to be nonnegotiable a proposal preventing the agency from taking disciplinary action against an employee so long as that employee is enrolled in a drug or alcoholism program and making "progress toward the renewal of acceptable work performance." The employee could, the FLRA said, "completely avoid disciplinary action...by remaining a participant in the program and making progress, however slight, towards acceptable performance...." At the same time, the FLRA has found that a proposal to give employees who accept assistance in an alcoholism and drug abuse program a "reasonable opportunity to improve their performance before being subject to adverse action" <span class="Italic">is</span> negotiable, on the ground that this proposal would simply "delay the imposition of discipline for those employees whose performance does not improve after having accepted assistance under the program."...&#8197;It is obvious that the FLRA could have characterized the proposal in the last case as one completely preventing disciplinary action against employees who "improve their performance"--just as it characterized the proposal in the first case as one preventing disciplinary action against employees making "reasonable" progress toward "acceptable" performance. Or, alternatively, it could have characterized the proposal in the first case as one merely delaying disciplinary action against employees who fail to make progress toward "acceptable performance"--just as it characterized the proposal in the last case as one delaying disciplinary action against employees whose performance does not improve. Whether the agency is prevented from "acting at all" thus turns upon whether one chooses to define the action in question as "dismissal of an employee who has failed to bring his performance up to standards" or rather simply "dismissal of an employee."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It may well be that the management right to assign work must be deemed to include, in some circumstances and not in others, the right to make unannounced assignments; that the management right to dismiss employees must be deemed to include the ability to dismiss without giving excessive opportunity for reformation, but not without giving no opportunity for reformation at all; and that the management right to discipline employees must be deemed to include the right to discipline on the basis of a needlessly delayed investigation. But it seems to us to make no sense to conclude those difficult inquiries by merely defining the agency "action" in terms of the very question at issue, making the proposals at issue negotiable or nonnegotiable at the FLRA's definitional whim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This panel is bound by this court's initial approval of the "acting at all" test, and by subsequent reaffirmation of the test's validity. We doubt, however, whether the court will be able to live indefinitely with a test that conceals rather than explains the FLRA's policy judgments which ultimately determine whether substantive management rights have realistically been impaired.</p>
<p class="noindent">The doubt expressed in the <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 615</span> decision was transformed into concerns more concrete in <span class="Italic">Customs Serv., Washington v. FLRA</span>, 854 F.2d 1414, <span id="page_576"></span>1417-21 (D.C. Cir. 1988). FLRA approved as negotiable, in <span class="Italic">Customs Serv. And NTEU</span>, 25 FLRA 248, 254-55 (1987), a proposal requiring the agency to delay a change in ship inspection procedures pending the outcome of a study designed to measure the effect of the changes on employees. FLRA ruled the proposal negotiable because it delayed but did not prevent the agency from acting at all. The court reversed FLRA:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The central issue in this case is whether the NTEU's proposal is a "procedure" over which the Customs Service is statutorily required to bargain. The FLRA's argument is that the proposal is procedural under the "acting at all" standard that is explicated in <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service, Region VIII</span>, 2 FLRA 25 (1979). Under this standard, the FLRA contends, a proposal that merely delays an agency's exercise of its reserved management rights, but does not prevent the agency from "acting at all" is a negotiable "procedure"....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Defense v. FLRA</span>, 659 F.2d 1140, 1153 (D.C. Cir. 1981), we approved the "acting at all" standard as "a reasonable and natural construction of the statutory language, rendered by the agency given responsibility for administering the statute." Application <span class="Italic">vel non</span> of this standard, however, depends entirely upon how the proposal at issue is characterized. If it can fairly be regarded as "purely procedural," then it is negotiable "unless the proposal, if adopted, would prevent the agency from 'acting at all'" <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1745 v. FLRA</span>, 828 F.2d 834, 840 (D.C. Cir. 1987)....&#8197;If, however, the proposal "stand[s] close to the uncertain border between procedure and substance, [then it] is deemed nonnegotiable if its adoption would directly interfere with management's reserved authority."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The position of the Customs Service in this case is that the Union's proposal here is surely not "purely procedural," such that the FLRA's "acting at all" standard applies, and, if it is even close to the procedural border, then it is still nonnegotiable because it would directly interfere with management rights....&#8197;First, it argues, the proposal is not procedural at all, in the relevant sense, because it deals only with procedures the <span class="Italic">Union</span> will observe--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, conduct a study of the impact that the RPET program would have on its members; it does not propose any "procedures which <span class="Italic">management officials of the agency</span> will observe in exercising any authority"...here, the undisputed right to implement the RPET program, which is encompassed within management's reserved right to determine the "means of performing work."...&#8197;Second, the Customs Service contends that the proposal is not a negotiable procedure because it "directly interferes" with management's right to implement the RPET program....&#8197;The proposal cannot be considered "procedural," in other words, because during the proposed six months' delay, the agency would be barred from implementing the RPET program and remitted, instead, to a "means of performing work" that is not of its own choosing....&#8197;We agree on both counts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the first point, we approach this case still plagued by "doubt whether [the 'acting at all' standard] is either theoretically sound or practically susceptible of principled application," because the results it yields depend so vitally on how the FLRA chooses to characterize the particular proposal under scrutiny....&#8197;Assuming it is applied to a proposal properly characterized as "purely procedural," the standard may not be an unreasonable interpretation of the statute....&#8197;If the FLRA applies it indiscriminately, however, then it may lead to arbitrary and indefensible results. That, we believe, is what happened in this case....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA says that the Union's proposal here "does not interfere with management's substantive right[s]" because the proposed procedure "merely delays the implementation" of the RPET program, as opposed to preventing the agency from acting at all....&#8197;But to what proposed procedure is it referring? According to FLRA's brief, the "procedure" NTEU has proposed is "the [agency's] holding in abeyance of [the RPET] program pending completion of the union's study."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This position is peculiar in the extreme.&#x2003;At the risk of belaboring the obvious, we note the fallacies within it....&#8197;To call holding a program in abeyance a "procedure" is, at the least, unnatural. More important, the statute does not broadly oblige the agency to bargain...over "procedures which management officials of the agency will observe." Instead, the agency's duty is to bargain over "procedures which management officials of the agency will observe <span class="Italic">in exercising any authority under this section</span>...."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's hold-in-abeyance proposal is not directed at <span class="Italic">how</span> the agency will implement its program; it would serve rather to place on the bargaining table the agency's decision as to <span class="Italic">when</span> to implement its new program. A decision regarding the timing of a program's implementation, however, is part and parcel of the reserved management right to determine the means by which an agency's work will be performed. It is a substantive, and not at all a procedural, decision; as such, it is reserved by statute to agency management, unfettered by collective bargaining obligations....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, because the proposal in this case is not "purely procedural," the "acting at all" standard is inapplicable. Further, even if it were procedural in some sense, no separate elaboration would be needed to see that the proposal is also nonnegotiable because it directly interferes with the reserved right of agency management to determine when a decision about the means of performing agency work will be implemented.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recur to our concern with the plasticity of the "acting at all" standard. Even if NTEU's proposal were arguably procedural, and even if it did not directly interfere with a reserved management right, the FLRA's application of the...standard in this case could not be sustained as reasoned decisionmaking....&#8197;[T]he FLRA applied the standard incorrectly to the proposal involved in this review proceeding. It (implicitly) reasoned as follows: (1) if a proposal does not prevent an agency from acting at all, (2) then it does not directly interfere with reserved management rights, and therefore (3) it will be regarded as a proposal concerning a "procedure" within the meaning of section 7106(b)(2). This analysis puts the cart before the horse, for as we have explained, the "acting at all" standard can logically be applied only when a proposal can properly be considered "purely procedural" in the first, not the third, place; it cannot be used to determine the anterior question of whether a proposal to postpone agency action directly interferes with management rights....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In closing, we again direct the FLRA to attend to our admonition in <span class="Italic">Local 615</span>....&#8197;For again, the FLRA's "acting at all" standard "causes [a] panel to doubt whether it is either theoretically sound or practically susceptible of principled application."...&#8197;Whatever merit the standard may have when it is applied properly, to a proposal properly within its scope, the FLRA's use of it seems at times to be mechanical, displacing any reasoned consideration of the proposal before it, and yielding results that are not only patently inconsistent...but also, as in this case, utterly irrational. And so again we caution the FLRA: "We doubt...whether the court will be able to live indefinitely with a test that conceals rather than explains the FLRA's policy judgments which ultimately determine whether substantive management rights have realistically been impaired."</p>
<p class="noindent">Despite the analysis in <span class="Italic">Customs Serv.</span>, the D.C. Circuit adhered to precedent as to negotiation of delays in disciplinary cases, affirming in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, BLM v. FLRA</span>, 873 F.2d 1505, 1511 (D.C. Cir. 1989), the negotiability of a proposal that a suspension take effect no fewer than 10 days after the issuance of a decision letter:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is, however, distinguishable. In contrast to <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, the proposal is genuinely linked to the decision-making procedure. Interior concedes that employees could appeal suspension decisions through a grievance and arbitration process....&#8197;Thus the provision is in a sense similar to this Court's Rule 15(b)(2), automatically staying the Court's mandate until expiration of the time for filing a petition for rehearing or suggestion for rehearing <span class="Italic">en banc</span>. Although Provision 9 is not explicitly tied to an employee's use of any remedial procedure, we do not believe that a time certain, of a duration plausibly suitable for a decision to seek such relief, is on that account less procedural. Nor does it prevent the agency from "acting at all."...&#8197;A six-month delay in the implementation of a new substantive program invades management's nonbargainable reserved authority and rights "to determine mission, budget, organization, number of employees and...to assign work and to determine the personnel by which agency operations shall be conducted."...&#8197;As we held in <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, a six-month delay in the implementation of a program to conduct the mission of the agency makes it impossible, at least during the period of delay, for management to exercise these prerogatives. A ten-day delay in the punitive suspension of a single employee does not.</p>
<p class="noindent">Artificial distinctions drawn by FLRA between substance and procedure were set aside in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, BATF v. FLRA</span>, 857 F.2d 819, 82-22 (D.C. Cir. 1988), overruling FLRA and determining nonnegotiable a proposal requiring management to delay recruitment or consideration of outside candidates for appointment until primary consideration was given to unit candidates:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "acting-at-all"/"directly interfere" tests, however, do not exist in a theoretical vacuum. The guidance provided in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Defense</span> [659 F.2d 1140] must be assessed not only in terms of the specific requirements a particular proposal would impose on management in the exercise of its protected rights, but on the circumstances which in real life allow it to exercise them. When a proposal stipulates procedures that so affect the environment within which an agency is allowed to act that it places the equivalent of a substantive restraint on its ability to act, that proposal has forfeited its claim to procedural purity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he effect of the proposal at issue in this case is to delay only <span class="Italic">part</span> of the employment process; and it is this asymmetrical impact that would directly interfere with management's ability to exercise the substantive rights guaranteed it by Congress. By delaying only one part of the hiring process, the proposal inhibits management's ability to look beyond the agency for potential employees, and it would be I to believe it had any other purpose.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The practical consequence of the proposal is clear: management may not consider or even solicit applications from outside the agency until <span id="page_577"></span>it has finished ranking and considering eligible agency applications. As a result, the agency will make its initial employment decisions before it is permitted to inform itself of the qualifications of the full range of potential candidates for the position it seeks to fill. Thus the effect of the proposal is to narrow the universe of candidates that section 7106(a)(2)(C) is intended to guarantee management the right to consider.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While it is true that the proposal does not prevent management from ultimately considering candidates from beyond the agency..., it would create pressure on even the most careful managers to promote a reasonably competent agency employee rather than leave a position unfilled during the time it would take to initiate and complete a late-starting search for a more qualified outside candidate. This result is inconsistent not only with section 7106(a)(2)(C), but also with the Act's larger goal of promoting "an effective and efficient Government."...</p>
<p class="noindent">Notwithstanding the occasional criticism of FLRA's "acting at all" test expressed by the D.C. Circuit, some courts defer to FLRA's standards, the Ninth Circuit stating in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1931 v. FLRA</span>, 802 F.2d 1159, 1163 (9th Cir. 1986):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the FLRA analysis, proposals that are cast in procedural language but are close to the border between procedure and substance are nonnegotiable if they would "directly interfere" with the agency's right to act in an area of reserved management rights. On the other hand, proposals that are more clearly procedural are nonnegotiable only if they would prevent the agency from "acting at all" in an area of reserved management rights....&#8197;Given the difficult task of distinguishing procedure from substance in the context of a section 7106 negotiability decision, the FLRA's two-test approach is a reasonable interpretation of the Act. That approach provides a logical and reasoned method for determining which union proposals interfere with an agency's reserved management rights and which merely concern the methods an agency will employ in exercising its management rights.</p>
