<h6 class="h6" id="sec6-56"><span class="space">(i)</span> Correction of Benefit; Placement in Wrong Retirement System</h6>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee may make a decision to retire but makes an improper decision concerning retirement options based on incorrect, or lack of correct agency advice. On occasion the Board will remedy the problem by correcting the retirement problem through retroactive adjustment in benefits or elections concerning or leading to the benefits, negating the other option of voiding the retirement and docketing an appeal against the employing agency. This option is chosen when it is very clear that the employee has no interest in returning to work and only desires to correct a retirement option that would properly have been available to the employee at the time of the retirement. In an overpayment case, <span class="Italic">Lessard v. OPM</span>, 43 MSPR 371 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds that the agency's choice of retirement options, made to the appellant's detriment after he was receiving disability payments from OPM, without advising him of the alternatives, entitles the appellant to have his overpayment recalculated using the beneficial alternative. <span class="Italic">Cf. Scharf v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 710 F.2d 1572, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (an agency's misinformation during retirement counseling, reasonably relied on and resulting in the petitioner's decreased total benefits upon disability retirement, entitles the petitioner to a recalculation of his benefits in his best interest).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In most cases similar to the one at hand where an apparent error by the employing agency misleads an employee into a choice of retirement date that results in an overpayment, the Board forwards the case to the regional office for docketing of a separate involuntary retirement appeal against the employing agency. <span class="Italic">See Siedschlag v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 517 (1988). Under the particular circumstances of this case, however, where there is no question as to the last date of duty or the desire to retire, and where a reasonable person presented with the options would choose the alternative which does not result in a significant loss of money, judicial efficiency and economy would not be served by redocketing the issue of the date of retirement as a separate appeal against the employing agency. The dates that the appellant last worked and exhausted his sick leave are not in question. Also, the appellant had received emergency disability retirement payments before the date that he exhausted his sick leave and the grant of disability retirement was a certainty. There was no reason for the employing agency to fail to accord the appellant the benefit of a lump sum payment of annual leave after he had exhausted his sick leave. Further, there are no adverse consequences to the employing agency resulting from the change in separation date. The agency was obligated to pay for the annual leave in any event. Thus, the Board finds that the date of separation can be modified based on the record adduced in the overpayment appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's situation is comparable to that of the employee in <span class="Italic">Keefe v. Office of Personnel Management</span> 19 M.S.P.R. 609 (1984). In that case, the employee had the option to have his disability annuity commence prior to the separation date given OPM by his employing agency, but did not do so because OPM and his employing agency failed to inform him of a new statute, effective between the date he could have been eligible for disability retirement and his actual separation date, which resulted in his annuity being decreased because he did not select the earlier separation date. In <span class="Italic">Keefe,</span> the Board found that the employee was entitled to a recalculation of his annuity. This case differs from <span class="Italic">Keefe</span> in that OPM did not affirmatively mislead the appellant. The omission of the employing agency in the appellant's case, however, is so clear and the result of the employing agency's action is so unreasonable that the Board finds that the appellant is entitled to have his overpayment recalculated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we remand this case to OPM for a new decision, recalculating the appellant's overpayment after modifying his separation date to July 24, 1986, the date on which he exhausted his sick leave.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A similar correction resulting from another overpayment appeal occurred in <span class="Italic">Hosford v. OPM</span>, 107 MSPR 418, 421-24 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7, 9-14, 2007 MSPB 295 (2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her pleadings and testimony below, the appellant made a claim that her disability retirement was involuntary based upon misinformation provided by her employing agency and OPM. Specifically, the appellant averred below that she would not have filed for a disability retirement if she had received accurate calculations of her estimated disability retirement benefits and if she had been informed that she qualified for an immediate optional retirement. The AJ did not address the appellant's involuntary retirement claim in the ID.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Scharf v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 710 F.2d 1572 (Fed. Cir. 1983), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that an optional retirement was involuntary where the employee received misleading information from his employing agency about the effect of his optional retirement's preceding his disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1574-75. The court held that the retirement was involuntary because the employee reasonably relied upon advice that was misleading under an objective standard. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1575. Although neither the Board nor the Federal Circuit has ever extended the holding in <span class="Italic">Scharf</span> to an allegedly involuntary disability retirement, we find that it is appropriate to do so under the circumstances presented in this case. The appellant argues that her employing agency informed her that her 7 years of service under CSRS were not creditable for purposes of determining retirement eligibility. She argues that, based on that misinformation from her employing agency, she believed that she did not have sufficient service credit to be eligible for immediate optional retirement. The appellant has therefore alleged that her decision to apply for disability retirement, rather than immediate optional retirement, was the result of her reasonable reliance on misleading advice from her employing agency. Accordingly, we find that she has raised a claim that her retirement was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Scharf,</span> 710 F.2d at 1575.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Normally, we would forward the appellant's involuntary retirement claim to the regional office for docketing as a new appeal against her former employing agency, DVA. <span class="Italic">See Siedschlag v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 38 M.S.P.R. 517, 520-21 (1988). However, the Board has recognized that, under certain circumstances, forwarding is unnecessary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Lessard v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 43 M.S.P.R. 371 (1990), a <span id="Page_1994"></span>disability retirement annuitant challenged the reconsideration decision from OPM finding that he had received an overpayment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 373. The Board found that the overpayment resulted from the failure of the annuitant's former employing agency to properly counsel him about the best way to proceed with his retirement application and choose his separation date. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 374. The Board found that the appellant in that case would have chosen an earlier separation date if he had been properly counseled because the earlier separation date would have resulted in an additional lump-sum payment to the appellant. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Board recognized that the normal procedure in a case of that type would be to forward the case to the regional office for docketing of a separate involuntary retirement appeal against the employing agency. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 375. However, the Board in <span class="Italic">Lessard</span> found that, under the particular circumstances of that case, judicial efficiency and economy would not be served by docketing a separate appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Instead, the Board simply ordered OPM to issue a new decision recalculating the appellant's overpayment after modifying his separation date. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the appellant's employing agency not only failed to inform her that she was eligible for immediate optional retirement, it affirmatively misled her by informing her that she was ineligible. It also failed to explain the financial consequences of applying for immediate optional retirement as opposed to disability retirement. <span class="Italic">See Cortinas v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 32 M.S.P.R. 513, 515 (1987) (an agency is required to provide information that is not only correct, but adequate in scope to allow an employee to make an informed decision to resign). The appellant's FERS annuity would have been computed under the same formula regardless of her choice. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8412(b), 8415(a), 8452(c)(2). However, the appellant would have been eligible to receive the FERS Retiree Annuity Supplement if she chose to apply for immediate optional retirement, but not if she chose to apply for disability retirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8421(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are unaware of any adverse financial consequences to the appellant should she convert her disability retirement into an immediate optional retirement. The appellant has indicated that she began receiving Social Security disability benefits in August 2006. If the appellant were entitled to Social Security old-age benefits, she would not be entitled to receive the FERS Retiree Annuity Supplement. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8421(a)(3)(B). However, there is no provision for reducing or eliminating the supplement due to the receipt of Social Security <span class="Italic">disability</span> benefits. The appellant was born on March 5, 1945, and therefore her entitlement to the supplement ceased at the end of March 2007, the month during which she turned 62. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8421(a)(3)(B). Nevertheless, she would have been entitled to the supplement from the effective date of her retirement in February 2006, until March 2007.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;It also does not appear that the calculation of the appellant's Social Security disability benefits would be impacted by a switch from disability retirement to immediate optional retirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 424a (setting forth the conditions under which Social Security disability benefits shall be reduced).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Had the appellant received complete and accurate information concerning her retirement options, she clearly would have chosen to apply for immediate optional retirement, rather than disability retirement, because the former option would have entitled her to receive the FERS Retiree Annuity Supplement until she reached age 62. We therefore find that judicial economy and efficiency would not be served by docketing a new involuntary retirement appeal. Instead, we order OPM to simply convert the appellant's February 4, 2006 disability retirement into an immediate optional retirement. <span class="Italic">See Lessard,</span> 43 M.S.P.R. at 375-76.</p>
