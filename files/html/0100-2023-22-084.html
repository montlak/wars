<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-85"><span class="space">2.</span> Equal Access to Justice Act</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The interplay between the Equal Access to Justice Act (5 USC 504 and 28 USC 2412), the fee provision of the Reform Act, 5 USC 7701(g), and the fee provision of the Back Pay Act, 5 USC 5596, is not readily apparent and generated some discussion, primarily in the Federal Circuit, secondarily by the Board. When it applies, EAJA supplements rather than supplants other statutory provisions for fees<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Gavette v. OPM</span>, 808 F.2d 1456, <span class="Italic">post</span>. EAJA covers time in court when the fee petition is processed by the court. EAJA covers fees for time spent defending fee applications. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fritz v. Principi</span>, 264 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (citing <span class="Italic">Brewer v. American Battle Monuments Comm'n</span>, 814 F.2d 1564 (Fed. Cir. 1987)). To be eligible for fees under EAJA, counsel fees must have been incurred; <span class="Italic">pro</span> <span class="Italic">se</span> litigants are ineligible for fees under EAJA, just as they are ineligible for fees under the Back Pay Act and the Reform Act. <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, FAA, 845 F.2d 976 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Cook v. Brown</span>, 68 F.3d 447, 450-51 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (EAJA provisions for reasonable attorney fees for court representation did not include fees for the services of an individual who was permitted to practice before the Court of Veterans Appeals but who was not a licensed attorney).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to the inapplicability of EAJA to <span class="Italic">pro se</span> litigants, under <span class="Italic">March v. Brown</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 95-7032):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. March also argues that his rights were violated because he did not receive equal pay for equal work. In other words, Mr. March contends that because he prepared his case and typed his brief, he deserves what a lawyer would have received. However, one does not become a lawyer simply by opening a book or sitting in front of a typewriter. Lawyers, as members of a profession, are paid for their expertise and experience gained from years studying in an accredited law school, passing the bar exam, and practicing law. That did not happen in this case and so we do not accept the "equal pay for equal work" argument. Furthermore, this case is governed by <span class="Italic">Cook</span> <span class="Italic">v. Brown</span>, 68 F.3d 447 (Fed. Cir. 1995), in which this Court held that the EAJA does not allow non-attorney practitioners in the CVA to recover attorney fees, even if those non-attorney practitioners are highly skilled, and are licensed by the CVA to practice in that court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, this Court has held that fees for the time spent by a petitioner acting <span class="Italic">pro</span> <span class="Italic">se</span> in an appeal not recoverable under the EAJA for <span class="Italic">pro se</span> petitioners. <span class="Italic">See Naekel v.</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 845 F.2d 976 (Fed. Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Historical background of the EAJA is traced in <span class="Italic">Scarborough v. Principi</span>, 124 S. Ct. 1856, 1861 (2004). The EAJA utilizes an adjudicative standard that appears somewhat easier to meet than the "interest of justice" standard. EAJA permits recovery of some expenses not encompassed by the Reform Act and Back Pay Act. But EAJA limits the maximum hourly rate, while no limit other than reasonableness applies to Reform Act or Back Pay Act applications. The Back Pay Act permits a court to award fees for time spent before the Board. EAJA defines a petitioning "party" to mean an individual with a net worth of less than $2,000,000, 28 USC 2412(d)(2)(B), and applicants may be required to provide detailed accountings of their net worth to qualify for entitlement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bazalo v. West</span>, 150 F.3d 1380, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (noting the jurisdictional nature of a timely filing of an EAJA application but permitting the retroactive amendment of an EAJA application to satisfy the requirement of a net worth statement); <span class="Italic">Fields v. United States</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 94-5026) (referencing <span class="Italic">United States v. Harper</span>, 569 F. Supp. 602 (E.D. Pa. 1983) (refer to Federal Circuit Form 20 and to Federal Circuit Rule 47.7 if an EAJA petition is being filed in that court)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Reform Act is relied on by the Board to award fees for time spent litigating cases before the Board; EAJA and the Back Pay Act provide authority for a court award of counsel fees (and, as to EAJA, for an award by the Board of fees when an ALJ prevails in a complaint brought against her). The complex relation of these statutes is discussed in the decisions that follow. The prolix discussion of EAJA that follows should not obscure the point that it is the Reform Act, as amended, or the Back Pay Act, and not EAJA, that provides the basis for almost all fee awards in Board litigation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gavette v. OPM</span>, 808 F.2d 1456, 1459-62, 1464-65 (Fed. Cir. 1986), provides a comprehensive view of the application of EAJA to civil service cases, noting particularly that the statute provides no authority to MSPB to grant fees, but that the statute authorizes a court to award fees for counsel's time in court <span id="Page_4613"></span>(although the court may not use EAJA to award fees for time before the Board):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, there are four situations to which the EAJA applies. Section 2412(b) of 28 USC extends the common law and statutes which made private parties liable for fees and expenses, so that the United States is liable to the same extent that the private party would be liable. Section 504 of 5 USC authorizes an agency that conducts an "adversary adjudication" to award fees and expenses incurred in connection with that proceeding. Section 2412(d)(1) of 28 USC authorizes a court to award fees and expenses incurred in a "civil action," i.e., in court proceedings. Finally, section 2412(d)(3) of 28 USC authorizes a court in "any action for judicial review of an adversary adjudication" to award fees and expenses incurred in connection with the adversary adjudication.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The 1980 EAJA rested on the premise that individuals and small businesses "may be deterred from seeking review of, or defending against unreasonable governmental action because of the expense involved in securing the vindication of their rights." The purpose of the EAJA was to "reduce the deterrents and disparity by entitling certain prevailing parties to recover an award of attorney fees, expert witness fees and other expenses against the United States."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The 1980 EAJA made two primary changes in the existing law in order to accomplish its purpose. First, in 28 USC 2412(b), the EAJA extended the common law and statutory exceptions to make the United States liable for attorney fees to the same extent that private parties would be liable....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, in 5 USC 504 and 28 USC 2412(d), the EAJA made a "significant change in the existing law regarding attorney fees by establishing a general statutory exception for an award of fees against the Government."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 504 of 5 USC authorizes the award of attorney fees and expenses incurred in "adversary adjudication" in administrative proceedings. "Adversary adjudication," in turn, is defined in 5 USC 554(a). "Adversary adjudication" excludes cases involving the "tenure of an employee."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 2412(d)(1) of 28 USC authorizes the award of attorney fees incurred in "civil actions," i.e., in court proceedings....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Section 2412(d)(3) further authorizes the court, in "any action for judicial review of an adversary adjudication" to award fees and expenses incurred in administrative proceedings to the same extent authorized by 5 USC 504.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A panel of this court held in <span class="Italic">Olsen v. Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau</span>, that the EAJA does not apply to proceedings before the board in cases involving "tenure." The <span class="Italic">Olsen</span> decision was affirmed in <span class="Italic">Austin v. Dept. of Commerce</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EAJA applies only to "civil actions" and to "adversary adjudications." A civil action is one which involves judicial proceedings; thus, an appeal to the board from an agency is not a civil action. An "adversary adjudication" excludes determinations involving the "tenure of an employee."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, 5 USC 504 (concerning "adversary adjudication") does not apply to the board proceedings because the case does involve tenure. Also inapplicable is section 2412(d)(3) of 28 USC, which authorizes courts to award attorney fees and expenses incurred in certain administrative proceedings, because the present case is not an "action for judicial review of an adversary adjudication."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We treat Gavette's request for attorney fees for proceedings before the board as a request under the Back Pay Act. Gavette may recover reasonable attorney fees if he shows that he was the prevailing party and that an award of fees would be in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, a panel of this court held in <span class="Italic">Olsen</span>, and another panel affirmed in <span class="Italic">Austin</span>, that the EAJA applies to appeals from the board to the Federal Circuit, because such appeals are judicial proceedings or "civil actions" under 28 USC 2412(d)(1)(A). We reconsider the applicability of the EAJA <span class="Italic">in banc</span>, at OPM's suggestion, and we reaffirm <span class="Italic">Olsen</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Back Pay Act...provides for attorney fees in a narrower set of circumstances than those covered by the EAJA. The Back Pay Act was not intended to provide for vigorous enforcement of the statute; it authorizes an award of attorney fees only when "in the interest of justice," a more difficult standard which is discretionary with the court and which places the burden on the employee. Section 2412(d)(1)(A) of the EAJA, on the other hand, requires the award of attorney fees in all cases where the employee prevails, unless the Government shows that its position was substantially justified. Thus, the EAJA covers situations which would not be covered by the Back Pay Act; the EAJA permissibly "<span class="Italic">supplements</span>, and does not impermissibly replace or supersede, the pre-existing award provision" of the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]here is no prohibition in either statute against the overlap in coverage in appeals from the board to this court.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit explained <span class="Italic">Gavette</span> in a decision considering fees under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, <span class="Italic">Beck by Beck v. Secretary of DHHS</span>, 924 F.2d 1029, 1037-38 (Fed. Cir. 1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Gavette</span> we held that an award of attorney fees under the EAJA was available in an appeal from the Merit Systems Protection Board to the Federal Circuit, even though a fee award might also have been available under the Back Pay Act, 5 USC 5596 (1988), which awarded fees whenever it would be "in the interest of justice" to do so. Our reasoning was that the Back Pay Act provided for attorney fees "in a narrower set of circumstances than those covered by the EAJA," and therefore the EAJA did not "impermissibly replace or supersede" the Back Pay Act. 808 F.2d at 1464-65. Where "the EAJA covers situations which would not be covered by" another fee statute, we reasoned, the relatively easy standard of 2412(d) could be used to supplement the other statute's fee provision....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Gavette</span> thus stands only for the limited proposition that the EAJA may be used to supplement another statute's attorney fee provision where the other statute has a more difficult or narrow standard for awarding fees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The unavailability of EAJA to support a fee award from a labor arbitrator who reversed an adverse action was noted in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3599 v. EEOC</span>, 920 F.3d 794, 797 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2019):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its opening brief, the union argued at several points that the Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 504; 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2412(d), governs the attorney fee award in this case. The union did not press that argument in its reply brief or at oral argument, and it is clear that it is unavailing. The Equal Access to Justice Act applies only to a "civil action," 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2412(d)(1)(A), or an "adversary adjudication," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 504(a)(1).

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hubbard v. United States</span>, 480 F.3d 1327, 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2007), required that EAJA fee awards reflect results achieved in litigation. [The case and that topic are discussed later is this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-22-140.html#sec15-140">Evidence of Reasonableness; Fee Agreement; Result Achieved</a>."] At issue in <span class="Italic">Wagner v. Shinseki</span>, 640 F.3d 1255, 1358-62 (Fed. Cir. 2011), was the basis for EAJA compensation for the time of counsel recovering EAJA fees--"fees on fees"--the court determining, in a case involving a claim for veterans benefits, that once the EAJA fee entitlement standard is met in the underlying case, further reexamination of statutory entitlement for the time litigating over EAJA fees would be unnecessary except to the extent necessary to determine any challenge to the reasonableness of the time invested:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The primary purpose of the EAJA is to ensure that litigants "will not be deterred from seeking review of, or defending against, unjustified governmental action because of the expense involved." <span class="Italic">Scarborough v. Principi</span>, 541 U.S. 401, 407 (2004) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The statute plays a particularly important role in the veterans' adjudicatory system:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Removing [deterrents to seeking judicial review] is imperative in the veterans benefits context, which is intended to be uniquely pro-claimant, and in which veterans generally are not represented by counsel before the [regional office] and the board. [The] EAJA is a vital complement to this system designed to aid veterans, because it helps to ensure that they will seek an appeal when the VA has failed in its duty to aid them or has otherwise erroneously denied them the benefits that they have earned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Kelly</span>, 463 F.3d at 1353 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"[A]n award of fees incurred in every stage of litigation is consistent with the legislative purpose of the EAJA...." <span class="Italic">Fritz v. Principi,</span> 264 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Thus, a prevailing party in a veterans case is entitled to an award of fees not only for hours devoted to the underlying merits litigation, but also for attorney time reasonably expended defending an initial EAJA application. <span class="Italic">Comm'r, Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Serv. v. Jean,</span> 496 U.S. 154, 161-62 (1990) ("<span class="Italic">Jean</span>"); <span class="Italic">Fritz</span>, 264 F.3d at 1377. Fees awarded for the defense of an initial fee application are commonly referred to as "supplemental fees" or "fees on fees."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Wagner contends that the Veterans Court misinterpreted 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; <span id="Page_4614"></span>2412(d)(1)(A) when it denied, in full, his petition seeking supplemental fees. He notes that he was partially successful in defending against the Secretary's challenge to his initial EAJA application, and argues that he should be awarded supplemental fees commensurate with the degree of success he achieved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree. In <span class="Italic">Jean</span>, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the argument that a claimant could be awarded supplemental fees only if the government's challenge to an initial EAJA application was not substantially justified. 496 U.S. at 158-62. The Court explained that "[a]ny given civil action can have numerous phases," but that "the EAJA--like other fee-shifting statutes--favors treating a case as an inclusive whole, rather than as atomized line-items." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 161-62. Recognizing that "requiring courts to make a separate finding of 'substantial justification' regarding the Government's opposition to fee requests would multiply litigation," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 163, the Court concluded that only one "threshold" determination that the government's position in the underlying merits litigation was not substantially justified is required, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 160. Accordingly, "a party who prevails in fee litigation under [the] EAJA may recover fees for legal services rendered during the fee litigation even if some of the Government's positions regarding the proper fee were 'substantially justified,' i.e., the district court need not make a second finding of no substantial justification before awarding fees for the fee contest itself." <span class="Italic">Scarborough,</span> 541 U.S. at 419 n.6 (citing <span class="Italic">Jean,</span> 496 U.S. at 160-62).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When calculating a supplemental fee award, a court is required to consider "the relationship between the amount of the fee awarded and the results obtained" through the initial EAJA application. <span class="Italic">Jean</span>, 496 U.S. at 163 n.10. Thus, supplemental fees should be denied "to the extent" that a claimant's defense of his original fee application proves unsuccessful. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Conversely, however, supplemental fees should be granted to the extent that a claimant successfully defends his original fee application. <span class="Italic">See Fritz</span>, 264 F.3d at 1377 (emphasizing that a veteran is "entitled to attorney fees incurred throughout the litigation, including those incurred in preparation and defense of the fee application to the extent those fees are defensible" (footnote omitted)). To deny a litigant all supplemental fees simply because the defense of his original fee application was not wholly successful unjustifiably dilutes the value of the original EAJA fee award and is contrary to the fundamental objectives of the EAJA. <span class="Italic">See Orange Blossom Ltd. P'ship v. S. Cal. Sunbelt Developers, Inc.,</span> 608 F.3d 456, 463 (9th Cir. 2010) (explaining that "it would be inconsistent [with the purpose of fee-shifting statutes] to dilute a fees award by refusing to compensate attorneys for the time they reasonably spent in establishing their rightful claim to the fee" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)); <span class="Italic">Prandini v. Nat'l Tea Co.,</span> 585 F.2d 47, 53 (3d Cir. 1978) ("If an attorney is required to expend time litigating his fee claim, yet may not be compensated for that time, the attorney's effective rate for all the hours expended on the case will be correspondingly decreased."); <span class="Italic">see also Norman v. Hous. Auth. of Montgomery,</span> 836 F.2d 1292, 1305 (11th Cir. 1988) ("To paraphrase the acute observation of base-ball great Yogi Berra, a case ain't over till it's over. This means that...counsel are entitled to compensation until all benefits obtained by the litigation are in hand.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Courts should look to the framework established in <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 435-39, when calculating an appropriate supplemental fee award. <span class="Italic">See Jean</span>, 496 U.S. at 161-63. In setting the fee, "the most critical factor is the degree of success obtained." <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 436. Thus, where a claimant "has achieved only partial or limited success," a court "may attempt to identify specific hours that should be eliminated, or it may simply reduce the award to account for the limited success." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 436-37. Because <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> requires a court to calibrate the amount of attorney fees to the degree of success a claimant has achieved, it is generally appropriate to make an award of supplemental fees that is commensurate with the degree of success obtained on the original fee application. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Schwarz v. Sec'y of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.</span>, 73 F.3d 895, 909 (9th Cir. 1995) (affirming an award of 50 percent of the supplemental fees sought by a claimant where she obtained approximately 50 percent of the fees claimed in her initial fee application); <span class="Italic">Spellan v. Bd. of Educ.</span>, 69 F.3d 828, 829 (7th Cir. 1995) (emphasizing that a claimant's success on his original fee application "is a material consideration in adjudicating the amount of fees recoverable in litigating an attorneys' fee award"); <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Gomez</span>, 45 F.3d 1365, 1367-69 (9th Cir. 1995) (concluding that a district court properly awarded 87 percent of the supplemental fees requested where claimants received 87 percent of the fees sought in their original fee application); <span class="Italic">In re Burlington N., Inc. Emp't Practices Litig.</span>, 832 F.2d 430, 433-36 (7th Cir. 1987) (concluding that the district court properly reduced a fees on fees award based upon the degree of success obtained in the original fee litigation); <span class="Italic">Harris v. McCarthy</span>, 790 F.2d 753, 758-59 (9th Cir. 1986) (affirming a district court's decision to award claimants 11.5 percent of their supplemental fee request since they had obtained only 11.5 percent of the fees requested in their original fee application); <span class="Italic">Institutionalized Juveniles v. Sec'y of Pub. Welfare</span>, 758 F.2d 897, 924-25 (3d Cir. 1985) (concluding that the district court properly reduced fees on fees by 12.5 percent where claimants did not obtain complete success on their original fee application); <span class="Italic">Mercer v. Duke Univ.</span>, 301 F. Supp.2d 454, 469 (M.D.N.C. 2004) (reducing a request for supplemental fees by 20 percent because the initial fee request was reduced by 20 percent), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 401 F.3d 199 (4th Cir. 2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Wagner was partially successful in defending against the government's challenge to his initial fee application, and he is entitled to supplemental fees commensurate with the degree of success he achieved. While "the relative degree of success in litigating for merits fees should bear upon the size of the fees-on-fees award," <span class="Italic">Thompson</span>, 45 F.3d at 1368, there is no justification for denying a supplemental fee request in its entirety simply because the claimant's initial fee application was not wholly successful.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be sure, a court has broad discretion in awarding attorney fees, <span class="Italic">see Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 437, and is not bound, in all cases, to make an award of supplemental fees that is proportionate to the degree of success obtained on the original EAJA application. A litigant is only entitled to "reasonable" attorney fees, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2412(d)(2)(A), and in fashioning a reasonable supplemental fee award a court may properly discount any "[e]xorbitant" or "unfounded" fee applications. <span class="Italic">Jean,</span> 496 U.S. at 163; <span class="Italic">see also Fritz</span>, 264 F.3d at 1377 (emphasizing that a supplemental fee award can be reduced "to the extent that the applicant ultimately fails to prove justification for each item of fee claimed" or if the fee application is "procedurally defective"). On remand, the Veterans Court will have the opportunity to consider whether such factors warrant a reduction in Wagner's supplemental fee award. If the court decides to discount Wagner's supplemental fee request, however, it needs to provide a reasoned explanation as to why particular attorney hours should be excluded. <span class="Italic">See Hensley,</span> 461 U.S. at 437 (explaining that a court must "provide a concise but clear explanation of its reasons for the fee award"); <span class="Italic">United States v. Eleven Vehicles, Their Equip. &#x0026; Accessories</span>, 200 F.3d 203, 213 (3d Cir. 2000) (emphasizing that a trial court cannot deny supplemental fees without providing an adequate explanation as to why such fees are "excessive, redundant [or] otherwise unnecessary" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In denying Wagner's application for supplemental fees, the Veterans Court stated that "[i]t would be anomalous to reduce an [initial EAJA] award by some $3,000 and then award nearly that amount to the losing party simply for putting up a fight." <span class="Italic">Supplemental Fees Decision</span>, 2010 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 197, at *3. We disagree. As the Supreme Court made clear in <span class="Italic">Jean</span>, "[t]he EAJA applies to a wide range of awards in which the cost of litigating fee disputes would equal or exceed the cost of litigating the merits of the claim." 496 U.S. at 163-64 (footnote omitted). Thus, regardless of whether Wagner could recoup, through his supplemental fee application, an amount that is nearly equal to the amount that he was denied on his original fee application, he is entitled to be compensated for all hours reasonably expended successfully defending his original fee request. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 164-65 ("The Government's general interest in protecting the federal fisc is subordinate to the specific statutory goals of encouraging private parties to vindicate their rights and curbing excessive regulation and the unreasonable exercise of Government authority."
