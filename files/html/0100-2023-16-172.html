<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-172"><span class="space">a.</span> Flagrant Misconduct</h5>
<p class="noindent">Present in some cases that involve discipline of union officials is the theme of flagrant misconduct. Early on, FLRA stated its position on the limits of permissible conduct by union officials engaged in labor management activities, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Bremerton Metal Trades Council,</span> 2 FLRA 54, 55 (1979):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the Authority's view flagrant misconduct by an employee, even though occurring during the course of protected activity, may justify disciplinary action by the employer. On the other hand, not every impropriety committed during such activity is beyond the ambit of protected activity. The employee's right to engage in protected activity permits leeway for impulsive behavior, which is balanced against the employer's right to maintain order and respect of its supervisory staff on the job site. The authority neither defends nor endorses the use of intemperate language in the conduct of labor management relations in the federal sector. However, under the circumstances of this case, the authority finds that the nature of the steward's conduct and language was not sufficiently flagrant to justify removing it from the ambit of protected activity. In this regard, the authority notes the uncontested findings and conclusions of the ALJ to the effect that for a period of approximately one month immediately preceding the incident the respondent, and most particularly the general foreman, had engaged in a pervasive course of conduct constituting, among other things, interference with, restraint and coercion of employees and union stewards in the exercise of their protected right to utilize the contractually established grievance procedure. In these circumstances, the authority concludes that the steward's conduct was not sufficiently flagrant to remove it from the ambit of protected activity, and, in agreement with the ALJ, finds that the respondent violated section 19(a)(1) of the Executive Order 11491, as amended, by suspending him for such conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1401"></span>"'Where an agency is alleged to have committed a ULP for disciplining an employee who was engaged in protected activity, "a necessary part of the [agency's] defense" against the ULP allegation is that the individual's actions constituted flagrant misconduct or otherwise exceeded the bounds of protected activity.'" <span class="Italic">Bremerton MTC and Puget Sound Naval Shipyard</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-21.html">73 FLRA 90</a>, 93 (2022) (quoting <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 64 FLRA 365 (2009)).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOD, DMA Aerospace Ctr. and NFFE Local 1827</span>, 17 FLRA 71, 81 (1985) (ALJ Decision), adopted a factor analysis for determining the existence of flagrant misconduct:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The various factors to be considered in striking the balance should include (1) the place and subject matter of the discussion, (2) whether the employee's outburst was impulsive or designed, (3) whether the outburst was in anyway provoked by the employer's conduct, and (4) the nature of the intemperate language and conduct. <span class="Italic">Cf. Atlanta Steel Co</span>., 102 LRRM 1247 (NLRB, 1979). The balance must be struck in each case with an eye to the special facts presented by it.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the employee assumes the mantle of union representative, he or she is permitted a degree of action and speech that could otherwise be considered insubordination. Under <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 53 FLRA 1751, 1755 (1998), the "flagrant misconduct" defense does not, however, excuse an agency where it was motivated by protected activity and claims a separate, legitimate justification for the discipline. Assuming the typical case involving alleged misconduct by the representative, the issue becomes not whether the deeds or words of the representative engaged in representational activities are improper, as judged by the standards generally applied in the workplace, but whether the conduct or speech is flagrantly improper. Flagrant misconduct arises as a defense to alleged discrimination in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2) of the Statute. If that is not the issue and another matter, e.g., the conduct of a management representative at a meeting is at issue, the question of flagrancy of conduct of union officials need not be addressed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons FCI Safford and AFGE Local 2313</span>, 59 FLRA 318 (2003). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-584.html#sec6-585">Union Officials</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Fed. Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 709</span>, 53 FLRA 1500, 1514-20 (1998), developed the concept of flagrancy in the context of a suspension that followed when the union official walked out of a counseling session that arose as a result of union activities conducted by that individual:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Letterkenny Army Depot and International Brotherhood</span> <span class="Italic">of Police Officers, Local 358</span>, 35 FLRA 113, 118 (1990), the Authority set forth the standard that the General Counsel must meet in order to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination against an employee for union activity. The General Counsel must prove that the employee against whom the discriminatory action was taken was engaged in protected activity, and that the protected activity was the motivating factor in the agency's treatment of the employee in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment. Even if the General Counsel makes the required <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing, an agency will not be found to have violated section 7116(a)(2) if the agency can demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) there was a legitimate justification for its action; and (2) the same action would have been taken even in the absence of protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the alleged discrimination concerns discipline for conduct occurring when the employee was acting in his/her capacity as a union representative, however, a necessary part of the respondent's defense is that the conduct constituted flagrant misconduct.[10] <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 17 FLRA at 80; <span class="Italic">United States Forces Korea/Eighth United States</span> <span class="Italic">Army and National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1363</span>, 17 FLRA 718 (1985). <span class="Italic">See also Department of the Navy, Puget</span> <span class="Italic">Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington and Bremerton</span> <span class="Italic">Metal Trades Council, AFL-CIO</span>, 2 FLRA 54 (1979) (interpreting Executive Order 11491). That is, when it is established that a respondent's alleged unlawful discrimination was motivated by the content of protected activity itself, establishing flagrant misconduct is a necessary element of any defense.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Grissom Air Force Base</span>, <span class="Italic">Indiana</span>, 51 FLRA 7, 11-12 (1995) <span class="Italic">(Grissom)</span>, the Authority stated the following, in relevant part, regarding the test for determining whether activities constitute flagrant misconduct:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">In determining whether an employee has engaged in flagrant misconduct, the Authority balances the employee's right to engage in protected activity, which 'permits leeway for impulsive behavior...against the employer's right to maintain order and respect for its supervisory staff on the jobsite., <span class="Italic">Department of Defense, Defense Mapping Agency</span> <span class="Italic">Aerospace Center, St. Louis, Missouri</span>, 17 FLRA 71, 80 (1985) <span class="Italic">(Defense Mapping Agency) (quoting Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Navy, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton</span>, <span class="Italic">Washington</span>, 2 FLRA 54, 55 (1979)<span class="Italic"> (Puget Sound)</span>. Relevant factors in striking this balance include: (1) the place and subject matter of the discussion; (2) whether the employee's outburst was impulsive or designed; (3) whether the outburst was in any way provoked by the employer's conduct; and (4) the nature of the intemperate language and conduct....&#8197;However, the foregoing factors need not be cited or applied in any particular way in determining whether an action constitutes flagrant misconduct....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In nearly all cases, the employee involved in a case where flagrant misconduct is examined is a union representative. However, in <span class="Italic">Department of Defense, Defense Mapping Aerospace</span> <span class="Italic">Center, St. Louis, Missouri</span>, 17 FLRA 71, 80 (1985) <span class="Italic">(Defense</span> <span class="Italic">Mapping Agency)</span>, an employee attending a grievance meeting as a grievant--not a union representative--was disciplined for speech occurring in the meeting, and the Authority held that the discipline was violative of the Statute because the employee had not engaged in flagrant misconduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If flagrant misconduct is established, then the conduct loses its protection under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Defense</span> <span class="Italic">Mapping Agency</span>. This is consistent with precedent arising in similar cases under the National Labor Relations Act. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Spartan Plastics, Inc.</span>, 269 NLRB 546, 551 (1984) (National Labor Relations Board held that an employer's proof of flagrant misconduct "'remove[s] [the employees] activities from any protection they might otherwise have enjoyed.'") (quoting, <span class="Italic">Fibracan Corp.</span>, 259 NLRB 161 (1981)). <span class="Italic">Cf. Old</span> <span class="Italic">Dominion Branch No. 496, National Association of Letter</span> <span class="Italic">Carriers, AFL-CIO v. Austin</span>, 418 U.S. 264, 283 (1974) ("federal law gives a union a license to use intemperate, abusive, or insulting language without fear of restraint or penalty if it believes such rhetoric to be an effective means to make its point."). In effect, in such a case, it is not legitimate for an agency to discipline for conduct occurring during the course of protected activity that is not flagrant misconduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether to apply the flagrant misconduct doctrine, the Authority examines, as relevant here, whether the employee was acting in his or her official union capacity at the time of the allegedly protected activities. <span class="Italic">See U.S</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security</span> <span class="Italic">Administration, Baltimore, Maryland and Social Security</span> <span class="Italic">Administration, Detroit Teleservice Center, Detroit, Michigan</span>, 42 FLRA 22, 23-24 (1991); <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, Internal</span> <span class="Italic">Revenue Service, Andover Service Center, Andover</span>, <span class="Italic">Massachusetts</span>, 13 FLRA 481, 489-90 (1983). In essence, if the Union President was acting in her capacity as a Union representative during the counseling meeting, then her conduct during that meeting constituted Union activity. For the following reasons, we conclude that the Union President was acting in her capacity as a Union representative during the meeting.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the counseling meeting was called for the express purpose of addressing the Union President's speech and conduct during the overtime incident. There is no dispute that, as found by the Judge, the employee was acting as a Union President during the overtime incident. As a result, the counseling meeting was called and occurred solely as a result of the Union president's actions as Union President, and the Union President was called to the meeting solely because of her position in the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, none of the reasons given by the Judge, or the bases asserted by the Respondent, persuade us that the Union President was not entitled, or had surrendered rights, to protection under the Statute. Despite the Judge's finding that the employee was acting as a Union President during the overtime incident, he concluded that the employee was not acting as a Union representative during the counseling meeting because: (1) her actions during the counseling meeting were disrespectful; and (2) during the oral response meeting, she did not specifically assert that her presence was required at the counseling meeting because of her activities as a Union representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the employee's actions are relevant to determining whether, as Union President, she engaged in flagrant misconduct, her conduct does not transform the nature of the meeting itself. If the Union President was acting as a Union representative during the meeting, her <span class="Italic">conduct</span> does not change her role. In this regard, "the nature of the intemperate language and conduct" is a factor in determining flagrant misconduct. <span class="Italic">Grissom</span>, 51 FLRA at 12. It is not a factor in determining whether the employee was acting in her capacity as a Union representative when she engaged in the conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, with respect to the Union President's failure to subsequently explain at the oral response meeting her presence as Union President at the counseling meeting, this too is not relevant to determining whether she was acting as Union President during the counseling meeting. It is not asserted or apparent that her statements at the oral response meeting constitute an admission or a waiver of her position as Union President. Indeed, as the Judge recognized, the Union President asserted repeatedly during the oral response meeting that the counseling meeting constituted unlawful retaliation. The Warden himself acknowledged a connection between the Union President's speech and conduct during the overtime incident and her actions during the counseling meeting when he stated that "[th]e issue is that the whole thing began" with the overtime incident. Moreover, the reason the Union President believed the counseling meeting was "illegal" was because it was retaliatory. Although <span id="Page_1402"></span>it is unclear whether the retaliation alleged by the Union President was related to the overtime incident or the Union meeting incident, each of these are activities in which the employee was involved as the Union President.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondent Prison asserts two additional reasons for finding that the employee was not acting in her capacity as Union President during the counseling meeting: (1) the Union President brought a Union representative with her to the counseling meeting; and (2) the Union President must have attended the meeting "in her status as an employee" because:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">It cannot be otherwise: agencies don't impose discipline on union officials qua union officials--discipline is imposed on <span class="Italic">employees</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Neither of these arguments supports a conclusion that the employee did not attend the counseling meeting as a Union President.&#x2003;With regard to the first, there is no authority cited or apparent for concluding that a union representative loses the protection of the Statute in a meeting if he or she is represented by another union official. In addition, we note that the Union President asserted during the oral response session that the Union representative attended the counseling meeting as a "witness," not a representative. Respondent Prison's second assertion is too circular to be persuasive. In essence, Respondent Prison asserts that the Union President attended the counseling meeting solely as an employee because, if she attended as a Union President, the discipline is unlawful. This argument would, in turn, render invalid the flagrant misconduct doctrine (and perhaps <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> itself) in all situations where the union representative disciplined is also an employee. As it is not apparent how an agency could discipline a non-employee, and as it appears that many union representatives are employees, the effect of accepting Respondent's argument would be to immunize agencies from violations of section 7116(a)(2) in discipline situations involving union representatives. We do not believe that this would further the purposes and policies of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we conclude that the Union President attended the counseling meeting in her capacity as Union president. As such, her actions during that meeting are protected unless they constitute flagrant misconduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the four factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Grissom</span>, 51 FLRA at 11-12, quoted and restated above, we conclude that the Union President's action in walking out of the counseling meeting, although disrespectful did not constitute flagrant misconduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Union President's conduct during the counseling meeting occurred in the Associate Warden's Complex, not in a public area, and the subject matter of the meeting was Union activity (the overtime incident). Second, the conduct was clearly an impulsive, not a designed, reaction to the Associate Warden's decision to issue a counseling letter to the Union President for her activity as Union President. Third, the conduct was directly provoked by the Associate Warden's refusal to recognize the protected nature of the Union President's activity. Fourth, although the decision to leave the meeting was imprudent, the Authority grants union representatives leeway when they are acting as union representatives. <span class="Italic">See Department of the Air Force, Grissom Air Force Base, Indiana and America Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO</span>, 51 FLRA 7, 20-21 (1995) (union official did not commit flagrant misconduct when he used profanity to his supervisor); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, National Border Patrol Council and U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, El Paso Border Patrol Sector</span>, 44 FLRA 1395 (1992) (union official did not commit flagrant misconduct in using profanity); <span class="Italic">U.S. Air Force Logistics Command, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and American Federation of Government Employees</span>, Local 916, AFL-CIO, 34 FLRA 385 (1990) (union official did not commit flagrant misconduct when he refused to comply with a security police order to leave a work area); <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy, Puget Sound Nava Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington</span>, 2 FLRA 54 (1979) (union official was improperly suspended for using profanity to his supervisor).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondent Prison's exaggerated assertion that anarchy will result from applying the flagrant misconduct doctrine to allow an employee, such as the Union President, to leave a meeting that the employee deems illegal is totally unsupported. The context in which the flagrant misconduct doctrine applies is inherently narrow--the doctrine applies only in situations where a union official is acting as a union official. Given these very limited circumstances, there is no basis for the consequences Respondent Prison asserts will flow from a ruling that the Union President's actions are protected under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the record establishes that the Union President was engaged in protected activity, and that the content of the protected activity was the basis for her suspension, the General Counsel has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. Respondent Prison has not established that the Union President's conduct at the counseling session constituted flagrant misconduct and, thus, has not shown a legitimate justification for suspending the Union President. Accordingly, Respondent Prison has not rebutted the General Counsel's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. We conclude that the General Counsel has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that Respondent Prison discriminated against the Union President for her protected activity.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether an employee has engaged in flagrant misconduct,[40] the Authority balances the employee’s right to engage in protected activity, which "permits leeway for impulsive behavior,...against the employer’s right to maintain order and respect for its supervisory staff."[41] Relevant factors in striking this balance include: (1) the place and subject matter of the discussion; (2) whether the employee’s conduct was impulsive or designed; (3) whether the conduct was in any way provoked by the employer's conduct; and (4) the nature of the intemperate language or conduct.[42] The Authority need not cite or apply these factors in any particular way in determining whether conduct exceeds the bounds of the Statute’s protection.[43] Additionally, the Authority determines whether conduct exceeds the boundaries of protected activity on a case-by-case basis, considering the totality of the circumstances.[44]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In applying the first factor, the Authority considers the place where the incident occurred and the subject matter of the discussion.[45] Regarding "place," the Authority has repeatedly held that heated encounters in closed-door meetings are more protected,[46] while conduct that disrupts the work unit is less protected because it jeopardizes the employer’s right to maintain order and respect for its supervisory staff on the jobsite.[47] Here, rather than expressing her concerns in an individual meeting with a supervisor, the grievant raised them during a sexual-harassment briefing attended by coworkers and supervisors. The Arbitrator found, and we agree, that the grievant, by electing to raise her concerns in front of other employees, "disrupted the briefing" and "impeded the Agency’s obligation under law...to maintain a work environment free of harassing, offensive behavior and words."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[45]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Def. Mapping</span>, 17 FLRA at 81.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[46]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. (noting that a closed-door meeting between an employee and supervisor "weigh[ed] heavily" in favor of the employee retaining protection for her statements to her supervisor).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As for the "subject matter," the Union contends that the grievant raised some of her concerns in a representative capacity after hearing from other bargaining-unit employees. Nevertheless, the grievant engaged in behavior that the Arbitrator found to be a violation of the Anti-Harassment Policy during a briefing on compliance with that same policy. According to the Arbitrator, the grievant’s actions not only "created an uncomfortable atmosphere for attendees," but also "denied [them] the opportunity to ask questions and share information about sexual harassment[,] such as identifying and reporting it."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, even if the grievant was acting in a representative capacity, she undermined this representational function by raising these concerns in an inappropriate place and manner. Accordingly, we find that the first factor weighs heavily against the grievant retaining the protection of the Statute.[53]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[53]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See VA Med. Ctr</span>., 32 FLRA 777, 778 (1988) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting) (denying exceptions to an arbitrator’s award upholding disciplinary action against union official for "loud, disruptive behavior" in the workplace). <span class="Italic">Cf. U.S. DOD, Def. Cont. Mgmt. Agency, Orlando, Fla</span>., 59 FLRA 223, 227 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting) (holding that a union official did not engage in flagrant misconduct during a heated exchange with a supervisor, in part, because the exchange occurred behind closed doors and did not interfere with the work of the office).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second factor considers whether the conduct was impulsive or designed.[54] The Arbitrator found that at least some of the grievant’s conduct was "planned." Specifically, the Arbitrator credited the briefing presenter’s description that the grievant arrived "with the obvious intent to distract and manipulate the meeting in an unproductive and inappropriate direction." Accordingly, we find that application of the second factor supports the Arbitrator’s conclusion that the grievant’s conduct exceeded the boundaries of protected activity.[57]</p>

FAA</span>, 64 FLRA at 413-14 (holding that a union official’s conduct did not exceed the bounds of protected activity where the official used profanity to a supervisor, in part, because the profanity was due to his frustration in the moment and was not planned).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The third factor considers whether the conduct was in any way provoked by the employer’s conduct.[58] The Arbitrator found that the grievant’s behavior during the briefing was "unprovoked...[and] manipulative." Employees that attended the briefing described the presenter as "professional and polite," and noted that, in response to the grievant’s conduct, he "kept himself calm" and was not "disrespectful or inappropriate." Thus, this factor also supports the Arbitrator’s conclusion that the grievant exceeded the boundaries of protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[58]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Def. Mapping</span>, 17 FLRA at 81.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fourth factor considers the nature of the intemperate language or conduct.[63] The Authority has held that while the particular words used are not, standing alone, dispositive, the context of the words determines whether they exceed the bounds of protected activity.[64] In analyzing the nature of intemperate conduct, the Authority considers whether the conduct in question was brief or prolonged.[65] As discussed above, the grievant’s conduct was particularly inappropriate in context given that she made sexually harassing remarks about a supervisor’s spouse during a briefing where the Agency was discussing the Anti-Harassment Policy. Noting that the grievant had attended thirteen harassment briefings in the past, the Arbitrator found that the "grievant was aware that her statements and conduct were unacceptable and contrary to the Anti-Harassment Policy." While the exact duration of her behavior during the briefing is unclear, the Arbitrator found that she was "persistent in controlling the presentation," despite attempts by the presenter to open the floor to other questions. Consequently, this factor supports the conclusion that the grievant exceeded the bounds of protected activity during the sexual-harassment briefing.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the Authority considers whether conduct exceeds the boundaries of the Statute’s protection on a case-by-case basis, considering the totality of the circumstances.[69] In assessing the totality of the circumstances, the Authority has in the past "considered whether an employee’s conduct is ‘similar to’ conduct that the Authority previously found protected."[70] But the norms of acceptable conduct in the workplace have changed throughout the years as employers have recognized their legal obligations to prevent harassment and ensure a safe and civil environment for employees.[71] Despite these advances in the workplace, the Authority has permitted union representatives’ use of vulgar, opprobrious, and often abusive language in many past decisions.[72] In reversing one such decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit stated that it is "preposterous...to conclude that Congress could reasonably have contemplated that federal employees are incapable of exercising their rights under &#x00A7; 7102 without ranting, raving, assaulting, battering and harassing their co-workers."[73] We agree. Accordingly, in assessing the totality of the circumstances, the Authority will place less emphasis on whether an employee’s conduct is similar to conduct previously found protected.[74] Additionally, the Authority recognizes that the circumstances under consideration must include an agency’s responsibility to "maintain civility in the workplace"[75] and to ensure a safe and civil environment for employees and supervisors alike.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The standard for determining whether management's statement or conduct violates section 7116(a)(1) is an objective one. The question is whether, under the circumstances, the statement or conduct tends to coerce or intimidate the employee in the exercise of rights protected under section 7102 of the Statute, or whether the employee could have reasonably drawn a coercive inference from the statement. <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois</span>, 34 FLRA 956, 962 (1990). While the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement are taken into consideration, the standard is not based on the subjective perceptions of the employee or on the intent of the employer. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Further, in order to find a violation of section 7116(a)(1), it is not necessary to find other unfair labor practices or to demonstrate union animus. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Judge assessed the evidence presented in the stipulated record and determined that the statements contained in the record of infraction and letter of proposed removal would reasonably tend to coerce employees in the filing of grievances and ULP charges. The Judge concluded, therefore, that the Respondent's references in the record of infraction and the letter of proposed removal to the employee's filing of grievances and ULP charges constituted a violation of section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute. We agree with the Judge's determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is beyond dispute that employees have a right under the Statute to file ULP charges and grievances....&#8197;In our view, an employee could reasonably have drawn a coercive inference from the Respondent's references to Hanlon's filings of ULP charges and grievances. References to Hanlon's filings of ULP charges and grievances in the record of infraction, which precedes discipline and is used by supervisors to document and report employee violations, would tend to have an intimidating effect on an employee who seeks to exercise the statutory right to file ULP charges and grievances. Similarly, the reliance in the letter of proposed removal on Hanlon's filing of ULP charges, as well as the reference to Hanlon's filing of grievances, would tend to intimidate employees in exercising their statutory right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent contends that the Judge's decision "ignores well established principles that an employee's right to file various actions is not without limits and that <span class="Italic">abuse of process</span> is a valid basis for disciplinary action."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We interpret the Respondent's contention that Hanlon's actions constituted an abuse of process as an argument that its action was justified because Hanlon's filing of ULP charges and grievances exceeded the boundaries of protected activity under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard Long Beach, California, and Long Beach Naval Station, Long Beach, California</span>, 25 FLRA 1002, 1005 (1987). An employee's conduct that would otherwise constitute protected activity may constitute flagrant misconduct and, therefore, exceed the bounds of protected activity if the employee's actions are "'of such an outrageous and insubordinate nature as to remove them from the protection of the Statute.'" <span class="Italic">U.S. Air Force Logistics Command, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 916, AFL-CIO</span>, 34 FLRA 385, 388-91 (1990) (<span class="Italic">quoting</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Aviation Administration, St. Louis Tower, Bridgeton, Missouri</span>, 6 FLRA 678, 687 (1981).) <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">[SSA v.]</span><span class="Italic"> Burris</span>, [39 MSPR 51 (1988)] (where the MSPB found that an employee's outrageous and sufficiently flagrant abuses of the grievance process by filing frivolous grievances warranted the imposition of discipline).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge stated that he "[saw] no limit in the Statute as to how many unfair labor practice charges or grievances an employee can file." It is clear, in this regard, that the Statute does not impose a limitation on the number of charges and grievances an employee can file. However, to the extent that the Judge's statement suggests that an employee may never be disciplined for misuse of the ULP procedure and grievance process, we disagree with such a suggestion. Employee misconduct may be of such an outrageous and insubordinate nature so as to remove the conduct from the protection of the Statute. A similar principle applies in the private sector under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wayne W. Sell Corp</span>., 281 NLRB 529, 532 (1986) (the fact that an employee "filed many grievances does not render the behavior unprotected"; it is "only extreme behavior on the part of an employee that removes his actions from the protection of the [NLRA].")...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the foregoing analysis to this case, we find that the record does not support a finding that Hanlon's action in filing ULP charges and grievances exceeded the bounds of protected activity. Nothing in the record shows that Hanlon used the ULP and grievance processes in such an outrageous manner so as to remove the conduct from the protection of the Statute. In particular, the record does not support the Respondent's claim that Hanlon's actions constituted an abuse of process. Based on the record before us, which was stipulated by the parties, we find that the Respondent has not met its burden of showing that Hanlon's filings constituted an abuse of the ULP and grievance forums so as to lose the protection of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, based on the above, we conclude that the statements in the documents pertaining to Hanlon's filing of ULP charges and grievances interfered with the right of employees under section 7102 to file ULP charges or use the negotiated grievance procedure. The Respondent's actions could reasonably tend to have a restraining or "chilling" effect not only on Hanlon but on other employees who might similarly wish to exercise such right. Accordingly, we conclude that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the remedy, the Respondent contends that the Judge's order requiring that references to Hanlon's filing of ULP charges and grievances be removed from the documents in issue is contrary to law. We disagree. "[W]hen an issue is properly raised as an unfair labor practice under section 7116, nothing therein would prevent the Authority from remedying any violation found." <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Air Force Systems Command, Electronic Systems Division</span>, 14 FLRA 390, 392 (1984) (although the Authority found, for other reasons, that a backpay award was not appropriate, the Authority rejected the agency's assertion that an Authority order to reinstate an employee with backpay would conflict with the action taken by MSPB and with section 7116(d) of Statute). As previously found, the issue concerning statements in the record of infraction and the letter of proposed removal pertaining to Hanlon's filing of ULP charges and grievances is properly before the Authority. We have also determined that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sections 7105(g) and 7118 of the Statute vest the Authority with broad remedial powers to correct violations of the Statute....&#8197;In our view, an order requiring the Respondent to remove any references to Hanlon's filing of ULP charges and grievances from the record of infraction and the proposed letter of removal is necessary to carry out the purposes of the Statute. If such references remained in these documents, the Respondent would benefit from its improper actions and employees would not be safeguarded in the exercise of their statutory rights....&#8197;We further note that these documents listed other charges of alleged misconduct by Hanlon. Our remedy addresses only the Respondent's reliance on Hanlon's filing of ULP charges and grievances as a basis for its action. Thus, we conclude that the order is not beyond the Authority's powers and does not conflict with the Respondent's right to remove employees.[4]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">Judge's Decision at 23.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Analytical Framework</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recently clarified the application of the framework in <span class="Italic">Letterkenny Army Depot</span>, 35 FLRA 113, 118 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>) to cases of alleged discrimination in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (2)<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of the Air Force, Aerospace Maint. &#x0026; Regeneration Ctr., Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson, Ariz.</span>, 58 FLRA 636 (2003) (<span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan AFB</span>). Under that <span id="Page_1405"></span>framework, the GC establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination by demonstrating that: (1) the employee against whom the alleged discriminatory action was taken was engaged in protected activity; and (2) such activity was a motivating factor in the agency's treatment of the employee. Once the GC makes the required <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>showing, an agency may seek to establish the affirmative defense that: (1) there was a legitimate justification for the action; and (2) the same action would have been taken even in the absence of the protected activity<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force, 315th Airlift Wing v. FLRA</span>, 294 F.3d 192 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (<span class="Italic">315th Airlift Wing v. FLRA</span>), we further clarified that when the alleged discrimination concerns discipline for conduct occurring during protected activity, "a necessary part of the respondent's defense is that the conduct constituted flagrant misconduct <span class="Italic">or otherwise exceeded the boundaries of protected activity</span>." <span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan AFB</span>, 58 FLRA at 636. In this regard, the court stated that "[f]lagrant misconduct is a sufficient, but not necessary, condition for a loss of privilege under &#x00A7; 7102 [of the Statute]." 294 F.3d at 201. As the court noted in discussing earlier Authority precedent, "'flagrant misconduct' [i]s only <span class="Italic">illustrative </span>of exceeding the boundaries of protected activities<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 202 (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If conduct that exceeds the boundaries of protected activities is established, then the conduct loses its protection under the Statute and can be the basis for discipline. If the conduct retains its protection, it cannot be the basis for discipline. "In effect, in such a case, it is not legitimate for an agency to discipline for conduct occurring during the course of protected activity that" does not exceed the boundaries of protected activities. <span class="Italic">FCI Englewood</span>, 53 FLRA at 1516. Under the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny </span>framework, the agency has the burden of establishing its affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence, and the GC has the overall burden of establishing the violation by a preponderance of the evidence on the record as a whole.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, as noted above, in <span class="Italic">Grissom</span>, the Authority stated that "[i]n determining whether an employee has engaged in flagrant misconduct, the Authority balances the employee's right to engage in protected activity, which 'permits leeway for impulsive behavior,...against the employer's right to maintain order and respect for its supervisory staff on the jobsite.'" <span class="Italic">Grissom</span>, 51 FLRA at 11-12. The Authority outlined several relevant factors to be considered in striking this balance: (1) the place and subject matter of the discussion; (2) whether the employee's outburst was impulsive or designed; (3) whether the outburst was in anyway provoked by the employer's conduct; and (4) the nature of the intemperate language and conduct<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 12. The Authority also stated that the foregoing factors did not need to be cited or applied in any particular way in determining whether an action constitutes flagrant misconduct<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. In addition, in assessing this balancing of interests, the Authority has held that "[u]nion officials acting in their official capacity have very broad latitude in speech and action." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Energy, Oak Ridge, Tenn.</span>, 57 FLRA 343, 345 (2001) (<span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting as to result).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Application of the analytical framework to this case</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge found that Johnson's conduct at the meeting occurred in his capacity as the Union's Chief Steward, and that his conduct was protected unless it constituted flagrant misconduct. The Judge also concluded that Johnson was disciplined based on his conduct at the meeting. Thus, the Judge effectively concluded that the GC had established a <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case of a violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent excepts to the Judge's conclusion that Johnson's conduct at the meeting occurred in his capacity as the Union's Chief Steward. According to the Respondent, the meeting could not have involved protected activity because it concerned only Johnson's alleged misrepresentation of his authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree.&#x2003;Contrary to the Respondent's claim, the fact that the meeting was called to inquire about Johnson's alleged misrepresentation of his authority does not mandate a conclusion that the meeting did not involve protected activity. As the Judge properly found, Johnson's alleged misrepresentation occurred in the course of his earlier performance of protected activity; that is, when Johnson, as Chief Steward, contacted unit employee Wagner at the request of another Union representative, told Wagner that he was the Union "head honcho," and asked her about the reassignments resulting from the upcoming reorganization. Since the Respondent called Johnson to the meeting to ask what he said as the Chief Steward in his conversation with Wagner, his conduct at the meeting occurred as Chief Steward. In this regard, the Judge correctly concluded that when a union official attends such a meeting as a union official, his actions during that meeting are protected unless they lose the protection of the Statute<span class="Italic">. See FCI Englewood</span>, 53 FLRA at 1518-20 (union official's presence at counseling meeting was protected activity because it was based on his conduct as a union representative during a previous incident).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having determined that Johnson's conduct at the meeting constituted protected activity, we must next determine whether Johnson's actions at the meeting constituted flagrant misconduct or otherwise lost the protection of the Statute. The Judge found that the Respondent had established, as an affirmative defense, that Johnson's actions constituted flagrant misconduct and, therefore, lost the protection of the Statute. For the following reasons, we disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we reject the Charging Party's exceptions challenging the Judge's credibility determinations. The Authority has consistently stated that it will "review credibility determinations based on considerations other than witness demeanor...based on the record as a whole." <span class="Italic">Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Ralph H. Johnson Medical Center, Charleston, S.C.</span>, 57 FLRA 495, 499 (2001). The Judge relied on the consistency of the various witnesses' testimony and not on their demeanor. The Charging Party has failed to demonstrate that the Judge's credibility determinations are erroneous based on the record as a whole. The Charging Party's exceptions also challenge the Judge's factual findings. Given the Judge's credibility determinations, however, those factual findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., United States Dep't of Transportation and FAA</span>, 48 FLRA 1211, 1215 (1993). Accordingly, we deny the Charging Party's exceptions as to the Judge's credibility determinations and factual findings. We determine, therefore, whether the Judge properly applied the relevant legal standards to the facts he found.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that no party challenges the relevance of the <span class="Italic">Grissom </span>factors to this case. Applying these factors to the facts found by the Judge, we conclude that Johnson's actions at the meeting, viewed in their entirety and in the context in which the meeting was called, did not lose the protection of the Statute. In so concluding, we note the following.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The meeting was held in an office with the door closed.&#x2003;The Judge found that Johnson's voice could be heard in the hall outside the outer office, but he did not find, and the record provides no evidence, that this had any effect on the work of the unit or interfered in any manner with the conduct of the Respondent's business. Thus, these considerations do not support a finding of flagrant misconduct<span class="Italic">. See Grissom</span>, 51 FLRA at 12 (the fact that employee's actions were not in front of other employees and did not disrupt the work of the unit was a consideration in finding that those actions did not constitute flagrant misconduct)<span class="Italic">. See also FCI Englewood</span>, 53 FLRA at 1518 (the fact that an employee's conduct did not occur in a public area was a factor in finding that the conduct did not constitute flagrant misconduct).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Judge expressly found that Johnson's actions were impulsive. Nothing in the Respondent's exceptions establishes that Johnson's actions at the meeting were planned and deliberate so as to warrant overturning this finding. The Judge found, in this regard, that Johnson's outburst immediately followed Wagner's informing him, on the way into the meeting, that she had told White about his misrepresentation of his authority to her. Thus, his anger erupted spontaneously. The fact that Johnson's actions were impulsive rather than planned also supports a finding that his actions did not constitute flagrant misconduct<span class="Italic">. See FCI Englewood</span>, 53 FLRA at 1519; <span class="Italic">Grissom</span>, 51 FLRA at 12 (cases in which impulsive nature of actions was a factor in finding those actions did not constitute flagrant misconduct).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge also found that Johnson's "outburst...was not provoked...unless raising the allegation that Mr. Johnson had misrepresented his authority can be considered 'provocation,' which I do not." We find the facts found by the Judge indicate that Johnson's conduct was provoked, at least in part, by the Respondent's conduct. In particular, the Judge found that White, the Respondent's representative, did not tell Johnson the purpose of the meeting when she set up the meeting, even though she had told Wagner the purpose. Moreover, when White started the meeting, it became immediately apparent to Johnson that he was being accused of lying, and he responded by promptly and repeatedly denying this allegation. In our view, these circumstances support a conclusion that Johnson's behavior was provoked by the Respondent<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Oak Ridge</span>, 57 FLRA at 346 (conduct of union representative was provoked, at least in part, by respondent's actions).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we find that the nature of the intemperate language and conduct does not support a conclusion that Johnson's action was unprotected. Union representatives are permitted broad leeway in discussions with management. The fact that Johnson engaged in a "long, rambling, angry monologue," that he "bad-mouthed" a manager, and threatened to sue her, and that he used one profane word are not, taken collectively, sufficient to eliminate the protection of the Statute, especially since the comments were in a private office, were impulsive, and were, at least in part, provoked. Nothing in Johnson's action affected the employer's right to maintain order and respect for its supervisory staff so as to shift the balance of competing interests toward a finding of flagrant misconduct<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service, Washington, D.C.</span>, 55 FLRA 875 (1999); <span class="Italic">Grissom</span>, 51 FLRA at 12-13 (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, National Border Patrol Council</span>, 44 FLRA <span id="Page_1406"></span>1395, 1402 (1992))<span class="Italic">. See also Acme-Arsena Co.</span>, 276 NLRB 1291, 1295 (1985) ("[T]he Board has repeatedly held that profane and foul language, or what is normally considered discourteous conduct while engaged in protected activity, does not justify disciplining an employee acting in a representative capacity."); <span class="Italic">Crown Central Petroleum Corp.</span>, 177 NLRB 322 (1969), <span class="Italic">enforced Crown Central Petroleum Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 430 F.2d 724 (5th Cir. 1970) (employee acting as union representative who called employer a liar held protected by National Labor Relations Act (the Act)).[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Moreover, we note that, unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">315th Airlift Wing v. FLRA</span>, there is no allegation or record evidence in this case that Johnson engaged in any touching of White or Wagner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, a central point in the Judge's reasoning is incorrect. Statements by union representatives signifying an intent to sue management officials are not beyond the protection of the Statute<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Mullican Lumber Co.</span>, 310 NLRB 836, 842 (1993) (employer's termination of employee for statement, in context of protected activity, that he would sue supervisors and hold them personally liable found to violate the Act); <span class="Italic">Wayne W. Sell Corp.</span>, 281 NLRB 529, 533 (1986) (NLRB "precedent shows that warnings by employees to resort to legal procedures are protected activity").[6] In this regard, the Authority has held that management officials do not commit an unfair labor practice by threatening private civil suits against employees or union representatives for, <span class="Italic">e.g</span>., libel<span class="Italic">. See Dep't of Treasury, Internal Revenue Serv., Louisville Dist.</span>, 20 FLRA 660, 661 (1985) (threat to file suit)<span class="Italic">. See also Consumer Product Safety Comm'n</span>, 4 FLRA 803 (1980) (actual filing of suit). It would be anomalous, in light of this precedent, to conclude that threats by union representatives to engage in similar litigation, related to and based in their representational activities, against their supervisors or other management officials, are not protected by the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;While Johnson's comments were restricted to threatening to sue certain individuals, we note that even comments that could be construed more broadly have been found to be protected<span class="Italic">. See Dep't of the Navy, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington</span>, 2 FLRA 54, 55, 75-76 (1979) (statement by union representative to management official that "I am going to get your ass" held not to constitute flagrant misconduct).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Judge's unexplained citation to <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping Agency</span> at page 24 of his decision also does not support a conclusion that Johnson's conduct constituted flagrant misconduct. In that case, the Authority adopted a judge's finding, based on the same factors enunciated in <span class="Italic">Grissom</span>, that the agency's conduct in reprimanding an employee did not violate &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) of the Statute. In weighing the various factors, the judge found that an employee's remarks were made during a closed grievance meeting and were impulsive. On the other hand, the judge found that the remarks were not provoked and, in fact, were not pertinent to a discussion of the grievance. The judge found that "[t]here is a difference between 'letting off steam' spontaneously because of frustration, zealousness, or provocation and deliberate, excessive abuse of supervisory staff based on personal antagonism." <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 17 FLRA at 83.[7] In the judge's view, the case before him "[fell] within the latter category<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. Accordingly, the judge determined that the balance between the employee's statutory right to engage in protected activity and the employer's right to maintain order and respect for its supervisory staff "tip[ped]" in favor of the employer<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 82.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping Agency</span>, the judge found that an employee's conduct was "based on personal antagonism." <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 17 FLRA at 83. In this case, the only personal antagonism alleged was between the Chief Steward and his fellow employee (Wagner); no antagonism is alleged between the Chief Steward and the management official (White). As we do not resolve whether the Chief Steward's conduct towards Wagner was a proper basis for discipline, the judge's statement in Defense Mapping Agency about antagonism cannot support a finding that Johnson's conduct towards White--the only relevant conduct--was unprotected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, in this case, in balancing the Chief Steward's right to engage in protected activity, which "permits leeway for impulsive behavior," against "the employer's right to maintain order and respect for its supervisory staff on the jobsite[,]" we find for the reasons stated above that, applying the <span class="Italic">Grissom </span>factors, the record supports the conclusion that Johnson's conduct did not lose its protection under the Statute<span class="Italic">. Grissom</span>, 51 FLRA at 11-12 (citations omitted). Unlike <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping Agency</span>, the Chief Steward's conduct in the meeting in this case reflects "'letting off steam' spontaneously because of frustration, zealousness, or provocation" rather than "deliberate, excessive abuse of supervisory staff based on personal antagonism." <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 17 FLRA at 83. In so finding, we emphasize, as the Authority has in previous cases, that our conclusion should not be construed as condoning the conduct here at issue<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards Air Force Base, Cal.</span>, 53 FLRA 1455, 1456 (1998). Rather, our conclusion is simply that the conduct did not lose its protection under the Statute. Accordingly, we reverse the Judge's finding of flagrant misconduct with respect to Johnson's conduct toward White during the meeting.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, I would take this opportunity to reexamine how the Authority evaluates the conduct, or misconduct, of Union officials as protected or not under &#x00A7; 7102(1). For years, past majorities of the Authority have excused instances of egregious misconduct by union officials unless it amounted to "flagrant misconduct"--a nearly insurmountable hurtle which was rarely met. In 2002, however, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that there was "little to justify" the Authority's flagrant misconduct standard and its interpretation of &#x00A7; 7102(1).[20] The Court noted that the Authority's standard, which focused solely on whether such conduct was "flagrant,"[21] was a "tortured...interpretation"[22] that cannot "reasonbl[y] interpret[&#8197;] the limit[s] of &#x00A7; 7102."[23] Despite that clear repudiation, the Authority continued to apply the flawed "flagrant misconduct" standard.[24] But, as the Court also warned, "applying an unreasonable statutory interpretation for several years cannot transform it into a reasonable interpretation."[25]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[24]&#x2003;The Authority's continued application of the "flagrant misconduct" standard, despite the Court's rejection, is closely akin to the Authority's continued application of the "abrogation" standard, even after the Court rejected that standard, a matter we had to correct in <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Fed.

<p class="noindent-2">[25]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">315th Airlift Wing</span>, 294 F.3d at 198.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I do not believe it is unreasonable to expect that federal employees, whether supervisor, employee, or union official, should be able to comport themselves appropriately in the federal workplace. I agree entirely with the sentiments (which are worth repeating here) expressed by Member Pizzella in his dissent in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2595</span>.[26] In that case, Member Pizzella detailed numerous instances where the Authority had condoned outrageous conduct perpetrated by union officials in the workplace....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[26]&#x2003;68 FLRA 293, 298 (2015) (Dissenting Opinion of Member Pizzella).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is important, therefore, that the Authority clarify, once and for all, that there is a necessary and clear distinction between conduct which occurs when union representatives are actively engaged in "classic labor disputes" (i.e. collective bargaining or negotiation of agreements). Those encounters, which typically occur behind closed doors, away from the workplace, and outside the hearing of coworkers and the public, afford union representatives (and managers) "some latitude" to "speak bluntly and recklessly...because those encounters by their nature have the potential to become heated." However, when interactions between management and union officials occur in the workplace, common areas, or take place in front of coworkers or the public, &#x00A7; 7102 does not excuse misconduct for which any other employee would be disciplined. In fact, the Court in <span class="Italic">315th Airlift Wing</span> concluded that "misconduct <span class="Italic">of any kind</span>..., by definition, '<span class="Italic">exceed[s] the boundaries of protected activity</span>'" particularly when that misconduct occurs in the workplace and is <span class="Italic">part of supervisor and employee interaction</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">A union official who became involved in speech that was considered threatening, along with some speech with racial overtones, lost the protection of the statute under the analysis in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 987 and Dept. of Air Force, Warner Robins ALC,</span> 63 FLRA 362, 362-64 (2009), reviewing exceptions to an arbitration award sustaining a suspension:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievant, a Union steward, was suspended for three days for conduct that occurred during two separate incidents. The first incident involved the grievant questioning a Human Resources (HR) Specialist about her review of the grievant's official time use. During the incident, the grievant stated, "through clinched [sic] teeth, and with balled fists[:] 'You better not mess with me! I know my rights.'" When asked to leave, the grievant stated "I don't have to leave" and then he followed closely behind the <span id="Page_1407"></span>HR Specialist from one office to the next "threatening to file a[n] [unfair labor practice (ULP)] and saying [that the HR Specialist] better learn the [parties' master agreement]." The HR Specialist testified that the incident made her feel "intimidated and threatened." An employee who witnessed the incident testified that the grievant seemed "very upset" and was following her "right there on her heel[.]" The witness further testified that she called out to the HR Specialist that she thought the HR Specialist "would be at least a year in the job before she got beat up."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second incident arose while the grievant was on official time.&#x2003;A third-line supervisor observed the grievant away from his work area and asked an assistant supervisor if he knew where the grievant was going. Later, the grievant asked the third-line supervisor if he had been looking for the grievant, and the third-line supervisor responded that he had just wanted to know the grievant's whereabouts. The grievant responded that the third-line supervisor "had no business asking where he was." The grievant then became "loud, unruly, upset and belligerent" and called the third-line supervisor an "Uncle Tom."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a result of the grievant's conduct, the Agency provided the grievant with a Notice of Proposed Suspension. In response to the Notice of Proposed Suspension, the Union Steward explained that the grievant's actions constituted "robust debate" and were, therefore, protected. The grievant was suspended for three days for his conduct during both incidents. He filed a grievance alleging that the suspension violated the Statute because he had not engaged in flagrant misconduct. Unresolved, the grievance was submitted to arbitration, where the Arbitrator framed the following issue: "Did the Agency have just cause to impose a three-day suspension on [the grievant]?" If not, what shall be the remedy[?]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the grievant had not been acting in his representational capacity during the incidents in question because he had not been advocating for a grievant or the Union.&#x2003;The Arbitrator further reasoned that "[t]here had been no challenge to [the grievant's] right to carry out his duties and responsibilities of Union [s]teward." Turning to the question of whether there was just cause for the suspension, the Arbitrator explained that the grievant had been motivated by personal, not union, considerations, and concluded that, had the grievant "been advocating the position of a grievant or his Union, his conduct would be subject to a different test." Nevertheless, having found that the grievant was not acting in his representational capacity, the Arbitrator determined that there was just cause for the three-day suspension. Accordingly, he denied the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an exception involves an award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews any question of law raised by the exception and the award <span class="Italic">de novo</span>.[2] <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 24,</span> 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) <span class="Italic">(citing United States Customs Serv. v. FLRA,</span> 43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). In applying the standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Def., Dep'ts of the Army and the Air Force, Ala. Nat'l Guard, Northport, Ala.,</span> 55 FLRA 37, 40 (1998). In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;We note that the Agency claims that the Arbitrator's finding of no protected activity is a factual one that cannot be reviewed as a matter of law because the Arbitrator resolved only a contractual claim. However, the Agency acknowledges that the Arbitrator reviewed the grievant's conduct in terms of the statutory requirements for protected activity, and in similar circumstances, the Authority has reviewed the issue of whether an employee was engaged in protected activity as a question of law, even when the arbitral issue was framed in contract terms. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Nat'l Border Patrol Council,</span> 44 FLRA 1395 (1992). Therefore, we determine whether the award is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7102 of the Statute guarantees employees the right to form, join, or assist any labor organization, or to refrain from such activity, without fear of penalty or reprisal.[3] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102; <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Border Patrol Council,</span> 44 FLRA 1395, 1402 (1992). However, &#x00A7; 7102 does not allow an employee to act with impunity even though he or she is engaged in such protected activity. Even taking into account the privilege afforded protected activity under &#x00A7; 7102, "an agency has the right to discipline an employee who is engaged in otherwise protected activity for remarks or actions that 'exceed the boundaries of protected activity, such as flagrant misconduct.'" <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force, Grissom Air Force Base, Ind.,</span> 51 FLRA 7, 11 (1995) <span class="Italic">(quoting United States Air Force Logistics Command, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma City, Okla.,</span> 34 FLRA 385, 389 (1990)). As such, flagrant misconduct is a sufficient, but not necessary, condition for a loss of protection under &#x00A7; 7102, <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force, 315th Airlift Wing v. FLRA,</span> 294 F.3d 192, 202 (D.C. Cir. 2002)) <span class="Italic">(315th Airlift Wing),</span> and merely "illustrative of," but not the <span class="Italic">only</span> type of action that could justify removal from the protection of &#x00A7; 7102 of the Statute. <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R3-32,</span> 61 FLRA 127, 132 (2005) <span class="Italic">(NAGE)</span> (Chairman Cabaniss writing separately) (citation omitted) <span class="Italic">(citing 315th Airlift Wing,</span> 294 F.3d at 201-02) (citations omitted). Accordingly, an agency has the right to discipline an employee who is engaged in otherwise protected activity for remarks or actions that: (1) constitute flagrant misconduct, or (2) otherwise exceed the bounds of protected activity. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Air Force, Aerospace Maint. &#x0026; Regeneration Ctr., Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Ariz.,</span> 58 FLRA 636, 636 (2003) <span class="Italic">(Davis-Monthan).</span> In sum, "[i]f conduct...exceeds the boundaries of protected activities...the conduct loses its protection under the Statute and can be <span class="Italic">the</span> basis for discipline." <span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan,</span> 58 FLRA at 636 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;Section 7102 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">&#x00A7; 7102. Employees' rights</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Each employee shall have the right to form, join, or assist any labor organization, or to refrain from any such activity, freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal, and each employee shall be protected in the exercise of such right. Except as otherwise provided under this chapter, such right includes the right--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;to act for a labor organization in the capacity of a representative and the right, in that capacity, to present the views of the labor organization to heads of agencies and other officials of the executive branch of the Government, the Congress, or other appropriate authorities, and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment through representatives chosen by employees under this chapter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the grievant was acting in his representational capacity and that "[t]he Arbitrator never reached the issue of whether [the grievant's] Union activity crossed the line from 'robust' advocacy to flagrant misconduct." The Union's argument assumes that "flagrant misconduct" is the only method by which to determine whether a union official's speech and/or conduct has exceeded the bounds of protected activity and has thus lost the protection of the Statute. However, as set forth above, flagrant misconduct is just one example of the type of conduct that exceeds the bounds of protected activity, thereby causing an employee who is otherwise engaged in protected activity to lose protection under the Statute. <span class="Italic">315th Airlift Wing,</span> 294 F.3d at 201-02. For the following reasons, we find that the grievant's conduct exceeded the bounds of protected activity and that the Union has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator erred in sustaining the suspension.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the first incident, the Arbitrator determined that the nature of the grievant's intemperate language and conduct reasonably caused the HR Specialist to feel "intimidated and threatened." In this connection, the Arbitrator found that the grievant, in a loud voice, warned the HR Specialist, "through clinched [sic] teeth, and with balled fists" that she "'better not mess with'" the grievant. The Arbitrator also found that the grievant "followed closely behind" the HR Specialist "threatening to file a ULP[.]" One witness testified that the grievant was "right there on [the HR Specialist's] heel...." The witness further testified that she called out to the HR Specialist that she thought the HR Specialist "would be at least a year in the job before she got beat up."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Courts have held that the use of threats and intimidation is inappropriate in the workplace.&#x2003;The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has held that conduct that involves "actual physical contact and physical intimidation" that placed an individual in "reasonable apprehension of 'some unpredictable blow'" is not protected. <span class="Italic">315th Airlift Wing,</span> 294 F.3d at 199. Here, the nature of the grievant's conduct was intimidating and threatening and caused at least one co-worker to apprehend that the HR Specialist was at risk of being "beat up." Even assuming that the grievant was engaged in protected activity, this type of conduct exceeds the bounds of protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the racially derogatory term used by the grievant in the second incident, courts have held that the use of racial slurs is inappropriate in the workplace. The Authority has long recognized "a clearly expressed public policy against racial discrimination in the workplace" and has found that this policy is undermined by "[r]acial stereotyping...." <span class="Italic">Veterans Admin., Wash., D.C.,</span> 26 FLRA 114, 116 (1987) <span class="Italic">(VA, Wash.).</span> Here, the Arbitrator found that the grievant "got loud, unruly, upset and belligerent" with the third-line supervisor for asking about his whereabouts while he was on official time and that the grievant twice called the supervisor an "Uncle Tom." "Racial stereotyping...is [not] part of the mere rough and tumble of "robust debate." <span class="Italic">VA, Wash.,</span> 26 FLRA at 116. Even assuming that the grievant was engaged in protected activity, the use of racial slurs in the workplace exceeds the bounds of protected activity and is not protected by the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Union has provided no basis for finding that the Arbitrator erred in determining that either of the two incidents provided "just cause" for the grievant's suspension and we deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">Flagrancy was also analyzed in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Davis-Monthan AFB and Pennington</span>, 58 FLRA 636, 636 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1408"></span>We have held that when the alleged discrimination concerns discipline for conduct occurring during protected activity, "a necessary part of the respondent's defense is that the conduct constituted flagrant misconduct." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Ralph H. Johnson Med. Ctr., Charleston, S.C.</span>, 58 FLRA 44, 47 (2002) (<span class="Italic">quoting Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Office of Internal Affairs, Wash., D.C.</span>, 53 FLRA 1500, 1514 (1998)). In light of the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force, 315th Airlift Wing v. FLRA</span>, 294 F.3d 192 (D.C. Cir. 2002), we take this opportunity to clarify that when the alleged discrimination concerns discipline for conduct occurring during protected activity, a necessary part of the respondent's defense is that the conduct constituted flagrant misconduct or otherwise <span class="Italic">exceeded the boundaries of protected activity</span>. In this regard, the court stated that "[f]lagrant misconduct is a sufficient, but not necessary, condition for a loss of privilege under &#x00A7; 7102 [of the Statute]." 294 F.3d at 201. As the court noted in discussing earlier Authority precedent, "'flagrant misconduct' [i]s only illustrative of exceeding the boundaries of protected activities." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 202 (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If conduct that exceeds the boundaries of protected activities is established, the conduct loses its protection under the Statute and can be the basis for discipline. If the conduct retains its protection, it cannot be the basis for discipline. "In effect, in such a case, it is not legitimate for an agency to discipline for conduct occurring during the course of protected activity that [does not exceed the boundaries of protected activities]." <span class="Italic">Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Office of Internal Affairs, Wash., D.C.</span>, 53 FLRA 1500, 1516 (1998). Under the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny </span>framework, the agency has the burden of establishing its affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence, and the GC has the overall burden of establishing the violation by a preponderance of the evidence on the record as a whole.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">If conduct that exceeds the boundaries of protected activities is established, the conduct loses its protection under the Statute and can be the basis for discipline.

<p class="noindent-1">In support of its &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) claim, the Union relies on two cases--<span class="Italic">Skinner v. Department of VA</span>,[40] which is a nonprecedential decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit), and <span class="Italic">Complainant v.

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Skinner</span>, the Federal Circuit upheld an administrative judge's conclusion that an agency's repeated attempts to resolve an alleged hostile work environment created by a union president "could have <span class="Italic">potentially</span> subjected the agency to liability for a[ ULP]."[42] This nonprecedential observation about potential ULP liability fails to establish that the grievant's discipline violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Donovan</span>, an employee filed an internal union complaint about sexual harassment by another union official, but the employee never reported the harassment to any management officials before raising the matter in the EEOC's complaint processes.[43] The EEOC held that the employee could not use its proceedings to collaterally attack the union's internal complaint processes.[44] Unlike <span class="Italic">Donovan</span>, in this case, employees did report the grievant's misconduct to management officials, and the award itself does not mention any internal Union proceedings for which the grievant's suspension would serve as a collateral attack.

<p class="noindent">Analysis of flagrancy is not an element of every case involving alleged disparate discipline of union officials. <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 53 FLRA 1751, 1753-55 (1998), explained in the context of review of an arbitrator's award overturning discipline:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority applies a two-prong test to determine whether an arbitration award that implicates management's rights set out in section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute is deficient as contrary to those rights. First, an arbitrator must be enforcing either applicable law, within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2), or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to the exceptions to section 7106(a) that are set forth in section 7106(b). Second, the award must constitute a reconstruction of what management would have done had management acted properly. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Washington, D.C</span>. <span class="Italic">and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter</span> 201, 53 FLRA 146, 153 <span class="Italic">(</span>1997)<span class="Italic"> (BEP); U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, <span class="Italic">Medical Center, Birmingham, Alabama and American Federation</span> of <span class="Italic">Government Employees, Local</span> 2207, 51 FLRA 270, 274 (1995) <span class="Italic">(VAMC, Birmingham)</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator enforced a just cause provision of the parties' agreement. The Arbitrator found that the Agency would not have proposed a suspension if the grievant had not also been a Union representative. Thus, the award satisfies both prongs of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> test and the award is not deficient as contrary to management's right under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In holding that the employee's suspension should be overturned, even though she was insubordinate in failing to attend training, the Arbitrator applied the Authority's framework for resolving claims of discrimination based on union activity. <span class="Italic">Letterkenny Army Depot</span>, 35 FLRA 113, 122-23 (1990) <span class="Italic">(Letterkenny)</span>. Under this framework, the party alleging discrimination must establish that: (1) the employee against whom the alleged discriminatory action was taken was engaged in protected activity; and (2) such activity was a motivating factor in the agency's treatment of the employee. If the required <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing is made, an agency may seek to establish the affirmative defense that there was a legitimate justification for its action and that the same action would have been taken even in the absence of protected activity. <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>, 35 FLRA at 118.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the Agency had "improperly link[ed]" the grievant's representational activities and her status as a Union steward with her suspension. <span class="Italic">See Letterkenny</span>, 35 FLRA at 118. The Arbitrator concluded that the Agency "discriminated" against the grievant in imposing the suspension. Thus, even though the grievant's actions in refusing to attend the training were not protected, the Arbitrator's findings indicate that the grievant's representational activity was a motivating factor in the Agency's decision to discipline her, satisfying the employee's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. The Arbitrator found that the Agency did not establish that the grievant would have been disciplined in the absence of her protected activity. Accordingly, he concluded that he could not sustain the suspension action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Authority cases cited by the Agency hold that an employee cannot be disciplined for conduct that is protected activity unless the employee's conduct constitutes flagrant misconduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Air Force Logistics</span> <span class="Italic">Command, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma City and American</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of Government Employees, Local 916</span>, AFL-CIO, 34 FLRA 385 (1990). The flagrant misconduct defense may be used by an agency to defend a disciplinary action that is based on protected activity. This defense does not, however, excuse an agency where, as here, it was motivated by protected activity and claims a separate, legitimate justification for the discipline. The agency's defense in that situation requires the establishment of both elements of the affirmative defense set out in <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>. 35 FLRA at 118.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, while the Arbitrator found the specific actions of the grievant to be unprotected, he also found that she was generally engaged in protected representational activity and that this activity was "linked" to the discipline. The Agency thus had a burden to establish both that it had a legitimate justification for the discipline and that it would have taken the same action absent the protected activity. The Arbitrator found that the second of these elements had not been met, appropriately applying the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> test to the facts of this case.</p>
