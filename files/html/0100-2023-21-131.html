<p class="Body-Text">A survivor annuity may be available for a child in school, <span class="Italic">Gordon v. OPM</span>, 39 MSPR 21, 22 n.1 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(4)(C), the appellant's daughter Adrian is entitled to a survivor annuity since she is an unmarried dependent child between 18 and 22 years of age and is a student regularly pursuing a full-time course of study. She will be considered a student during an interim between school years if the interim is not more than five months and if she shows a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> intention of continuing to pursue a course of study or training in the same or different school during the school semester (or other period into which the school year is divided) immediately after the interim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When is a child in school? Is home study a school? These questions were addressed, <span class="Italic">Seth-Morris v. OPM</span>, 94 MSPR 166, 167-72 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 4-14 (2003) (CSRS):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's son is also the child of a civil service annuitant who died in 1988. After the decedent's death, OPM concluded that his son was entitled to receive annuity benefits based on the decedent's federal service, and it began paying those benefits to the appellant, as the representative payee for her son. In or about August 1999, however, OPM notified the appellant of its determination that her son was no longer entitled to receive those benefits because the educational institution he attended was "not recognized for the purpose of Federal retirement benefits." Although the appellant objected to the determination and asked that the survivor benefits--which OPM evidently had stopped paying by August 1, 1999--be reinstated retroactive to that date, OPM reaffirmed its previous position and advised the appellant that, as a result of the erroneous payment of benefits from April 1 through July 31, 1999, she had received an overpayment of $1,368.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341, the unmarried dependent child of a deceased employee or annuitant is entitled to receive a survivor annuity until the last day of the month before he becomes 18 years of age. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(4), (e)(3). After that date, he is entitled to continue to receive benefits if he "is a student regularly pursuing a full-time course of study or training in residence in a high school, trade school, technical or vocational institute, junior college, college, university, or comparable recognized educational institution." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(4)(C), (e)(3)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM appears to have taken the position that enrollment in a home study program in which the student does not attend classes in a high school building, such as with the appellant's son here, cannot satisfy the statutory requirement that the recipient of benefits under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(4)(C) be a full-time student "in residence...in a high school." In affirming the reconsideration decision in which OPM addressed this matter, the administrative judge relied on the requirement that the student be "in residence."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither OPM's regulations governing the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) nor its regulations governing the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) define the phrase "in residence" or state how that term relates to the statutory language. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.672 and 843.410. In such a situation, we turn to generally accepted rules for construing statutes, as well as common sense, to discern Congress's intent in providing student benefits to individuals such as the appellant's son.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Usually words in a statute must be construed in accordance with their ordinary meaning unless they have acquired technical meaning or unless a definite meaning is apparent or indicated by the context of the words." 2A Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction &#x00A7; 47:27 (6th ed. 2000). In the educational context, the term "in residence" means "being officially associated with an organization in a specified capacity." Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary 596 (1977); <span class="Italic">see Rockenel Fastener, Inc. v. United States,</span> 267 F.3d 1354, 1356-57 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (to determine the common meaning of a term, a tribunal may consult dictionaries, among other sources). Using these rules of statutory construction, we find that the appellant's son is entitled to student benefits under either of two reasonable interpretations of the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the term "in residence" has its common meaning of being officially <span id="Page_4272"></span>affiliated with an organization, the uncontradicted record evidence shows that the appellant's son was at all relevant times officially enrolled in or affiliated with a fully-accredited high school educational program run by Sonoma County, California. Under this program, students received their assignments once a week and met regularly with their teachers, but attended classes and completed their assignments at home. Thus, if the statute is interpreted using the commonly-understood meaning of "in residence," the appellant's son is entitled to benefits as a full-time student.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If, on the other hand, the statute is read as requiring that a surviving child be "regularly pursuing a full-time course of study" <span class="Italic">or</span> be "in training in residence," the appellant's son still qualifies for benefits. That is to say, the appellant's son is entitled to continue to receive survivor benefits if he "is a student <span class="Italic">regularly pursuing a full-time course of study</span> or training in residence <span class="Italic">in a high school,</span> trade school, technical or vocational institute, junior college, college, university, or comparable recognized educational institution." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(4)(C) (emphasis added). Under this interpretation of the statute, the word "or" differentiates between a "full-time course of study" in, for instance, a high school, and "training in residence" in, for example, a trade school. If the statute is construed in this way, a student pursuing a "full-time course of study...in a high school" would not have to establish that the course of study was pursued "in residence" at one of the enumerated educational institutions. Because the appellant's son was enrolled in a full-time course of study in a high school, he is entitled to survivor benefits under this interpretation of the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The result under either interpretation of the statute is strongly supported by the undisputed evidence that the appellant has submitted and the persuasive arguments she has made. As she indicates in her petition for review, public high school students generally do not "reside" on school grounds, and even full-time students enrolled in a more typical high school program generally spend a considerable amount of their education-related time studying outside the school building. Thus, the appellant's son is entitled to continued benefits if he "is a student regularly pursuing a full-time course of study...in a high school."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that the appellant's son became 18 years of age on April 24, 1999. At that time, he was enrolled in a home study program of the Sonoma County (California) Office of Education. According to uncontradicted statements in the record, this was a fully accredited "alternative high school education program," run by Sonoma County, under which students were to pick up their assignments once a week and meet regularly with their teachers, but under which they were to attend classes at home and complete their assignments at home.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM also has not disputed the appellant's assertion that her son completed a regular high school course of study in the normal four years and graduated with the rest of his class, thus conforming with OPM's regulatory definition of a "full-time course of study" as one that "will lead to completion of the education within the period generally accepted as minimum for completion, by a full-time day student...," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.672(b)(1). Moreover, the appellant has submitted documents certifying her son's enrollment in a full-time course of high school study under the auspices of a county school system; these documents are, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.672(b)(2), <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> evidence that the program was full-time; and OPM has not rebutted or even challenged the sufficiency of the appellant's evidence of her son's enrollment in a fully accredited course of study.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Against this evidence, OPM has relied, not on regulations promulgated after notice and comment, but on its CSRS and FERS Handbook. The Supreme Court of the United States has stated that informal interpretations of a statute by an agency charged with enforcing it are "entitled to respect," "but only to the extent that those interpretations have the 'power to persuade.'" <span class="Italic">Christensen v. Harris County,</span> 529 U.S. 576, 587, 120 S. Ct. 1655, 1663 (2000); <span class="Italic">see also Pitsker v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 234 F.3d 1378, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2000). The Federal Circuit has stated as follows.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An agency's reliance on an internal handbook as a basis for deference to an agency's interpretation of a statutory scheme is not ordinarily entitled to the same weight as its reliance on a regulation that was promulgated pursuant to statutory authority and following formal notice and comment proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Roman v. Central Intelligence Agency,</span> 297 F.3d 1363, 1368-69 (Fed. Cir. 2002), <span class="Italic">citing United States v. Mead Corp.,</span> 533 U.S. 218, 230-31, 121 S. Ct. 2164 (2001). The power to persuade is lacking under the circumstances since the CSRS/FERS Handbook provides no insight into OPM's reason for interpreting the statute in such a way that would deny the appellant's son an annuity even though, as described above, he was enrolled in a full-time, county-approved and county-supervised high-school course of study that resulted in his graduation with his class in the normal time it takes to complete high school.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the appellant's son was entitled to continue receiving a survivor annuity while he was enrolled in the Sonoma County alternative education program up until the time he graduated from that program. We believe this outcome is what Congress intended. <span class="Italic">Accord, e.g., Roman,</span> 297 F.3d at 1371 (in view of Congress's desire to ensure equitable treatment for employees who go from full-time to part-time status, it was "highly unlikely" that Congress would have intended the appellant to be penalized in the calculation of her annuity when she converted to part-time status before retirement). Because no annuity overpayment occurred, both the reconsideration decision in which OPM denied the appellant's request for waiver of recovery of the alleged overpayment and the initial decision affirming that reconsideration decision are moot.</p>
