<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-80"><span class="space">6.</span> Necessary Functioning of Agency</h4>
<p class="noindent">FLRA permits an agency to make unilateral changes in matters affecting employment if the changes are necessary to the functioning of the agency. <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU,</span> 63 FLRA 505, 509-10 (2009), defined and applied the doctrine in the context of a challenge to an arbitration award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that implementation of the unified awards system did not violate the Statute because that action was consistent with the necessary functioning of the Agency.&#x2003;"'Necessary functioning' is a defense to an alleged unfair labor practice based on a unilateral implementation." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, INS,</span> 55 FLRA 892, 904 (1999) (<span class="Italic">INS</span>) (then Member Cabaniss and Member Wasserman dissenting in part as to other matters) (citing <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., SSA and SSA, Field Operations, Region II,</span> 35 FLRA 940, 950 (1990) (<span class="Italic">SSA,</span> <span class="Italic">Field Operations</span>)). In particular, "[a] party asserting this defense must establish, with evidence, that its actions were in fact consistent with the necessary functioning of the agency, such that a delay in implementation would have impeded the agency's ability to effectively and efficiently carry out its mission." <span class="Italic">INS,</span> 55 FLRA at 904 (citing <span class="Italic">SSA, Field Operations,</span> 35 FLRA at 950; <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, BATF,</span> 18 FLRA 446, 469 n.7 (1985)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency concedes that it "did not present specific examples of how the [prior] awards programs resulted in decreased morale and distraction on the job" to support its "necessary functioning" defense. The Agency also fails to demonstrate why the Union President's statement concerning the negative effect on employee morale of differences in pay constitutes sufficient evidence to establish necessary functioning. In this regard, the Arbitrator specifically found, and the Agency does not dispute, that there is no evidence that those differences had affected employee morale in a way that interfered with the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency objects to the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency provided no support for its position that delay in granting awards to unit employees, pending the completion of bargaining, would have resulted in no awards being given to those employees. However, the Agency provides no statutory or other legal support for its claim. Further, the Agency fails to support its contention that, in the absence of awards for unit employees, morale would have suffered so as to undermine the Agency's operations. Thus, the Agency's claim in this regard is purely speculative. <span class="Italic">See SSA,</span> 35 FLRA 296, 302 (1990) (respondent failed to demonstrate, on either factual or legal grounds, that the Judge erred in concluding that its necessary functioning defense was speculative).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 55 FLRA 892, 904 (1999), summarized the policy and the agency's burden of proof as to a "necessary functioning" defense:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's test to determine whether implementation is necessary for the functioning of the agency is long-standing. "Necessary functioning" is a defense to an alleged unfair labor practice based on a unilateral implementation. <span class="Italic">See Department of Health and Human</span> <span class="Italic">Services, Social Security Administration, and Social</span> <span class="Italic">Security Administration, Field Operations, Region II</span> <span class="Italic">and American Federation of Government Employees,</span> <span class="Italic">AFL-CIO, </span>35 FLRA 940, 950 (1990) <span class="Italic">(HHS). </span>A party asserting this defense must establish, with evidence, that its actions were in fact consistent with the necessary functioning of the agency, such that a delay in implementation would have impeded the agency's ability to effectively and efficiently carry out its mission. <span class="Italic">See id.;</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Treasury, </span>18 FLRA at 469 n.7.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency does not provide any evidence to support its assertion that a delay in implementation of its non-deadly force policy would have impeded its ability to effectively and efficiently carry out its mission. Instead, the Respondent sets forth numerous policy arguments, which were also made to the Judge, regarding the Immigration Act and the use of force for immigration officers. Although, as found by the Judge, the Respondent's assertions show a need for the new policy, the arguments do not demonstrate how delaying implementation of the policy until the parties had an opportunity to bargain over the policy's impact and implementation would have prevented the Respondent from effectively and efficiently carrying out its mission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to its arguments that unilateral implementation of the policy was necessary to the functioning of the Agency, the Respondent's arguments are misplaced. The Respondent's judgment in adopting its policy on the use of non-deadly force is not at issue here. Rather, the issue is the timing of the implementation of the non-deadly force policy--specifically, whether it was necessary to implement the policy choice before completing its obligation to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, the Respondent has provided no argument, and pointed to no evidence, supporting its defense that it was necessary to implement the nondeadly force policy when it did. As there is no evidence that a delay in implementing the policy would have impeded the Respondent's ability to effectively and efficiently carry out its mission, the resolution of this issue does not turn on whether the review standard is "deferential" or "demanding." Even if we were to resolve the issue based on weighing the evidence presented by the Respondent against a "deferential" standard--as the Respondent seeks--it would not prevail. For the Respondent to prevail here, we would have to permit an unsupported assertion of necessity to overcome the bargaining rights afforded the Charging Party under the Statute. Such a standard would go well beyond a "deferential" standard for reviewing an agency's evidence of necessity. We find that the Respondent has failed to establish that it was "necessary" for it to implement changes in its non-deadly force policy prior to satisfying its bargaining obligation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Discussion of the "necessary functioning" defense was provided in <span class="Italic">SEC v. FLRA,</span> 568 F.3d 990, 992-96 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (enforcing <span class="Italic">SEC and NTEU,</span> 62 FLRA 432, 438-39 (2008)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This is the sort of dispute that could only arise between public employees and a governmental agency.&#x2003;The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Agency) was eager to pay its employees more money. The National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU or Union) complains the SEC implemented the raises too quickly. The Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA or Authority) agrees with the Union and has ordered the SEC to provide back pay to atone for the affront. Counterintuitive though it may be, we agree the FLRA has properly resolved this odd controversy so we deny the petition for review and grant the Authority's cross-application for enforcement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This is what happened.&#x2003;After years of struggling with high attrition from the ranks of its professional employees (attorneys, accountants, and examiners), the SEC began focusing on pay disparities between itself and other financial regulatory agencies, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision. Since 1989, these other agencies had been authorized to determine their own compensation and benefit levels <span id="Page_1320"></span>without regard to the General Schedule, which continued to define pay grades for SEC employees. Although the SEC took advantage of as many compensation and benefit flexibilities as existing law allowed, including special pay rates for its most sought-after employees, by 2001--with its workload increasing dramatically and staffing shortages reaching crisis levels--the Agency sought legislative relief. Congress acquiesced. On January 16, 2002, it passed the Investor and Capital Markets Fee Relief Act, Pub. L. No. 107-123, 115 Stat. 2390 (2002), which gave the SEC authority to set and adjust its employees' pay rates without regard to the General Schedule.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both the Union and SEC management had eagerly anticipated the passage of this Act.&#x2003;The Union signaled the very next day, January 17, its willingness to begin bargaining. By March 6, the Agency had submitted its Implementation Plan to Congress and, on April 10, the Agency convened initial discussions with the Union. On April 18, SEC Chairman Pitt sent out an email to all employees stating the SEC hoped to implement the new system on May 19. Formal bargaining began April 22. Negotiations reached an impasse and the Union filed for assistance with the Federal Services Impasse Panel (Panel) on May 15. The SEC and the Union were unable to break the impasse when they met again on May 16 and 17, at which point management notified employees that it would unilaterally implement the SEC's proposed pay plan effective May 19. The raises became effective as of May 19, but the actual increased paychecks did not begin to arrive until August.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On November 8, 2002 the Panel resolved the bargaining impasse, ordering adoption of the SEC's proposal with only slight modifications. On November 18, the NTEU filed two unfair labor practice charges, alleging the SEC violated Sections 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute) by unilaterally implementing the new pay plan and ending automatic annual within-grade increases (known as WIGIs) before the completion of the bargaining process. The General Counsel filed a complaint and, after a full evidentiary hearing, the ALJ found the SEC had violated the Statute. The ALJ awarded retroactive within-grade increases to employees who were entitled to them between May 19 and November 8, and ordered the SEC to recalculate those employees' placement on the new pay schedule taking such within-grade increases into account. The Authority concluded the record fully supported the ALJ's findings and that the recommended remedy was not contrary to the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The SEC petitions for review; the Authority cross appeals for enforcement of its order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We review the FLRA's conclusion that the SEC engaged in an unfair labor practice under the familiar arbitrary and capricious standard; we determine only whether the FLRA has "offered a rational explanation for its decision, whether its decision is based on consideration of the relevant factors, and whether the decision is adequately supported by the facts found." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Ass'n of Gov't Employees, Local R5-136 v. FLRA,</span> 363 F.3d 468, 474-75 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (citing<span class="Italic">, inter alia, Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,</span> 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA's conclusion that the SEC engaged in an unfair labor practice was neither arbitrary nor capricious. As a preliminary matter, we reject the SEC's claim it is entitled to deference from the FLRA with respect to its chosen affirmative defense, that the unilateral implementation of the new salary system was necessary to the functioning of the agency. The SEC concedes it can cite no authority in support of its request. We conclude any deference to the SEC would be inconsistent with the defense being an affirmative one; in this matter the SEC is not an agency entitled to deference, but rather appears as an employer. Indeed, under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review that governs, it is the FLRA that receives deference when we review petitions challenging its conclusions under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., HHS Family Support Admin. v. FLRA,</span> 920 F.2d 45, 48 (D.C. Cir. 1990) ("[W]e must defer to the FLRA's interpretation of its own statute as against competing executive branch determinations.") (citing cases).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The SEC simply failed to meet its burden to prove its chosen affirmative defense--that the unilateral implementation of the new salary system on May 19, 2002 was necessary to the functioning of the agency--by a preponderance of the evidence. As the Authority has explained before, the rule governing this affirmative defense is that, pending the completion of the mandatory bargaining process:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he <span class="Italic">status quo</span> must be maintained to the maximum extent possible, that is, to the extent consistent with the necessary functioning of the agency. When an agency chooses to avail itself of this exception and thus to alter the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>, it must be prepared to provide affirmative support for the assertion that the action taken was consistent with the necessary functioning of the agency if its actions were subsequently contested in an unfair labor practice proceeding. The Authority has also indicated that the phrase, "consistent with the necessary functioning of the agency," may be accurately paraphrased as "necessary for the [agency] to perform its mission."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Def. Logistics Agency Def. Indus. Plan Equip. Ctr. Memphis Tennessee,</span> 44 F.L.R.A. 599, 616-17 (1992) (citing <span class="Italic">Dept of Justice, U.S. Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Serv., U.S. Border Patrol, Laredo, Texas,</span> 23 F.L.R.A. 90, 90 (1986)) (internal citations, footnotes and quotations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The SEC complains the FLRA purported to apply a mere preponderance burden of proof in determining whether the Commission sustained its affirmative defense, but effectively imposed a much more demanding one. In context, though, it seems clear the ALJ was describing the affirmative defense itself as demanding, not the employing agency's burden. From the Commission's point of view, this may be a distinction without a difference. Consider, however, that while the prosecution in a criminal case always bears the burden of proving the elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt, the substantive content of the elements to be proven may vary; for example, from a reckless state of mind to a knowing and intentional one. While the <span class="Italic">burden</span> is the same, the <span class="Italic">standard</span> <span class="Italic">itself</span> is different, and it is easier for a litigant to prove some than others.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To successfully invoke the "necessary functioning" exception, an agency must show the change is a response to "an overriding exigency" or similarly compelling need. <span class="Italic">22 Combat Support Group (SAC) March Air Force Base, California,</span> 25 F.L.R.A. 289, 301 (1987) ("While the matter was obviously important, I do not conclude it was so critical as to create an overriding exigency or other compelling reason which would justify adhering to the January 13 implementation date...."). For example, in one case the Authority rejected the defense because it did not appear that the agency "was in acute danger of being unable to perform its function without" the unilateral implementation of the change at issue. <span class="Italic">Def. Logistics Agency Def. Indus. Plan Equip. Ctr. Memphis Tennessee,</span> 44 F.L.R.A. at 617. The SEC observes that a public agency will rarely face an exigency that threatens its ability to function. But that is only to say the "necessary functioning" exception will never be the rule. Exigency still has a role to play in determining whether the unilateral implementation of a management proposal is properly exempted from statutory requirements. At the very least, the proponent of the necessary functioning defense must establish that the change was necessary for the agency to effectively perform its mission and that it was necessary to make the change at the time it was made. <span class="Italic">Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Serv.,</span> 55 F.L.R.A. 892, 904 (1999) ("Respondent has failed to establish that it was 'necessary' for it to implement the changes...prior to satisfying its bargaining obligation."). As the SEC fails to appreciate, there is a difference between what an agency finds expedient and what is necessitated by an "overriding exigency."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The administrative law judge (ALJ), whose decision was adopted by the Authority, carefully went through the evidence presented, analyzed the parties' arguments, and explained his findings and conclusions. There is "a reasoned path from the facts and considerations before the [agency] to the decision it reached." <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA,</span> 466 F.3d 1079, 1081 (D.C. Cir. 2006). The ALT acknowledged the Agency "was losing key employees at an alarming and dangerous rate" and needed to act quickly to reduce attrition by increasing compensation. But, as the ALJ observed, and as the Authority confirmed, "management must demonstrate not merely that the <span class="Italic">change</span> is necessary to its effective functioning, but also that <span class="Italic">delaying</span> <span class="Italic">implementation</span> until after the impasse is resolved would undermine the effective functioning of the agency." While the SEC makes a good argument that it urgently needed to recruit new staff and discourage defections from current employees, it failed to persuade the administrative law judge, the FLRA, and ultimately this court that its unilateral implementation of a new pay system <span class="Italic">on</span> <span class="Italic">May</span> <span class="Italic">19,</span> <span class="Italic">2002</span>--rather than after the completion of the required bargaining process--was necessary for the agency to perform its mission. As in previous cases in which this defense has not been satisfied, here "the record reflects that the reasons for the change were of long-standing origin and were merely desirable, rather than being essential or necessary to the functioning of the agency." <span class="Italic">Def. Logistics Agency Def. Indus. Plan Equip. Ctr. Memphis Tennessee,</span> 44 F.L.R.A. at 618 (quotations and citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The SEC also challenges two of the FLRA's factual findings. The Authority's findings of fact are "conclusive" if "supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c). "This standard requires us to defer to the Authority's factual determinations if, taking into account any record evidence to the contrary, the record contains such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support such determinations." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Ass'n of Gov't Employees, Local R5-136,</span> 363 F.3d at 475 (quotations and citations omitted). Substantial evidence "is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency's finding from being supported by substantial evidence." <span class="Italic">Consolo v. Fed. Maritime Comm'n,</span> 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966); <span class="Italic">see also Domestic Sec. Inc. v. SEC,</span> 333 F.3d 239, 249 (D.C. Cir. 2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The SEC has not shown that the challenged findings of fact fail under <span id="Page_1321"></span>this deferential standard.&#x2003;The SEC first challenges the FLRA's finding that the Executive Director's testimony "directly contradicts the [SEC's] claim that implementation of the pay system on May 19 was necessary to assure funding." The SEC points to testimony suggesting that if the $25 million reprogrammed by the Office of Management and Budget was not legally obligated in FY 2002, the money might be used for something else. The FLRA draws our attention to other testimony showing that money would likely be available to pay for the raises, either from the reprogrammed funds or the Agency's regular appropriation process. The SEC also challenges the FLRA's finding that the employees did not receive the salary increases until August and that this delay weakened the SEC's argument that implementation in May, rather than waiting for the Panel decision, was necessary to the functioning of the Agency. With respect to each of these findings, there was conflicting evidence in the record. The ALJ addressed the evidence in his decision, carefully describing contradictions and making credibility determinations. Such credibility determinations are almost never disturbed on appeal, and there is no reason to do so in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">The necessary functioning exception was applied to affirm the award of an arbitrator who concluded that the agency properly furloughed employees without completing implementation bargaining, <span class="Italic">SPORT and Dept. of Air Force, Edwards AFB</span>, 68 FLRA 9, 10-11 (2014) (recon. den. 68 FLRA 107 (2014)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union alleges that the Arbitrator erred when he concluded that implementing the furloughs on July 8 was necessary to the functioning of the Agency and, therefore, not a ULP. When an exception involves an award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews any question of law raised by the exception and the award <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. In applying the standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses whether the arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. When a grievance involves an alleged ULP, the arbitrator must apply the same standards and burdens that would be applied by an administrative law judge in a ULP proceeding under &#x00A7; 7118 of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that before changing conditions of employment, an agency must satisfy its duty to bargain. Further, the impasse resolution procedures of the Panel are an aspect of the collective-bargaining process. Once a party timely requests the assistance of the Panel, "the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> must be maintained to the maximum extent possible."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But an agency may unilaterally change working conditions if the changes are necessary to the functioning of the agency.[27] Thus, "necessary functioning" is a defense to a charge of unlawful unilateral implementation.[28] "An agency asserting the defense has the burden to establish 'that its actions were in fact consistent with the necessary functioning of the agency, such that a delay in implementation would have impeded the agency's ability to effectively and efficiently carry out its mission.'"[29] In applying the exception, the Authority has found that "whether its requirements are satisfied depends primarily on whether the agency produces adequate factual support for its assertions of necessity."[30] Moreover, the Authority has observed that "determinations as to whether an agency has satisfied the requirements of the 'necessary[-]functioning' exception are primarily, if not completely, factual."[31]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[31]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that the Arbitrator did not properly apply Authority precedent regarding the necessary-functioning defense. Specifically, the Union asserts that the Arbitrator did not factually distinguish this case from the Authority's decisions in <span class="Italic">U.S. DHS, U.S. CBP</span> [32] and <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, INS</span>.[33] However, in both of those cases, the factfinder found the agency's necessary-functioning defense to be unsupported.[34] Here, the Agency provided evidence to support its necessary-functioning claim, the Arbitrator credited the Agency's evidence, and the Union has not provided a basis for finding that the Arbitrator erred in doing so. Accordingly, the Union has not established that the Arbitrator misapplied Authority precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[32]&#x2003;62 FLRA 263.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union also argues that the Agency did "not offer any evidence or argument that [the Agency] did not have the salary funds to delay implementation of the furloughs until the [Panel] had ruled."[35] But it fails to explain why the Agency was required to do so in order to establish a necessary-functioning defense. As such, this claim does not show that the Arbitrator misapplied the law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Union argues that, during arbitration, the Agency did not "dispute that if the DOD[-]mandated furlough time remained at [eighty-eight] hours, the SPORT [bargaining-unit employees] starting on July 21...would [not] have affected the necessary functioning of the [A]gency," and that the Agency's "entire argument was based on an assertion [that] the DOD would reduce the number of furlough days and [as a result] the SPORT controllers would not be able to support" the Agency's flight testing. However, the Union does not explain how these claims are relevant to the necessary-functioning analysis. Accordingly, these claims are insufficient to establish that the award is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA affirmed the award of an arbitrator who concluded that the agency did not demonstrate that it was necessary to the functioning of an agency to change a dress code before completing bargaining, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU</span>, 62 FLRA 263, 265-66 (2007):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated above, an agency is obligated to bargain before implementing a change in the conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees. <span class="Italic">See Scott AFB</span>, 33 FLRA at 544-47. However, an agency is relieved of this obligation where implementation prior to the completion of bargaining is necessary to the functioning of the agency. <span class="Italic">See Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., 35 FLRA 296, 302 (1990). The Authority has held that a party asserting that unilateral implementation of a policy was necessary to the functioning of the Agency "must establish, with evidence, that its actions were in fact consistent with the necessary functioning of the agency, such that a delay in implementing would have impeded the agency's ability to effectively and efficiently carry out its mission." <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Justice, Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Serv</span>., 55 FLRA 892, 904 (1999) (then-Member Cabaniss and Member Wasserman dissenting in part on other grounds) (<span class="Italic">DOJ</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator rejected the Agency's claims that safety and efficiency concerns warranted unilateral implementation of the policy. In particular, as set forth above, the Arbitrator determined that the claimed risks regarding hair and jewelry were "unsupported[,]" the claimed risks regarding respirators and facial hair were "grossly overstated[,]" and that there was no evidence of "operational problems[.]" Although the Agency makes general assertions regarding officer safety, national safety, and Agency efficiency, the Agency has failed to point to any specific evidence in the record establishing that the Arbitrator erred in rejecting its claim that safety or efficiency concerns made implementation necessary to the functioning of the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Agency asserts that "[i]mmediate application" of the grooming standards policy was necessary to address the "lack of uniformity in an area of central importance" to the accomplishment of the Agency's anti-terrorism mission. However, consistent with the Arbitrator's findings, there is no indication that the public did not "respond[&#8197;] properly to the Agency's officers because of differing appearance standards" or that "lack of uniformity in attire and appearance...interfere[ed] with the accomplishment of the Agency's mission[.]" Accordingly, although the Agency's assertion demonstrates the critical nature of its mission, it does not establish how delaying implementation of the policy until the parties completed bargaining would have prevented the Agency from effectively carrying out its mission. <span class="Italic">See DOJ</span>, 55 FLRA at 904. Moreover, the Arbitrator found that the Agency's delay in implementing the policy one month past the planned implementation date "prove[d] that the timing of its implementation was not critical to the Agency's mission[.]" The Arbitrator's finding is consistent with Authority precedent holding that an agency's delay of implementation past the planned implementation date is evidence that the implementation was not necessary to the functioning of the agency. <span class="Italic">See Olam S.W. Air Defense Sector (TAC), Point Arena Air Force Station, Point Arena, Calif</span>., 51 FLRA 797, 827 (1996) (<span class="Italic">TAC</span>); <span class="Italic">Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Soc. Sec. Admin., &#x0026; Soc. Sec. Admin., Field Operations, Region II</span>, 35 FLRA 940, 951 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Agency has failed to establish that the Arbitrator erred in determining that implementation of the grooming standards policy was not necessary to the functioning of the Agency. Accordingly, we deny the Agency's exception.</p>
