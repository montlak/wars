<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-46"><span class="space">a.</span> National Security Work; Employees With Security Clearances; Work Critical to National Infrastructure; 5 USC 7112(b)(6)</h5>
<p class="noindent">As to employees challenged under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) of the Statute as being engaged in security work directly affecting national security, the activity must show: that the individual employee is engaged in the designated work; and that the work directly affects national security. Employees engaged in security work directly affecting national security included personnel security specialists with responsibility for granting access authorizations or clearances through examination, evaluating information about individuals, interviewing individuals, conducting security lectures, and determining whether individuals should be given data access. Although the term is not statutorily defined, <span id="Page_52"></span>"security work" includes the design, analysis, or monitoring of security systems and procedures, but the term does not include work involving mere access to and use of sensitive information and material. At a minimum, it would be expected that the position descriptions of the employees be designated as sensitive. A clerk typist was not engaged in security work; she had access to sensitive information, typed security-related information, and responded to inquiries. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Energy, Oak Ridge Operations, Oak Ridge, Tenn. and NAGE Local R5-181</span>, 4 FLRA 644, 657-58 (1980) (ALJ Decision) (<span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore and AFGE</span>, 58 FLRA 170, 174 (2002) (granting review of request for reconsideration of regional unit determination; requesting briefing on issue of whether "national security" encompasses work directly related to protection and preservation of the economic and productive strength of the United States). The linkage between an individual's duties and national security, to exclude the employee from the unit, must be direct. <span class="Italic">See NRC and NTEU,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v66/66-56.html">66 FLRA 311</a>, 315-22 (2011) (Member Beck dissenting), <span class="Italic">post</span>. GS-12 Security Specialists responsible for designing and auditing security systems and procedures were involved in security work, but their secretaries, who took dictation, performed typing, filing and responses to inquiries, were not engaged in security work directly affecting national security. A mail clerk who received and distributed classified materials according to security procedures was not excluded from the unit. <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 4 FLRA at 659, 662. Not excluded under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) were investigators who examined credentials of employment applicants, but who had no duties connected with national security or loyalty investigations. <span class="Italic">OPM and AFGE</span>, 5 FLRA 238, 247-48 (1981).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">US Attorneys Office for the Dist. of Columbia and AFSCME, Capital Area Council</span>, 37 FLRA 1077, 1084-89 (1990), summed up guidance concerning the nature of security work, as FLRA considered the unit status of a computer specialist, a computer programmer, and a management analyst:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7112(b)(6) provides, in pertinent part, that a unit shall not be determined to be appropriate if it includes any employee engaged in security work which directly affects national security. In <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>, the Authority defined "security work" as:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a task, duty, function or activity relating to securing, guarding, shielding, protecting, or preserving something. As used in context, "security work" would include the design, analysis, or monitoring of security systems and procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>, 4 FLRA at 655. Security work was found not to "include work involving mere access to and use of sensitive information and material.<span class="Italic">" Id</span>. "National security" was defined "to include only those sensitive activities of the government that are directly related to the protection and preservation of the military, economic, and productive strength of the United States[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 655-56.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In applying section 7112(b)(6), the Authority has excluded employees from bargaining units who: (1) maintained a classified material system, and reviewed and handled classified material; (2) controlled access to, destroyed, transported, and protected highly classified information; (3) maintained clearance records on individuals who are applicants for or holders of clearances to top secret materials and determined whether or not to grant such clearances; and (4) were responsible for the maintenance of a vault where top secret material was kept and whose duties included supplying technicians with top secret materials....</p>

<p class="noindent-1">[W]e reaffirm the principle, stated in <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>, that mere access to classified information is not sufficient to exclude an employee from a bargaining unit under section 7112(b)(6)....</p>
<p class="noindent">The exclusion under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) is assessed based on specific job responsibilities and the relation of those responsibilities to national security interests. The requirement that an employee hold a security clearance is not determinative of the unit exclusion <span class="Italic">DOD, Pentagon Force Protection Agency and FOP D.C. Lodge I</span>, 62 FLRA 164, 171-73 (2007), involved an effort by the agency, through a unit clarification proceeding, to exclude police officers from an existing unit because of their involvement in national security work:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The Authority's framework for evaluating exclusion claims under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In &#x00A7; 7105(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, Congress delegated to the Authority the exclusive jurisdiction to determine the appropriateness of units for labor organization representation under &#x00A7; 7112 of the Statute. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3723</span>, 49 FLRA 1256, 1258 (1994). As relevant here, &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) provides that a unit will not be considered appropriate if it includes "any employee engaged in intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or security work which directly affects the national security[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6)'s three-prong test, the RD must determine whether employees are: (1) engaged in security work that (2) directly affects (3) national security. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6). The Authority has previously defined each of these terms and explained how they are to be applied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, with respect to the term "engaged in security work," the Authority has defined "security work" as "a task, duty, function, or activity related to securing, guarding, shielding, protecting, or preserving something. As used in context, `security work' would include the design, analysis, or monitoring of security systems and procedures." <span class="Italic">Dep't of Energy, Oak Ridge Operations, Oak Ridge, Tenn.</span>, 4 FLRA 644, 655 (1980) (<span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>). Additionally, the term was modified when the Authority held that an employee is engaged in "security work" if the employee's position includes "the regular use of, or access to, classified information." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice</span>, 52 FLRA 1093 (1997) (<span class="Italic">DOJ</span>). Moreover, the Authority rejected an argument that the Statute required either an employee to have a security clearance, or that the employee's position be designated as "sensitive," in order for the employee to be excluded under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin., Balt., Md.</span>, 59 FLRA 137, 144-45, 145 n.6. (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring and Member Pope dissenting, in part) (<span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore</span>). Accordingly, in determining whether &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) applies to a particular employee, "the focus must be on the type and nature of the work performed." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 145. The possession of a security clearance is not in itself dispositive, but it is a "significant factor[&#8197;]" in making such a determination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, with regard to the term "directly affects," the Authority has defined this term to mean that the security work engaged in has a "straight bearing or unbroken connection that produces a material influence or [alteration]" on national security. <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore</span>, 59 FLRA at 144; <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>, 4 FLRA at 655.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, with respect to the term "national security," the Authority has held that the term "entails, among other things, Government activities directly related to the protection of the economic and productive strength of the Nation, including the security of the Government from sabotage." <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore, </span>59 FLRA at 144; <span class="Italic">see also Oak Ridge</span>, 4 FLRA at 655-56<span class="Italic">.</span> In addition, the Authority has clarified that "such activities clearly include protecting the Nation's critical infrastructure...as well as defending the Nation against terrorist activities." <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore, </span>59 FLRA at 144.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The RD failed to apply established law by not examining the specific duties of the various categories of police officers in reaching his &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) determinations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority bases bargaining unit eligibility determinations on testimony as to an employee's actual duties at the time of the hearing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Air Force, 82nd Training Wing, Sheppard Air Force Base, Wichita Falls, Tex.,</span> 61 FLRA 443, 445 (2006); <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore</span>, 59 FLRA at 142-43. As stated by AFGE, the record demonstrates that "police officers who are assigned to different locations and/or divisions have distinctly different duties[.] For example, as set forth above, the duties of ERT officers are different from those of K-9 officers or PSU officers, just as the duties of police officers assigned to the Pentagon are different from the duties of police officers assigned to the RRMC.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union now asserts that the RD erred "by holding that a representative witness was representative of what all police officers in the bargaining unit would testify [to] regardless of what position they encumbered" because that representative testimony "was representative of other police officers in their same positions and not every police position as asserted by the RD. The Union also asserts, generally, that the RD did not examine the actual duties of the disputed employees in applying the statutory test. We agree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this connection, although the RD made specific findings with respect to the actual duties of the representative witnesses who testified at the hearing, he did not base his holdings on specific job duties when applying the statutory standard. In this regard, rather than consider the actual duties of the PPD police officers within each of the five different categories (Police Officer; FTO; ERT Officer; K-9 Officer; and PSU Officer), as they are employed at the locations involved, the RD instead made general conclusions with respect to all PPD police officers without reference to their actual duties. Specifically, the RD made the generalized findings that PPD police officers have "overall responsibility for providing protection and security services to the DOD facilities, organizations and employees within the NCR under their jurisdiction[,]" and "provide, in effect, a first line of defense for the protection of the seat of the United States' military strength--the DOD Headquarters organizations, personnel, and facilities located within the NCR, where every major military operation of this country is planned or approved." Based on these generalized findings, and the further general observation that "it is clear from the record that the PPD [p]olice [o]fficers have direct responsibilities for the protection of the DOD Headquarters facilities and employees within the NCR, as well as visitors to those facilities[,]" the RD concluded that the work performed by the police officers directly affects national security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That the RD failed to base his bargaining unit eligibility determinations on an analysis of the actual duties of each category of PPD police officer is underscored by the RD's construction of the parties' stipulation. As discussed previously, the RD applied an "all or nothing" approach, stating: "[E]ither all of these employees are bargaining unit eligible, or they are all ineligible pursuant to 5 USC 7112(b)(6)." However, the parties' stipulation simply confirmed that the employees who testified represented all other employees, not that duties of the representative employees should be considered together. To the extent that the RD's commitment to this "all <span id="Page_53"></span>or nothing" approach led the RD to bypass a detailed and particularized analysis of the duties of each category of PPD police officer, under the statutory standard, in making the RD's unit eligibility determinations, the RD erred.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the case is remanded to the RD for clarification. <span class="Italic">Cf. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Computer &#x0026; Telecomms. Area, Master Station-Atlantic, Base Level Communications Dep't, Reg'l Operations Div., Norfolk, Va., Base Communications Office-Mechanicsburg</span>, 56 FLRA 228 (2000) (where RD failed to consider each of three statutory criteria for determining whether a unit was appropriate, case remanded to RD to consider all three factors and issue a decision consistent with those findings). On remand, the RD should examine and consider the actual job duties of each of the five categories of police officers in the different divisions, as they are employed at the locations involved, and analyze and explain with reference to these actual job duties whether the various police officer categories are excluded from bargaining unit eligibility under the criteria established pursuant to &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6). In so doing, the effect of the actual duties of each category of employee on national security, at the specific locations involved, must be evaluated to determine whether national security is "directly affect[ed.]" <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>, 4 FLRA at 655.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOD, Army Aeronautical Serv. Agency and AFGE,</span> 64 FLRA 217, 219-20 (2009) (for employee to be engaged in security work within &#x00A7; 7116(b)(6), employee's duties will include regular use of, or access to, classified information, a determination made apart from requirement by employing agency that employee hold security clearance).</p>
<p class="noindent">The distinction between the need to hold a security clearance and the unit exemption under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) was described in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Tyndall AFB and AFGE Local 1113</span>, 65 FLRA 610, 610-14 (2011), involving the position of Air Force Police Officer</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity is a military base for the United States Department of the Air Force (Air Force). The Activity's mission is to support the combat functions of the Air Force by providing training, maintenance personnel, and managers that provide combat assistance. The Activity houses over thirty tenants who assist with this mission. These tenants perform various functions, including responding to air threats located in the Activity's region, evaluating the Air Force's "air to air weapons system," researching, discovering, and developing technologies to "further air base capabilities," and providing "tools, practices, and professional support to maximize Air Force civil engineer capabilities[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity employs fifteen Officers, a civilian position that is responsible for several security functions on the base. The position is considered "non-critical, sensitive," and Officers have a "secret level of security clearance." All Officers receive training in "basic law enforcement techniques[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the beginning of each shift, Officers receive verbal briefings about security issues. The information they receive is not typically classified and is often "watered-down" information that is available to the public. Officers do not regularly "destroy[&#8197;], reproduc[e], stor[e], or handl[e] classified information."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Officers are stationed at the Activity's front gates. They are responsible for checking identification and passes for visitors who pass through the front gates.<span class="Italic"> </span>However, Officers do not issue identification or passes, except on weekends when they may hand out visitors' passes. On weekdays, commercial vehicles enter through a separate gate that is not staffed by Officers. On weekends, however, commercial vehicles must come through the front gate. Officers visually inspect commercial vehicles that come through the front gate, but they do not use any equipment to do so. Officers inspect other types of vehicles only when instructed to do so by the Activity as part of its "random anti-terrorist measure[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Officers must respond to alarms that are activated at any of the Activity's facility buildings. Facility buildings are critical buildings or buildings that contain classified information. Responding to alarms at facility buildings comprises most of the Officers' duties and occurs, on average, twice a shift. When an alarm is activated, an Officer proceeds to the building and waits for a building custodian to arrive. The Officer and the custodian walk through the facility to determine the cause of the alarm. The facilities often contain classified information that the building owners must secure. Officers potentially could view information that had been left unsecured, but none recalled actually seeing such information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Officers also are responsible for responding to incidents involving suspicious packages or bomb threats. If a suspicious package is reported, Officers and military police cordon off the area, evacuate unauthorized individuals inside the area, and prevent non-authorized individuals from entering it. Officers cordon-off the area until a fire chief (chief) with the Activity's fire department or other official determines no threat is present. Chiefs have the authority to send in bomb disposal units (disposal units) or military personnel with bomb-sniffing dogs. The disposal units are part of the Activity's civil engineer unit and have no affiliation with the Officers. Officers cannot enter the cordoned-off area unless chiefs order them to do so. Officers also do not assist with the disposal of the package.<span class="Italic"> </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">RD's Decision</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD noted that, under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) of the Statute, a bargaining unit is not considered appropriate if it includes "any employee engaged in intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or security work which directly affects national security[.]" RD's Decision at 7 (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6)). The RD further stated that, in order to determine whether an employee fits within the foregoing standard, the Authority examines "whether employees are: (1) engaged in security work that (2) directly affects (3) national security." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Def., Pentagon Force Prot. Agency, Wash., D.C., </span>62 FLRA 164, 171 (2007)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD concluded that the Officers' duties involve security work within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6). The RD reached this conclusion despite also finding that Officers "do not use classified information or have regular access to it." The RD determined that, although Officers, when responding to alarms, search facilities containing classified information, there is little chance that Officers could view or use the classified information in these buildings. He also found that Officers receive only "watered down" information during their security briefings. Thus, the RD found that Officers do not use or have "regular" access to classified information. He nevertheless concluded that the Officers' other duties--including patrolling the base and its perimeter, monitoring the front gates, responding to suspicious packages and bomb threats, making routine traffic stops, monitoring gate cameras, responding to alarm facilities, and providing security for the Activity's tenants--establish that they perform security work under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD also determined that Officers' duties involve national security within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) of the Statute.[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;Neither party disputes this conclusion. Accordingly, we do not address it further.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the RD concluded that the Officers' duties do not directly affect national security. He stated that an employee's duties directly affect national security if they have "a straight bearing or unbroken connection that produces a material influence" on national security. RD's Decision at 8 (citing <span class="Italic">SSA, Balt., Md., </span>59 FLRA 137, 144 (2003) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring and then-Member Pope concurring in part and dissenting in part); <span class="Italic">Dep't of Energy, Oak Ridge Operations, Oak Ridge, Tenn., </span>4 FLRA 644, 655 (1980) (<span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>)). Relying on the foregoing standard, the RD examined several of the Officers' duties. As is relevant here, he analyzed their involvement with suspicious packages and the front gate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that Officers must respond to incidents involving "bomb threats or suspicious packages[.]" However, he found that Officers only secure and control the area containing these threats, whereas the fire chief or the bomb disposal unit deals with, and ultimately disposes of, the actual threat.<span class="Italic"> </span>Thus, the RD concluded that the Officers' role in such situations is limited.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Examining the Officers' front gate duties, the RD found that Officers monitor gate cameras, check visitor identification and passes, perform random searches of non-commercial vehicles when ordered to do so during "random anti-terrorist measures[,]" and visually inspect commercial vehicles on weekends. However, the RD also found that Officers do not actually determine who may access the base; indeed, the only time Officers issue visitors' passes is on the weekend, and visitors must be sponsored by someone else.<span class="Italic"> </span>Further, the RD determined that Officers may not search non-commercial vehicles unless ordered to do so. Additionally, the RD found that Officers are limited to searching commercial vehicles on the weekend and, even then, conduct only visual inspections.<span class="Italic"> </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the RD determined that the Officers' duties do not "have a clear, unbroken connection to national security."<span class="Italic"> </span>The RD concluded that Officers should not be excluded from the bargaining unit because the duties they perform do not directly affect national security within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The RD did not commit clear and prejudicial error in connection with his examination of certain duties performed by Officers.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The RD did not commit clear and prejudicial error by disregarding facts linking the Activity's functions to the Officers' affect on national security</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity first argues that the RD "disregarded facts" linking the functions performed by the Activity, the Officer's duties, and national security. According to the Agency, due to the importance of the Activity's work, the RD should have found that any security work performed on the base necessarily affects national security. The Activity's argument is misplaced. In deciding whether a position directly affects national security within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) of the Statute, the Authority has consistently looked <span class="Italic">only </span>to the duties of the position at issue. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz.</span>, 62 FLRA 332, 335 (2008) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, <span id="Page_54"></span>Wash., D.C., </span>62 FLRA 286, 294 (2007) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring in part, dissenting in part); <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge, </span>4 FLRA at 655. The Authority has never stated that a position directly affects national security because of the duties performed by an activity. The Activity's argument is, therefore, incorrect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, the Activity's reliance on <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge </span>is misplaced. The Activity asserts that this matter satisfies "[v]irtually every one of the criteria" in <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>. The Activity does not explain what those "criteria" are, or how they apply in this matter. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Moreover, although the Authority in <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge </span>examined the functions of the activity, it relied on the <span class="Italic">duties of the position </span>at issue in order to determine whether that position directly affected national security. <span class="Italic">See Oak Ridge</span>, 4 FLRA at 656. Consequently, <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge </span>does not support the Activity's position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we deny the Activity's claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The RD did not commit clear and prejudicial error because he properly weighed the Officers' suspicious package duties. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity contends that the RD committed prejudicial error because he failed to properly weigh: (1) the Officers' involvement with suspicious packages; and (2) the Officers' searching of commercial vehicles. As previously noted, under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) of the Statute, a bargaining unit is not appropriate if it includes any employee engaged in "security work which <span class="Italic">directly affects </span>national security[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) (emphasis added). The Authority defines "direct effect" as "a straight bearing or unbroken connection that produces a material influence or [alteration]." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Agric., Food Safety &#x0026; Inspection Serv., </span>61 FLRA 397, 402 (2005) (<span class="Italic">USDA</span>) (quoting <span class="Italic">SSA, </span>59 FLRA at 143); <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge, </span>4 FLRA at 655 (citing <span class="Italic">Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary</span>). The Authority has found that a position does not directly affect national security if an intervening factor severs the position's affect on national security or otherwise limits it. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., USDA</span>, 61 FLRA at 402.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity first argues that the Officers' duties with respect to suspicious packages establish the Officers' direct effect on national security. The record reveals, however, that the Officers actual role in such situations is limited.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Officers are responsible for evacuating an area containing suspicious packages, cordoning-off the area, and preventing unauthorized individuals from entering the area. This is the extent of the Officers' functions; other positions are responsible for eliminating the threat posed by a suspicious package. A chief with the Activity's fire department is in charge of the situation and is the only individual who makes the decision as to how the situation should be resolved. To this end, only a chief can decide whether or not a disposal unit--which contains no Officers--or military personnel with bomb-sniffing dogs should be sent into the cordoned off area to dispose of the package. The disposal unit and military personnel are the only individuals who physically handle the package and ultimately decide how to dispose of it. Moreover, although Officers cordon off the area, they do so in conjunction with military police. Thus, even in the absence of Officers, other positions are available to cordon off the area. The Activity does not dispute any of the foregoing, nor has it averred that Officers have any involvement with the actual disposal of any suspicious packages. Accordingly, the record establishes that the Officers' ability to eliminate any threat posed by a suspicious package is quite "limited." <span class="Italic">USDA</span>, 61 FLRA at 402 (position's limited duties in resolving threat to national security supported finding that position did not directly affect national security).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Officers' discretion in resolving situations involving suspicious packages is similarly limited. Officers are required to follow a chief's orders. Officers cannot even enter the cordoned area unless a chief orders them to do so. Moreover, the Activity has not asserted, and the record does not reveal, that Officers have any control over the disposal unit or military personnel's actions or decisions. Thus, Officers have a "less than direct" impact on how suspicious package situations are resolved. <span class="Italic">USDA, </span>61 FLRA at 402 (position's limited discretion in deciding how to resolve threats supported finding that position did not directly affect national security).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The foregoing supports the RD's conclusion that Officers do not directly affect national security. Nevertheless, the Activity contends that Officers "are the actual threat response," because they "move people and assets out of harm's way,...apprehend suspicious persons, and...expose themselves to serious harm" by cordoning off the area. Although Officers do remove individuals from the area, as established above, Officers have little to no role in the disposal of suspicious packages, which is the "actual threat" at issue. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Additionally, the Activity cites to nothing in the record that establishes that Officers apprehend individuals associated with suspicious packages, nor do they explain how Officers being exposed to harm directly affects national security. The Agency's position, therefore, does not result in a different conclusion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity also contends that the RD committed prejudicial error because he failed to consider the fact that, when Officers search commercial vehicles on the weekend, they search vehicles of various sizes. Even if the RD failed to consider the distinction in commercial vehicle sizes, the Activity does not explain how such a distinction could directly affect national security. Thus, even if the RD committed the foregoing error, that error would not lead us to determine that his overall conclusion was erroneous.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we reject the Activity's claim that the RD committed prejudicial error by failing to properly weigh certain duties<span class="Italic">. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The RD did not fail to apply established law.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity argues that the RD impermissibly considered the Officers' involvement with classified information in his analysis of whether Officers directly affect national security. Based on this argument, the Activity also asserts that the RD did not treat the <span class="Italic">use of </span>classified information and <span class="Italic">access to </span>classified information equally. We construe the foregoing arguments as assertions that the RD failed to apply established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity's assertions are flawed. Contrary to the Activity's claim, the RD did not rely on the Officers' involvement with classified information to decide whether Officers directly affect national security. In his decision, the RD stated that, "[d]espite" the Officers' limited involvement with classified information, their other duties establish that they "are involved in <span class="Italic">security work </span>under the meaning of [&#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) of the Statute], thereby satisfying <span class="Italic">the first prong </span>of the test." The RD made no mention of the "directly affects" prong of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6). The foregoing language, therefore, demonstrates that the RD considered the Officers' involvement with classified information <span class="Italic">solely </span>for the purposes of deciding whether Officers perform security work within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6). This is further reinforced by the fact that the RD's discussion of whether Officers directly affect national security contains <span class="Italic">no </span>reference to the Officers' involvement with classified information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Officers' non-use of, and limited access to, classified information was not part of the RD's consideration of whether Officers directly affect national security. Thus, the Activity's argument is incorrect, and we reject it. Because this argument is the basis of the Activity's assertion that The RD did not treat "access to" and "use of" classified information equally, we likewise reject that argument as well<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's focus on specific job responsibilities involving national security, rather than the employee's position being designated as "sensitive" under Executive Order 10450, or the employee's need for a security clearance to perform work, was reemphasized in <span class="Italic">DOJ and AFSME Local 3097</span>, 62 FLRA 286, 290-96 (2007), describing evolution of the legal analysis, emphasizing the involvement of employees with operation of a database used in antiterrorism efforts, and applying that analysis to four positions, including three warranting unit exclusion:</p>

In doing so, the Authority considered several executive orders concerning national security that were promulgated after the enactment of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6), as well as the definition of "national security" used in <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge,</span> which it found to be consistent with those executive orders and other relevant authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority again reexamined the term "national security" as used in &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) in <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore </span>[<span class="Italic">Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland, </span>59 FLRA 137 (2003)], and held that the term applied to security work related to the economic and productive strength of the United States. <span class="Italic">See SSA, Baltimore, </span>59 FLRA at 144. In doing so, the Authority again considered executive orders and statutes that had been promulgated or enacted since the enactment of the Statute.[6] <span class="Italic">Reaffirming Oak Ridge</span> and <span class="Italic">DOJ,</span> the Authority held that "national security" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6), "entails, among other things, Government activities directly related to the protection of the economic and productive strength of the Nation, including the security of the Government from sabotage." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In addition, the Authority clarified that "such activities clearly include protecting the Nation's critical infrastructure, as defined in the authorities discussed above, as well as defending the Nation against terrorist activities." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Authority also stated that it would continue to apply the <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge </span>definition in determining whether security work "directly affects" national security within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;In this regard, the Authority specifically considered E.O. 13138, 64 Fed. Reg. 53879 (Sept. 30, 1999); the Critical Infrastructures Protection Act of 2001, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5195c, incorporated as &#x00A7; 1016 of the USA Patriot Act; and &#x00A7; 891 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore, </span>the Authority also rejected the union's argument that the Statute required either that an employee have a security clearance, or that the employee's position be designated as "sensitive," in order for the employee to be excluded under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) of the Statute.<span class="Italic"> See id. </span>at 144-45, 145 n.6. The Authority found that in determining whether &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) applies to a particular employee, "the focus must be on the type and nature of the work performed[,]" and not on whether the employee has a security clearance or whether the position has been designated as sensitive.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 145. In this connection, the Authority stated that employees may perform security work that directly affects national security "irrespective of whether they have a security clearance."<span class="Italic"> Id. </span>However, the Authority also stated that whether an employee holds a security clearance and/or occupies a position designated as "sensitive" are "significant factors in making a determination under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6)." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citation omitted). The Authority explained that "just as with other bargaining unit eligibility determinations, determinations under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) are to be based on the entire record as presented by the parties and developed during the representation proceeding." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, in <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore, </span>the Authority reaffirmed its practice of resolving matters arising under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) on a case-by-case basis by applying the statutory criteria to the record developed in each case, consistent with the Authority's exclusive jurisdiction to make appropriate unit determinations, including the resolution of questions concerning the bargaining unit status of employees, given to it by Congress.[7] The Agency requests that the Authority modify this approach and find that any employee who is designated "sensitive" under Executive Order (E.O.) 10450 or who has been granted a security clearance is, "based on that factor alone," excluded from the coverage of the Statute pursuant to &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore,</span> the Authority also noted that Congress addressed national security in &#x00A7; 7103(b) of the Statute, which grants the President the authority to order the exclusion of any agency or component from coverage of the Statute based on national security considerations. <span class="Italic">See SSA, Baltimore, </span>59 FLRA at 143. In this regard, the Authority stated that, unlike &#x00A7; 7103(b), which addresses agencies or other component as a whole, &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) is limited to whether particular employees may be included in bargaining units. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>Here, it is undisputed that no such &#x00A7; 7103(b) order applies in the present case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Sensitive Positions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 3(b) of E.O. 10450 requires agencies to designate as "sensitive" any position where the occupant "could bring about, by virtue of the nature of the position, a material adverse effect on the national security...." The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has issued regulations that implement this requirement at 5 C.F.R. Part 732, "National Security Positions." Specifically, these regulations require agencies to designate employees in one of three categories of sensitivity, mandate that agencies follow standards for investigating each level of sensitivity, and provide due process rights for employees subject to unfavorable determinations concerning sensitive positions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 732.201-203, 732.301.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;In 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.102(a), the term "national security position" is defined to include:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">[t]hose positions that involve activities of the Government that are concerned with the protection of the nation from foreign aggression or espionage, including development of defense plans or policies, intelligence or counterintelligence activities, and related activities concerned with the preservation of the military strength of the United States[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Further, as relevant here, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.201, provides that:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">the head of each agency shall designate, or cause to be designated, any position within the department or agency the occupant of which could bring about, by virtue of the nature of the position, a material adverse effect on the national security as a sensitive position at one of three sensitivity levels: Special-Sensitive, Critical-Sensitive, or Noncritical-Sensitive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court's decision in<span class="Italic"> Egan </span>indicates that administrative bodies like the FLRA do not have the authority to independently review an agency's national security determination that a particular position is sensitive under E.O. 10450. In particular, the Court held in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> [<span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v. Egan, </span>484 U.S. 518 (1988)] that the Merit Systems Protection Board lacked the statutory authority in a removal hearing to review the underlying reasons for the denial of an employee's security clearance where the employee lost his job for cause due to such denial. An agency's sensitivity determination under E.O. 10450 invokes similar national security issues as the Court discussed in<span class="Italic"> Egan </span>and may be based on an employee's "regular use of, or access to, classified information." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.102(2) (relationship to classified information is basis for designating position "national security position" under E.O. 10450). Thus, as the Agency argues, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> supports a conclusion that the same deference applied to clearance determinations is also due sensitivity determinations under E.O. 10450.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, the Agency is correct in asserting that the Authority may not review its determination under E.O. 10450 that a particular position "could" have an "adverse effect on the national security[.]" However, the Agency does not explain why this determination necessarily disposes of the issue before the Authority. We note that &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) requires that an employee be "engaged in intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or security work which directly affects national security[.]" This standard is not only different from the standard set out in the Executive Order, it is narrower. Rather than the potential adverse effect on national security that "could" result from the nature of positions covered by the Executive Order, &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) requires that the employee actually be "engaged" in particular work which has a "direct" effect on national security. The requirements of engagement and directness indicate that the statutory exemption describes a narrower class of positions than does the Executive Order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Agency is incorrect insofar as it asserts that "[i]n order to designate a position as 'sensitive,' the agency head must first determine that the position could 'have a material adverse effect on national security.'" Contrary to the Agency's assertion, E.O. 10450 provides only that positions that could have a material adverse effect on national security <span class="Italic">must</span> be designated as sensitive; it does not preclude an agency from designating a position as "sensitive" on grounds other than a possible adverse effect on national security. Thus, the category of sensitive positions may be broader than only those positions that fall under the Executive Order's definition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a general matter, the Authority has noted that "[i]n enacting section 7112(b)(6), Congress is presumed to have been aware of the meaning given to the term 'national security' in existing statutes and executive orders," including E.O. 10450, which was in effect when the Statute was passed. <span class="Italic">DOJ, </span>52 FLRA at 1099-1100. If Congress had wished to exclude all employees designated "sensitive" from bargaining units, it could have done so by incorporating the Executive Order standard into the Statute. Instead, Congress included a standard in &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) that focused on particular duties that employees must be engaged in and excluded only those employees who are actually performing those duties. The Agency provides no reason why the Authority should apply the broader standard set out in the Executive Order when Congress chose a narrower standard for the statutory exclusion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to the specific terms of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6), we also note that the Statute contains three additional national security-related exclusions: 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7103(a)(3)(B), (C), and (D) (excluding the FBI, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the National Security Agency); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) (authorizing the President to exclude any agency or subdivision thereof from coverage of the Statute if "the agency or subdivision has as a primary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work[.]"); and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(b)(2) (authorizing the President to suspend any provision of the Statute with respect to "any agency, installation, or activity located outside the 50 States and the District of Columbia, if the President determines that suspension is <span id="Page_56"></span>necessary in the interest of national security."). Congress has, therefore, set forth a comprehensive scheme with multiple national security protections, and the Agency provides no reason to interpret &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) in a manner that adds an exclusion that it does not expressly contain. We therefore deny the Agency's request that the Authority reconsider its standards concerning the application of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) of the Statute to employees in sensitive positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;Security Clearances</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth above, the Authority has determined that an employee is engaged in "security work" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) of the Statute if the employee's duties include "the regular use of, or access to, classified information." <span class="Italic">DOJ,</span> 52 FLRA at 1103. Here, the RD found, and it is not disputed, that the information contained in the JABS system is not classified and that none of the employees at issue regularly use or have access to classified information. Applying the <span class="Italic">DOJ </span>standard, the RD found that the employees' duties do not provide a basis for excluding them from the bargaining unit on the basis of their use of, or access to, classified information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Authority should hold that an agency's decision to grant an employee a security clearance is sufficient to satisfy the statutory exemption. According to the Agency, the granting of a security clearance makes the employee "immediately eligible to access classified information when the need arises" and a standard that permits such employees to remain in bargaining units "fails to recognize the flexibility that agencies require in order to respond quickly to unforeseen events threatening national security."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency does not provide any authority indicating that potential future access to classified information satisfies the requirement of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) that an employee be "engaged" in security work that "directly affects national security." Rather, the Agency asserts that there are situations where flexibility and the need to act quickly are paramount, using the Agency's response to the September 11, 2001, attacks as an example. However, the Agency's discussion of the actions it was required to take in the wake of that tragedy does not provide any basis on which to conclude that the Agency's flexibility was, or would be, compromised by the bargaining unit status of an employee with a security clearance. The Agency also posits a hypothetical situation where one of the employees at issue in this case is "unexpectedly...needed tomorrow to assist with a six-month project requiring that he regularly use classified information." However, as with the Agency's prior example, the Agency does not provide any basis to conclude that its ability to carry out such an assignment would be compromised by the bargaining unit status of an employee. Thus, even if, as the Agency claims, the bargaining unit status of an employee temporarily assigned to classified duties would be unclear, the Agency does not explain either why this potential dispute would affect the employee's assignment or why such dispute could or should not be resolved at the time it arises. For the above reasons, we find that the Agency has not established that the Authority should reconsider its precedent with regard to the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) of the Statute and automatically exclude employees with security clearances from the coverage of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The RD failed to apply established law with respect to three of the four positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here and explained above, the exclusion set out at &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) of the Statute is satisfied where: (1) the tasks and duties of the employee's position include the designing, analyzing, or monitoring of security systems or procedures; (2) the system concerns "national security"; and (3) the work "directly affects" national security as "a straight bearing or unbroken connection that produces a material influence or [alteration].[9]<span class="Italic"> SSA, Baltimore, </span>59 FLRA at 143<span class="Italic"> (quoting Oak Ridge,</span> 4 FLRA at 655). As the second of these criteria applies equally to all four positions, we address it initially.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;With respect to the third criterion, the RD did not address whether the incumbents' work with the JABS system "directly affects" national security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that JABS itself "is a secure computerized repository of identifying and biographical data concerning federal offenders, and is used in connection with the protection and security of the United States[.] This uncontested finding supports a conclusion that JABS is a national security system meeting the second criterion set forth above. It is undisputed that following the attacks of September 11, 2001, JABS has been utilized in a number of ways to defend the Nation against terrorist activities. Specifically, there is no dispute that following the attacks, the Agency expedited the installation of JABS computer hardware at every Agency site in the nation in an effort to fight terrorism. Further, there is no dispute that JABS has been used by the DoD in recent military operations to input military detainee information. In this connection, JABS was used to process military insurgents and other individuals who were incarcerated in Abu Ghraib Prison in Iraq. JABS was also used in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to process detainees in the custody of coalition forces. It is also undisputed that JABS was utilized by the FBI to create an "index of known or suspected terrorists" that is maintained in JABS. Based on the foregoing, we conclude that JABS is a system that concerns national security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD nevertheless concluded that the four employees should not be excluded because their work did not satisfy the first criterion above. He found that they were not performing "security work" because their duties did not include the designing, analyzing, or monitoring of security systems or procedures and the four employees "are not responsible for securing, guarding, shielding, protecting or preserving JABS." The Agency argues that the RD erred in concluding that the work of the four employees did not constitute "security work" as the Authority has defined that statutory term.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Specialist 1</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Among other duties, the RD found that Specialist 1 "ensures that the customer agencies he works with adhere to JABS security policies[.]" <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 4. This finding supports the Agency's contention that Specialist 1 is involved in the designing, analyzing, or monitoring of JABS. The Agency asserts, and the record supports, that if a change is requested in order to enhance the security of the JABS system, Specialist 1 must test the system and ensure its integrity. The Agency further asserts, and the record supports, that customer agencies serviced by Specialist 1 contact him with regard to any concerns related to the security or functioning of the JABS system, following which Specialist 1 gathers information concerning the requested modifications and helps with the design of those modifications. Further, the Agency claims that the customer agencies serviced by Specialist 1 contact him if they discover design and security problems and Specialist 1 then plans the analysis that will be used to identify and repair the problem. Specialist 1 is also responsible for testing the system to make sure that what the contractors have done is correct.<span class="Italic"> </span>In addition, the record supports the Agency's assertion that Specialist 1 is responsible for testing the integrity of the security of JABS, works with the JABS security team to further define customer agency security needs, and has ultimate responsibility and accountability for the required security modifications.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD's general conclusion that none of the four employees at issue is responsible for designing, analyzing, or monitoring any security systems or procedures is not consistent with the RD's specific findings concerning Specialist 1's duties or with the uncontested record evidence relied on by the Agency. While the RD may be correct that other offices have responsibility for securing the JABS system, this does not mean that the duties Specialist 1 performs implementing the security requirements of customers and ensuring that these customers comply with the Agency's security standards are not also "security work" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6). The findings of the RD, as supported by the record, demonstrate that Specialist 1 is responsible for monitoring the security of the JABS system by directing and testing any security-related changes the contractors make to the system. As such, we find that the RD failed to apply established law when he held that the duties of Specialist 1 did not involve the designing, analyzing, or monitoring of JABS. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., SSA, Baltimore, </span>59 FLRA at 146;<span class="Italic"> DOJ, </span>52 FLRA at 1104. Consistent with the preceding discussion, we thus find that Specialist 1 is engaged in security work within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having concluded that Specialist 1 is engaged in security work that satisfies the first two <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore</span> criteria, we now consider whether that work satisfies the third criterion--whether it "directly affects" national security as "a straight bearing or unbroken connection that produces a material influence or [alteration]."<span class="Italic"> SSA, Baltimore, </span>59 FLRA at 143 <span class="Italic">(quoting Oak Ridge, </span>4 FLRA at 655). For the reasons that follow, we find that the work Specialist 1 performs and the decisions he makes with regard to the security of the JABS system are critical to protecting the information contained within that system. Specifically, Specialist 1 is personally and directly responsible for monitoring the security of the JABS system by directing and testing any security-related changes the contractors make to the system. Further, he is ultimately accountable for the accuracy of any such security modifications.<span class="Italic"> See id. </span>There are, therefore, no intervening steps between the duties of Specialist 1 and the potential effects on national security if Specialist 1 fails to perform his duties. Thus, there is a direct connection between the duties of Specialist 1 and national security. Accordingly, we find that Specialist 1 is engaged in security work that directly affects national security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Specialist 2</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that Specialist 2 serves as the COTR for the contractors who are responsible for servicing CORE JABS and "oversees contractor work ensuring that JABS is operational, that necessary system maintenance is performed, and that unexpected downtime is kept to a minimum. The RD also found that Specialist 2 is "able to bring the JABS system down in order to perform system maintenance.<span class="Italic"> </span>The Agency notes that, as COTR, Specialist 2 has oversight over all interactions with the contractors. As a result, according to the Agency, Specialist 2 is responsible for helping <span id="Page_57"></span>to maintain the security of JABS insofar as any type of security-related change to JABS has to be routed through him. In this connection, the Agency further notes that only Specialist 2 has the authority to direct the contractors to make such changes to the system. Consistent with the RD's findings, the record supports the Agency's assertion that contractors bring any security issues they discover within the system to the attention of Specialist 2, who then is responsible for reporting those issues to the security team. In this regard, Specialist 2 testified that he has access to "everything that's in JABS." Insofar as the RD specifically credited Specialist 2's testimony with regard to his description of the duties of his job, and did not discredit Specialist 2's testimony with respect to this, or any other issue, we credit the testimony of Specialist 2 and find that he has access to "everything that's in JABS."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As with Specialist 1, the RD's conclusion that none of the four employees at issue is responsible for designing, analyzing, or monitoring any security systems or procedures is not consistent with the RD's specific findings concerning Specialist 2's duties or with the uncontested record evidence relied on by the Agency. With regard to the latter point, it is uncontested that Specialist 2 is responsible for overseeing all contractor work on CORE JABS, including work related to security. The findings of the RD, as supported by the record, demonstrate that Specialist 2 is responsible for monitoring the security of the JABS system by overseeing the security work performed by contractors on CORE JABS. As such, we find that the RD failed to apply established law when he held that the duties of Specialist 2 did not involve the designing, analyzing, or monitoring of JABS. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., SSA, Baltimore, </span>59 FLRA at 146;<span class="Italic"> DOJ, </span>52 FLRA at 1104. Consistent with the preceding discussion, we further find that Specialist 2 is engaged in security work within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the third <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore</span> criterion, we find that Specialist 2 is engaged in security work that directly affects national security. As with Specialist 1, for the reasons that follow, we find that the work Specialist 2 performs and the decisions he makes with regard to the security of the JABS system are critical to protecting the information contained within that system. Specifically, Specialist 2 is personally and directly responsible for overseeing all contractor work on CORE JABS, including work related to the security of the JABS system. Further, only Specialist 2 has the authority to direct the contractors to make such security changes to the system. There are, therefore, no intervening steps between the duties of Specialist 2 and the potential effects on national security if Specialist 2 fails to perform his duties. Thus, there is a direct connection between the duties of Specialist 2 and national security. Accordingly, we find that Specialist 2 is engaged in security work that directly affects national security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;Project Manager</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that the Project Manager "reviews contractors' work on JABS' code, designs[,] and testing plans, including] work affecting the security of access to the JABS system. The Agency argues, and the record supports, that the Project Manager is responsible for the security of the part of CORE JABS that he maintains. In this connection, the record also supports the Agency's assertion that the Project Manager is responsible for ensuring that any changes to CORE JABS are performed correctly.<span class="Italic"> </span>The Project Manager also works with contractors to resolve weaknesses in the security or integrity of JABS. Further, the Agency asserts, and the record supports, that the Project Manager had been involved in two changes that affected security just prior to the hearing in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As with the previous two positions, the RD's conclusion that none of the four employees at issue is responsible for designing, analyzing, or monitoring any security systems or procedures is not consistent with the RD's specific findings concerning the Project Manager's duties or with the uncontested record evidence relied on by the Agency. With respect to the latter point, it is uncontested that the Program Manager is responsible for overseeing contractor work related to the security of the part of CORE JABS that he maintains. The findings of the RD, as supported by the record, demonstrate that the Program Manager is responsible for monitoring the security of the JABS system by overseeing the security work performed by contractors on CORE JABS. As such, we find that the RD failed to apply established law when he held that the duties of the Program Manager did not involve the designing, analyzing, or monitoring of JABS. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., SSA, Baltimore, </span>59 FLRA at 146; <span class="Italic">DOJ,</span> 52 FLRA at 1104. Consistent with the preceding discussion, we further find that the Project Manager is engaged in security work within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the third criterion set forth above, we find that the Project Manger is engaged in security work that directly affects national security. As with Specialists 1 and 2, for the reasons that follow, we find that the work the Project Manager performs and the decisions he makes with regard to the security of the JABS system are critical to protecting the information contained within that system. Specifically, the Project Manager is personally and directly responsible for maintaining the security of the part of CORE JABS that he maintains and ensuring that any changes to CORE JABS are performed correctly. There are, therefore, no intervening steps between the duties of the Project Manager and the potential effects on national security if the Project Manager fails to perform his duties. Thus, there is a direct connection between the duties of the Project Manager and national security. Accordingly, we find that the Project Manager is engaged in security work that directly affects national security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4.&#x2003;Analyst</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the Analyst, the Agency does not dispute the RD's finding that the incumbent performs administrative tasks such as ordering equipment needed by customer organizations, answering phones, and opening mail. Similarly, the Agency does not point to any duties performed by the incumbent that demonstrate that she is involved in the designing, analyzing, or monitoring of security systems or procedures. While the incumbent may have limited access to sensitive information, which she may see when opening the mail or overhear in the office, the incumbent has no access to the JABS system itself. Contrary to the Agency's assertion that the incumbent serves as a "backup" to the employee who enrolls JABS users, the record demonstrates that she has not had access to JABS for the three years prior to the hearing, she does not have a JABS password, and she has not served as the "back-up" in those three years because there is another "back-up" person.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast with the previous three positions, the RD's conclusion that the Analyst is not responsible for designing, analyzing, or monitoring any security systems or procedures is consistent with the RD's specific findings concerning the Analyst's duties and with the uncontested record evidence. The undisputed evidence demonstrates that the Analyst does not have access to or responsibility for any part of the JABS system. The record also reveals that the Analyst is responsible for ordering equipment for JABS only at the direction of the servicing project manager. In addition, unlike the other three incumbents--who direct, oversee and are responsible for the work of contractors relating to the security of JABS--there is no record evidence that the Analyst is responsible for overseeing the work of others who are involved in monitoring the security of JABS. There is similarly no record evidence that the Analyst is otherwise responsible for designing, analyzing, or monitoring any security systems or procedures. As such, we find that the RD did not fail to apply established law when he held that the duties of the Analyst did not involve the designing, analyzing, or monitoring of JABS. In light of this conclusion, there is no need to address the third criterion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to its claims based on the specific work of the employees and apart from its claim that Authority precedent should be reconsidered, the Agency argues that the RD failed to apply established law by not giving the proper weight to the Analyst's security clearance status and the designation of her position as sensitive, as required by <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore.</span> In support, the Agency states that, under <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore, </span>security clearances and designations of positions as sensitive are "significant factors" in determining bargaining unit status. Application for Review at 23 <span class="Italic">(quoting SSA, Baltimore,</span> 59 FLRA at 145).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency's claim, the RD's decision specifically acknowledged that the Analyst has a top secret security clearance and that her position is designated as special-sensitive. Further, consistent with <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore, </span>the RD noted the importance of these factors for determining bargaining unit eligibility under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6). Nevertheless, the RD found no evidence that the nature and type of work performed by the Analyst involved the regular use of, or access to, classified information and found that she was not involved in the designing, monitoring, or analyzing of security programs or policies. Based on the foregoing, the Agency has not established that the RD failed to afford appropriate weight to the incumbent's security clearance status and the designation of her position as sensitive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the above reasons, we find that the Agency has not established that the RD failed to apply established law or made prejudicial factual errors with regard to the Analyst.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 65 FLRA 687, 690-93 (2011) (Member Beck dissenting in part), explored application of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) to security officers responsible for protecting a secure IRS facility designed to permit continuing operations of the agency during catastrophic circumstances--a facility containing highly sensitive information and containing offices available for use in those circumstances by the highest level officials of the Department of Treasury and IRS. Although the officers had access to sensitive areas of the facility and to the information contained in those areas, their limited contact with those areas and that information did not warrant their exclusion under &#x00A7; 7116(b)(6). The officers' connection with national security was not sufficiently direct to warrant their unit exclusion:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the RD noted, under &#x00A7; 7116(b)(6) of the Statute, a bargaining unit is not appropriate if it includes any employee engaged in "security work which directly affects national security[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6). It is undisputed that Officers are engaged in security work that involves national security. <span id="Page_58"></span>Consistent with the application for review, the issue is whether the RD erred by finding that the Officers' work <span class="Italic">directly affects </span>national security, as required by &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has interpreted and applied &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) for more than thirty years--since the Statute's enactment. In <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>, the Authority considered the "ordinary meaning" of the term "directly affects" and found that it means "a straight bearing or unbroken connection that produces a material influence or alter[&#8197;]ation." 4 FLRA at 655. The plain terms of this definition--that any bearing on national security must be "straight[,]" any connection must be "unbroken[,]" and any influence or alteration must be "material[,]" <span class="Italic">id.</span>--make it clear that &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) does not permit the exclusion of positions merely because they have <span class="Italic">some </span>relationship to national security.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;We note that the dissent does not: squarely address the plain wording of "directly affects[;]" challenge how it has been interpreted since <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>; or explain how it permits any conclusion other than a conclusion that this language "should be interpreted narrowly[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6), the Authority, since <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>, has found that positions directly affect national security only in limited circumstances. For example, when there are "no intervening steps between the employees' failure" to satisfactorily perform their duties "and the potential effect [of that failure] on national security[,]" the Authority has found the requisite direct connection. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz.</span>, 62 FLRA 332, 335 (2008) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring). By contrast, where an employee's role in protecting national security is "limited[,]" the Authority has not found the requisite direct connection. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Tyndall Air Force Base, Tyndall AFB, Fla.</span>, 65 FLRA 610, 614 (2011) (<span class="Italic">Tyndall AFB</span>); <span class="Italic">USDA</span>, 61 FLRA at 402. Similarly, where employees must "go through another individual" before they may conduct a more extensive review of a situation that they believe may pose a security risk, the Authority has declined to find a direct effect. <span class="Italic">USDA</span>, 61 FLRA at 403. <span class="Italic">Cf. Tyndall AFB</span>, 65 FLRA at 613 (officers were responsible for evacuating and cordoning off areas containing suspicious packages, and preventing unauthorized individuals from entering the areas, but other positions were responsible for eliminating the threat posed by the packages). The Authority also has declined to find a direct effect where duties were "carried out in accordance with established procedures and provide[d] little opportunity for making choices[.]" <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>, 4 FLRA at 659. Further, the mere fact that employees' work may have a relationship to important national interests is not sufficient to find a direct effect on national security. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., USDA</span>, 61 FLRA at 402-03 (declining to exclude inspectors who were involved in "guard[ing], shield[ing], and protect[ing] the food supply from the importation of unsafe, adulterated, damaged or ineligible food products[&#8197;]").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's precedent applying &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) is consistent with not only the plain wording of that statutory section, but also important statutory rights and policies discussed in <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>. In this connection, in <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>, the Authority emphasized that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[e]xclusion from an appropriate unit deprives employees of the opportunity under the Statute to determine whether or not they wish to be represented by a labor organization and of the opportunity to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment through labor organizations. Labor organizations and collective bargaining in the civil service have been determined by the Congress to be "in the public interest." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(a). <span class="Italic">Therefore</span>, the term "national security" must be interpreted to include only [certain activities].</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>, 4 FLRA at 655 (emphasis added). This passage, which underscores the importance of the statutory rights and policies involved in this case, supports a narrow application of the "directly affects" requirement. Such an application is necessary to ensure that Congress' determination in &#x00A7; 7101(a) to "safeguard[&#8197;] the public interest" through the institution of collective bargaining for federal employees is fully effectuated, rather than being unreasonably limited by constricted interpretations of the Statute that are not compelled by the Statute's plain language.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, as particularly relevant in this case, the Authority's precedent applying &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) is consistent with Congress' determination that federal employees who perform guard duties may be included in bargaining units with non-guard employees. In this connection, Executive Order (E.O.) 11,838, which preceded the Statute, amended E.O. 11,491, in pertinent part, "by eliminating the requirement that guards be represented in separate units and only by labor organizations which represented guards exclusively." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Bureau of the Mint</span>, 2 FLRA 457, 460 (1980). In this connection, in a report that accompanied the issuance of E.O. 11,838, the Federal Labor Relations Council stated that "[g]uards have demonstrated no conflict of interest in performing their duties[&#8197;]" and "[s]o long as the existing prohibition on strikes by federal employees is continued, such conflicts as might exist in the private sector need not be anticipated." <span class="Italic">Labor-Mgmt. Relations in the Fed. Sector </span>(1975), at 30. This principle was continued when Congress enacted the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Bureau of Indian Affairs, Wind River Agency, Fort Washakie, Wyo.</span>, 29 FLRA 935, 936, 938 (1987) (noting regional director's finding in this regard and declining to reconsider the policy created by E.O. 11,838). Thus, unlike certain other statutory exclusions--such as management officials under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(1)--there is no inherent conflict of interest arising when bargaining unit members perform guard duties. <span class="Italic">Cf. Dep't of the Navy, Automatic Data Processing Selection Office</span>, 7 FLRA 172, 175 (1981) (noting "the intent reflected in the legislative history to exclude...officials who are identified with management and whose inclusion would result in an apparent conflict of interest[&#8197;]").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the RD found that the Officers' duties directly affect national security based on the Officers': (1) access to and protection of the Secure Room; (2) access to and protection of the Cage; and (3) guarding of sensitive materials when those materials are moved during a COOP. For the following reasons, applying the terms of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) and the well-established Authority precedent cited above, we find that the record does not support the RD's conclusion that these duties (the disputed duties) demonstrate a direct effect on national security.[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;There is no basis for the dissent's statement that this decision "modif[ies] the Authority's approach to exclusion under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) of the Statute." We expressly apply the Authority's longstanding approach to &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6), as underscored by our conclusion that the RD "failed to apply <span class="Italic">established law</span>" regarding &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, other individuals play an important role in securing the Center. In this connection, Guards also work the front gate and check card readers, and it is Guards, not Officers, who are primarily responsible for: (1) determining which individuals may actually enter the building; and (2) providing visitors with identity badges. By controlling access to the facility, the Guards' duties have a substantial impact on the security of the facility. Further, the record indicates that Guards "man the command center," including the video monitors in that center, and dispatch Officers if Guards see something "that shouldn't be[,]" In this connection, one Officer testified that if he was not nearby when someone needed to be apprehended, the Guard could apprehend the individual and, in those situations, "would be the first line of defense[.]" Another individual testified that Guards "can do...walk-throughs of the building, the card readers" and "help [Officers] in that respect[,]" and that although, "because of manpower, mainly, [the Guards are]...at the fixed post at the gate,...they can and they have helped do walk-throughs of th[e] buildings." In addition to Guards, an information technology specialist testified that "[e]mployees are always told that security begins with us, so we're supposed to question if someone is not wearing their badge properly, if there is a suspicious package or if we get bomb threats," and that she "ha[s] actually challenged some people that didn't have their badges on." That employees other than Officers play such an important role in securing the Center supports a conclusion that Officers do not directly affect national security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the disputed duties occur within rooms that are accessible only by keys and/or card readers, and those rooms are within the Center, which, as stated previously, is accessible only by individuals who have been screened at the front gate. These additional layers of security render it less probable that the Officers' performance of the disputed duties within the secured Center would produce "a material influence or [alteration]" on national security. <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 59 FLRA at 143.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, in addition to the disputed duties, the Officers perform numerous other duties, including: checking incoming vehicles and passengers for proper identification and authorization to enter the building; performing vehicle patrols of the Center's grounds; and engaging in foot patrols of other areas of the Center's interior. That the Officers perform numerous, important duties unrelated to the disputed duties related to the Secure Room and the Cage is relevant to determining whether the Officers should be excluded from the unit.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;The RD's findings and the record do not establish how frequently the Officers perform the disputed duties. In this connection, the RD found both that Officers' "duties relative to" the Secure Room and the Cage are only "occasional[&#8197;]" and that "[e]vidence demonstrates that [Officers] regularly patrol the...Cage and particularly at night, will walk through to insure that no documents are visible or computers left on." With regard to the record, one Officer testified that "when I'm doing a patrol of the annex, I would generally take a tour through" the Cage, while another Officer testified: "I don't go in there really unless I'm called, because if I'm doing my foot patrol through there, or a card reader, I go around the outside of it; and[&#8197;]...if something is showing smoke or something, or I'm requested to go in there, I will go in, but it's not a regular thing for me to go in there." Accordingly, it is not clear whether Officers "regularly patrol the Cage area" and "the interior of the Cage." In any event, that Officers perform numerous other duties indicates that the disputed duties are not the sole focus of their responsibilities, which informs our determination as to their unit status even if it is not a dispositive consideration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_59"></span>Moreover, the nature of the disputed duties does not demonstrate a straight or unbroken connection to national security. As an initial matter, we emphasize that the Officers are not stationed outside either the Secure Room or the Cage, checking badges of individuals who wish to enter the rooms. Rather, the Officers check on the rooms only as part of their foot patrols through the entire Center.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Secure Room in particular, the record indicates that Officers generally do not access that Room. (Officer's testimony that he does not go into the Secure Room on a regular basis and had been informed that he was to "go into [it] only when [he] need[s] to[&#8197;]" do so); (other Officer's testimony that he "do[es] not have access to[&#8197;]" the Secure Room). In particular, the record indicates that the circumstances under which Officers access that Room are limited. In this connection, one Officer testified only that he had "opened the door for the person that's supposed to be there[,]" that he had "checked a motion alarm before and c[o]me back out[,]" and that he sometimes checks "glass-break alarms" from the outside of the room. In fact, that Officer testified that he does not know what is contained in, or what is done in, the Secure Room. Further, in order to access the Room, Officers must obtain the assistance of other individuals. Specifically, one witness testified that the command center has an envelope with a sealed key, and the individuals in the command center must "make phone calls[&#8197;]...to notify people that you're going in that room, and then you use that key and you can get in[.]" As to the Officers' protection of the Secure Room, the record evidence is limited. For example, an Officer testified that "as long as the door [to the Room] is closed, that's usually enough[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, Officers access the Secure Room only rarely and in limited circumstances, and they must obtain the assistance of other individuals in order to access it. In addition, the record evidence of their duties in protecting the Secure Room is limited. In these circumstances, we find that the record does not reflect that Officers' duties with respect to the Secure Room have "a straight bearing or unbroken connection that produces a material influence or [alteration]" on national security. <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 59 FLRA at 143.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Officers' duties in and around the Cage, one Officer testified that when he enters the Cage, he's "checking for fire hazards, anything that would threaten the facility, any danger, and I don't do it on a daily basis." According to that Officer, employees work in the Cage during the weekday, and consequently, if he sees files laying out, he "wouldn't bother to look[&#8197;]" because he would "assume somebody is working there." In this connection, he stated that he has "never read [anything] on anybody's desk[.]" Further, when asked whether he "look[s] for things like computers being on[,]" he testified: "I do not pay attention to the computers at all. I don't know who is in--what people are doing in there. I don't know what they're doing and what they have on and what they need to have on."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for Officers on the night shift, another Officer testified that when he patrols the Cage, he looks for "computers that have been left on, any unsafe conditions that may exist." For example, he said that "[t]here have probably been twice, in recent memory, where somebody has reported smoke, the smell of smoke[.]" However, he also testified that he has "never found" a computer left on. He further testified that, if he found a live computer on, then he would "attempt to get somebody to remedy the problem[,]" and "[i]f [he] can't find anybody in the area, [he] know[s] how to power down a computer and you just turn it off. That would be the extent of what [he] would do." He also testified that he would also "look[&#8197;] for a possibility that somebody left files or papers out[,]" but that he's "never seen any[&#8197;]" documents and files lying out because "[g]enerally, everything is secured when [the employees who work in the Cage] leave." As with the other Officer, he testified that he does not know what is performed in the Cage.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the record indicates that other individuals work directly with the materials in the Cage. The record also indicates that at night, Officers who enter the Cage generally do not see documents left out or computers left on, and even if they did see a computer on, they would first contact someone else to address it and would turn it off only if someone was not available to address it. Given these circumstances, we find that the record does not reflect that Officers' duties with respect to the Cage have "a straight bearing or unbroken connection that produces a material influence or [alteration]" on national security. <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 59 FLRA at 143.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the guarding of sensitive materials when those materials are moved during a COOP, an Officer testified that he did not know what was in the "locked tubs[&#8197;]" that are moved, and that the extent of the Officer's involvement is to "let the warehouse in and out[&#8197;]" [sic], and provide for access and exit of the materials "[i]n and out of the dock areas[.]"[9] In other words, the Officers do not move any materials, and merely oversee the movement of the materials, which are in locked tubs. Given that other individuals are actually moving the materials, that the tubs are locked, and that the movement occurs only in COOP events and inside of an already secured facility, we find that any connection that this activity has to national security is not direct.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;We note the dissent's statement that the Officer "agreed that Officers provide '<span class="Italic">secure </span>access and <span class="Italic">secure </span>exit' of these materials." In fact, the Officer testified, "We let the warehouse in and out." When asked, "You provide for secure access and secure exit of these materials?," the Officer responded: "In and out of the dock areas, yes." Thus, the word "secure" was solely the questioner's, and the emphasis is solely the dissent's.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Taking all of the disputed duties together, we find that the Officers' duties do not directly affect national security. In so finding, we note that in the decisions cited by the Activity and the dissent, employees who were excluded from units under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) engaged in activities such as designing, analyzing, and/or installing security systems at the facilities involved. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 62 FLRA at 303; <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 59 FLRA at 146. The Officers do not engage in similar activities. Thus, those decisions are distinguishable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the RD failed to apply established law when he found that the Officers' duties directly affect national security, and we direct the RD to clarify the unit to include the Officers.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU</span>, 68 FLRA 13, 14 (2014) (supply-chain specialists in Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism Program (C-TPAT or program) ("For an employee's work to 'directly affect' national security, it must have a 'straight bearing or unbroken connection that produces a material influence' on national security. Evaluating the evidence, the RD determined that the specialists' work investigating applicants and securing international supply lines qualifies as investigative and security work that relates to national security. However, the RD determined that, because the specialists' work does not have a straight bearing on national security, their work does not directly affect national security. Specifically, the RD found that supervisors and managers--not specialists--make 'decisions whether to validate an entity's participation at a particular C-TPAT [t]ier, or whether to suspend it from C-TPAT altogether.' Although finding that specialists 'have discretion in investigating and monitoring their companies,' the RD determined that field-office directors review the specialists' work. The RD also noted that 'supervisors decide whether [to] suspend or terminate an entity from the program.'").</p>
<p class="noindent">Unit exclusion was not appropriate for criminal investigations who participated in investigations and evaluation of investigative results related to personnel seeking access to nuclear power plants and alleged failures of licensees and others to abide by agency regulations and security procedures. With the exception of four investigators who had regular access to or use of classified information, the work of the investigators was not directly related to national security and did not warrant their unit exclusion under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6), <span class="Italic">NRC and NTEU</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v66/66-56.html">66 FLRA 311</a>, 315-22 (2011) (Member Beck dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the RD stated, under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6), a bargaining unit is not appropriate if it includes "any employee engaged in intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or security work which directly affects national security[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6). Consistent with this statutory wording, to determine whether an employee is excluded from a bargaining unit based on &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6), the Authority must consider whether the employee is: (1) engaged in intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or security work that (2) directly affects (3) national security. <span class="Italic">Cf. U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz.</span>, 62 FLRA 332, 334 (2008) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring) (<span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan</span>) (discussing security work).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the RD failed to apply established law, and made clear and prejudicial errors regarding substantial factual matters, in connection with his findings that: (1) the CIs' investigative work does not directly affect national security; and (2) the CIs do not perform security work because they do not have regular use of, or access to, classified or safeguards information. In addition, the Agency argues that there is an absence of precedent with respect to the definitions of "intelligence" and "counterintelligence" within the meaning of--and the appropriate treatment of safeguards information in the context of--&#x00A7; 7112(b)(6). We address these arguments separately below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The RD did not fail to apply established law, or make clear and prejudicial errors regarding substantial factual matters, in connection with his findings that the CIs' investigative work does not directly affect national security. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found, and there is no dispute, that the CIs perform "investigative" work, and that this work involves "national security[,]" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6). Rather, the Agency challenges only the RD's legal and factual findings regarding whether this investigative work "directly affects" national security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that "directly affects" means "a straight bearing or unbroken connection that produces a material influence or alter[&#8197;]ation." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS</span>, 65 FLRA 687, 690 (2011) (Member Beck dissenting in part) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>). The Authority also has held that the plain terms of this definition--that any bearing on national security must be "straight[,]" any connection must be "unbroken[,]" and any influence or alteration must be "material[&#8197;]"--make it clear that &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) does not permit the exclusion of positions merely because they have <span class="Italic">some </span>relationship to national security--even "important national [security] interests." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Accordingly, applying this definition, the Authority has found that <span id="Page_60"></span>positions directly affect national security "only in limited circumstances." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>For example, when there are "no intervening steps between the employees' failure" to satisfactorily perform their duties "and the potential effect [of that failure] on national security[,]" the Authority has found the requisite direct connection. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>By contrast, where an employee's role in protecting national security is "limited," the Authority has not found the requisite direct connection. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Similarly, where employees must "go through another individual" before their actions may impact national security, the Authority has declined to find a direct effect. <span class="Italic">Id. See also U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Tyndall Air Force Base, Tyndall AFB, Fla</span>., 65 FLRA 610, 613 (2011) (<span class="Italic">Tyndall</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, the RD found, and there is no dispute, that CIs are not personally and directly responsible for the safety and security of Agency-licensed facilities. In addition, there is no dispute that the CIs are not engaged in designing or personally maintaining the security systems for, or security-related computer systems used in, Agency-licensed facilities. Thus, this case is distinguishable from Authority decisions where such employees' duties were found to directly affect national security. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS</span>, 62 FLRA 298, 304 (2007) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring and then-Member Pope concurring) (among other things, employees granted and restricted access to agency facilities through issuance and deactivation of key cards, and determined the type and placement of security systems to be utilized in agency facilities); <span class="Italic">DoJ</span>, 62 FLRA at 295-96 (employee was personally and directly responsible for maintaining the security of database used for many security-related purposes, including protecting the nation from terrorist attacks and storing military detainee information).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that, in finding that the CIs' investigative work does not directly affect national security, the RD improperly "diminishe[d] the independent nature of the CI position," and states that CIs "do not change or modify their conclusions regarding violations" when Agency staff offices are not in agreement. In this connection, a relevant factor in assessing the "direct effects" requirement is whether employees' duties are "carried out in accordance with established procedures and provide[d] little opportunity for making choices[.]" <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 65 FLRA at 690. Consistent with this principle, the RD expressly acknowledged that CIs conduct their investigations with significant independence, and the Agency's assertion that CIs do not modify their conclusions merely because other staff offices disagree is a relevant consideration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, the RD also found that the CIs do not have unfettered authority in conducting their investigations. In this regard, the RD found that <span class="Italic">the ARB</span>--not the CI--"determines the scope of the investigation by issuance of the draft notice of violation." In addition, the RD determined that if a CI uncovers additional, potential violations during the scope of the investigation, then the CI notifies the ARB, and <span class="Italic">the ARB</span>--not the CI--"determines whether to expand the scope of the investigation." Thus, although CIs may exercise independence during the course of their investigations, the <span class="Italic">scope </span>of those investigations is not entirely within their control. Put simply, their independence, while significant, is far from unlimited.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the RD found that there are several intervening steps, both before and after a CI's investigation, that limit the effect of the CIs' investigative duties on national security. In this regard, the RD found, and there is no dispute, that CIs' investigative reports are reviewed by their FODs.[6] In addition, even after a CI completes his or her investigation, another entity or individual must actually take a prosecutorial or enforcement action before the CIs' investigative work can have an effect on national security. As for the Agency's assertion that all government offices involve some layers of review, this does not change the facts that: (1) &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) requires a "direct" effect on national security; and (2) the existence of intervening layers of review is a significant consideration in determining whether there is a direct effect. With regard to the Agency's claim that ROIs are not sent to DoJ for prosecutorial consideration--and that only "a separate investigative summary" is sent to DoJ--the Agency does not explain why this demonstrates a direct effect on national security, particularly given that DoJ continues to serve as a separate, intervening layer between the CI's investigative work and any potential effect on national security.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;As such, there is no basis for the dissent's assertion that, if a CI "wrongly conclude[s]" that no improprieties occurred, then no further action would be taken. In particular, the dissent cites no evidence that, upon review of an investigative report, an FOD cannot direct the CI to conduct additional investigative work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, with respect to ARB meetings, the Agency's arguments focus on the duties of a generic "OI representative," rather than the specific CIs at issue here. This focus is misplaced because in assessing bargaining unit status, the Authority focuses on "only...the duties of the position at issue." <span class="Italic">Tyndall</span>, 65 FLRA at 613. In any event, even assuming that the CIs at issue perform the duties described in the application, that does not change the fact that there are several intervening steps before and after the performance of those duties that sever the link between those duties and any potential effect of those duties on national security.[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;As the dissent does not reach the issue of exclusion of CIs on the basis of their access to safeguards information, Dissent at 22 n.*, the dissent's reliance on <span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan</span>, 62 FLRA 332, which involved employees who had regular use of, and/or access to, classified information, is misplaced. Similarly, although it is undoubtedly true that, as the dissent states, CIs' investigative duties are "integral to the enforcement process as a whole," that is not the test for determining whether the CIs' <span class="Italic">duties </span>directly affect national security. <span class="Italic">Cf. IRS</span>, 65 FLRA at 690 ("the mere fact that employees' work may have a relationship to important national interests is not sufficient to find a direct effect on national security.")</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, the Agency has not demonstrated that the CIs' investigative duties directly affect national security, and we do not exclude the CIs from the unit on that basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The RD did not fail to apply established law, or make clear and prejudicial errors regarding substantial factual matters, by focusing on CIs' actual, not potential, use of or access to classified and safeguards information</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, an employee will be found to be engaged in "security work" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) if the employee's duties include "the regular use of, or access to, classified information." <span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan</span>, 62 FLRA 332, 334. In assessing bargaining unit status, with certain exceptions not relevant here, the Authority focuses on the duties actually performed by the employee at the time of the hearing, rather than potential future duties. <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 59 FLRA 137, 142-43.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that CIs, due to their security clearances, could come into contact with safeguards and classified information at any time in the performance of their duties, and that it was "arbitrary" for the RD to include them in the unit while excluding CIs who, "simply by chance," have been assigned investigations that required them to access classified information. However, the Agency's arguments are misplaced because they focus on the CIs' potential duties in the future, rather than their actual duties at the time of the hearing, which is the relevant focus. <span class="Italic">See SSA</span>, 59 FLRA at 142-43. Thus, the arguments do not provide a basis for reversing the RD.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also challenges the RD's statement that OI policy restricts CIs to obtain safeguards information only when they need to do so, because the Agency claims that this principle does not apply only to CIs. There is no basis for finding that the RD relied on any perceived uniqueness of CIs in this connection, and, thus, the Agency's argument does not demonstrate that the RD made a clear and prejudicial error regarding a substantial factual matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Agency's citations to <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 59 FLRA 137, and <span class="Italic">Corps of Eng'rs</span>, 57 FLRA 834, those decisions held, respectively, that: (1) employees "do not lose their national security status simply because they are not engaged in matters related to national security <span class="Italic">all </span>of the time[,]" 59 FLRA at 146; and (2) the Authority does not require "any minimum amount of time" for access to classified material in order to find that an employee performs security work, 57 FLRA at 837. The Agency's reliance on these decisions is misplaced because, here, the RD did not find that the CIs are included in the unit merely because they do not have access to classified information "all of the time[,]" 59 FLRA at 146, or because they did not spend a "minimum amount of time" exposed to it, 57 FLRA at 837. Rather, the RD found that the CIs at issue in the application did not have <span class="Italic">any </span>use of, or access to, classified information, despite the fact that at some point in the future their duties <span class="Italic">could </span>require such use and/or access. Thus, the RD's decision is not contrary to <span class="Italic">SSA </span>or <span class="Italic">Corps of Eng'rs</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, the Agency has not demonstrated that the RD erred in finding that potential, future use of or access to safeguards and classified information is an insufficient basis for excluding the CIs from the unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">There is an absence of precedent regarding the meaning of intelligence and counterintelligence work, but the Agency has not demonstrated that the RD erred in finding that the CIs do not perform such work</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the RD found, no Authority precedent explains the meaning of the terms "intelligence" and "counterintelligence" under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6). Thus, we find that there is an absence of precedent regarding the meaning of those terms.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the Statute does not define a pertinent term, the Authority has found it appropriate to consider dictionary definitions of the term. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1827</span>, 58 FLRA 344, 345-46 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring in part and Member Armendariz dissenting in part). The Statute does not define the terms "intelligence" and "counterintelligence." Accordingly, like the RD, we consider dictionary definitions of those terms.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In context, "intelligence" means "evaluated information concerning an enemy or possible enemy or a possible theater of operations and the conclusions drawn therefrom." <span class="Italic">Webster's 3d New Int'l Dictionary </span>1174 (2002) (<span class="Italic">Webster's</span>). "[C]ounterintelligence" means "organized activity of an <span id="Page_61"></span>intelligence service designed to block an enemy's sources of information by concealment, camouflage, censorship, and other measures, to deceive the enemy by ruses and misinformation, to prevent sabotage, and to gather political and military information." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 519.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that the record does not establish that any CIs are engaged in intelligence or counterintelligence work within these definitions. The Agency does not cite any record evidence indicating that the RD's finding is erroneous. In particular, the Agency does not show that any of the pertinent CIs are engaged in work that involves: (1) "evaluated information concerning an enemy or possible enemy or a possible theater of operations and the conclusions drawn therefrom," <span class="Italic">Webster's </span>at 1174; or (2) "organized activity of an intelligence service designed to block an enemy's sources of information by concealment, camouflage, censorship, and other measures, to deceive the enemy by ruses and misinformation, to prevent sabotage, and to gather political and military information," <span class="Italic">id. </span>at 519.[8] Further, the Agency provides no basis for finding that any intelligence or counterintelligence work that the CIs allegedly perform has a direct effect on national security, as required by &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6). Accordingly, we find no basis for reversing the RD and excluding the CIs from the unit on the ground that they are engaged in intelligence or counterintelligence work that directly affects national security.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;We note that CI Teator testified that he was tasked at a counterintelligence working group with "obtaining information" and providing it to another federal agency for the conduct of their investigation into concerns regarding foreigners having access to special nuclear technology, and CI Gonsoulin testified that he was assigned to JTTF to assist the FBI "in gathering information, intelligence that was coming in at that time[.]" Even assuming that this testimony is sufficiently specific to demonstrate that these two CIs performed intelligence and/or counterintelligence work, CI Teator is not at issue here because the RD excluded him, and, for the reasons discussed further below, we find that CI Gonsoulin must be excluded on another ground. Accordingly, we do not address this testimony further.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">There is an absence of precedent regarding the treatment of safeguards information in the context of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6), and we find that the CIs who regularly use or access the safeguards information at issue here are engaged in security work that directly affects national security. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that there is an absence of precedent regarding the appropriate treatment of safeguards information in the context of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6). The Union disputes this claim, asserting that <span class="Italic">DoJ</span>, 62 FLRA 286, 290, establishes that, for employees who do not access classified information, the Authority assesses whether the employees design, analyze, or monitor security systems and procedures. However, <span class="Italic">DoJ </span>did not establish an "either/or" standard. In addition, while the Authority previously has addressed access to certain types of non-classified information, the Authority previously has not been presented with, and thus has not addressed, access to the type of non-classified information--safeguards information--involved in this case. Accordingly, we conclude that there is an absence of precedent on whether regular access to safeguards information constitutes security work within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6), and we address that issue here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has defined "security work" as "a task, duty, function, or activity related to securing, guarding, shielding, protecting, or preserving something." <span class="Italic">U.S. DoD, Pentagon Force Prot. Agency, Wash., D.C.</span>, 62 FLRA 164, 171 (2007). In addition, as stated previously, the Authority has held that an employee will be found to be engaged in "security work" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) if the employee's duties include "the regular use of, or access to, classified information." <span class="Italic">U.S. DoJ</span>, 52 FLRA 1093, 1103 (1997) (<span class="Italic">Justice</span>). In <span class="Italic">Justice</span>, the Authority rejected its previous holding in <span class="Italic">Department of Energy, Oak Ridge Operations, Oak Ridge, Tennessee</span>, 4 FLRA 644, 655-56 (1980), that security work does "not include work involving mere access to and use of sensitive information and material." 52 FLRA at 1102. Instead, the Authority considered pertinent regulations and Executive Orders concerning classified material and concluded that the regular use of, or access to, such material is security work. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 1102-03.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to whether security work involves "national security," the Authority has held that the term "national security" includes:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">those sensitive activities of the government that are directly related to the protection and preservation of the military, economic, and productive strength of the United States, including the security of the Government in domestic and foreign affairs, against or from espionage, sabotage, subversion, foreign aggression, and any other illegal acts which adversely affect the national defense.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan</span>, 62 FLRA 332, 335. This "entails, among other things, Government activities directly related to the protection of the economic and productive strength of the Nation, including the security of the Government from sabotage." <span class="Italic">DoJ</span>, 62 FLRA 286, 291. The Authority has clarified that "such activities clearly include protecting the Nation's critical infrastructure,...as well as defending the Nation against terrorist activities." <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the foregoing, the RD found, and there is no dispute, that the Agency's work concerns national security within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6). Specifically, the RD found that: (1) the Agency is responsible for the regulation of the United States' commercial nuclear power plants and use of nuclear materials, including the safe transport and disposal of nuclear materials and byproducts; (2) the United States' commercial nuclear power plants and the use of nuclear materials constitute a part of the Nation's critical infrastructure; and (3) any incapacity or destruction of these systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, the economy, public health and safety.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to whether the CIs' <span class="Italic">duties</span>--specifically, the regular use of, or access to, safeguards information--constitute security work that involves national security, we begin by considering the statutory and regulatory provisions pertaining to safeguards information. In this regard, &#x00A7; 2167, entitled "Safeguards information[,]" authorizes the Agency to</p>
<p class="noindent-2">prescribe such regulations, after notice and opportunity for public comment, or issue such orders, as necessary to prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of safeguards information which specifically identifies a licensee's or applicant's detailed--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(1)&#x2003;control and accounting procedures or security measures (including security plans, procedures, and equipment) for the physical protection of special nuclear material...in quantities determined by the [Agency] to be significant to the public health and safety or the common defense and security;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(2)&#x2003;security measures (including security plans, procedures, and equipment) for the physical protection of source material or byproduct material...in quantities determined by the [Agency] to be significant to the public health and safety or the common defense and security; or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(3)&#x2003;security measures (including security plans, procedures, and equipment) for the physical protection of and the location of certain plant equipment vital to the safety or production or utilization facilities involving nuclear materials covered by paragraphs (1) and (2) if the unauthorized disclosure of such information could reasonably be expected to have a significant adverse effect on the health and safety of the public or the common defense and security by significantly increasing the likelihood of theft, diversion, or sabotage of such material or such facility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2167(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the regulatory authority set forth in &#x00A7; 2167(a), the Agency, in 10 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 73.2 (&#x00A7; 73.2), has defined safeguards information, in pertinent part, as</p>
<p class="noindent-2">information not classified as National Security Information or Restricted Data which specifically identifies a licensee's or applicant's detailed control and accounting procedures for the physical protection of special nuclear material in quantities determined by the [Agency] through order or regulation to be significant to the public health and safety or the common defense and security; detailed security measures (including security plans, procedures, and equipment) for the physical protection of source, byproduct, or special nuclear material in quantities determined by the [Agency] through order or regulation to be significant to the public health and safety or the common defense and security; security measures for the physical protection of and location of certain plant equipment vital to the safety of production or utilization facilities; and any other information within the scope of [&#x00A7; 2167], the unauthorized disclosure of which, as determined by the [Agency] through order or regulation, could reasonably be expected to have a significant adverse effect on the health and safety of the public or the common defense and security by significantly increasing the likelihood of sabotage or theft or diversion of source, byproduct, or special nuclear material.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">10 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 73.2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, &#x00A7; 2167(a) provides that the Agency shall exercise its authority to prohibit the disclosure of safeguards information: (1) "so as to apply the minimum restrictions needed to protect the health and safety of the public or the common defense and security[;]" and (2) "upon a determination that the unauthorized disclosure of such information could reasonably be expected to have a significant adverse effect on the health and safety of the public or the common defense and security by significantly increasing the likelihood of theft, diversion, or sabotage of such material or such facility." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2167(a)(A), (B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, &#x00A7; 2167(d) provides, in pertinent part, that, in connection with prohibiting the disclosure of safeguards information, the Agency shall submit a report to Congress that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="Page_62"></span>(1)&#x2003;specifically identifies the type of information the [Agency] intends to protect from disclosure under the regulation or order;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;specifically states the [Agency's] justification for determining that unauthorized disclosure of the information to be protected from disclosure under the regulation or order could reasonably be expected to have a significant adverse effect on the health and safety of the public or the common defense and security by significantly increasing the likelihood of theft, diversion, or sabotage of such material or such facility, as specified under [&#x00A7; 2167(a)]; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;provides justification, including proposed alternative regulations or orders, that the regulation or order applies only the minimum restrictions needed to protect the health and safety of the public or the common defense and security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2167(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, two things are clear. First, safeguards information includes, as relevant here, an Agency licensee's or applicant's security measures with respect to protecting nuclear materials and related equipment. Second, by designating the information at issue here as safeguards information and prohibiting its disclosure, the Agency has determined--and justified its determination to Congress--that the unauthorized disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to have a significant adverse effect on the health and safety of the public or the common defense and security, and that the minimum-restrictions requirement (i.e., the mandate that the Agency apply the minimum restrictions needed to protect public health and safety and the common defense and security) has been met.[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;We note that there is no assertion that the Agency improperly categorized as safeguards information any of the information that CIs allegedly regularly use and/or access.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the RD found, and there is no dispute, that the safeguards information that the CIs allegedly access involves the security plans of nuclear facilities. In addition, given the undisputed serious nature and scope of the potential effects that could result from sabotage of nuclear facilities, we find it reasonable to conclude that the unauthorized disclosure of security plans of nuclear facilities could have an adverse effect on the common defense and security. Although &#x00A7; 2167 uses the terms "common defense and security," rather than "national security," we find that nature of the safeguards information at issue here supports a conclusion that the information pertains to national security, and that the CIs' use of and/or access to it is "security work."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that &#x00A7; 73.2 defines safeguards information, in pertinent part, as "information <span class="Italic">not</span> classified as National Security Information." (Emphasis added.) However, the Agency argues, and there is no dispute, that safeguards information is not classified as national security information because it is not information owned by, produced by or for, or under the control of the United States. <span class="Italic">See also</span> Executive Order (E.O.) 13,526 (stating that information may be classified only if, among other things, "the information is owned by, produced by or for, or is under the control of the United States Government"). The Authority has not previously held that information must be owned by, produced by or for, or under the control of the United States for that information to be related to national security. In this regard, as stated previously, national security work includes "activities...protecting the Nation's critical infrastructure,...as well as defending the Nation against terrorist activities." <span class="Italic">DoJ</span>, 62 FLRA at 291. Further, E.O. 13,010, "Critical Infrastructure Protection," acknowledges that "many...critical infrastructures are owned and operated by the private sector." E.O. 13,010. Accordingly, the fact that the definition of safeguards information excludes "information...classified as National Security Information" merely reflects that safeguards information may not necessarily be owned by, produced by or for, or under the control of the United States and, as a result, cannot constitute classified information. It does not demonstrate that safeguards information does not concern national security, or that employees who regularly use or access safeguards information are not engaged in security work that relates to national security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the plain wording and legislative history of &#x00A7; 2167 indicate that safeguards information was not meant to be the equivalent of, or a substitute for, classified information. However, nothing in the Statute or Authority precedent indicates that information must be the equivalent of, or substitute for, classified information in order to concern national security. Further, with regard to the Union's reliance on the minimum-restrictions requirement, that reliance is misplaced because, once information has been designated as safeguards--as is the case with the information at issue here--the Agency already has determined that the information meets that requirement. Moreover, the Union claims that &#x00A7; 2167 requires a different impact ("significant adverse effect") than the Authority requires--specifically, "incapacity or destruction of systems that have debilitating impact." However, the wording set forth in <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 59 FLRA 137, is from the statute and Executive Order that were at issue in that decision; the Authority did not hold that information must meet that standard in order for the information to concern national security. Even if it did, then it is reasonable to conclude that, should there be an unauthorized disclosure of the security plans of nuclear facilities, this could result in incapacity or destruction of systems that have debilitating impact. Finally, the Union claims that the "reasonably expects" standard that applies to safeguards information (i.e., that unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to have a significant adverse effect) should not be construed as being the equivalent of the "reasonably expects" standard that applies to classified information (i.e., that unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause at least identifiable damage to the national security). However, that claim ignores that, in designating the information at issue in this case as safeguards information, the Agency already has made a determination that the unauthorized disclosure of the information could "reasonably be expected" to adversely affect the common defense and security. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2167(a)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the regular use of and/or access to the safeguards information at issue here is "security work" that involves "national security" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6). Accordingly, consistent with the requirements of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6), we next address whether the regular use of and/or access to this information <span class="Italic">directly </span>affects national security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the context of classified information, the Authority has found a direct effect where, "given the nature of" the information at issue, "it is clear that there are no intervening steps between the employees' failure to prevent unauthorized disclosure of the...information that they use and/or access on a regular basis and the potential effect on national security should they fail to do so." <span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan</span>, 62 FLRA at 335. No basis is argued for applying a different standard to safeguards information. Applying that standard here, given the nature of the safeguards information here--the security plans of nuclear facilities--and the fact that the Agency has determined (under statute and regulations) and justified to Congress that unauthorized disclosure "could reasonably be expected to have a significant adverse effect on...the common defense and security," <span class="Italic">e.g., </span>&#x00A7; 2167(d)(2), we find that there are no intervening steps between a CI's failure to prevent unauthorized disclosure of the information and the potential effect on national security. Accordingly, we find that, for employees who regularly use and/or access the safeguards information at issue here, they are engaged in national security work that directly affects national security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that the following eight CIs have no, or only limited, use of or access to safeguards information: (1) Dvorak ("exposed to safeguards information on one occasion" in seven years; (2) Fahey (access on only "two occasions," <span class="Italic">id.</span>); (3) Ferich (only "limited access" in six years, <span class="Italic">id.</span>); (4) Hayden (only "limited exposure[,]" i.e., "once[,]" in seven years; (5) Janicki ("no access," <span class="Italic">id.</span>); (6) Kryk (only "limited" access in twelve years); (7) Richards ("has not used or had access"); and (8) Young (has not "read or heard safeguards information). The Agency does not dispute these findings or allege that they support a conclusion that these eight CIs' actual use of, or access to, safeguards information is "regular."[10] Accordingly, we find that these eight employees are not excluded from the unit on the basis of security work that directly affects national security.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;As discussed previously, we have rejected the Agency's argument that the CIs should be excluded on the basis that they <span class="Italic">could </span>use or access safeguards information in the course of their duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the RD found that four CIs have access to, and/or use of, safeguards information that is sufficiently frequent to be characterized as "regular." Specifically, the RD found that: (1) Bigoness has had access "on several occasions" and is the custodian of the safe in which safeguards information is kept, <span class="Italic">id. </span>at 7, which supports a conclusion that he has access on a continuous, or regular, basis; (2) Cabrelli has had access "several times," <span class="Italic">id.</span>; (3) Gallagher has had access "several times[,]" <span class="Italic">id.</span>; and (4) Gonsoulin "knows the combination to the safe" in which safeguards information is stored, <span class="Italic">id.</span>, which supports a conclusion that he also has access on a continuous, or regular, basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, consistent with the foregoing, we find that CIs Bigoness, Cabrelli, Gallagher, and Gonsoulin are engaged in security work that directly affects national security. Thus, we reverse the RD's Decision and Order in part on this basis and direct him to clarify the unit to exclude those four employees. We affirm the RD's Decision and Order in all other respects.</p>
<p class="noindent">Unit exclusion was appropriate for several employees of a military establishment who had regular access to information concerning military strength, including troop movements and deployments, mission data, operational and contingency plans, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Davis-Monthan AFB and AFGE Local 2924, </span><a href="http://www.flra.gov/decisions/v62/62-058.html">62 FLRA 332</a>, 332-36 (2008):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As amended at the hearing, the Union filed a petition seeking to clarify the unit status of the following six employees: a GS-0318-07/09 Secretary (Office <span id="Page_63"></span>Automation) ("Secretary 1"), a GS-0318-08 Secretary (Office Automation) ("Secretary 2"), a GS-0301-11 Protocol Officer ("Protocol Officer"), and three GS-0343-12 Program Analysts ("Analyst 1," "Analyst 2," and "Analyst 3"). The Activity asserted that each of the disputed employees is engaged in national security work within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As found by the RD, all of the disputed employees are employed by the Activity's 12th Air Force (AFSOUTH), which is the air component of the United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM). USSOUTHCOM's area of responsibility (AOR) includes 32 countries in Central and South America. AFSOUTH conducts air, space, and information operations "in support of USSOUTHCOM and other agencies conducting a global war on terrorism, counternarco-terrorism, force protection, humanitarian assistance, and theater security cooperation operations. AFSOUTH is divided into the Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC) and the Air Force Forces (AFFOR).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">All of the disputed employees possess at least a secret security clearance. As described below, several of the employees have access to a classified computer network, called SIPRNET, which contains unclassified data and data classified up to the secret level.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Secretary 1 is the secretary for the Vice Commander (VC) and the Chief of Staff (COS) of AFSOUTH; she is primarily responsible for scheduling and maintaining the calendars of the VC and COS. Secretary 1 views classified documents several times per week. In this regard, Secretary 1 reads everything that the VC and COS sign, including classified materials, checking for typographical and formatting errors. In addition, Secretary 1 secures classified documents in a safe and is responsible for shredding classified documents that are ready to be destroyed. Further, Secretary 1 distributes incoming classified materials to the VC and COS, "which may include information on troop movements and monthly reports on the status of personnel, training, and equipment resources. Each morning, either Secretary 1 or Secretary 2 accesses the office safe containing the SIPRNET laptops and is responsible for setting the laptops up and/or securing them at the end of the day. In the absence of the VC or COS, Secretary 1 answers classified phones approximately once per month. In Secretary 2's absence, Secretary 1 also performs secretarial duties for the Commander of AFSOUTH.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Secretary 2 serves as the secretary to the Commander of AFSOUTH; she is primarily responsible for reviewing unclassified correspondence requiring the Commander's signature, scheduling and maintaining the Commander's calendar, answering phones, and screening visitors. Secretary 2 views classified information on a weekly basis, "which may include information on troop deployments." In reviewing classified documents, Secretary 2 checks for typographical and formatting errors. Like Secretary 1, Secretary 2 answers classified phones in the Commander or VC's absence. In addition, Secretary 2 accesses her own SIPRNET account approximately six to seven times per year with regard to travel itineraries.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Protocol Officer is responsible for preparing for, and hosting, all visitors to AFSOUTH. The visits of individuals such as the President of the United States, four-star generals, and the Commander of USSOUTHCOM are classified. The Protocol Officer's duties entail planning itineraries; arranging for meals, lodging, and transportation; coordinating with escorts and briefers; and answering questions that invitees have about how to address a dignitary or how to line up when the dignitary's plane lands. The Protocol Officer also prepares "visit books" for visitors that may contain classified information. Sometimes the Protocol Officer's duties require her to travel to the AOR; she receives classified intelligence briefings prior to doing so. In addition, the Protocol Officer attends classified security briefings on at least a weekly basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Analyst 1 primarily performs personnel-related duties for civilian and military employees of the CAOC. Analyst 1 uses his SIPRNET account weekly to obtain classified information "such as mission data relevant to incoming personnel and facts needed to develop position papers, decision papers, or briefings on manpower, organizational, and other issues."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Analyst 2 serves as a Foreign Disclosure Officer; his primary duties involve reviewing publications and developing "concepts for team cooperation with partner nations in South America consistent with combatant commanders' theater strategies." In this connection, Analyst 2 "reviews Air Force, joint, and multi-service publications dealing with aerospace doctrine in order to update the publications with respect to current military tactics, techniques, and procedures, and to correct for grammar and punctuation."<span class="Italic"> </span>Analyst 2 also helps compose orders for the Commander, as directed by his supervisor. In addition, Analyst 2 reviews classified operational plans every two to three years. Further, Analyst 2 accesses his own SIPRNET account on a daily basis to perform research and to maintain situational awareness on the USSOUTHCOM's AOR. Analyst 2 sees classified information daily.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;RD's Decision</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that each of the six employees holds a position that requires the regular use of, or access to, classified information. Based on this finding, the RD concluded, citing <span class="Italic">United States Department of Justice</span>, 52 FLRA 1093 (1997) (<span class="Italic">DOJ</span>), that each of the employees is engaged in "security work" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD rejected the Union's assertion that the employees' work does not directly affect national security. According to the RD, in <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> the Authority held that positions requiring the regular use of, or access to, classified information "by their nature are necessary to protect the national security." Relying on this interpretation, the RD concluded that "the positions at issue in th[e] petition directly affect national security and, consistent with <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, are clarified as excluded from the bargaining unit."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;Discussion</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Legal Standard</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to determine whether an employee is excluded under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6), the analysis must consider whether employees are: "(1) engaged in security work that (2) directly affects (3) national security." <span class="Italic">Pentagon</span>, 62 FLRA at 171 (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, an employee will be found to be "engaged in security work" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) if the employee's duties include "the regular use of, or access to, classified information." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Md.</span>, 59 FLRA 137, 143 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring and Member Pope dissenting, in part) (<span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore</span>); <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, 52 FLRA at 1103.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has defined the term "directly affects" to mean that the security work engaged in has a "straight bearing or unbroken connection that produces a material influence or [alteration]" on national security. <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore</span>, 59 FLRA at 144; <span class="Italic">Dep't of Energy, Oak Ridge Operations, Oak Ridge, Tenn.</span>, 4 FLRA 644, 655 (1980) (<span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Authority has held that the term "national security" includes:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">those sensitive activities of the government that are directly related to the protection and preservation of the military, economic, and productive strength of the United States, including the security of the Government in domestic and foreign affairs, against or from espionage, sabotage, subversion, foreign aggression, and any other illegal acts which adversely affect the national defense.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore</span>, 59 FLRA 143 (quoting <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>, 4 FLRA at 655-56).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The RD's Decision is consistent with established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth previously, the Union does not dispute the RD's finding that the employees are engaged in "security work." Application for Review at 3. Thus, in the present case, we need only consider whether the RD failed to apply established law with respect to the second and third prongs of the test set forth above--whether the employees' security work (2) directly affects (3) national security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the RD's decision is consistent with established law. In <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, the Authority held that "a position that requires the regular use of, or access to, classified information is one that is necessary to protect the national security." <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, 52 FLRA at 1103 (citation omitted). Applying that principle, the Authority ruled that particular employees who occupied such positions were engaged in security work that directly affected national security. In reaching this conclusion, the Authority did not explicitly analyze whether the disputed employees' work "directly affect[ed]" national security within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6). <span class="Italic">See id; see also Army Corps of Eng'rs</span>, 57 FLRA at 836-37.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although <span class="Italic">DOJ </span>and <span class="Italic">Army Corps of Eng'rs </span>did not include explicit findings on the "directly affects" prong of the &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) analysis discussed above, the decisions should not be read as making it unnecessary to find that (1) the employees in question perform security work and that (2) the work directly affects (3) national security. Not only is the Statute plainly worded on this point; the Authority also clearly stated in both cases that the appropriate analysis includes consideration of whether the work of the disputed employees "directly affects" national security. <span class="Italic">See Army Corps of Eng'rs</span>, 57 FLRA at 836 ("If an employee is engaged in security work, as so defined, which directly affects national security, the employee may not be included in a bargaining unit."); <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, 52 FLRA at 1101 ("The employees in this case are involved in security work and this work directly affects national security....").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the RD concluded that the work performed by the employees who occupied the disputed positions directly affects national security within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) based on his finding that the positions <span id="Page_64"></span>require the regular use of, or access to, classified information. The RD did not explicitly analyze whether the disputed employees' work "directly affected" national security. Nevertheless, we find that the RD's conclusion that the disputed positions directly affect national security within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) is supported by the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, it is apparent from the record that the classified information being used or accessed by the employees relates to the nation's military strength. Specifically, the record demonstrates that this information pertains to troop movements, troop deployments, the travel of the President and other high-level military officials, mission data, operational plans, and contingency plans. Thus, the employees' duties affect "national security" insofar as they relate to the "the protection and preservation of the military...strength of the United States[.]" <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore</span>, 59 FLRA at 143.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, it is apparent from the record that the effect of the employees' work on national security is "direct." In this regard, given the nature of the classified information that each of the six employees regularly uses and accesses (i.e., information pertaining to troop movements, troop deployments, the travel of the President and other high-level military officials, mission data, operational plans, and contingency plans), it is clear that there are no intervening steps between the employees' failure to prevent unauthorized disclosure of the classified information that they use and/or access on a regular basis and the potential effect on national security should they fail to do so. Accordingly, there is a direct connection between the employees' duties and national security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The present case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">United States Department of Justice, Wash., D.C.,</span> 62 FLRA No. 52 (2007) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring in part and dissenting in part) (<span class="Italic">Dep't of Justice</span>). In <span class="Italic">Dep't of Justice</span>, the disputed employees held security clearances, but there was no evidence that the employees' duties included the regular--or any--use of, or access to, classified information. Here, not only do the employees hold security clearances, but the record is clear that they also have regular use of, or access to, classified information. Thus, this case contrasts with <span class="Italic">Dep't of Justice</span>, in which the employees held security clearances in the event they would need to use or access classified information at some point in the future, but had never actually used or accessed such information at the time of the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The present case is also distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Pentagon</span>. In <span class="Italic">Pentagon</span>, all of the disputed employees held top secret clearances, but "the evidence [was] limited regarding [the employees'] actual use of classified information in the course of performing their duties[.]" <span class="Italic">Pentagon</span>, 62 FLRA at 165 (citation omitted). In this regard, the record showed that all of the disputed employees received training concerning the handling of classified information: specifically, they learned "how to recognize and safeguard classified information <span class="Italic">to which they would normally not have access</span>, but with which they may come in contact in the course of their duties." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 166 (citation omitted) (emphasis added). However, with the exception of one category of employees (i.e., the Protective Services Unit officers), there was no evidence that the other categories of employees had regular--or any--use of, or access to, classified information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that each of the six employees is engaged in security work that directly affects national security, and that the RD's decision to this effect is consistent with established law.</p>
<p class="noindent">A classified material systems custodian was excluded from a unit. He maintained a classified material system within the Naval Communications Station, reviewed and logged all classified material, and handled highly classified communications directly affecting national security. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, U.S. Naval Station, Panama and AFSCME Local 907</span>, 7 FLRA 489, 495 (1981). An individual was engaged in classified security work and excluded from the unit who, as a GS-5 Security Clerk, handled, controlled access to, destroyed, transported, and protected highly classified information directly affecting national security. <span class="Italic">DMA, Aerospace Ctr. and AFGE Local 2786</span>, 13 FLRA 52, 54 (1983). GS-11 Security Specialists were excluded from a unit because of their involvement in security work. They were responsible for a vault containing top secret material and they were also responsible for unpacking and logging in top secret material, packaging and shipping the materials, destruction of some top secret material, and supplying employees materials from the vault. Another responsibility was operation of communication equipment used to transmit top secret information, including setting, and later destroying, codes for transmission of information. <span class="Italic">DMA, Hydrographic/Topographic Ctr. and AFGE Local 1884</span>, 13 FLRA 128, 129 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">As several decisions earlier noted suggest, the national security exclusion is not limited to personnel within military establishments. It extends to employees of nonmilitary establishments if the required tasks, duties, functions, or activities of an employee's position include: the design, analysis, or monitoring of security systems or procedures; or the regular use of, or access to, classified information, <span class="Italic">DOJ and AFSCME Local 3719</span>, 52 FLRA 1093, 1098-1103 (1997) (<span class="Italic">DOJ</span>):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...For the following reasons, we conclude that work performed by employees in civilian as well as military agencies can constitute "security work which directly affects national security" within the meaning of section 7112(b)(6) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In enacting section 7112(b)(6), Congress is presumed to have been aware of the meaning given to the term "national security" in existing statutes and executive orders<span class="Italic">. Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corp.</span>, 503 U.S. 258, 267-68 (1992) (The Supreme Court held that when Congress enacted a statute that used the same words that were used in previous statutes, "we can only assume it intended them to have the same meaning that courts had already given them."). Congress passed the Act of August 26, 1950 (the Act), the stated purpose of which was "to protect the national security of the United States by permitting the summary suspension of employment of civilian officers and employees of various departments and agencies of the Government." The Act specifically applied not only to military but also to several civilian agencies, including the Department of Justice. Section 3 of the Act stated that "the provisions of this Act shall apply to such other departments and agencies of the Government as the President may, from time to time, deem necessary in the best interest of national security."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, several executive orders dealing with national security were issued. <span class="Italic">See Department of the Navy </span>v. <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 454 U.S. 518, 527-28 (1988); <span class="Italic">Cole v. Young</span>, 351 U.S. at 545-46. As relevant to this case, E.O. 10450 stated that, "[i]n addition to the departments and agencies specified in [the Act]...the provisions of [the Act] shall apply to all other departments and agencies of the Government." E.O. 10450, Section 1. Section 3(b) of the Act delegated to the "head of any department or agency" the authority and obligation to designate as sensitive "any position within his department or agency the occupant of which could bring about, by virtue of the nature of the position, a material adverse effect on the national security." More recently, E.O. 12968 established "a uniform Federal personnel security program for employees who will be considered for...access to classified information[,]" the disclosure of which "can cause irreparable damage to the national security[.]" E.O. 12968, 60 Fed. Reg. 40245. Section 1.1(a) of E.O. 12968 defines "Agency" as "any 'Executive agency,'...and any other entity within the executive branch that comes into the possession of classified information....<span class="Italic">" Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Act and executive orders demonstrate that matters relating to national security can arise in any agency, civilian or military. Accordingly, we conclude that the work of employees of civilian, as well as military, agencies can constitute security work which directly affects national security within the meaning of section 7112(b)(6) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first issue on which the Authority granted the application for review was whether the work performed in the Agency's Criminal Division involves "national security," as that phrase is defined in <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>. For the reasons set forth below...we find that it does.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>, the Authority defined "national security" as</p>
<p class="noindent-2">those sensitive activities of the government that are directly related to the protection and preservation of the military, economic, and productive strength of the United States, including the security of the Government in domestic and foreign affairs, against or from espionage, sabotage, subversion, foreign aggression, and any other illegal acts which adversely affect the national defense.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>, 4 FLRA at 655-56. This definition was derived from, and is consistent with, the use of the same term in relevant authorities. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for</span> <span class="Italic">example</span>, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7531; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.102(a); and <span class="Italic">Cole v. Young</span>, 351 U.S. at 864-67. Accordingly, we will continue to apply this definition in determining whether the work performed in an agency involves "national security."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The functions of the Agency's Criminal Division include the duty to prosecute and assist in the prosecution of criminal investigations specifically designed to protect the national security of the United States. In this regard, the Criminal Division has been delegated responsibility to, among other things,</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[e]nforce[ ] all criminal laws relating to subversive activities and kindred offenses directed against the internal security of the United States, including the laws relating to treason, sabotage, espionage, and sedition; enforcement of...the Trading With the Enemy Act...; criminal prosecutions under the Atomic Energy Act...; and criminal prosecutions...arising out of offenses relating to national security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">28 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 0.61. The functions and responsibilities of the Criminal Division make it clear that the work performed in the Criminal Division involves the security of the Government in domestic and foreign affairs, against and from espionage, sabotage, subversion, and foreign aggression. Accordingly, we find that the work performed in the Agency's Criminal Division involves national security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second issue on which the Authority granted the application for review was whether, based on record evidence, the disputed employees are involved in "security work," as defined in <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>, 4 FLRA at 655, and how this work directly affects national security. For the reasons set forth below, we find that the disputed employees are involved in "security <span id="Page_65"></span>work" and that this work directly affects national security within the meaning of section 7112(b)(6).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, in determining the standard to decide whether an employee is engaged in security work within the meaning of section 7112(b)(6) of the Statute, we reject the Union's argument that Congress did not intend to exclude large groups or entire subdivisions of employees under section 7112(b)(6), but rather delegated that power only to the President under section 7103(b). We agree with the RD who, in rejecting this argument, found that "[u]pon a review of the legislative history of the Statute...there is no prohibition, express or implied, as to the number of employees within a given organization or subdivision of an agency [who] can be excluded under [&#8197;] section 7112(b)(6)."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In considering the meaning of the term "security work" in section 7112(b)(6), the Authority stated in <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span> that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[o]ne ordinary definition of 'security work' would be a task, duty, function, or activity related to securing, guarding, shielding, protecting, or preserving something. As used in context, 'security work' would include the design, analysis, or monitoring of security systems and procedures. It would not include work involving mere access to and use of sensitive information and material.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>, 4 FLRA at 655.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span> reasonably defined "security work" as a task, duty, function, or activity related to securing, guarding, shielding, protecting, or preserving something. We also affirm the holding in <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span> that "security work" <span class="Italic">includes</span> the design, analysis, or monitoring of security systems and procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, for the following reasons, we reject the statement in <span class="Italic">Oak</span> <span class="Italic">Ridge</span> that, in the context of section 7112(b)(6), "security work" would not also include work involving mere access to and use of sensitive information and material. With respect to the relationship between access to information and national security, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.102(a) defines the term "national security position" as a position "that require[s] regular use of, or access to, classified information." Pursuant to E.O. 10450, Section 3(b), agency heads must designate as sensitive any position within the agency or any department, the occupant of which could bring about, by virtue of the nature of the position, a material adverse effect on the national security. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.201(a). E.O. 12968 establishes security policies to protect classified information, the disclosure of which can cause irreparable damage to the national security. 60 Fed. Reg. 40245. An employee's eligibility for access to classified information is dependent upon the results of a favorable background investigation and the employee is certified or cleared to hold such position. <span class="Italic">See</span> E.O. 12968, Section 3.1.(a) and (b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These provisions demonstrate that a position that requires the regular use of, or access to, classified information is one that is necessary to protect the national security. This ensures that an employee occupying a position that requires the regular use of, or access to, classified information is available to the agency when the need for security work arises. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hartness v. Bush</span>, 919 F.2d 170, 173-74 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (random drug testing was permissible for employees with top security clearances "regardless of the fact that some employees may be rarely, if ever, exposed to" classified information; "'[t]he whole point of granting top secret security clearances in advance is to provide flexibility, to ensure that employees can be given access to top secret materials as soon as the need arises'" (citation omitted)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that an employee is engaged in "security work" within the meaning of section 7112(b)(6) if the required tasks, duties, functions, or activities of the employee's position include: (1) the designing, analyzing, or monitoring of security systems or procedures; or (2) the regular use of, or access to, classified information. If an employee is engaged in security work, as so defined, which directly affects national security, as discussed above, the employee may not be included in a bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs and AFGE Local 3310</span>, 57 FLRA 834, 836-37 (2002), confirmed the <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> analysis that a security position can include access to classified information, and that "the Authority did not condition the definition of security work on any minimum amount of time for exposure to or access to classified material."</p>
<p class="noindent">The scope of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) was further defined or clarified in a decision issued after FLRA solicited <span class="Italic">amicus</span> briefs, <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE</span>, 59 FLRA 137, 142-46 (2003), resulting in the determination that 5 USC 7112(b)(6) encompassed positions that would be excluded from units because of their critical relation to maintenance of essential operations of agencies affecting major elements of American infrastructure. A position's requirement for a security clearance for the incumbent employee was not determinative of disqualification from unit membership. SSA employees encumbering the positions of physical security specialist and electronics technician were excluded from the unit:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The Statutory Framework</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7105(a)(2)(A) of the Statute states that the Authority shall determine the appropriateness of units for labor organization representation under &#x00A7; 7112 of the Statute. Section 7112(a) reiterates that the Authority shall determine the appropriateness of any unit, and &#x00A7; 7112(b) excludes from bargaining units certain categories of employees. Specifically, as relevant here, &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) excludes from a bargaining unit "any employee engaged in intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or <span class="Italic">security work which directly affects national security</span>[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In implementing its responsibilities under &#x00A7; 7112(b) of the Statute to determine whether particular employees are excluded from bargaining units, the Authority applies its regulations set forth at 5 C.F.R. Part 2422. Under those regulations, the parties have the opportunity to make factual and legal arguments on the record as to why particular employees should be included in or excluded from a bargaining unit. In resolving applications for review of Regional Director determinations, the Authority makes its determinations by applying Authority precedent to the record evidence and arguments presented. The Authority bases bargaining unit eligibility determinations on testimony as to an employee's actual duties at the time of the hearing rather than on duties that may exist in the future<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of Labor, Office of the Solicitor, Arlington Field Office</span>, 37 FLRA 1371, 1377 (1990). Bargaining unit eligibility determinations are not based on evidence such as written position descriptions or testimony as to what duties had been or would be performed by an employee occupying a certain position, because such evidence might not reflect the employee's actual duties<span class="Italic">. See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed by the parties that the Authority has jurisdiction to resolve the unit status of the employees at issue in this case. In this regard, we note that, in enacting the Statute, Congress also addressed the matter of national security in &#x00A7; 7103(b) of the Statute. There, Congress stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(b)(1)&#x2003;The President may issue an order excluding any agency or subdivision thereof from coverage under this chapter if the President determines that--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(A)&#x2003;the agency or subdivision has as a primary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work, and</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(B)&#x2003;the provisions of this chapter cannot be applied to that agency or subdivision in a manner consistent with national security requirements and considerations.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;The President may issue an order suspending any provision of this chapter with respect to any agency, installation, or activity located outside the 50 States and the District of Columbia, if the President determines that the suspension is necessary in the interest of national security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">No such order applies in the instant case. Unlike &#x00A7; 7103(b) of the Statute, which addresses agencies or other components as a whole, &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) is limited to whether particular employees may be included in bargaining units. Congress gave the Authority the responsibility to make determinations under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6). Accordingly, we will first consider the legal standard to apply and then apply that standard to the record in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The Legal Standard</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1980, shortly after the enactment of the Statute, the Authority considered the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) in its decision in <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>. The Authority stated that, in order to exclude an employee from a unit under this section, an agency "must show (1) that the individual employee is engaged in the designated work, and (2) that the work directly affects national security." <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>, 4 FLRA at 655. After stating that the terms "security work," "directly affects," and "national security" are not defined in the Statute, the Authority applied dictionary definitions to the terms "security work" and "directly affects."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority defined "security work" as including "the design, analysis, or monitoring of security systems and procedures[,]" but not including "work involving mere access to and use of sensitive information and material.<span class="Italic">" Id</span>. The Authority defined "directly affects" as "a straight bearing or unbroken connection that produces a material influence or [alteration].<span class="Italic">" Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the term "national security," the Authority noted various statutes, executive orders, regulations, and judicial decisions comprising the "complex legal framework surround[ing] 'national security' in the context of Government employment.<span class="Italic">" Id</span>. Taking into account this framework, the Authority defined the term "national security" in &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) to include only</p>
<p class="noindent-2">those sensitive activities of the government that are directly related to the protection and preservation of the military, economic, and productive strength of the United States, including the security of the Government in domestic and foreign affairs, against or from espionage, sabotage, subversion, foreign aggression, and any other illegal acts which adversely affect the national defense.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 655-56.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_66"></span>In 1997, the Authority revisited the meaning and application of the phrase "security work which directly affects national security" in &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) when it issued its decision in <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>. In <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, the Authority modified <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge </span>in part and determined that an employee is engaged in "security work" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) if the required tasks, duties, functions, or activities of the employee's position include: (1) the designing, analyzing, or monitoring of security systems or procedures; or (2) the regular use of, or access to, classified information<span class="Italic">. See DOJ</span>, 52 FLRA at 1103.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority also examined the scope of the term "national security" and held that the work of employees of civilian, as well as military, agencies may constitute security work which directly affects national security within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6)<span class="Italic">. DOJ</span>, 52 FLRA at 1098-1100. In so doing, the Authority took into account several executive orders dealing with national security that were promulgated after the enactment of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6)<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. The Authority also reviewed the definition of "national security" that had been used in <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge </span>and found that this definition "was derived from, and is consistent with, the use of the same term in relevant authorities[,]" and that it would "continue to apply this definition in determining whether the work performed in an agency involves 'national security.'<span class="Italic">" Id</span>. at 1100-01 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case before us, the Authority granted review to determine whether, and how, the security work performed by the incumbents directly affects national security. In granting review, the Authority noted that no case had been cited in which there was an assertion, such as here, that the disputed incumbents perform security work that is directly related to the protection and preservation of the economic and productive strength of the United States<span class="Italic">. SSA</span>, 58 FLRA at 174.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Just as the Authority did in <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, we believe it is appropriate here to take into account executive orders and statutes that have been promulgated or enacted since the enactment of the Statute. These executive orders and statutes, referenced below, are relevant in examining the scope of the term "national security" in &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6), particularly as they apply to the protection and preservation of the economic and productive strength of the United States.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Executive Order 13138, 64 Fed. Reg. 53879 (Sept. 30, 1999) provides, in relevant part: "Certain national infrastructures are so vital that their incapacity or destruction would have a debilitating impact on the defense or economic security of the United States. These critical infrastructures include...continuity of government." The Critical Infrastructure Protection Act, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5195c(b), sets forth the finding of Congress that "[t]he information revolution has transformed the conduct of business and the operations of government as well as the infrastructure relied upon for the defense and national security of the United States." In &#x00A7; 5195c(e), Congress defined "critical infrastructure" as the "systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, &#x00A7; 5195c(c) provides that it is the policy of the United States government "that any physical or virtual disruption of the operation of the critical infrastructures of the United States be rare, brief, geographically limited in effect, manageable, and minimally detrimental to the economy, human and government services, and the national security of the United States." Further, in &#x00A7; 891 of the Homeland Security Act, Congress found that: "The Federal Government collects, creates, manages, and protects classified and sensitive but unclassified information to enhance homeland security."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, these provisions are properly taken into account as part of the complex legal framework surrounding the meaning of the term "national security" in &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6). As set forth in <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge </span>and <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, "national security" entails, among other things, Government activities directly related to the protection of the economic and productive strength of the Nation, including the security of the Government from sabotage. There can be no doubt that such activities clearly include protecting the Nation's critical infrastructure, as defined in the authorities discussed above, as well as defending the Nation against terrorist activities. As so clarified, we reaffirm the definition of "national security" set forth in <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we note that with respect to the meaning of the term "directly affects" in &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6), the Authority stated in <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge </span>that "[a]n ordinary meaning of 'directly affects' would be a straight bearing or unbroken connection that produces a material influence or [alteration]." <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>, 4 FLRA at 655 (citation omitted). DoD asserts that the term "directly affects" should be construed, as it was by "inference" in <span class="Italic">Redstone Arsenal</span>, to include "those situations whereby the adverse effect to national security is foreseeable and a natural consequence even though some matters are yet to occur to further those adverse affects." In our view, the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Redstone Arsenal </span>is consistent both with &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) and with the definition of the term "directly affects" set forth in <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>. Accordingly, we will continue to apply the <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge </span>definition in determining whether security work "directly affects" national security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">DoD argues that <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge </span>is in error to the extent that it implies that only those employees who have security clearances perform work that affects national security. According to DoD, employees "may still do security work that directly affects national security, whether they have a security clearance or not." DoD argues that the focus should be on the type and nature of the work performed, not on whether the employee has a security clearance or whether the position has been designated as sensitive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with DoD that in determining whether &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) applies to any particular employee, the focus must be on the type and nature of the work performed. We also agree that employees may perform security work that directly affects national security, irrespective of whether they have a security clearance. However, whether an employee has a security clearance and/or occupies a position designated as sensitive are significant factors in making a determination under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6)<span class="Italic">. E.g., United States Dep't of the Army, Corps of Engineers, United States Army Engineers Research Development Center, Vicksburg, Miss.</span>, 57 FLRA 834 (2002) (employees with highest security classification in DoD and who have access to classified information concerning matters of national security were excluded from unit).[4] Nevertheless, the absence of such factors does not automatically compel a conclusion that &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) is inapplicable in a particular situation. Rather, just as with other bargaining unit eligibility determinations, determinations under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) are to be based on the entire record as presented by the parties and developed during the representation proceeding.[6] In sum, consistent with the Authority's exclusive jurisdiction to make appropriate unit determinations, including the resolution of questions concerning the bargaining unit status of employees, given to it by Congress, the Authority resolves these matters on a case-by-case basis by applying the statutory criteria to the record developed in each case<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., United States Dep't of HUD, Headquarters</span>, 41 FLRA 1226, 1237 (1991). Accordingly, we next apply &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) to the record in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;We note that in 5 C.F.R. Part 732, "National Security Positions," OPM has set forth certain requirements and procedures which each agency shall observe for determining national security positions pursuant to Executive Order 10450. For purposes of Part 732, OPM has defined the term "national security position" to include:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(1)&#x2003;Those positions that involve activities of the Government that are concerned with the protection of the nation from foreign aggression or espionage, including development of defense plans or policies, intelligence or counterintelligence activities, and related activities concerned with the preservation of the military strength of the United States; and</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(2)&#x2003;Positions that require regular use of, or access to, classified information. Procedures and guidance provided in OPM issuances apply.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.102(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>, the Authority stated that "it is expected that...all positions sought to be excluded under section 7112(b)(6) will, at a minimum, have been designated as sensitive pursuant to" Executive Order 10450 and then-existing Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Chapter 732-3, subchapter 1, paragraph 1.3a<span class="Italic">. Oak Ridge</span>, 4 FLRA at 656. To the extent that this statement could be construed as requiring a position to be designated as "sensitive" in order for it to be excluded under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6), the Authority has never so held and we reject such a construction for the reasons stated above. Rather, we will consider the record as a whole in making determinations under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;Application of the standard in this case</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The disputed positions are located in the Office of Protective Security Services, Division of Security Program Services. This office provides security oversight, including 24-hour security, for all SSA facilities. The RD found that the incumbents of the positions perform "security work" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6), and no party disputes this finding. The positions do not require a security clearance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, before examining the duties of the incumbents of the specific positions, we address the role of SSA in the Nation's economy and the RD's findings regarding the Agency's claim that there would be consequences to the Nation's economy if information contained in SSA's facilities were lost due to tragedy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the protection of the Agency's facility and computer center involves protection of the economic strength of the Government from sabotage. The social security benefits that SSA provides are of great significance to the Nation's economic strength. As the RD stated, and the record shows, "[o]ne in six Americans receives a [s]ocial [s]ecurity benefit, and about 98 percent of all workers are in jobs covered by [s]ocial <span id="Page_67"></span>[s]ecurity." The RD also stated that social security benefits comprise "5 percent of the [N]ation's total economic output." The RD added that the "programs which form the core of SSA's responsibilities represent critical income support to some 40 million people, and issuance of a correct and timely payment to each person is the [A]gency's paramount responsibility."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD rejected the Agency's claim that there would be consequences to the Nation's economy if information contained in SSA's facilities were lost due to tragedy. The RD reasoned that SSA's back up recovery system would allow claims to be paid, even if many claims had to be processed manually.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, contrary to the RD's determination, that disruption in the SSA's ability to process claims and make social security payments would have a serious adverse effect on the economic strength of the country. The record demonstrates, as argued by the Agency, that the fact that a back up recovery system exists and claims could be paid manually does not change the national security implications of a major disruption in the Agency's ability to process claims and make social security payments. We agree with the Agency that "when 40 million people do not receive their Social Security checks on time or in the right amount, there is a tremendous impact [on] the economy of the United States."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, we note that the RD's findings as to the duties of the incumbents of the specific positions are not in dispute. The RD found that the duties of the incumbents of the two PSS positions include conducting site surveys of SSA offices nationwide to develop knowledge of the facility security systems and make recommendations for improvements in the design of such security systems. The RD also found that the incumbents are responsible for writing and implementing security action plans, emergency plans and AIMS guides (SSA administrative manuals) as they relate to security matters, as well as ensuring that these security measures are properly implemented and used. The RD noted that the two PSS positions do not have security clearances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that the incumbents are all, to some extent, involved with the granting of access to SSA facilities, to both employees and non-employees. In most cases when an outsider requests access, an additional entity, such as a supervisor or the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is involved in the decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD further found that these incumbents have access to the Security Repository, which holds 1500 security reviews for SSA offices nationwide (a database that includes all the site surveys), as well as an additional database that includes incident reports from SSA facilities. The RD found that this information was sensitive, but not classified.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The work of the incumbents of the two PSS positions includes the design, analyzing or monitoring of security systems for the security of, and access to, SSA's databases and physical facilities. These systems are directly related to the protection of the economic and productive strength of the Nation, including the security of the Government from sabotage, particularly its databases and physical facilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the RD found that the duties of the incumbents of the ET position include participating in the design, installation and implementation of comprehensive security measures at SSA's most sensitive facilities, including closed-circuit television monitoring systems of the SSA. The incumbents also have access to, and the ability to adjust, the security systems for the SSA at these and other facilities and work with contractors as well as SSA management in providing guidance concerning technical security requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The work of the incumbents of the ET position includes the design, analyzing or monitoring of security systems for the security of, and access to, SSA's databases and physical facilities. These systems are directly related to the protection of the economic and productive strength of the Nation, including the security of the Government from sabotage, particularly its databases and physical facilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the record shows, and we find, that the incumbents of the two PSS positions and the ET position perform work that involves the design, analyzing or monitoring of security systems for the security of, and access to, SSA's databases and physical facilities, and that these systems are directly related to the protection of the economic and productive strength of the Nation, including the security of the Government from sabotage, particularly its databases and physical facilities. We note in particular that although the incumbents of the PSS positions also sometimes perform other duties that do not affect national security, they do not lose their national security status simply because they are not engaged in matters related to national security <span class="Italic">all</span> of the time<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., DOJ</span>, 52 FLRA at 1102-03 (Authority found that the regular use of, or access to, classified information directly affects national security, even if that involvement with classified information "rarely" takes place). Therefore, consistent with the discussion set forth above, we find that the disputed employees are engaged in security work which "directly affects national security" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we will direct the RD to clarify the bargaining unit to exclude these employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">Also adopting a broad definition of national security, more particularly as it applied to IRS physical security specialists responsible for safeguarding IRS property, assets, and facilities necessary to fund federal operations, FLRA resolved that the regional director properly excluded the specialists from a unit, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, <a href="http://www.flra.gov/decisions/v62/62-053ab.html">62 FLRA 298</a>, 302-05 (2007):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The Authority's framework for evaluating exclusion claims under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In &#x00A7; 7105(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, Congress delegated to the Authority the exclusive jurisdiction to determine the appropriateness of units for labor organization representation under &#x00A7; 7112 of the Statute.<span class="Italic"> AFGE, Local 3723,</span> 49 FLRA 1256, 1258 (1994). As relevant here, &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) provides that a unit will not be considered appropriate if it includes "any employee engaged in intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or security work which directly affects national security[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6)'s three-prong test, the RD must determine whether employees are: (1) engaged in security work that (2) directly affects (3) national security. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6); <span class="Italic">see also United States Dep't of Def., Pentagon Force Prot. Agency, Wash., D.C.</span>, <a href="http://www.flra.gov/decisions/v62/62-042.html">62 FLRA 164</a>, 171 (2007). The Authority has previously defined each of these terms and explained how they are to be applied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the first prong, an employee will be found to be "engaged in security work" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) if the employee's duties include: (1) the designing, analyzing, or monitoring of security systems or procedures; or (2) the regular use of, or access to, classified information.<span class="Italic"> See, e.g., SSA, Baltimore, </span>59 FLRA at 144; <span class="Italic">DOJ,</span> 52 FLRA at 1103. The Authority rejected an argument that the Statute required either that an employee have a security clearance, or that the employee's position be designated as "sensitive," in order for the employee to be excluded under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) of the Statute.<span class="Italic"> SSA, Baltimore, </span>59 FLRA at 144-45, 145 n.6. Accordingly, in determining whether &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) applies to a particular employee, "the focus must be on the type and nature of the work performed."<span class="Italic"> Id. </span>at 145. The mere possession of a security clearance, without more, is not in itself dispositive, but it is a "significant factor[&#8197;]" in making such a determination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, with regard to the term "directly affects," the Authority has defined this term to mean that the security work engaged in has a "straight bearing or unbroken connection that produces a material influence or [alteration]" on national security. <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore, </span>59 FLRA at 144; <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge, </span>4 FLRA at 655.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, with respect to the term "national security," the Authority has held that the term "entails, among other things, Government activities directly related to the protection of the economic and productive strength of the Nation, including the security of the Government from sabotage." <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore, </span>59 FLRA at 144; <span class="Italic">see also Oak Ridge,</span> 4 FLRA at 655-56.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The Specialists' work directly affects national security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here and explained above, the exclusion set out at &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) of the Statute is satisfied where: (1) the tasks and duties of the employee's position include the designing, analyzing, or monitoring of security systems or procedures; (2) the system concerns "national security"; and (3) the work "directly affects" national security as "a straight bearing or unbroken connection that produces a material influence or [alteration]." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6); <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore,</span> 59 FLRA at 143 (quoting <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge, </span>4 FLRA at 655).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the RD found that the Specialists perform "security work" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) because they design, analyze, and monitor security systems, and the Union does not dispute this finding. The Union also does not dispute that the relevant security systems concern national security as that term was applied by the Authority in <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore. </span>Accordingly, the only disputed issue is whether the RD's finding that the Specialists' work "directly affects" national security conflicts with established law, namely <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As explained below, we find that the RD correctly determined that the Specialists' work "directly affects" national security and, thus, that the RD did not fail to apply established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding that the Specialists' work "directly affects" national security, the RD properly considered whether "there is sufficient evidence of a straight bearing or unbroken connection between the security work performed by the Specialists and national security" and concluded that there was such a connection. RD's Decision at 17 (citing <span class="Italic">Oak Ridge, </span>4 FLRA at 655). The RD's determination is consistent with <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore. </span>In this regard, in findings not challenged by the Union, the RD found that the Specialists' security work "is designed to protect [Agency] employees and [Agency] processes, such as computer systems." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>In support, the RD cites the Specialists' responsibility for: granting and restricting access to Agency facilities; participating in the design, installation, and implementation of security measures; adjusting security systems; directing the work of contractors who install, maintain, and repair security systems; regularly <span id="Page_68"></span>conducting risk assessments and compliance reviews in order to detect security vulnerabilities; securing or monitoring the security of facilities affected by natural disasters; and engaging in security-related activities to promote the continuity of Agency operations during natural disasters. The RD concluded on these bases that the Specialists' security work directly affects national security because it "directly relates to the security of [Agency] physical facilities and databases and these systems are directly related to the protection of the economic and productive strength of the United States."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This approach is consistent with <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore.</span> In that case, the Authority held that the disputed employees were engaged in security work that "directly affects" national security where their work included designing, analyzing, or monitoring security systems for the security of, and access to, the agency's databases and physical facilities, and, those security systems were directly related to the protection of the economic and productive strength of the Nation. <span class="Italic">See SSA, Baltimore, </span>59 FLRA at 146.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The effect of the Specialists' work on "national security" is comparable to the effect found by the Authority in <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore. </span>There, the incumbents of the disputed positions were responsible for designing, analyzing, or monitoring "security systems for the security of, and access to, [the Social Security Administration's] databases and physical facilities" and these systems were "directly related to the protection of the economic and productive strength of the Nation, including the security of the Government from sabotage, particularly [of] its databases and physical facilities."<span class="Italic"> SSA, Baltimore, </span>59 FLRA at 146. As found by the RD here, and supported by the record, the Specialists are responsible for designing, analyzing, and monitoring security systems for the security of, and access to, the Agency's (Internal Revenue Service's) databases and physical facilities, and the Union does not dispute that these systems are directly related to the protection of the economic and productive strength of the Nation, including the security of the Government from sabotage, particularly of its databases and physical facilities. Thus, the RD correctly applied <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, contrary to the Union's assertion that the Specialists' duties are related to national security only through a series of "indirect connections[,]" [T]he record evidence supports a conclusion that the chain of causation between the Specialists' work and national security is direct. As found by the RD, any disruption to the Agency's ability to collect taxes, which allows for the funding of governmental operations, would greatly impact the Nation's economic strength, and, thus, the national security. Consequently, protecting Agency facilities where tax returns are processed is essential to ensuring that the Agency can collect revenue to fund the operations of the Federal government, which is a national security concern. In this regard, the record demonstrates that the work the Specialists perform and the security decisions they make are critical to protecting the Agency's databases and physical facilities. The Specialists are personally and directly responsible for designing, analyzing, and monitoring the security of their assigned physical facilities. Specifically, the Specialists: grant and restrict access to Agency facilities through the issuance and deactivation of key cards; determine the type of security systems to be utilized in Agency facilities (i.e. alarms, surveillance cameras, locks), as well as the placement of such systems; have direct responsibilities related to the work of contractors who install, maintain, and repair security systems; periodically test the effectiveness of these security measures (i.e. alarms); detect security vulnerabilities at Agency facilities and make the necessary adjustments; and secure and monitor facilities affected by natural disasters (e.g. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita) in order to promote the continuity of Agency operations. There are, therefore, no intervening steps between the Specialists' duties and the potential effects on national security if the Specialists fail to perform their duties. Thus, there is a direct connection between the Specialists' duties and national security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Specialists are engaged in security work that directly affects national security and we reject the Union's claim that the RD failed to apply established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Authority precedent does not warrant reconsideration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore</span> warrants reconsideration because, as applied here, it sanctions the exclusion from a bargaining unit of employees whose duties have only an indirect connection to national security. In support, the Union cites and essentially relies upon the reasoning set forth in the dissent in <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore. </span>However, the Union does not argue that a standard other than that applied in <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore,</span> and here by the RD, should be used to evaluate whether the "directly affects" test set forth in <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore</span> is satisfied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Union's claim fails to establish that reconsideration of Authority precedent is warranted. The Union's claim that reconsideration is warranted, relying exclusively on the position taken by the dissent in <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore,</span> amounts only to a disagreement with <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore. See, e.g, United States Dep't of Agric., Forest Serv., Los Padres Nat'l Forest, Goleta, Cal., </span>60 FLRA 644, 651 (2005) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting) (no basis for reconsideration of Authority precedent where respondent raised substantively identical arguments to those that had been previously raised and rejected); <span class="Italic">see also United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, VA Conn. Healthcare System, West Haven, Conn., </span>61 FLRA 864, 870 n.4 (2006) (review not warranted where union asserted, without explanation, that Authority precedent warranted reconsideration).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;There is not an absence of precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons set forth below, we find that the Union's claim, that there is an absence of precedent regarding whether employees who do not have access to classified or sensitive information may be excluded under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6), is without merit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, contrary to the Union's claim, Authority precedent specifically addresses whether possession of a security clearance is necessary for an employee to be excluded from a bargaining unit pursuant to &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6). In this connection, in <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore,</span> the Authority explicitly held that employees may perform security work that directly affects national security, "irrespective of whether they have a security clearance." <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore, </span>59 FLRA at 145. The Authority further stated that whether an employee holds a security clearance and/or occupies a position designated as "sensitive" are "significant factors in making a determination under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6)[,]" <span class="Italic">id. </span>(citation omitted). However, the Authority clearly held that "the absence of such factors does not automatically compel a conclusion that &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) is inapplicable in a particular situation." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 145. Thus, under existing precedent, whether or not an employee holds a security clearance, or occupies a position designated as sensitive, is not dispositive of whether that employee should be included or excluded under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, contrary to its claim, the Union acknowledges that under existing precedent, an employee is engaged in "security work" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) if the employee's duties include either. (1) the designing, analyzing, or monitoring of security systems or procedures; or (2) the regular use of, or access to, classified information. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., SSA, Baltimore,</span> 59 FLRA at 143;<span class="Italic"> DOJ,</span> 52 FLRA at 1103. In particular, the Union recognizes that the test for determining whether an employee is engaged in "security work" is applied in the disjunctive. Further, the Union does not challenge the RD's finding that the Specialists are engaged in the designing, analyzing, or monitoring of security systems or procedures. Accordingly, the Union's claim does not demonstrate that review of the RD's decision is warranted. In this regard, even if the Authority were to apply the test urged by the Union under which the lack of a security clearance would be "a powerful presumption" in favor of finding that an employee is not excluded under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6), [A]pplication of such a test would not change the outcome in this case because the RD's undisputed finding that the Specialists design, analyze, or monitor security systems or procedures would remain undisturbed. Thus, for this reason as well, the union's claim lacks merit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we reject the Union's contention that there is an absence of precedent regarding whether employees who do not have access to classified or sensitive information may be excluded under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE</span>, 60 FLRA 57, 58-61 (2004), concluded that it was not necessary to exclude for security reasons information technology specialists and a lead technician controller who, although engaged in computer network operations in regional organizations, did not monitor the network for security issues:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argued that the employees cannot be included in a bargaining unit because they "'oversee and protect systems which if lost due to tragedy, would have serious consequences to the Nation's economy.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing Agency Brief at 8 (citing <span class="Italic">Social Security Admin.</span>, <span class="Italic">Baltimore, Md.</span>, 59 FLRA 137 (2003) (<span class="Italic">SSA Baltimore</span>))). The Agency asserted that the employees play an important role in protecting the Agency's infrastructure. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Regarding the supervisory status of the LTC, the Agency contended that the employee "attends management meetings, gives assignments to employees, and makes recommendations about hiring and awards."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the issue of whether the employees' work directly affects "national security," the RD concluded that the work of the employees in this case is "not directly related to the protection of [the Agency's] facilities" and that a different office is responsible for protecting the physical facilities of the ROCC. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 13, <span class="Italic">contra SSA Baltimore</span>, 59 FLRA at 146. In addition, the RD found that the employees are not acting to prevent the destruction of the ROCC and that the Agency did not demonstrate that the loss of the ROCC (essentially the ability to process claims or use e-mail) would have a "serious adverse effect on the economic strength" of the nation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Finally, the RD determined that the employees could not do serious damage to the Agency because the employees do not have access to the client data as it is transmitted, the stored client data, or the security repository. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">More specifically, the Agency has not shown how the employees at issue <span id="Page_69"></span>here are engaged in any activity that would or should be considered as "security work." The record illustrates that the ROCC employees do not analyze, design or monitor a security system and do not have access to classified information. The ROCC employees are responsible for the maintenance of the telecommunications network, but do not monitor the network for security issues. The ROCC employees do not have access to the mainframe computer or the security repository and therefore do not have access to or regularly use classified information. The ROCC employees do not make determinations about who will have access to the network and what access each person will have. The ROCC employees are not responsible for the physical security of the facility, as they are expected to report any security concerns to the security office. In short, the evidence presented does not support a finding that the ROCC employees are engaged in "security work." <span class="Italic">Contra SSA Baltimore</span>, 59 FLRA at 146 (Authority determined that the employees were engaged in "security work" because they wrote and implemented security plans, were involved in granting access to the facilities, had access to the security repository as well as access to the security systems).</p>
<p class="noindent">Despite a significant role in the protection of the nation's food supply, FSIS Food Inspectors (import) were not excluded from unit membership, <span class="Italic">USDA, FSIS and Nat'l Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals</span>, 61 FLRA 397, 401-03 (2005):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the inspectors' current duties warrant exclusion from a bargaining unit under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) of the Statute. As noted previously, under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) of the Statute, a bargaining unit is not appropriate if it includes any employee engaged in "security work which directly affects national security." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6). The Authority has determined that an employee is engaged in "security work" if the task and duties of the employee's position include: (1) the designing, analyzing, or monitoring of security systems or procedures; or (2) the regular use of, or access to, classified information. <span class="Italic">United States DOJ</span>, 52 FLRA 1093, 1103 (1997). The Authority has determined that "national security" includes "sensitive activities of the government that are directly related to the protection and preservation of the...economic...strength of the United States[.]" <span class="Italic">Dep't of Energy, Oak Ridge Operations, Oak Ridge, Tenn.</span>, 4 FLRA 644, 655-56 (1980).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that the inspectors "may reasonably be found to be involved in 'security work'" because the re-inspection procedures that they follow are "designed to guard, shield, and protect the food supply from the importation of unsafe, adulterated, damaged or ineligible food products." The RD also found that "national security" includes the protection and preservation of the United States' food supply from sabotage and terrorist attack. Neither party excepts to these findings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency disputes the RD's finding that the work performed by the inspectors does not directly affect national security. In this regard, the Authority defines "direct effect" as "a straight bearing or unbroken connection that produces a material influence or [alteration]." <span class="Italic">SSA, Balt., Md.</span>, 59 FLRA 137, 143 (2003) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring and Member Pope concurring in part and dissenting in part on other grounds).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether the inspectors' work has a straight bearing or unbroken connection that produces a material influence on, or alteration to, national security, we reject the Agency's claim that the RD found that inspectors' security responsibilities are the same as those of the general public. Contrary to the Agency's claim, the RD thoroughly assessed the duties performed by the inspectors and assessed whether those duties directly affect national security. Further, we note that the record supports the RD's finding that, after September 11, the inspectors' duties changed only insofar as they are required to be more vigilant. RD Decision at 9 n.6; <span class="Italic">see, e.g., </span>Tr. at 226-27 (most significant post-September 11 change has been heightened awareness, enhanced observation skills); <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 565-67 (bioterrorism training received post-September 11 trained inspectors to be more aware and more suspicious, but didn't train them how "to identify abnormalities in shipments coming in").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the RD's assessment of the inspectors' duties, the record supports the RD's findings that the inspectors' role in protecting the United States' food supply from sabotage or terrorist attack is limited. In this regard, the RD found, and it is undisputed, that the inspectors are not responsible for the detection and interception of bioterrorism agents or weapons of mass destruction, have not been trained in those duties, and do not inspect for diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease and "mad cow" disease. The RD also found, and it is also undisputed, that by the time products arrive at the import houses they already have been inspected by CBP and APHIS for, respectively, weapons of mass destruction and potential carriers of animal and plant pests and diseases. As for the Agency's assertions that inspectors play a significant role in securing the food supply against intentional infection with bacteria and pathogens, record evidence supports the RD's findings that inspectors do not inspect for diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease and "mad cow" disease.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the RD found that inspectors generally inspect products that have passed inspection in its country of origin, and that countries that are allowed to export such products to the United States must have passed a three- to five-year extensive review process, including one or more on-site audits, to determine that their food inspection systems are "equivalent" to the United States' food inspection system. That is, generally, inspectors deal with products that have been approved by facilities that meet the Agency's requirements for inspection. Although products may arrive at the import house from a non-approved country or establishment, record evidence indicates that the Agency's computer database does not permit the inspector to enter that information into the computer, thereby alerting inspectors to the fact that such product is not permitted in circumstances where inspectors otherwise may not be aware of that fact. As discussed previously, inspectors do not have the authority to override instructions from the computer database without the assistance of an ISLI or a supervisor. Thus, the inspector's ability to influence whether food from an uncertified country is permitted into domestic commerce is limited in this respect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The inspectors' discretion is limited in other respects as well. In this regard, the RD found that the computer database generates the inspectors' daily assignments, specifying what type of inspection to conduct and which samples require laboratory analysis. Additionally, the RD found that the inspection process is defined, step-by-step, in the Agency's manual and directives. Further, in the instances where the inspectors exercise discretion, their impact on the process is indirect. In this regard, when the inspectors determine that circumstances warrant a heightened inspection or laboratory analysis, the inspector must request that his or her supervisor or an ISLI override the computer database's instruction to the contrary. Thus, although the inspectors may determine that a more detailed inspection and/or a laboratory analysis is warranted, they must go through another individual--the ISLI or the supervisor--before they can actually conduct a more extensive review. This indicates that, although their ability to exercise discretion may have some impact on what product gets refused, this ability is less than direct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the RD found that the import houses are owned and operated by private industry. Although the Agency asserts that the immediate area around an import house is not secure, the RD found, and it is undisputed, that the inspectors are not responsible for the physical security of their work areas, do not determine who has access to the facilities, and do not design or analyze security systems for the facilities. These factors indicate that the inspectors' ability to "influence or alter[&#8197;]" what food leaves the premises and enters commerce is not "material[.]" <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 59 FLRA at 143. They also support a conclusion that the inspectors do not perform work that has been held to directly affect national security because it involved, for example: writing and implementing security action plans, emergency plans, and agency administrative manuals relating to security matters; participating in the design, installation and implementation of comprehensive security measures at an agency's most sensitive facilities; having access to and ability to adjust the security systems; and/or providing guidance regarding technical security requirements. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 146. In this connection, the inspectors do not write and implement security action plans or participate in the design or installation of comprehensive security measures at the Agency's facilities, do not have access to and ability to adjust security systems, and do not provide guidance on security requirements.</p>
