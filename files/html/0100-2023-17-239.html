<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-237"><span class="space">g.</span> Causation; Contract Violation</h5>
<p class="noindent">To be sustained under the Back Pay Act, an award of overtime must be connected to specific management actions affecting the employee, not general contract violations. <span class="Italic">INS and AFGE Local 40</span>, 18 FLRA 412, 414-15 (1985). For an award to grant overtime pay under the Back Pay Act, it is not sufficient for the agency to violate its agreement; there must be a finding that the unwarranted action of the agency directly resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of overtime pay the employee would otherwise have received by performing overtime work. <span class="Italic">Jefferson Barracks Nat'l Cemetery and NAGE Local R14-116</span>, 13 FLRA 703, 704 (1984) (claim based on contract violation); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Carson and AFGE Local 1345</span>, 65 FLRA 565, 566-67 (2011) (contract violation: arbitrator properly directed overtime payment when overtime opportunities were lost in consequence of unwarranted disciplinary action, reprimand, in violation of contract; violation and finding that employee would otherwise ordinarily have worked overtime satisfied causation requirements of Back Pay Act); <span class="Italic">VAMC Cincinnati and AFGE Local 2031</span>, 57 FLRA 782, 783 (2002) ("Under &#x00A7; 5542, overtime may not be paid unless an employee works more than forty hours in an administrative workweek or more than eight hours in a day. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Def., Def. Commissary Agency, Fort Lee, Va</span>., 54 FLRA 83, 87 (1998). However, overtime pay may be provided for work that was not performed on an overtime basis but would have been but for an agency's breach of a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Sheridan, Or</span>., 55 FLRA 28, 29 (1998)."; <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. and NTEU Chap. 143</span>, 52 FLRA 622, 626-28 (1996) (award sustained granting overtime compensation to individual who would have earned overtime had agency not discriminated against him for four months in violation of Rehabilitation Act). Back Pay Act awards for overtime would seem to be appropriate for FEPA entitlements or overtime under other statutes. As to FLSA, however, it appears that time paid must be time worked, not time that would have been worked had management followed its contract. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA, OHA and AFGE Local 3615</span>, 55 FLRA 349, 354 (1999), <span class="Italic">post</span> (overtime allowable under Back Pay Act for contract violation, but "[u]nder the FLSA, employees are entitled to be paid at the statutory overtime rate <span class="Italic">when they "work"</span> in excess <span id="page_2123"></span>of 40 hours in a given week. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Reich v. New York City Transit Authority</span>, 45 F.3d 646, 651 (2d Cir. 1995) (emphasis supplied). In this case, the Arbitrator found that, if the Agency had not denied the grievant's request to work at home she <span class="Italic">would have worked</span> in excess of 40 hours a week. The fact that an employee has been denied an opportunity to work overtime does not constitute a violation of the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Riley v. Dow Corning Corp</span>., 767 F. Supp. 735, 743 (M.D.N.C. 1991). Therefore, the award does not support any damages under the FLSA, and must be modified to vacate the award of compensatory and liquidated damages under the FLSA.").</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Beaumont and AFGE Council of Prisons Locals C-33</span>, 59 FLRA 466, 467-68 (2003), overturned an award of back pay for overtime that was claimed by an employee who was placed on home duty; the back pay was insufficiently justified by a "but for" connection between the contract violation and the remedy:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the portion of the award granting backpay for overtime, shift differential, and Sunday work, the Arbitrator determined that the grievant was "interested" in these benefits and awarded the grievant the "average" amount of these benefits paid to correctional officers during the relevant time period. However, the Arbitrator did not find that but for the Agency's violation of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, the grievant, even if interested, would have been offered specific overtime assignments, shift differentials, and Sunday work. There is also no finding by the Arbitrator that the grievant, if offered this work, would have been available to perform it or would have worked the amount of time necessary to receive the average amount paid to correctional officers during the relevant time period. In this regard, the Agency asserts, and the Union does not dispute, that employees are not guaranteed a certain amount of overtime, shift differentials, or Sunday work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nothing in the Arbitrator's award or the record supports a determination that, but for the Agency's violation of Article 6, Section b-2 of the parties' agreement, the grievant would have worked a specific amount of overtime on specific days, different shifts, or on Sundays. As such, we find that the award of backpay for overtime, shift differentials and Sunday work is deficient as contrary to the Back Pay Act<span class="Italic">. See Navy Public Works Ctr., Norfolk, Va.</span>, 33 FLRA 592, 599 (1988) (award of retroactive overtime pay calculated to bring the grievant's yearly total into balance with two other employees violated Back Pay Act where arbitrator did not find that, but for the agency's violation of the parties' agreement, the grievant would have performed specific overtime assignments and received overtime pay); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, Warner Robins Air Force Base, Ga.</span>, 56 FLRA 541, 543 (2000) (award violated Back Pay Act where the arbitrator did not find that the grievant suffered an actual, as opposed to potential, loss of a monetary award);<span class="Italic"> AFGE, Local 1857</span>, 35 FLRA 325, 328 (1990) (award of retroactive overtime pay violated the Back Pay Act where the arbitrator did not find that, but for the agency's violation of the parties' agreement, the grievant would have worked a specific amount of overtime on specific days).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the portions of the award granting a promotion with backpay, and backpay for overtime, shift differential, and Sunday work are deficient as contrary to the Back Pay Act, and we set aside those portions of the award. <span class="Italic">See United States, DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Med. Ctr.

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the Agency's failure to timely respond to the grievance concerning the assignment of overtime violated the time limits for processing grievances under the parties' master collective bargaining agreement. To remedy this violation, the Arbitrator ordered that aggrieved employees be awarded backpay to cover lost overtime as requested by the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Back Pay Act, an award of back pay is authorized if: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; (2) the personnel action directly resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials; and (3) but for such action, the grievant otherwise would not have suffered the withdrawal or reduction. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 31 and U.

Because the second and third requirements of the Back Pay Act require evidence of a causal relationship between the violation and a loss or reduction in pay, allowances, or differentials, backpay is authorized only where the violation found by the arbitrator resulted in such a loss or reduction<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Customs Service, South Central Region, New Orleans, Louisiana and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 168</span>, 43 FLRA 337, 340-41 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found the Agency had violated Article 13, Section 9 of the master agreement, based on its failure to timely respond to the grievance. In this regard, he stated that it was the Agency's failure to timely respond that resulted in "a withdrawal or reduction of the pay of the affected boiler plant operators...." Although the Arbitrator quoted Article XIII, Section 3 of the parties' local agreement as relevant to the grievance concerning overtime distribution, he did so only to assess an appropriate remedy for the Agency's violation of Article 13, Section 9. Consequently, we find that the award enforced Article 13, Section 9 of the parties' master agreement. Therefore, contrary to the Agency's arguments, which are based on the assumption that the Arbitrator enforced Article XIII, Section 3, we must determine whether the award enforcing Article 13, Section 9 is deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming, without deciding, that the violation of Article 13, Section 9 constituted an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action in satisfaction of the first requirement of the Back Pay Act, the record does not support a conclusion that the violation of that provision resulted in a loss of the grievants' pay, allowances or differentials. The Agency's violation of Article 13, Section 9 resulted from its failure to meet its obligations under the procedural requirements of the parties' negotiated grievance procedure. This conduct occurred long after the filing of the grievance and the alleged loss of overtime opportunities that gave rise to the grievance. Thus, the violation found by the Arbitrator could not have resulted in the loss of pay, allowances, or differentials at issue in this case. In these circumstances, there is no causal connection between the violation and any monetary loss. As the requirements of the Back Pay Act have not been met, we find that the award of overtime pay is deficient and must be set aside....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">USDA, Fed. Grain Inspection Serv. and AFGE Local 3157</span>, 58 FLRA 98, 99-100 (2002), involved a procedural violation of a contract overtime provision that was not coupled with a "but for" determination supporting a causal connection between the violation and the claimed failure of the agency to provide overtime work:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the award of backpay is deficient because it is contrary to the Back Pay Act.&#x2003;The Arbitrator did not find and the record does not establish that the Agency's failure to follow the procedures of the parties' collective bargaining agreement resulted in the loss of 5 hours of overtime pay on the disputed weekend. Clearly, the Arbitrator made no finding that but for the Agency's failure to follow the procedures of Article 11, Section 1(L), the grievants would have been assigned to the Bunge elevator location and worked an entire overtime shift. In addition, the required causal connection is not implicit from the findings of the Arbitrator or the record before the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award and record do not reflect that the grievants' failure to have worked at the Bunge elevator location for an entire overtime shift on the disputed Sunday is attributable to the Agency's failure to follow the procedures of the agreement. To the extent that the Arbitrator found that the Agency failed to follow the procedures of the agreement, his opinion only addresses why he concluded that the Agency did not fully meet its obligations under the procedure. The award does not address what would have happened if the Agency had met its obligations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, nothing in the Arbitrator's findings or the record supports a causal connection between any unwarranted action of the Agency and the grievants' failure to work a full overtime shift on the disputed Sunday. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Soc.

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator awarded backpay, applying the principle that "where there in fact was no offense [by an employee], personnel actions that cause loss of pay and benefits are, in my opinion, unjustified and/or unwarranted." However, the Arbitrator did not find that the Agency violated any applicable law, rule, regulation, or provision of the parties' collective-bargaining agreement. In fact, the Arbitrator does not mention or quote any law other than the BPA itself, nor any rule, regulation, or collective-bargaining agreement provision. As such, the award does not include a finding that the Agency committed an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action as required by the BPA.[15] Therefore, the Arbitrator did not have any basis under the BPA to award the grievant backpay.[16] Accordingly, we find the award contrary to law.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The award is not contrary to &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority recently revised the analysis that it will apply when reviewing exceptions alleging that awards are contrary to law because they are inconsistent with management rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See U.S. EPA</span>, 65 FLRA 113, 115 (2010) (Member Beck concurring) (<span class="Italic">EPA</span>); <span class="Italic">FDIC, Div. of Supervision &#x0026; Consumer Prot., S.F. Region</span>, 65 FLRA 102 (2010) (Chairman Pope concurring) (<span class="Italic">FDIC, S.F. Region</span>). Under the revised analysis, the Authority will first assess whether the award affects the exercise of the asserted management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a). <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, 65 FLRA at 115. If so, then, as relevant here, the Authority examines whether the award enforces a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b). <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Also under the revised analysis, in determining whether the award enforces a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), the Authority assesses: (1) whether the contract provision constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right; and (2) if so, then whether the arbitrator's enforcement of the arrangement abrogates the exercise of the management right. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 118. In concluding that the Authority would apply an abrogation standard, the Authority rejected continued application of an excessive-interference standard. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 113. In addition, in setting forth the revised analysis, the Authority rejected the continued application of the "reconstruction" requirement set forth in <span class="Italic">BEP. FDIC, S.F. Region</span>, 65 FLRA at 106-07.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator's award affects management's rights to assign work, assign employees, and determine internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute. Where the Authority has found that an arbitrator was enforcing an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, the Authority has assumed, without deciding, that the award affected the management rights as claimed by the excepting party. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Army Headquarters, I Corps &#x0026; Ft. Lewis, Ft. Lewis, Wash.</span>, 65 FLRA 699, 703 (2011). As discussed below, we find that the Arbitrator was enforcing an appropriate arrangement. Accordingly, we assume without deciding that the award affects the Agency's rights to assign work, assign employees, and determine internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency violated the parties' agreement was based in part on his application of Article 6, which requires the Agency to treat employees "fairly and equitably in all aspects of personnel management[.]" "The Authority has repeatedly found provisions requiring management to exercise its management rights fairly and equitably to constitute arrangements because they are intended to mitigate the adverse effects of the unfair or inequitable exercise of management's rights." <span class="Italic">SSA, Dallas Region</span>, 65 FLRA 405, 409 (2010) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>). <span class="Italic">See also U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Prison Camp, Duluth, Minn.</span>, 65 FLRA 588, 591 (2011) (<span class="Italic">BOP Duluth</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, Dugway Proving Ground, Dugway, Utah</span>, 57 FLRA 224, 226 (2001) (<span class="Italic">Dugway</span>) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting). Further, although the Agency argues that the award is not sufficiently tailored to be an arrangement, "the Authority does not conduct a tailoring analysis in resolving exceptions to arbitration awards." <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, 65 FLRA at 116. Accordingly, we find that Article 6, as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, constitutes an arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In arguing that, as interpreted by the Arbitrator, the agreement is not an <span id="page_2125"></span>"appropriate" arrangement, Exceptions at 15, the Agency cites several decisions in which the Authority determined that arbitrators' enforcement of contracts <span class="Italic">excessively</span> interfered with management rights, <span class="Italic">id. </span>at 17-18 (citing <span class="Italic">BOP Lompoc</span>, 58 FLRA at 302-03; <span class="Italic">BOP Sheridan</span>, 58 FLRA at 284; <span class="Italic">IFPTE</span>, 49 FLRA at 249). However, as stated above, the Authority no longer applies the excessive-interference standard in determining whether an arbitrator has enforced a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3); rather it applies the abrogation standard. <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, 65 FLRA at 116-18. Thus, the Agency's reliance on these decisions is misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to whether the award abrogates management rights, an award abrogates the exercise of a management right if the award precludes the agency from exercising the right. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin.</span>, 65 FLRA 171, 174 (2010). However, the Authority previously has found Article 6, as interpreted by another arbitrator, to be an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) because the provision did not "preclude [an agency] from reassigning employees, but, rather, only preclude[d] the [a]gency from conducting reassignments in an unfair manner." <span class="Italic">BOP Duluth</span>, 65 FLRA at 591. <span class="Italic">Cf. SSA</span>, 65 FLRA at 409 (provision requiring management to exercise its rights fairly and equitably does not abrogate management's rights); <span class="Italic">Dugway</span>, 57 FLRA at 226 (same). Similarly, the award in this case does not, as the Agency alleges, preclude the Agency from temporarily reassigning an employee under investigation, or "completely prevent[ ] the Agency from choosing where to reassign an employee[,]." Instead, the award requires the Agency to manage the reassignment and overtime opportunities of an employee under investigation in a "fair and equitable" manner. Thus, this case is distinguishable from the decisions cited by the Agency because they each involved awards or proposals that effectively precluded an agency's exercise of its management rights. <span class="Italic">See BOP Lompoc</span>, 58 FLRA at 303 (award "effectively remove[d]...[a]gency's authority to determine the staffing necessary to maintain the security of its facility"); <span class="Italic">BOP Sheridan</span>, 58 FLRA at 284 (award "totally over[o]de any [a]gency internal security staffing determinations"); <span class="Italic">IFPTE</span>, 49 FLRA at 249 (award imposed "absolute" restriction on agency's ability to assign work); <span class="Italic">Chapter 26</span>, 22 FLRA at 317 (proposal "could totally preclude [an] [a]gency from exercising its right to assign work").[8] Because the award in this case does not impose similar restrictions on the Agency's exercise of its management rights, the Agency does not establish that the Arbitrator's enforcement of Article 6 abrogates management's rights to assign work, assign employees, or determine internal security practices. Accordingly, we find that Article 6, as interpreted by the Arbitrator, is an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;Further, as noted above, in <span class="Italic">BOP Lompoc</span>, 58 FLRA at 303, <span class="Italic">BOP Sheridan</span>, 58 FLRA at 284, and <span class="Italic">IFPTE</span>, 49 FLRA at 249, the Authority was applying the excessive-interference standard, rather than the abrogation standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that the award is deficient under <span class="Italic">BEP </span>because the remedy does not reconstruct what management would have done if it had not violated the parties' agreement. However, as noted above, the Authority no longer requires that an arbitrator's remedy reconstruct what management would have done if it had not violated the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">FDIC, S.F. Region</span>, 65 FLRA at 106-07. Thus, the Agency's argument does not provide a basis for setting aside the award.[9] <span class="Italic">See id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;For the reasons set forth in her concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">FDIC, S.F. Region</span>, 65 FLRA at 112, Chairman Pope agrees that the Agency provides no basis for finding the Arbitrator's remedy deficient because the remedy is reasonably related to Article 6 and the harm being remedied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the award is not contrary to &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, and deny the Agency's management rights exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The award is not contrary to the BPA. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the BPA, an award of backpay is authorized only when an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.</span>, 54 FLRA 1210, 1218-19 (1998). A violation of a collective bargaining agreement constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action under the BPA. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>Thus, the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency violated the parties' agreement supports a conclusion that the award satisfies the first requirement of the BPA. Although the Agency argues that this requirement is not met, its argument is premised on its essence and management rights exceptions. As we have denied these exceptions, we also reject the Agency's argument in this connection.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the second BPA requirement, the Authority has held that a direct causal connection may be implicit from the record and the award. <span class="Italic">See Customs</span>, 54 FLRA at 770-71; <span class="Italic">Army Depot</span>, 46 FLRA at 976; <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 31</span>, 41 FLRA 514, 518-19 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Local 31</span>). In this regard, the Authority has found that where an agency disputed before an arbitrator a grievant's availability to work overtime, but the arbitrator nevertheless awarded backpay for overtime, the arbitrator "implicitly rejected" the agency's argument and found that, but for the agency's unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, the grievant would have worked overtime and received the backpay awarded. <span class="Italic">Customs</span>, 54 FLRA at 771; <span class="Italic">Army Depot</span>, 46 FLRA at 976.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator found that the Agency's denial of overtime opportunities to the grievant violated the parties' agreement, and determined that an appropriate remedy would be "an award for lost overtime opportunities, calculated by past records of performance and in response to the actual monetary loss of income by [the grievant][,]" Both parties offered evidence concerning the number of overtime opportunities denied the grievant and the grievant's history of working overtime. Based on that evidence, the Arbitrator found that: (1) the grievant was prohibited from working overtime for seventeen weeks; (2) "overtime opportunities were a regular and routine assignment in the institution[,]"; and (3) the grievant "previously worked an extensive amount of regular and voluntary overtime shifts[,]"<span class="Italic"> </span>The Arbitrator concluded that, "based on his prior personnel and pay records, it is not unreasonable to conclude that [the grievant] would have worked forty...hours of overtime each week[.]." In this regard, the Arbitrator noted that "[t]here was no contention that the [g]rievant ever refused overtime[,]" and implicitly rejected the Agency's argument that the Union failed to establish the grievant's availability to work overtime on specific dates. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Customs</span>, 54 FLRA at 771; <span class="Italic">Army Depot</span>, 46 FLRA at 976. Similarly, the Arbitrator acknowledged, but implicitly rejected, the Agency's arguments about the amount of overtime assignments that would have been offered the grievant. Further, the Arbitrator "acknowledge[d] that the [g]rievant would not have worked every available overtime hour...each week[,]" when he determined that the grievant would have worked forty hours of overtime per week, rather than the seventy-two hours per week suggested by the Union. As a result of these findings, the Arbitrator "calculate[d] and determine[d] that [the grievant] lost $964 of overtime opportunity each week...during the seventeen[-]week period of reassignment[.].<span class="Italic">"</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">By arguing that this calculation is too "speculative" to satisfy the BPA, the Agency effectively challenges the Arbitrator's factual findings discussed above. However, where, as here, a party has not demonstrated that an award is based on a nonfact, the Authority defers to an arbitrator's factual findings. <span class="Italic">See Local 1437</span>, 53 FLRA at 1710. Further, the Arbitrator's factual findings distinguish this case from those cited by the Agency in which the Authority found backpay awards deficient because the arbitrators' factual findings did not support a backpay award. <span class="Italic">See BOP Beaumont</span>, 59 FLRA at 467-68 (arbitrator awarded grievant the "average" overtime amount paid to coworkers during the relevant time period without finding the grievant would have been offered, or available to work, overtime); <span class="Italic">Warner Robins</span>, 56 FLRA at 543 (arbitrator expressly found "potential" as opposed to "actual" monetary loss); <span class="Italic">Local 1857</span>, 35 FLRA at 326-27 (arbitrator awarded sixteen hours of overtime pay "[b]ased on what is, admittedly, pure conjecture"); <span class="Italic">Naval Air</span>, 21 FLRA at 412 (arbitrator awarded backpay despite finding that there was "no evidence that any of the [grievants] were actually available and willing to work" during the missed overtime opportunities).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA reexamined the causal relation of an overtime claim coupled with a contract violation involving the administration of discipline. The union argued, and the arbitrator agreed, that when the agency failed to use an expedited process of investigating particular disciplinary charges, placing the employee on administrative leave and eventually restoring him to duty, the employee lost overtime that would have been his had the investigation been more quickly concluded. FLRA disagreed, setting aside the overtime award, ruling it an inappropriate remedy, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 2499</span>, 70 FLRA 572, 572-74 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting):</p>

<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusion: The remedy of backpay for twelve months of lost overtime opportunities is not reasonably and proportionally related to the violation of Article 32G.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator's decision that the Agency could not restrict the grievant to administrative duties for fourteen months violates the Agency's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. The right to assign work includes the right to determine the particular duties to be assigned, when work assignments will occur, and to whom, or what positions, duties will be assigned.[10]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA</span>, 61 FLRA 54, 56 (2005); <span class="Italic">cf.

<p class="noindent-1">Evaluating the Agency's argument using the framework set forth in <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>,[11] the first question is whether the Arbitrator found a violation of a contract provision.[12] The Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Article 32G by not applying SPEAR to expedite the initiation of the grievant's disciplinary action. Thus, the answer to the first question is yes.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;70 FLRA at 405-06.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 405.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second question under <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> is whether the Arbitrator's remedy reasonably and proportionally relates to the violation of Article 32G. The Arbitrator recognized, under the plain wording of SPEAR, that the Agency expressly "reserve[d]" its right <span class="Italic">not to apply</span> SPEAR if the Agency did not find it appropriate. However, the Arbitrator's determination that the Agency violated Article 32G rested almost entirely on his finding that the Agency failed to follow its own policy when it did not make "preliminary findings" as to the appropriateness of using SPEAR for the grievant's case; therefore, the Arbitrator concluded the Agency could have, and should have, applied SPEAR to the grievant. Although the Arbitrator found that the Agency did not provide the grievant with disciplinary notice at the "earliest practicable date" under Article 32G, awarding a remedy of <span class="Italic">twelve months</span> of backpay for lost overtime, spanning a window of time that ran heedless of actual events, is disproportionate to the Agency's violation of Article 32G's notice provision. Because the Arbitrator's remedy does not reasonably and proportionally relate to the Agency's violation of Article 32G, the answer to the second <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> question is no.</p>
<p class="noindent">That a contract violation may result in an overtime award even if work is not performed when the overtime would have been worked were the contract followed, was explained in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Terre Haute and AFGE Local 720</span>, 65 FLRA 460, 463-64 (2011), involving the agency's failure to adhere to a settlement agreement defining the beginning and ending points for a tour of duty:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, even assuming that the Agency eliminated pre-shift and post-shift activities, the Agency does not establish that the award is deficient. In this regard, the Authority has found that, even if employees did not actually work overtime, they may receive overtime pay under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, if a contract violation resulted in their failure to work overtime. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard</span>, 62 FLRA 4, 7-8 (2007) (quoting <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Supervisor of Shipbuilding Conversion &#x0026; Repair, Pascagoula, Miss.</span>, 57 FLRA 744, 746-47 (2002) (it is "well-settled that an employee may be awarded overtime compensation for overtime hours that were not worked because of a violation of a contract")); <span class="Italic">see also Soc.

Gen. 1071 (1975), in which the Comptroller General confirmed that the "no work, no pay" rule no longer applies to preclude an award of backpay to remedy the violation of a collective bargaining agreement that causes an employee to lose pay).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated the portal-to-portal agreement and the settlement agreement--and as the Back Pay Act authorizes backpay to remedy the loss of overtime pay resulting from a violation of a collective bargaining agreement even when employees perform no overtime work--the Agency's claim that the award is deficient because employees performed no overtime work provides no basis for finding the award deficient.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also challenges the Arbitrator's determination concerning the second Back Pay Act requirement. According to the Agency, the grievant did not suffer a withdrawal or reduction in pay, allowances, or differentials because the Union could not show that the grievant would have worked overtime and because the grievant was "not entitled to...overtime." The Authority has found that, even if employees did not actually work overtime, they may receive backpay under the Back Pay Act if a contract violation resulted in the failure to work overtime. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Complex, Terre Haute, Ind.</span>, 65 FLRA 460, 463 (2011) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard &#x0026; Intermediate Maintenance Facility, Bremerton, Wash.</span>, 62 FLRA 4, 7 (2007)). Although the Agency contends that the grievant failed to show he would have worked overtime, the Arbitrator explicitly found that the grievant "would have worked the hours." Because the Authority defers to an Arbitrator's factual findings, and because the Agency does not challenge this finding as being based on a nonfact, the Agency has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator's determination concerning the second Back Pay Act requirement is deficient. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Army, Fort Carson, Colo.</span>, 65 FLRA 565, 567 (2011) (upholding an award of backpay because the arbitrator found that the grievant would have worked overtime but for the agency's actions).</p>
<p class="noindent">If it is established that employees entitled to overtime under a collective bargaining agreement do not receive that overtime because of a violation of the agreement by an agency, an arbitrator can determine that those employees are entitled to compensation for the lost overtime. An arbitrator is not required to make an explicit "but for" finding that there is a direct causal connection between an agency's improper act and the loss of pay by an employee. That connection can be implicit in the award. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Cherry Point and IAM Lodge 2297</span>, 45 FLRA 1324, 1329-30 (1992); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 1613</span>, 68 FLRA 128, 132 (2014) ("The Agency also argues that the remedy of backpay is contrary to law because it awards backpay for overtime not worked. The Authority has rejected this argument previously, explaining that 'the fact that employees did not actually work overtime d[oes] not render a remedy of overtime compensation unlawful. Rather, the employees would have worked overtime had the agency not engaged in improper conduct and, therefore, they suffered the loss of pay because of that conduct.' Here, as discussed above, the Arbitrator found that the Agency failed to equitably distribute overtime as required by the parties' agreement and that, as a result, the grievants lost the opportunities to work overtime at a higher AUO percentage. Therefore, the Agency's argument provides no basis for finding the backpay remedy contrary to law."); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Tinker AFB and AFGE Local 916</span>, 63 FLRA 59 (2008) (award properly granted back pay remedy when agency violated provision of local agreement by denying grievant the opportunity to volunteer for evening shift and earn differential pay); <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 57 FLRA 538, 542 (2001) (arbitrator's award of overtime sustained on basis of finding that agency violated contract by failing to offer overtime to grievant on equitable basis; were it not for contract violation, grievant would have accepted overtime that should have been offered); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. and NTEU Chap. 156</span>, 54 FLRA 764, 770-71 (1998) ("In this regard, the Arbitrator in effect found that, but for the Agency's unjustified and unwarranted personnel action, the grievant, who had listed himself as available for that overtime shift, would have worked and received the overtime pay for that shift."); <span class="Italic">IAM Lodge 2261 and Dept. of Army, Tooele Army Depot</span>, 47 FLRA 427, 434 (1993) ("[T]he 'but for' test does not require a specific recitation of certain words and phrases, such as 'but for,' but rather a finding of a direct connection between an unwarranted or unjustified personnel action and an employee's loss of pay...the finding of a direct causal connection may be 'implicit from the record and the award.'").</p>
<p class="noindent">An example of an implicit determination of a contract violation entitling employees to overtime compensation is <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS, San Diego and AFGE INS Council</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v51/51-089.html">51 FLRA 1094</a>, 1097-98 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has long held that under the Back Pay Act, an award of backpay is authorized only when an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; (2) the personnel action directly resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances or differentials; and (3) but for such action, the grievant otherwise would not have suffered the withdrawal or reduction. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 31 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio</span>, 41 FLRA 514, 517 (1991) (<span class="Italic">VA Cleveland</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unless an arbitrator finds that an aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, any award of backpay is deficient. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Distribution Region West, Stockton, California and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1857</span>, 48 FLRA 221 (1993). In this regard, the Authority has long held that a violation of a collective bargaining agreement constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span> <span class="Italic">International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Lodge 2261 and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2185 and U.S. Dept. of the Army, Tooele Army Depot, Tooele, Utah</span>, 47 FLRA 427, 434 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Tooele Army Depot</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator stated that the Agency violated the parties' agreement when it refused to pay SRIs &#x00A7; 1353a overtime. The Arbitrator did not specify the particular provision of the parties' agreement which was violated or the manner in which it was violated. However, the Arbitrator quoted Article 29 A(2), which established the basic workweek as occurring on 5 days between Monday through Saturday, in the paragraph immediately preceding his conclusion. Moreover, both parties interpret the award as holding that the Agency violated Article 29 A(2). Consequently, there is an undisputed basis for concluding that the award satisfies the first requirement for an award of backpay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the second and third Back Pay Act requirements, the Authority has stated that the "but for" test does not require a "specific recitation of certain words and phrases," such as but for; rather it requires that a direct connection be found between an unwarranted or unjustified personnel action and an employee's loss of pay or differentials. <span class="Italic">VA Cleveland</span>, 41 FLRA at 518. A finding of a direct causal connection may be "implicit from the record and the award<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 519. In this respect, Article 29 A(2) of the parties' agreement does not include Sunday in the basic 40-hour workweek. As such, under Article 29 A(2), work performed on a Sunday is overtime work. However, it is undisputed that the SRIs did not receive overtime compensation under 8 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1353a for the performance of the <span id="page_2127"></span>Sunday duties in this case because the Agency had changed their work schedules to include Sundays within their basic 40-hour workweek. As indicated above, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Article 29 A(2) and, as a remedy, ordered that the Agency make whole any SRI who had not been paid overtime under &#x00A7; 1353a. In these circumstances, it is clear from the record in this case that "but for" the Agency's change in SRI work schedules to include Sunday within the basic 40-hour workweek, SRIs would have been paid &#x00A7; 1353a overtime for the inspection duties they performed on Sunday, January 17, 1993. Consequently, the award satisfies the second and third test for an award of backpay.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the context of a disciplinary case, an arbitrator need not award overtime compensation at all, even when there is a finding of a violation of a contract provision governing overtime distribution. The arbitrator's broad remedial discretion was discussed in <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 98 and Dept. of Treasury, IRS Memphis Accounting Mgmt. Ctr.</span>, 60 FLRA 448, 450-51 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Authority has never required an arbitrator to award backpay under the Back Pay Act to remedy an agreement violation, particularly where, as here, no finding of a loss of pay was made. In fact, the Authority has specifically held that "nothing in the Back Pay Act that requires a monetary award for every unjustified or unwarranted personnel action." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 916</span>, 57 FLRA 715, 717 n.7 (2002). In this regard, the Authority has also upheld awards of future overtime, in lieu of backpay. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., id; United States Dep't of the Air Force, Oklahoma City Air Logistics Ctr., Tinker AFB, Okla</span>., 47 FLRA 98, 101-02 (1993); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy, United States Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany, Ga.</span>, 39 FLRA 576 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that, although not addressed by the parties, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has addressed the issue of the extent to which an employee may be entitled to backpay where an arbitrator sets aside all or part of a disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">See Ollett v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 253 F.3d 692 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (<span class="Italic">Ollett</span>); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2718, Nat'l Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Serv. Council, et al. v. Dep't of Justice, Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Serv</span>., 768 F.2d 348 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2718</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2718</span>, the court reviewed an arbitrator's award mitigating a removal for misconduct to a 15-day suspension but denying backpay. The court found no violation of the Back Pay Act by not providing backpay. In making that finding, the court noted that an entitlement to backpay under the Back Pay Act did not apply "where the arbitrator has mitigated a removal, has found the employee as much responsible for the removal action as the agency, and has expressly denied back pay as part of the mitigated penalty." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2718,</span> 768 F.2d at 351.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Ollett</span>, the arbitrator in the underlying case reversed an employee's removal for misconduct but awarded no backpay. It was not possible for the court to determine why the arbitrator determined to award no backpay. On appeal of that arbitration award, the court remanded to the arbitrator for clarification on the issue backpay in light of the Back Pay Act and <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2718</span>. In concluding to remand, the court noted, however, that "[o]nly if the arbitrator made a finding of fault on [the grievant's] part which would justify a mitigated penalty could he properly deny back pay." <span class="Italic">Ollett, </span>253 F.3d at 695.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In both <span class="Italic">Ollett</span> and <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2718</span>, the court found that an employee is not always entitled to backpay for the period of time of a removal or suspension that is set aside when the disciplinary action is found to be an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2718, </span>768 F.2d at 351; <span class="Italic">Ollett</span>, 253 F.3d at 695. The court noted that an arbitrator, as part of his or her ability to mitigate a penalty, may set aside the entire removal or period of suspension yet still not award the affected employee backpay for that period if the employee was found to bear some responsibility for causing the underlying disciplinary action (and the resulting loss of pay). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2718, </span>768 F.2d at 351. However, where the employee was found not to bear any responsibility for what occurred, the employee would then be entitled to backpay for that period. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ollett</span>, 253 F.3d at 695.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Authority has held specifically that arbitrators are not required to award backpay and the Federal Circuit has held that backpay is required in only limited circumstances. In the present case, involving an alleged lost opportunity to work overtime rather than a disciplinary action, it is unclear whether or how the Federal Circuit's reasoning would apply. Nevertheless, as set forth above, the Arbitrator in the case now before us found that the Union failed to sustain its burden of establishing that backpay was a required remedy. Thus, we leave for another day, in a case where the issue is presented and addressed, the question whether the Authority should reconsider its precedent on this point.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the award is not contrary to law and deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because an overtime award will be sustained only if the arbitrator finds that, but for the violation, the grievants would have in fact performed the overtime work, necessary subsidiary findings include that the employees were actually available and willing to work at the times of the claimed overtime. <span class="Italic">Naval Air Rework Facility and IAM Local 39</span>, 21 FLRA 410, 411-12 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Navy Pub. Works Ctr., Norfolk and Tidewater Virginia FEMTC</span>, 33 FLRA 592, 599 (1988) (insufficient to predicate back pay award on violation of equalization provisions without finding that employees would have performed specific overtime assignments and received overtime pay). Overtime could not be awarded on the basis of a violation of a collective bargaining agreement, requiring proper notice of cancelation of an overtime assignment, coupled with only an expectation by the grievant of the receipt of overtime work. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Long Beach Naval Shipyard and FEMTC</span>, 34 FLRA 311, 313 (1990). Overtime may not be awarded through back pay because an agency's recordkeeping is poor and because it appears that "in all probability" the grievant was improperly passed over for overtime. The award was too speculative to support a back pay remedy. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1857 and Dept. of Air Force, Sacramento Air Logistics Ctr., McClellan AFB</span>, 35 FLRA 325, 328 (1990). Back pay for lost overtime was not properly awarded when an arbitrator determined that overtime "was not certain." The finding did not constitute an express determination that the unjustified termination of a detail directly resulted in the loss of overtime pay and that, but for the unjustified action, the grievant would have received the pay. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Park Serv. and Police Ass'n of Dist. of Columbia</span>, 21 FLRA 189, 194 (1986). If a contract violation affected several grievants, but only one grievant would have obtained the disputed overtime, not all three grievants may be awarded overtime. A determination should be made who should be the fortunate one. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, Ft. Eustis and NAGE Local R4-6</span>, 38 FLRA 362, 366-67 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">Overtime pay could not be awarded to punish the agency for its refusal to permit a union official from attending a meeting to discuss with management a change in the work schedule. There was no link between the action of precluding attendance at the meeting and a resultant failure of the grievant to have worked weekends to obtain overtime pay. <span class="Italic">VAMC and AFGE Local 31</span>, 18 FLRA 506, 507 (1985). For an overtime award to withstand review, there must be a determination that, but for the violation of an agreement, the grievant would have performed overtime and received overtime pay. A decision that the grievant should have been assigned or requested to perform the overtime does not constitute the requisite finding that she would have performed the work. <span class="Italic">Norfolk Naval Shipyard and Tidewater Virginia FEMTC</span>, 21 FLRA 307, 308 (1986). It is appropriate for an arbitrator to direct an agency to offer a grievant the opportunity to work overtime when it is next available if the grievant was improperly passed over for overtime, but when there is no proof that the grievant actually suffered a monetary loss. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 916 and Dept. of Air Force, Tinker AFB</span>, 57 FLRA 715, 717 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">When an award recognized an overtime violation but made an equitable distribution, dividing the overtime among those who might have been adversely affected, the award was set aside because it violated the Back Pay Act, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1286 and DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, FCI Ashland</span>, 51 FLRA 1618, 1618, 1621-22 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator sustained a grievance by seven grievants claiming that the Agency violated the parties' collective bargaining agreement by assigning overtime work to another employee. The Arbitrator issued the following award: "A sum equal to 8 times the hourly wage of the highest paid of the seven grievants shall be paid by the [Agency] and distributed equally among the seven grievants."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Article 18, Section (n) of the parties' agreement, he did not find that this violation resulted in the denial of overtime pay to all of the grievants. Even assuming, without deciding, that the violation of Article 18, Section (n) constituted an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action in satisfaction of the first requirement of the Back Pay Act and that the award is not deficient on any other basis, the record does not support a conclusion that the violation of the agreement provision resulted in a loss of pay to all the grievants. As such, the award of backpay to all of the grievants violates the Back Pay Act and is, therefore, deficient as contrary to law under section 7122(a) of the Statute. In light of this determination we need not address the Agency's and Union's other contentions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's award is set aside.[2]</p>

<p class="noindent">An arbitrator may condition a back pay award for overtime on whether overtime was available for a given period without violating the Back Pay Act if that conditional order is coupled with a decision that, but for some contractual violation, the employee would have received the overtime when it was available. <span class="Italic">BATF and NTEU</span>, 12 FLRA 49, 50 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DOD, Defense Depot <span id="page_2128"></span>Memphis and AFGE Local 2501</span>, 43 FLRA 228, 234-35 (1991) (overtime properly awarded when agency failed to assign work on holiday in accordance with contract procedures).</p>

<p class="noindent-2">"Unjustified or unwarranted personnel action" means an act of commission or an act of omission (i.e., failure to take an action or confer a benefit) that an appropriate authority subsequently determines, on the basis of substantive or procedural defects, to have been unjustified or unwarranted under applicable law, Executive order, rule, regulation, or mandatory personnel policy established by an agency or through a collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.803. The failure of an agency to pay employees monies to which they are entitled constitutes an unwarranted personnel action within the meaning of the Back Pay Act....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that backpay could not be awarded in this case because there has been no violation of a provision in a collective bargaining agreement.&#x2003;The Arbitrator found, however, that the Agency violated its promise to the grievants to assign 8 hours of overtime per week if they accepted a detail to a lower-paid temporary assignment. He ruled that the Agency's promise constituted "a mandatory element of the employment relationship." The Agency admits that the grievants were misled by the promise of overtime assignments and so induced to accept the 90-day temporary duty assignment. Further, the Agency does not dispute that the NAVSEA freeze on overtime did not apply to the USS Parche to which the grievants were assigned.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our opinion, the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency failed to comply with "a mandatory element of the employment relationship" constitutes a finding that the Agency had established a "mandatory personnel policy" within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.803. We do not agree with the Agency's contention that the foreman was acting outside his authority when he posted the promise to pay overtime on the bulletin boards of Shop 95. The Agency has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator erred in concluding that the foreman was authorized to promise overtime as a means of encouraging employees to volunteer for a temporary assignment at a lower rate of pay. Based on the record before him, the Arbitrator found that the promise of overtime assignments posted by the foreman was discussed with Agency management officials. We note the Arbitrator's statement that "[t]he evidence indicates that there then may have been discussion between Portsmouth and Mare Island concerning [the lack of volunteers after the first solicitation]." Also, as the Union points out, the notice was posted on the bulletin boards of Shop 95 and there was testimony confirming that the matter was discussed by management officials.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we conclude that the Agency has failed to establish that the foreman was not authorized to promise overtime as an inducement to accepting assignments to Mare Island Naval Shipyard. Rather, the record supports the Arbitrator's finding that the promise of overtime was made as a considered and deliberate attempt to induce employees to volunteer after a first call for volunteers had produced none.... The Agency's contention that it did not authorize the foreman to promise overtime merely constitutes disagreement with the Arbitrator's evaluation of the evidence and his findings and conclusion in that regard and provides no basis for finding the award deficient....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Arbitrator specifically ruled that "but for the [Agency's] wrongful withholding of the guaranty, the electricians in question would have received such guaranty." Consequently, the Arbitrator made a proper finding under the Back Pay Act that the Agency had committed an unjustified and unwarranted personnel action when it failed to pay overtime in accordance with the promise made by the foreman and that "but for" that action the grievants would have been assigned the overtime they were promised. The Agency's exceptions fail to establish that the award is deficient because it is contrary to the Act....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Agency's contention that the award is contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5542(a) and 5544(a) by ordering backpay for overtime not worked. The Authority previously has found awards of overtime compensation to be warranted in cases where employees did not actually perform overtime work.... [T]he fact that employees did not actually work overtime did not render a remedy of overtime compensation unlawful. Rather, the employees would have worked overtime had the agency not engaged in improper conduct and, therefore, they suffered the loss of pay because of that conduct. Where it is established that employees are entitled to overtime under collective bargaining agreements and do not receive that overtime because of a violation of the agreement by the agency, those employees can be found to be entitled to compensation for the lost overtime....</p>
<p class="noindent">To obtain FLSA compensation, it may be insufficient that the grievant was denied the opportunity to work overtime, although FLRA did not explain how one would otherwise obtain FLSA compensation for management's failure properly to award overtime work in <span class="Italic">SSA, OHA and AFGE Local 3615</span>, 55 FLRA 349, 353-54 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the FLSA and its implementing regulations require agencies to compensate an employee for all hours he or she works in excess of 40 hours a week at a rate equal to one and one-half times the employee's hourly regular rate of pay. <span class="Italic">See National</span> <span class="Italic">Treasury Employees Union and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, </span>53 FLRA 1469, 1470 n.2 (1998) (<span class="Italic">FDIC</span>). The FLSA also provides that "[a]ny employer who violates the provisions of [the FLSA]...shall be liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of their unpaid overtime compensation,...and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 216. The Arbitrator found that the violation of the parties' agreement supported monetary relief under the FLSA, and that the Union met the standard for recovery under the FLSA because it introduced evidence providing a "reasonable inference of hours worked"--17 hours per week.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues the grievant is not entitled to liquidated damages because the Agency acted in good faith and reasonably.&#x2003;29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260 provides, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">if the employer shows...that the act or omission giving rise to such action was in good faith and that he had reasonable grounds for believing that his act or omission was not a violation of the [FLSA]...the court may, in its sound discretion, award no liquidated damages or award any amount thereof not to exceed the amount specified in section 216 of this title.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 260 "establishes a presumption that an employee who is improperly denied overtime shall be awarded liquidated damages, unless the employer shows that 'the act or omission giving rise [to the violation of the FLSA] was in good faith and that he had reasonable grounds for believing that his act or omission was not a violation of the [FLSA].'" <span class="Italic">FDIC, </span>53 FLRA at 1481 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finding that the FLSA has been violated is, of course, a necessary predicate to any award of liquidated damages based on the employer's failure to establish it acted in good faith. <span class="Italic">Cf. Nash v. Resources, Inc., </span>982 F. Supp. 1427, 1436 (D. Or. 1997). Because, for the reasons that follow, there is no basis on which to conclude that the Agency has violated the FLSA, it is not necessary to examine whether, in rejecting the Agency's good faith defense, the Arbitrator made the necessary findings under section 260.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the FLSA, employees are entitled to be paid at the statutory overtime rate <span class="Italic">when they "work" </span>in excess of 40 hours in a given week. <span class="Italic">See Reich v. New</span> <span class="Italic">York City Transit Authority, </span>45 F.3d 646, 651 (2d Cir. 1995) (emphasis supplied). In this case, the Arbitrator found that, if the Agency had not denied the grievant's request to work at home she <span class="Italic">would have worked </span>in excess of 40 hours a week. The fact that an employee has been denied an opportunity to work overtime does not constitute a violation of the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See Riley v. Dow Coming Corp., </span>767 F. Supp. 735, 743 (M.D.N.C. 1991). Therefore, the award does not support any damages under the FLSA, and must be modified to vacate the award of compensatory and liquidated damages under the FLSA.</p>
<p class="noindent">The effect or intent of <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3615</span> is unclear. <span class="Italic">Reich v. NYC Transit</span>, cited by the Authority, had nothing to do with lost overtime opportunities. It concerned the amount of pre- and post-shift activities (involving dog-handlers) that could be considered "work" (care for the dogs entrusted to the handlers' care). <span class="Italic">Riley v. Dow Corning</span>, also relied upon by FLRA, had nothing to do with an obligation to assign work under a collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">If a reassignment pending investigation is determined to be proper by the arbitrator, and if that reassignment results in loss of overtime or other premium pay, the arbitrator cannot award back pay for the benefits. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Pine Bluff Arsenal and AFGE Local 953</span>, 47 FLRA 626, 629 (1993).</p>
