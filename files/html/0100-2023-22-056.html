<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-57"><span class="space">6.</span> Mitigation</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1987 the Board attempted to harmonize the approach to fee awards in mitigation cases under the "substantial innocence" and the "knew or should have known" standards. What the Board did, without saying as much, was to apply the same standards for fees in mitigation cases as it was applying in retirement appeals: look to the evidence relied on by the AJ to mitigate the penalty; if that evidence was also before the agency, it could be said that the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail. The Board's analysis was set out in <span class="Italic">Lambert v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 34 MSPR 501, 508-07 (1987), involving a meatcutter whose removal for creating a threat to himself and other workers was mitigated to a 60-day suspension. The Board developed an analysis on the basis of its theory that the "merits" of a decision include the selection of penalty for purposes of the "knew or should have known" attorney fee category:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, the Board held that an adverse action could be adequately supported by evidence of record yet still be arbitrary and capricious if there is no rational connection between the grounds charged and the managerial interest served by the particular sanction imposed....&#8197;The Board added that it would only correct a penalty where it finds that the agency failed to weigh relevant factors or imposed a penalty that clearly exceeded the limits of reasonableness.[4] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. 5 MSPR at 306. In acting irresponsibly or unreasonably, however, an agency either knows or should know that the penalty would not withstand Board scrutiny. Thus, fees will generally be warranted under this category when all of the charges are sustained and yet the Board mitigates the penalty imposed, unless the Board's decision to mitigate is based upon evidence that was not presented before the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The Board also found that when an agency action is based upon multiple charges and some of the charges are not sustained, the administrative judge should consider whether the sustained charges warrant the penalty imposed by the agency. <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>[,] 5 MSPR at 308. A request for attorney fees under the knew-or-should-have-known category under these circumstances would also include an examination of whether the agency knew or should have known it would not prevail on the charges themselves, as well as the penalty. This situation, however, is not at issue in the present case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the administrative judge's decision to mitigate the penalty was based upon information available to the agency at the time it took the action. No new information that was unavailable to the agency prior to its decision to remove appellant was introduced at the hearing. Furthermore, we note that the agency did not contest the administrative judge's determination that the penalty was unreasonable since it did not file a petition for review of the initial decision on the merits. Thus, we find that the agency knew or should have known that its selection of an unreasonable penalty would not be sustained by the Board, and an award of attorney fees is, therefore, appropriate in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The short statement of the <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> rule is that attorney fees will generally be warranted under the "knew or should have known" category of <span class="Italic">Allen</span> when the Board sustains all the agency's charges but, nevertheless, mitigates the penalty--unless the Board's mitigation is based on evidence that was not presented to the agency. <span class="Italic">Stephens v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 51 MSPR 5, 7 (1991); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. DOJ</span>, 38 MSPR 398, 401 (1988) (stating rule); <span class="Italic">Sprenger v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 34 MSPR 664, 667 (1987) (by mitigating the penalty the AJ, "of necessity" found that the penalty imposed was unreasonable; by unreasonably selecting the excessive penalty, the agency should have known that the penalty would not withstand Board scrutiny; the appellant carried his burden of showing that the agency knew or should have known that it could not prevail on its selection of the penalty, "which is part of the merits of the case" when it brought the adverse action); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 60 MSPR 614, 619 (1994) (mitigation of a removal to a 120-day suspension: fees were awarded when the single charge against the appellant was sustained, although not all the specifications supporting the charge were sustained). In 1996 the Federal Circuit cast doubt on whether the Board could properly create a presumptive entitlement to fees under the <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> analysis. <span class="Italic">Dunn v. VA</span>, 98 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 1996), <span class="Italic">post</span>.</p>

Noted below are the decisions clarifying, modifying, and amplifying upon <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>, followed by discussion of the Federal Circuit 1996 decision in <span class="Italic">Dunn v. VA</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board clarified <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> in <span class="Italic">Shelton v. OPM</span>, 42 MSPR 214, 221-22 (1989), relieving the agency of responsibility for payment of fees when it could not have anticipated that the Board would change preexisting law or when mitigation resulted after some charges were sustained and others were not sustained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board has no precedent for applying the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> case to mitigate an OPM action under 5 CFR Part 731, once OPM has determined that an employee or applicant is unsuitable for Federal employment....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, we find that the agency could not have been expected to anticipate that the mitigating factors upon which the court relied in this case would have been applied to mitigate the OPM action, especially in light of the seriousness and recency of the appellant's misconduct. On the contrary, the agency apparently was aware of the Board precedents holding that those who falsify employment applications have been determined to be unsuitable for Federal service, and that their successful performance of the duties of the position obtained by such falsification has been considered to be irrelevant to that determination....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, while it is true that a fee award may be warranted when all of an agency's charges are sustained, but its choice of penalty is found to be unreasonable, where, as in this case, the agency's choice of penalty is based on multiple charges, and a subsequent decision to mitigate the penalty is based in part on the fact that not all of the charges were sustained, it cannot be said that the agency should have known its original penalty selection was not reasonable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lambert</span> and <span class="Italic">Shelton</span> were then both interpreted in <span class="Italic">Hutchcraft v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 55 MSPR 138, 147-48 (1992). There, fees were denied after a removal was mitigated to a demotion for an appellant who failed to succeed in development training. Under <span class="Italic">Hutchcraft,</span> if an agency decision departs from existing precedent in applying mitigating factors and if the agency acted reasonably under the preexisting law, the agency could not know or be expected to know that the penalty imposed would not stand up to Board review. The standard for fee awards is whether the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail, not that it knew or should have known that it might not prevail. <span class="Italic">Barrett v. Dept. of Interior</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 95-3593), confirmed that fees are not payable under the "knew or should have known" standard when the basis of mitigation of a penalty is a change in law that occurred after the agency made its adverse action decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners assert that the BIA "knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits at the Board level," and therefore, "it is in the 'interest of justice' that attorney fees be paid by the agency." The crux of petitioners' argument is that the BIA knew or should have known that the penalty it imposed was unreasonable, and the "[s]election of a particular penalty is part of the merits of the agency's case." Therefore, according to the Petitioners, where the Board sustains charges against an appellant, but mitigates the penalty, it follows that the agency acted unreasonably in selecting the penalty imposed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, Petitioners' argument is unpersuasive in that at the time the penalty was imposed, the BIA had no reason to believe that the penalty would be mitigated by the Board. In its final decision on the merits, the Board held that two of the charges against the Petitioners were improper because, under <span class="Italic">Walsh v. VA</span>, 62 MSPR 586 (1994), an agency may not separately charge an employee with misconduct and with making false statements pertaining to the alleged misconduct. Of particular importance is that <span class="Italic">Walsh</span> was decided not only after the BIA initially took action against the Petitioners, but after the Board had initially sustained all of the charges against them....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_4585"></span>The Board again retreated from <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> in <span class="Italic">Ciarla v. USPS</span>, 43 MSPR 240, 244-45 (1990), in analysis of some opacity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the appellant is not entitled to attorney fees under <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category 5. In doing so, we reopen this case to elaborate on our holding in <span class="Italic">Lambert v. Department of the Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force,</span> 34 MSPR 501 (1987). In <span class="Italic">Lambert,</span> the Board held that attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice under the knew-or-should-have-known category where all of the charges of misconduct against an appellant are sustained but the Board still mitigates the agency-imposed penalty because it exceeds the bounds of reasonableness. In <span class="Italic">Lambert,</span> the Board found that the agency knew or should have known that it had selected an unreasonable penalty when all of the charges are sustained.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The Board based this conclusion upon precedent establishing that the selection of a penalty is part of the merits of a case, and its decision in <span class="Italic">Douglas v.</span> <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration,</span> 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280 (1981), where the Board held that it would not substitute its judgment, as to the choice of the penalty to be imposed, for that of the agency unless the agency's choice of the penalty was arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise unreasonable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, 5 MSPR at 306.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> does not extend to cases such as the present, where all the specifications, as opposed to all the charges, have been sustained and the penalty mitigated. The critical point made in <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> was that an agency should not act irresponsibly or unreasonably in imposing a penalty if it either knows or should know that the penalty would not withstand Board scrutiny, even if all of the charges are sustained. <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> at 507. We believe that a finding that all the charges are sustained is distinguishable from a finding that all of the specifications are sustained. In the former situation, the agency may either have known, or should have known, that the penalty imposed was unreasonable. In the latter case, a determination that the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail cannot be made as easily since the penalty may have been appropriate for the charges on which the action was based, if they were sustained, but the penalty may not be appropriate based merely on the sustained specifications, which may involve fewer and/or less serious charges and therefore warrant less severe discipline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's more serious charge, sexual harassment, was not sustained, even though the specifications underlying that charge were sustained. Had that charge been sustained, removal would have been within the bounds of reasonableness. Only the lesser charge of conduct unbecoming a supervisor was sustained, however. In view of the appellant's position as a supervisor, the gravity of the misconduct involved, and the administrative judge's decision sustaining all of the specifications, we find that the agency neither knew nor should have known that the penalty of removal was too harsh for what it may have reasonably, though incorrectly, believed to be sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1991, the Board issued <span class="Italic">Dunn v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 144, 146-48 (1991) (rev'd, <span class="Italic">Dunn v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1992 NP No. 91-3487), <span class="Italic">post</span>), a decision that muddled the <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> analysis. Although all the charges were sustained, the Federal Circuit modified the Board's decision by mitigating the penalty to a six-month suspension, apparently because the court believed the original removal to be excessive. Under <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> the appellant should have received fees. Not so in <span class="Italic">Dunn</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Federal Circuit found that the agency had not established the appellant's lack of rehabilitative potential, and concluded that the penalty of removal therefore was excessive....&#8197;In mitigating the penalty to a 6-month suspension, which is a very significant penalty, the court did not disturb the Board's determination to sustain the serious charges of misconduct against the appellant. The agency charged the appellant with taking three items (a magazine, a flashlight, and a basketball) out of the mainstream by removing those items from his facility's "no obvious value" (NOV) containers. The appellant had taken a training course for employees of the maintenance department several weeks prior to the incidents in question, and had been warned at that time that maintenance personnel were prohibited from removing items from the NOV containers. Furthermore, the agency's Domestic Mail Manual provides that this type of mail is the agency's property until removed from Postal premises by authorized personnel. Because the appellant committed an offense which goes to the heart of the agency's mission, his violations cannot be considered minor. There is consequently no basis for concluding that the agency "knew or should have known" the appellant's removal would not be sustained. Accordingly, we find that an award of attorney fees is not warranted in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The instant case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>, 34 MSPR at 503, where the administrative judge sustained the charge of "creating a threat to the safety of [the appellant] and his fellow workers," but mitigated the agency's selected penalty of removal to a 60-day suspension because the agency had failed to prove the gravamen of its charge. In that case, we held that "fees will generally be warranted under [the knew or should have known] category when all of the charges are sustained and yet the Board mitigates the penalty <span id="Page_4586"></span>imposed, unless the Board's decision to mitigate is based upon evidence that was not presented to the agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 507. <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> does not, however, establish a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule providing that where all the charges are sustained but the penalty is mitigated, mitigation of the penalty, in itself, is a circumstance which warrants an award of attorney fees in the interest of justice. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rose v. Department of the Navy and Office of Personnel Management</span>, 47 MSPR 5, 10 (1991). In <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>, 34 MSPR at 507, we found that the agency had acted "irresponsibly or unreasonably" in selecting an excessive penalty and, consequently, knew or should have known that the penalty would not withstand Board scrutiny. In this case, we cannot find that the imposition of a 6-month suspension by the Federal Circuit warrants a conclusion that the agency acted "irresponsibly or unreasonably" in selecting the penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPINION OF CHAIRMAN DANIEL R. LEVINSON DISSENTING.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I respectfully dissent because I see no principled difference between this case and <span class="Italic">Lambert v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 34 MSPR 501, 507 (1987). In light of the court's decision in this case, it must be found that the agency acted "irresponsibly or unreasonably" in selecting the penalty. Thus, I would award fees under <span class="Italic">Lambert's</span> general rule.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dunn</span> appeared to distinguish levels of mitigation without articulating the bases for the distinctions. In 1992 the Federal Circuit corrected the Board (unfortunately through a nonprecedential decision) in <span class="Italic">Dunn v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1992 NP No. 91-3487), directing the award of fees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a previous appeal, this court mitigated the penalty of removal to a six-month suspension because of the agency's failure to consider all mitigating factors. <span class="Italic">Dunn v. USPS</span>, No. 88-3285 (Fed. Cir. 2-15-89). As a result of such failure, the agency, under clear and uniform case law, could not reasonably expect to prevail on the merits respecting the severity of the penalty....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dunn v. USPS</span> escaped mention in <span class="Italic">Cisneros v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 695, 699-70 (1991), sustaining all the charges (concerning timekeeping practices and statements made in an investigation into those practices) but (based on past long service and potential for rehabilitation) mitigating removal to a 60-day suspension and demotion to the next lowest nonsupervisory position. The Board directed payment of fees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant again cites <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>, 34 MSPR 501, and <span class="Italic">Sprenger v. Department of Interior</span>, 34 MSPR 664 (1987), to support his contention that fees are warranted in the interest of justice because the agency knew or should have known that its choice of penalties would be reversed on appeal to the Board. In those decisions, the Board held that fees will generally be warranted under the "knew or should have known" category when all of the charges are sustained and the Board mitigates the penalty imposed, unless the Board's decision to mitigate is based on evidence that was not presented to the agency....&#8197;The Board reasoned that, in acting irresponsibly or unreasonably in selecting the excessive penalty, the agency knew or should have known that the penalty would not withstand Board scrutiny....&#8197;Both <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> and <span class="Italic">Springer</span> explicitly limit the applicability of their holdings to those cases where the penalty is mitigated by the Board based on information that was before the agency at the time that it rendered its decision to take the action in question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge specifically stated in the initial decision on the merits that the appellant's "many years of good service show the necessary potential for rehabilitation."...&#8197;Although the administrative judge further stated that his finding of rehabilitative potential depended, in part, upon the impression he gained by listening to the appellant's hearing testimony, that "impression" does not constitute evidence or other new information that was not presented before the agency....&#8197;Rather, the administrative judge's determination to mitigate the penalty was based on the same evidence of rehabilitative potential--i.e., the appellant's nineteen years of satisfactory service with no prior disciplinary record--that was available to the agency at the time that it rendered its decision to remove him. We therefore find that the agency knew or should have known that its selected penalty would not withstand Board scrutiny, and that the appellant is entitled to an award of fees on that basis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dunn v. USPS</span> and <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> were "reconciled" in <span class="Italic">Nickerson v. USPS</span>, 55 MSPR 92, 95-96 (1992). The Board concerned itself about the ultimate length of a suspension following mitigation and the nature of the sustained charges, i.e., whether the charges went to the "heart" of the agency's mission:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Lambert v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 34 MSPR 501, 505-07 (1987), the Board held that an agency's penalty selection is part of the merits of its action and that an award of attorney fees is generally warranted where all the charges are sustained but the agency knew or should have known, based upon evidence that was presented before the agency, that its choice of penalty would not be sustained. In <span class="Italic">Dunn</span>, 49 MSPR at 147, the Board reiterated its holding in <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> that "fees will generally be warranted under [the knew or should have known] category when all of the charges are sustained and yet the Board mitigates the penalty imposed, unless the Board's decision to mitigate is based upon evidence that was not presented to the agency."[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The Board clarified its holding in <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>, stating that it "does not, however, establish a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule providing that where all the charges are sustained but the penalty is mitigated, mitigation of the penalty, in itself, is a circumstance which warrants an award of attorney fees in the interest of justice." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 147.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Board distinguished <span class="Italic">Dunn</span> from <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> on the following bases: (1) In <span class="Italic">Dunn</span>, the agency proved the serious charges of misconduct against the appellant, i.e., mistreatment of mail, while, in <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>, the agency failed to prove the gravamen of its charge, i.e., that the appellant created a threat to his safety and to that of his coworkers; (2) the penalty of removal was mitigated to a 6-month suspension in <span class="Italic">Dunn</span>, as opposed to a 60-day suspension in <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>, and (3) the appellant's misconduct in <span class="Italic">Dunn</span> went to the heart of the agency's mission. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 146-47. Thus, the Board found that, in <span class="Italic">Dunn</span>, the agency did not act "irresponsibly or unreasonably" in imposing the penalty of removal<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> at 147-48. Thus, it concluded that an award of attorney fees was not warranted in the interest of justice on the basis that the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on its choice of penalty. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Board found in <span class="Italic">Dunn</span>, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span> n.3, that attorney fees were not warranted in the interest of justice in that case, the instant appeal is distinguishable. Here, (a) the appellant's misconduct of disobeying orders to submit to fitness-for-duty examinations, while quite serious, did not go to the heart of the agency's mission as did the appellant's mistreatment of mails in <span class="Italic">Dunn</span>, and (b) the mitigated penalty of the 120-day suspension is significantly less than the mitigated penalty of the 6-month suspension in <span class="Italic">Dunn</span>. 49 MSPR at 146-48. Because the Board ultimately concluded in this case that the appellant's removal was unreasonable--substantially mitigating the penalty--and that finding was not based upon evidence first introduced on appeal, we conclude that an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After a hiatus of about five years in decisionmaking (for lack of a quorum), the Board issued a decision (nonprecedential--it should have been precedential, given the guidance it provided and the dissent it included), in <span class="Italic">Brown v. DHS</span>, SF-0752-14-0816-A-1 (NP 1/12/2023) (dissent by Member Leavitt). Fees were awarded when a removal was mitigated to a 30-day suspension based on the "knew or should have known" category. The substance of the majority and dissenting opinions are provided:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from her Transportation Security Inspector position based on charges of submitting false reports, failure to follow directions, and failure to exercise due diligence. The appellant appealed her removal to the Board, and the administrative judge issued an initial decision finding that the removal penalty was not within the tolerable limits of reasonableness and mitigating the removal penalty to a demotion to a Transportation Security Officer position and a 30-day suspension. The Board affirmed the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant thereafter filed a motion for attorney fees and costs seeking $104,173.02 for the two attorneys who represented her in the removal appeal: Wendy Musell and Stephen Goldenzweig. The administrative judge issued an addendum initial decision partially granting the motion, finding that the appellant was a prevailing party, an attorney-client relationship existed, and fees were warranted in the interest of justice. After examining the reasonableness of the fees requested, however, the administrative judge reduced the award to $67,105.72.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has filed a petition for review challenging the addendum initial decision. The appellant has responded in opposition to the petition for review, and the agency has replied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To receive an award of attorney fees under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), an appellant must show that: (1) she was the prevailing party; (2) she incurred attorney fees pursuant to an existing attorney-client relationship; (3) an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice; and (4) the amount of attorney fees claimed is reasonable. <span class="Italic">See Caros v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 231, &#x00B6; 5 (2015). The agency has not challenged the appellant's prevailing party status, her having incurred attorney fees pursuant to an existing attorney-client relationship, or the reasonableness of the award, and we discern no basis to disturb these findings. We accordingly limit our review of the addendum initial decision to whether an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An award of attorney fees may be warranted under section 7701(g)(1) in the interest of justice when: (1) the agency engaged in a prohibited personnel practice; (2) the agency action clearly was without merit or wholly unfounded, or the employee was substantially innocent of the charges; (3) the agency initiated the action in bad faith; (4) the agency committed gross procedural error; or (5) the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits. <span class="Italic">See Allen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 420, 434-35 (1980). An award of attorney fees need only be premised on one category of entitlement under Allen. <span class="Italic">See Payne v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 71, 72 n.* (1998). The administrative judge found that an award of attorney fees was warranted in this case because the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits. As discussed below, we agree with the administrative judge's findings, and we need not consider whether the appellant established an entitlement to an award of attorney fees under any of the other <span class="Italic">Allen</span> categories. <span class="Italic">See Payne</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. at 72 n.*.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency's penalty selection is part of the merits of a case. <span class="Italic">See Caryl v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 76, 78 (1993). When the Board sustains the charges in an adverse action appeal but mitigates the penalty based on evidence before, or readily available to, the agency at the time it took the action, an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice because the agency knew or should have known that its choice of penalty would not be upheld. <span class="Italic">See Del Prete v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 429, &#x00B6; 7 (2007), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Driscoll v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 11 (2011). Penalty mitigation alone, however, does not create a presumption in favor of satisfaction of any of the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factors. <span class="Italic">Dunn v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 98 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we agree with the administrative judge's finding that attorney fees are warranted under the "knew or should have known" category because the Board sustained the charges, but mitigated the penalty based on evidence before, or readily available to, the agency at the time it took the action. As the administrative judge properly found, each of the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305 (1981), that warranted mitigation of the penalty in this case were known or readily available to the deciding official when he made the decision to remove the appellant. AID at 5 (citing <span class="Italic">Del Prete</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 429, &#x00B6; 11 (finding that fees were warranted under the fifth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category when no new information was introduced at the hearing that was unavailable to the agency before it removed the appellant)). Further, as the administrative judge properly explained, the Board agreed that the deciding official's evaluation of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors was lacking and that the agency did not prove the reasonableness of the penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board in <span class="Italic">Allen</span> described category 5 as including circumstances in which the agency prepared or presented its case so negligently as to make it a foregone conclusion that the action could not be sustained on the record. <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 435 n.37. Similarly, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that if the agency never possessed trustworthy, admissible evidence, or was negligent in its conduct of the investigation, then the agency knew or should have known not to take the action and fees are warranted in the interest of justice. <span class="Italic">Yorkshire v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 746 F.2d 1454, 1457 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">see also Dunn</span>, 98 F.3d at 1313 (holding that a negligently conducted investigation might give rise to an affirmative finding under <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category 5).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As indicated above, the Board found in its final decision on the merits that the deciding official's evaluation of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors was lacking because he "appeared to admit in his testimony that he did not consider, in the context of the proper penalty for the submitting of false reports charge, the appellant's job level, record of experience, length of service, lack of prior discipline, ability to get along with her coworkers, and any stress, job tensions, or personality issues." The Board also agreed with the administrative judge that the appellant did not engage in a deliberate pattern of misconduct concerning the falsification charge, but found that the deciding official failed to consider this in his <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor analysis. More specifically, the deciding official testified that he "read" each of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, and that he reviewed the proposal and the appellant's response to the proposal. He testified that he "will look" at any mitigating or aggravating factors that may apply, and that he reviewed the agency's table of penalties, which he claimed called for removal for a charge of making a false statement. Nevertheless, the deciding official also testified that he did not consider the appellant's job level and experience in her position because "[h]aving length of service is not an excuse for falsifying a report," and "[w]hether you're there a short period of time or whether you're a tenured or seasoned inspector, if you falsify a report, you falsify a report." He testified that a lack of prior discipline would not be a mitigating factor in this case because "it was a...removal" and the table of penalties for a proposed removal did not provide for "mitigating action." To the extent that the deciding official was strictly following the agency's table of penalties, which indicated that there is only a "recommended" and "aggravated" penalty range of removal for falsification, with the "mitigated" penalty range for that offense described as "N/A," it appears that he did not understand that the table of penalties also indicated that it "does not replace supervisory judgment for determining appropriate penalties in individual cases," and that "[m]anagement officials have the discretion to go outside the ranges listed in this guide if they determine that circumstances warrant." Under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> and the Board's caselaw, consistency of the penalty with any applicable table of penalties is only one of the factors relevant for consideration in determining the penalty. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Zazueta v. Department of Justice</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 493, &#x00B6; 8 (2003), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 104 F. App'x 166 (Fed. Cir. 2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4587"></span>The deciding official further testified that he did not consider the appellant's past work record, including length of service, performance in Oakland, California, ability to get along with coworkers, and dependability "for the same reasons, falsifying a report," given that "[n]one of that would have any bearing on falsifying a report." He testified that "having a stellar work record is not cause to mitigate falsifying a report." All of the above testimony was elicited on direct examination by the agency's representative. In fact, in response to the question from the agency's representative, "[d]id you consider any mitigating circumstances?," the deciding official testified, "[n]o, I did not." He testified that such mitigating circumstances as unusual job tensions, personality problems, mental impairment, harassment, bad faith, malice, or provocation on the part of others were not considered because they did not "provide cause to falsify a report." On cross-examination, the deciding official also testified that he considered the notoriety of the offense to be an aggravating factor even though the misconduct was not made known to the public or the airlines. A review of the agency's proposal and decision notices show that the acting officials only considered the appellant's length of service and lack of prior discipline as mitigating factors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors have been in effect since 1981, yet the deciding official did not apply them in this case. Fees are therefore warranted in the interest of justice under <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category 5 because the agency was negligent in preparing and presenting its case, i.e., the deciding official negligently considered the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. A negligently conducted <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor analysis, such as occurred here, fits within <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category 5's description of a negligently prepared or presented case, as well as the court's references to a negligently conducted investigation that warrants a finding that the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the penalty aspect of its burden of proof. Moreover, this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Dunn</span> and <span class="Italic">Adeleke v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 551 F. App'x 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2014). In those cases, the court found that the agency did not make its original judgment negligently or in disregard of relevant facts. Similarly, <span class="Italic">Sims v. Department of the Navy</span>, 711 F.2d 1578, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1983), is distinguishable because the court held in that case that the agency could not have known, nor should it have known when it took the action in 1979, that the Board's 1981 <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> decision, which required agencies to demonstrate consistency in the imposition of penalties on employees charged with similar offenses, would be issued and applied retroactively.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency argues that much of the evidence relied on by the administrative judge in mitigating the penalty was not known to the deciding official prior to rendering his decision, the standard is whether the agency <span class="Italic">knew or should have known</span> that it would not prevail on the merits, <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 434-35. We find that the administrative judge properly considered the evidence and reasonably concluded that the agency knew or should have known--based on information readily available to it when it brought the proceeding--that it would not prevail on the merits. <span class="Italic">See Del Prete</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 429, &#x00B6; 11. Accordingly, we affirm the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISSENTING OPINION OF TRISTAN L. LEAVITT</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board "may" award attorney fees to "the prevailing party" when it "determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). Both of these prerequisites must be fulfilled in order for fees to be awarded. <span class="Italic">Sterner v. Department of the Army</span>, 711 F.2d 1563, 1565-66 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 462 U.S. 1122 (1983). An appellant may be deemed to have prevailed, and thus be <span class="Italic">eligible</span> for an award of attorney fees, where, as here, the agency-imposed penalty is mitigated as a result of her appeal. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1567. This is distinct from whether the appellant is <span class="Italic">entitled</span> to such an award because fees are warranted in the interest of justice. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1565-67; <span class="Italic">see also Allen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 420, 428 (1980) (the "interest of justice" standard cannot be coextensive with the "prevailing party" requirement). As to entitlement, the question is not whether attorneys should be paid for their success, but rather, whether the Government must bear the burden of payment. <span class="Italic">Sims v. Department of the Navy</span>, 711 F.2d 1578, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that an attorney fee award may be warranted in the interest of justice under the following circumstances: (1) the agency engaged in a prohibited personnel practice; (2) the agency action was clearly without merit or wholly unfounded, or the employee was substantially innocent of the charges; (3) the agency initiated the action in bad faith; (4) the agency committed a gross procedural error; or (5) the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits. <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 434-35. The majority finds an award of fees is warranted in this case under <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category 5 because the agency purportedly knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits. For the reasons set forth below, I respectfully dissent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Allen</span> category 5 "may include circumstances in which the agency prepared or presented its case so negligently as to make it a foregone conclusion that the action could not be sustained on the record established before the Board." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 435 n.37. In analyzing a request for fees under category 5:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he appropriate procedure is to appraise the agency's decision to carry through the action against the employee. If the agency never possessed trustworthy, admissible evidence, or if the agency was negligent in its conduct of the investigation, then the agency ‘knew or should have known' not to take the action. Attorney's fees are then warranted in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Yorkshire v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 746 F.2d 1454, 1457 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">see Kent v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 361, 367 (1987) ("If it is found that the agency was negligent...or that it lacked a reasonable and supportable explanation for its position, then it can be concluded that the agency knew or should have known that it could not prevail") (citing <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span>, 746 F.2d at 1457).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge found the agency proved its charge of submitting false reports by preponderant evidence, sustaining two of the agency's seven specifications. Notably, the administrative judge concluded the appellant made two false statements on an official inspection report--in both instances falsely claiming to have provided airline employees with accurate information concerning security procedures despite knowing she had actually provided them with incorrect information--for the purpose of "obtaining supervisory approval on her report and avoiding further edits or performance counseling." The Board affirmed these findings, which the appellant did not challenge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has frequently stated that the nature and seriousness of the offense, and its relation to the employee's duties, position, and responsibility, is the most important factor in assessing the reasonableness of a penalty. <span class="Italic">Singh v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 2022 MSPB 15, &#x00B6; 18. It is well-settled that falsification is a serious offense that affects an employee's reliability, veracity, trustworthiness, and ethical conduct. <span class="Italic">O'Lague v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 340, &#x00B6; 20 (2016), <span class="Italic">aff'd per curiam</span>, 698 F. App'x 1034 (Fed. Cir. 2017). In my view, the fact that not all of the falsification specifications were sustained does not substantially diminish the gravity of the sustained charge. All Federal employees are expected to be trustworthy and to maintain high standards of integrity. <span class="Italic">Parsons v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. 438, 446 (1984). Although falsification will not invariably result in removal, as the circumstances of each individual case must be considered, <span class="Italic">see id</span>., the Board has found removal to be a reasonable penalty for a first offense of falsification with no prior discipline. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., O'Lague</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 340, &#x00B6; 20 (upholding the penalty of removal for a first offense of falsification with no prior discipline); <span class="Italic">Wheeler v. Department of the Army</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 240, 246-47 (1991) (the appellant's past work record and lack of disciplinary history were insufficient to warrant mitigation of the penalty of removal for falsification due to the seriousness of the offense); <span class="Italic">Delessio v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 517, 521 n.4 ("removal is a reasonable penalty for the sustained falsification charge with or without reference to prior discipline"), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 837 F.2d 1096 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's action comported with these well-established principles. As a Transportation Security Inspector, the appellant was responsible for conducting security inspections, "ensuring security compliance," and "serv[ing] as a technical expert and agency point of contact on transportation security regulations." In light of the appellant's "failure to record [her] inspection activity, truthfully," the deciding official lost trust in the appellant's "ability to carry out [her] responsibilities as a Transportation Security Inspector in a trustworthy and credible manner." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 55. The deciding official "felt that the seriousness of the offense did not warrant a lesser penalty than removal." He testified, "Having length of service is not an excuse for falsifying a report...having a stellar work record is not cause to mitigate falsifying a report.... Stress, tension, personality issues...does not justify falsifying a report." He also relied on the agency's Table of Penalties, which indicates removal is appropriate for falsification, even for a first offense.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the seriousness of the sustained falsification specifications <span id="Page_4588"></span>alone, I do not believe the agency acted negligently in deciding to remove the appellant. This is simply not a case where the agency never possessed trustworthy, admissible evidence in support of its chosen penalty. Although the penalty was ultimately mitigated, the agency had a reasonable, supportable basis for its action when it was taken. Accordingly, I would find an award of fees is not warranted in the interest of justice in this matter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Through 1996 the state of the law was that fees would generally be warranted under the "knew or should have known" category when all the charges were sustained and the Board mitigated the penalty imposed, unless the Board's decision to mitigate was based on evidence that was not presented to the agency, <span class="Italic">Dancy v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 56 MSPR 287, 290 (1993) (agency should have known it could not sustain the removal of a store control clerk for the theft of a $.27 cream pie from the commissary), and unless, perhaps, under <span class="Italic">Nickerson</span> the appellant's conduct went to "the heart of the agency's mission."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1996 the Federal Circuit cast doubt on the continuing validity of <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>. <span class="Italic">Dunn v. VA</span>, 98 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 1996), concluded that no presumption of fee entitlement follows mitigation when all charges are sustained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The arbitrator did not commit error by avoiding comment on the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Lambert v. Department of Air Force</span>, 34 MSPR 501 (1987). In <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>, an administrative judge sustained the agency's charge against an employee, but mitigated the penalty from removal to a sixty-day suspension<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 503. The administrative judge also awarded the employee attorney fees<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> In upholding the award, the Board stated: "fees will generally be warranted under [category five] when all of the charges are sustained and yet the Board mitigates the penalty imposed, unless the Board's decision to mitigate is based upon evidence that was not presented before the agency." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 507.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>, the Board has properly rejected any <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule in favor of fees in cases where the charges are sustained but the penalty is mitigated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nickerson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 55 MSPR 92, 95 n.3 (1992). Nonetheless, the Board has on occasion suggested that <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> creates a presumption that fees are warranted in such cases. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Brunning v. General Services Administration</span>, 63 MSPR 490, 494 (1994). This court detects in the law no such presumption.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to a presumption, section 7701(g)(1) imposes two separate requirements for a fee award. <span class="Italic">Sterner</span>, 711 F.2d at 1565-66. <span class="Italic">See also Wise</span>, 780 F.2d at 999; <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span>, 746 F.2d at 1458 n.7; <span class="Italic">Sims</span>, 711 F.2d at 1581. The employee bears the burden of proving compliance with both conditions<span class="Italic">. Sterner</span>, 711 F.2d at 1566. Moreover, penalty mitigation alone does not create a presumption in favor of satisfaction of any of the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factors. <span class="Italic">See Sims</span>, 711 F.2d at 1582 ("That the employee's punishment was mitigated from removal to a 10-day suspension does not, in itself, strike us as a circumstance which warrants--in the interest of justice--an award of attorney's fees..."). A presumption of fees upon mitigation of a penalty runs counter to the statutory requirement that the employee show that the interests of justice warrant an award. <span class="Italic">See also</span> S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 61 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 USCCAN 2723, 2783 (commenting on section 7701(g)(1): Attorney fees "should not become...the ordinary practice in cases which the employee wins.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following <span class="Italic">Dunn, supra</span>, the court affirmed denial of fees by an arbitrator, <span class="Italic">Adeleke v. DHS</span>, 551 Fed. Appx. 1003, 1006 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An employee challenging an agency's adverse employment action may recover reasonable attorney fees if the employee is a prevailing party and the payment of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(ii); 7701(g). "[M]itigation of an employee's punishment may qualify the employee as a prevailing party." <span class="Italic">Dunn</span>, 98 F.3d at 1311. To determine whether attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice, we consider factors including "[w]hether the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits when it brought the proceeding." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1311-12 (citing <span class="Italic">Allen v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 2 M.S.P.B. 582, 592-93 (1980) (the fifth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board in <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> stated that "fees will generally be warranted under [the knew or should have known] category when all of the charges are sustained and yet the Board mitigates the penalty imposed, unless the Board's decision to mitigate is based upon evidence that was not presented before the agency." <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. at 507. "Since <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>, [however,] the Board has properly rejected any<span class="Italic"> per se</span> rule in favor of fees in cases where the charges are sustained but the penalty is mitigated" and we have specifically rejected "a presumption that fees are warranted in such cases." <span class="Italic">Dunn</span>, 98 F.3d at 1313. We have held that "penalty mitigation alone does not create a presumption in favor of satisfaction of any of the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factors." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. ("A presumption of fees upon mitigation of a penalty runs counter to the statutory requirement that the employee show that the interests of justice warrant an award.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the arbitrator's mitigation of the penalty of removal to a reprimand does not create a presumption that an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice. The arbitrator properly considered relevant evidence to determine whether the fifth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor was met, i.e., whether USCIS knew or should have known that it would not prevail in the removal action. The arbitrator noted that USCIS conducted a careful investigation and concluded that Adeleke gave false statements in responding to the questionnaire and during the investigation by USCIS, which Adeleke admitted after his removal. Under USCIS guidelines, removal was within the range of penalties for giving false statements. Substantial evidence thus supports the arbitrator's finding that USCIS did not know and should not have known that it would not prevail in the removal action. Given that finding (and the admitted lack of bad faith), the denial of fees is in accordance with law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Seeking to harmonize the <span class="Italic">Dunn v. VA</span> analysis with its approach to fees in mitigated cases, the Board decided <span class="Italic">Matthews v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 523, 525-26 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the Board sustains the charges in an adverse action appeal but mitigates the penalty based on evidence before (or readily available to) the agency at the time it took the action, an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice because the agency knew or should have known that its choice of penalty would not be upheld.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We acknowledge that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has criticized the <span class="Italic">Brunning</span> decision cited above, to the extent that <span class="Italic">Brunning</span> can be interpreted as creating a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule that recovery of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice whenever the Board sustains the charges but mitigates the penalty. <span class="Italic">Dunn v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 98 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 1996). We do not endorse or apply any <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule in this case. Again, we find that the agency knew or should have known that its choice of penalty would not be upheld because, based on evidence before the deciding official, the final Board decision concludes that the agency's penalty selection was unreasonable. We also note that in <span class="Italic">Dunn</span>, the court strongly implied that when the reviewing body sustains the charges and mitigates the penalty, and when the agency "made its original judgment...in disregard of the relevant facts," an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice. 98 F.3d at 1313. Here, the administrative judge found in what is now a final Board decision that "the agency has not conscientiously considered all relevant factors" in setting the penalty. <span class="Italic">Dunn</span> thus supports an award of attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Payne v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 71, 74-75 (1998) (same analysis as <span class="Italic">Matthews</span>: "[N]o new information was introduced at the hearing that was unavailable to the agency before it demoted the appellant<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Crawford</span>, 60 MSPR at 619; <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>, 34 MSPR at 507. Moreover, we find that the agency did not properly weigh the relevant factors for determining a penalty set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas v.

We therefore conclude that the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits when it brought the action, and that attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board again explained the confluence of <span class="Italic">Dunn v. VA</span> and <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> in <span class="Italic">Capeless v. VA</span>, 78 MSPR 619, 621-22, 624-25 (1998), eschewing a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule, but awarding fees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the Board sustains the charges in an adverse action appeal but mitigates the penalty based on evidence before (or readily available to) the agency at the time it took the action, an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice because the agency knew or should have known that its choice of penalty would not be upheld. <span class="Italic">Matthews v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 78 MSPR 523 (1998); <span class="Italic">Lambert v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 34 MSPR 501, 505-07 (1987). In <span class="Italic">Dunn v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 98 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 1996), the court emphasized that since <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> the Board has properly rejected any <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule in favor of fees in cases where the charges are sustained but the penalty mitigated. Here, the sole agency charge was sustained and the Board mitigated the penalty imposed from removal to a forty-five day suspension. We do not endorse or apply any <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule in this case, but find that the Board's decision to mitigate the penalty was based upon evidence that was before or readily available to the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The substitute AJ also found that <span class="Italic">Dunn</span> overruled <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>. The substitute AJ correctly cited <span class="Italic">Dunn</span> for the principle that mitigation of a penalty alone does not create a presumption that attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice. The court, however, did not overrule our decision in <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>. Rather, the court stated that, to the extent that the Board has on occasion suggested that <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> creates a presumption that fees are warranted where the charges are sustained but the penalty is mitigated, there is no presumption. <span class="Italic">Dunn</span>, 98 F.3d at 1313.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant did not argue that the Board's mitigation of the penalty alone warranted an award of attorney fees in the interest of justice. Rather, she argued that based on the evidence before it, the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits with respect to the penalty when it took the action. We agree. The agency had before it or readily available to it information showing <span id="Page_4589"></span>mitigating factors, including, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the appellant had a history of outstanding performance appraisals, and that she advised the agency, prior to its final decision, that she had sought medical treatment for work-related stress. Furthermore, the record shows that the appellant advised the agency that she had sought advice from the agency attorney concerning her legal right to tape-record conversations, but was told that the agency attorney could not answer any of her questions or provide her with any help and advised her to consult her own attorney. Although the record evidence does not clearly show that the agency knew that the appellant had consulted a private attorney for advice, it does show that the appellant apparently attempted to advise the agency of such....&#8197;Thus, it appears that knowledge that the appellant was relying on outside legal advice was readily available to the agency, but that the agency chose not to avail itself of such information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, as detailed above, no significant new information was introduced at the hearing that was unavailable to the agency before it removed the appellant. <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 60 MSPR 614, 619 (1994); <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>, 34 MSPR at 507. Moreover, the original AJ found that the agency did not properly weigh the relevant factors for determining a penalty set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280, 305-06 (1981), and made its original judgment negligently or in disregard of relevant facts, <span class="Italic">Dunn</span>, 98 F.3d at 1313. We therefore conclude that the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits when it brought the action, and that attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>, through 1987 if the employee prevailed and obtained mitigation of a discharge, fees were denied.
