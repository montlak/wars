<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-214"><span class="space">d.</span> Necessity for Classified Position at the Higher Level</h5>
<p class="noindent">Cases involving temporary promotions and higher-graded details generate a considerable body of case law relating promotion and classification issues. The body of law generated changes over time and may seem inconsistent from one decision to the next. One issue is whether a temporary promotion can be based on something other than a detail to a classified, higher-graded job, that is, whether assignment of higher-graded duties classified to an established job is sufficient to warrant the higher rate of pay.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center, Twentynine Palms, and AFGE Local 2018,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-74.html">73 FLRA 379</a> (2022) (Member Kiko dissenting in part), <span class="Italic">supra,</span> clarified the distinction between a contract right to a temporary promotion to a position with classified duties and the claim that duties performed by the appellant, when properly classified, supported a temporary promotion. That decision and revisions in the law in 2018 (earlier discussed) revised the earlier order, and earlier decisions may be obsolete or unreliable as precedent, depending on the facts of the cases. These decisions, earlier discussed, are again summarized.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">SBA and AFGE Local 3841</span>, 70 FLRA 729, 730-31 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting), established a multi-part test: (1) an agency <span class="Italic">expressly reassigned</span> a majority of the duties of an already classified, higher-graded position to a lowergraded employee, including all of the grade-controlling duties of that position; (2) the reassigned duties were <span class="Italic">different</span> from the duties of the lowergraded employee's permanent position; (3) the duties were not assigned to meet an urgent mission requirement, to give the employee experience as part of an employee development or succession plan, or for similar reasons; and (4) the employee did not receive a temporary promotion for performing the reassigned duties:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found that a grievance involved classification where it sought, for example: (1) a noncompetitive promotion based on the accretion of higher-graded duties to an employee's permanent position;[6] (2) the reclassification of an employee's position based upon alleged classification errors;[7] (3) a change to the promotion potential of an employee's permanent position;[8] or (4) compensation for performing allegedly higher-graded duties at a time when those duties were not part of an established, previously classified position description.[9] By contrast, as relevant here, the Authority has long held that the question of an employee's entitlement to a temporary promotion under a collective-bargaining agreement or agency regulation does not concern classification within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5).[10]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., AFGE, Local 2142</span>, 61 FLRA 194, 196 (2005); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1858</span>, 59 FLRA 713, 715 (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., AFGE, Local 987</span>, 58 FLRA 453, 454-55 (2003) ("The [a]rbitrator found that the grievant, in the original grievance, contended that his position was improperly classified and that he requested a permanent promotion."); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 987</span>, 52 FLRA 212, 213, 215 (1996) ("Where the issue before the arbitrator involves the appropriateness of a grievant's assigned grade level, the matter is not arbitrable under [&#x00A7;] 7121(c)(5) of the Statute.").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. DOL</span>, 63 FLRA 216, 218 (2009) ("[T]he [u]nion concedes that the grievance challenges the grade level of the career-ladder or journeyman level warranted for the [grievants].").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Comm'n</span>, 54 FLRA 1416, 1421-22 (1998) (Member Wasserman dissenting) ("[T]he [a]rbitrator determined, and the [u]nion does not dispute, that the duties performed by [the grievant] were new and had not previously been classified anywhere.").</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, the Authority's existing standards for determining what constitutes a temporary promotion have not always been clear and failed to recognize the realities of, and flexibilities required of, a 21st Century federal workforce. For example, the Authority has found that a grievance concerned a temporary promotion--and, consequently, was grievable and arbitrable--merely because an employee performed some duties that appeared in a higher-graded position description.[11] In our view, such cases fail to recognize the modern workplace reality that managers often assign employees various duties on a temporary basis as part of their permanent positions, and not as temporary promotions, for any number of reasons. For example, these assignments might be for an urgent mission requirement or just to give the employee valuable experience that could be useful when applying for a future promotion or succession planning. The Authority's previous failure to recognize these realities has led to gray areas in &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) case law and confusion among parties and arbitrators. Therefore, we find it appropriate to clarify our standards regarding &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We now hold that a grievance concerns classification under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) if an employee seeks additional compensation for performing new or additional duties that are part of that employee's work in his or her permanent position. This includes situations where an employee claims to have performed duties that appear in a higher-graded position description. Such grievances essentially seek to have the employee's permanent position reclassified, even if only for a limited time. Thus, we will no longer follow previous Authority decisions--including those that the Union cites[12]--to the extent that they found claims grievable and arbitrable based merely on the existence of higher-graded position descriptions that contained duties that lowergraded employees allegedly performed for a limited period of time.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., Opp'n Br. at 6 (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, S. Tex.

<p class="noindent-1">We clarify that, in order to present a temporary-promotion claim that does not involve classification under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5), a party must offer evidence that: (1) an agency <span class="Italic">expressly reassigned</span> a majority of the duties of an already classified, higher-graded position to a lowergraded employee, including all of the grade-controlling duties of that position; (2) the reassigned duties were <span class="Italic">different</span> from the duties of the lowergraded employee's permanent position; (3) the duties were not assigned to meet an urgent mission requirement, to give the employee experience as part of an employee development or succession plan, or for similar reasons; and (4) the employee did not receive a temporary promotion for performing the reassigned duties.[13] Therefore, a party's allegation that an employee <span class="Italic">assumed</span> higher-graded duties, without management's express direction to perform those duties, will be insufficient to show that a claim is grievable and arbitrable. Using these clarified standards, a claim regarding the following situation would not involve classification under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5): After a higher-graded position becomes vacant, an agency manager explicitly directs a lowergraded employee to temporarily perform the duties that the former occupant of the higher-graded position performed, consistent with the higher-graded position description.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;Of course, if a collective-bargaining agreement or applicable agency regulation contains additional requirements for receiving a temporary promotion, then a claiming party must offer evidence to satisfy those requirements as well.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority recently revised the rule to determine whether a dispute concerns classification within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). Under the revised rule articulated in <span class="Italic">SBA</span>, to present an arbitrable temporary-promotion claim, a party must offer evidence that: (1) an agency expressly reassigned a majority of the duties of an already classified, higher-graded position to a lower-graded employee, including all of the grade-controlling duties of that position; (2) the reassigned duties were different from the duties of the lower-graded employee's permanent position; (3) the duties were not assigned to meet an urgent mission requirement, to give the employee experience as part of an employee development or succession plan, or for similar reasons; and (4) the employee did not receive a temporary promotion for performing the reassigned duties. A party's allegation that an employee <span class="Italic">assumed</span> higher-graded duties, without management's express direction to perform those duties, is insufficient to show that a claim is grievable and arbitrable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">SBA</span>, the Authority further clarified that, where an arbitrator's factual findings are insufficient to conduct the above analysis, the Authority will exercise its discretion to review the record evidence and determine whether the dispute concerns classification under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5).[16]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[16]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">SBA</span>, the union alleged that the grievant was entitled to a temporary promotion because she performed duties associated with three higher-graded positions. However, the Authority found that the "[u]nion's claim that the grievant performed an amalgamation of duties from three different position descriptions fail[ed] to allege that the [a]gency expressly assigned the grievant the duties of any specific higher-graded position." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, the Authority concluded that the grievance involved classification. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although <span class="Italic">SBA</span> clarified the standard for evaluating temporary-promotion claims, certain bedrock requirements from previous caselaw remained the same.[17] In particular, long before <span class="Italic">SBA</span>, temporary-promotion claimants knew that they could not avoid &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5)'s classification bar unless they identified a <span class="Italic">specific</span>, higher-graded <span class="Italic">position</span> to which the Agency could temporarily promote them.[18] Indeed, it is inherent in the nature of a grievable, arbitrable temporary-promotion claim that it must seek a promotion to a <span class="Italic">position</span>; the concept of a "promotion" to higher-graded <span class="Italic">duties</span> is nonsensical.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[17]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 730 (identifying certain features of a dispute that clearly identify it as a non-grievable classification matter, such as an accretion of higher-graded duties to a permanent position).</p>

(emphasis added)); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio</span>, 59 FLRA 64, 67 (2003) (finding a grievance barred under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) where it was "undisputed that there was not a properly classified <span class="Italic">civilian</span> position for the work being performed by the grievant" (emphasis added)); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Air Educ. &#x0026; Training Command, Randolph Air Force Base, San Antonio, Tex</span>., 49 FLRA 1387, 1390 (1994) (finding grievance barred under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) where "there were no available...<span class="Italic">positions</span> into which the grievant could be promoted" (emphasis added)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, in an attachment to the grievance, the Union lists the grievants' names, departments, assigned grade levels, and grade levels of the higher-graded <span class="Italic">duties</span> that each grievant allegedly performed. However, nothing in the record states what factual circumstances gave rise to the grievance, what the grievants' permanent positions were, or what <span class="Italic">positions</span> were associated with the higher-graded duties that the grievants allegedly performed. In fact, for all but five of the thirty-one grievants listed in the grievance attachment, the Union asserts that they performed duties at multiple grade levels. Those assertions are inconsistent with seeking a temporary promotion to a specific <span class="Italic">position</span> classified at a single grade level. Further, the Union claims the recovery period for the grievance is "ongoing," which supports a finding that the claim does not involve <span class="Italic">temporary</span> promotions.[21]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[21]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See SSA</span>, 60 FLRA at 65 (finding that the arbitrator improperly decided a classification matter where, in the arbitrator's view, the grievance was ongoing and "permanent [in] nature, thereby defeating any claim that the performance of [the disputed] duties was for a temporary period of time").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we disagree with the dissent that "it is clear...that the grievance in this case is about...'detail[s] to a higher-graded <span class="Italic">position</span>.'" As previously mentioned, the grievance does not identify <span class="Italic">any</span> higher-graded positions to which the Agency could promote the grievants. The grievants assert that they performed an amalgamation of unspecified, higher-graded duties, sometimes at multiple grade levels. Thus, the grievance suggests on its face that it seeks either permanent promotions based on the accretion of higher-graded duties, or the reclassification of the grievant's permanent positions. Long-established precedent recognizes that &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) bars both of those types of claims.[24]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[24]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See SBA</span>, 70 FLRA at 730 &#x0026; n.6 (accretion-of-duties promotions involve classification); <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 730 &#x0026; n.7 (a challenge to the appropriateness of the grievant's assigned grade level involved classification).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we find that the Union's claim fails to allege that the Agency expressly assigned the grievants the duties of any specific higher-graded positions, and we find that the grievance involved classification. Accordingly, we conclude that &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) bars the grievance, and we set aside the interim award as contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under earlier law, although an arbitrator may be precluded from awarding back pay for a temporary promotion to a position that has not been classified, an award may be sustained that interprets a contract to permit the back pay if the position is identical to other positions that are properly classified. <span class="Italic">USDA, Forest Serv. and NFFE Local 450</span>, 35 FLRA 542, 549 (1990). <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point and IAM Local 2297</span>, 42 FLRA 795, 802-03 (1991), summarized the law:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has refused to find that such a grievance concerns the classification of any position within the meaning of section 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">SSA,</span> <span class="Italic">Baltimore</span> (and cases cited in the decision); <span class="Italic">Robins AFB</span> (and cases cited in the decision); <span class="Italic">INS</span>; <span class="Italic">Georgia Air National Guard.</span> In this case, positions at the WG-9, WG-10, and WG-11 grade levels were established and classified by management and were specifically examined and considered by the Arbitrator. We are not persuaded that the fact that these positions are prevailing rate "mixed jobs" or that the Arbitrator frequently discussed duties rather than positions distinguishes this case from the long line of Authority cases pertaining to the temporary assignment of duties of a higher-graded position. Therefore, contrary to the claim of the Agency, this case is unlike <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 31 FLRA 933. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of the Air Force, Warner Robins Air Force Logistics Center, Robins Air Force Base, Georgia and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 987</span>, 37 FLRA 155, 159-60 (1990). Accordingly, we will deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also conclude that the Agency provides no basis for finding that the award is contrary to the Comptroller General's decision in <span class="Italic">McPeak</span>. As we noted in <span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard</span>, 37 FLRA at 1119, the decision in <span class="Italic">McPeak </span>confirms the general rule that an employee is only entitled to the salary of the position to which the employee was actually appointed. However, the Comptroller General acknowledged an exception <span id="page_2085"></span>"where the parties to a collective bargaining agreement agree to make temporary promotions mandatory for details to higher grade positions, thereby establishing a nondiscretionary agency policy which would provide a basis for backpay." 69 Comp. Gen. at 94. The Comptroller General concluded that the affected employees in <span class="Italic">McPeak </span>were not entitled to retroactive temporary promotions because "there [was] no evidence of a detail of the employees to the higher-graded position. Instead, it appear[ed] that over a period of several years they either assumed or were assigned some duties which were associated with the higher-graded position." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, in this case, as in <span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard,</span> the Arbitrator specifically found that "the Grievant was detailed within the meaning of that term as defined in the Federal Personnel Manual." Accordingly, we find that the award is fully consistent with <span class="Italic">McPeak </span>and, contrary to the claim of the Agency, is indistinguishable from Long Beach Naval Shipyard. As the Arbitrator found that management's assignment of higher-graded duties to the grievant for a legitimate management purpose constituted a detail, we reject the Agency's claim that this finding is contrary to FPM chapter 300, subchapter 8-3. We refuse to find the Arbitrator's determination deficient based on an FPM provision which merely advises that when employees continue to perform the duties of their positions, while also performing the duties of another position, they "generally [are] not considered to be on a detail." <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Allen Park, Michigan and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 933</span>, 38 FLRA 688, 696 (1990) (Authority concluded that based on the determinations of the arbitrator, the award was consistent with the FPM and denied the agency's exception). Accordingly, we will deny the exception.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's exceptions are denied.(*)</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[*]&#x2003;In denying the exceptions, we anticipate that the parties, as ordered by the Arbitrator, will now endeavor to agree on the amount of backpay. We remind the parties, and advise the Arbitrator, of the limitations on temporary promotions set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.102 and FPM chapter 335, subchapter 1-5.

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator specifically found, as a factual matter, that "the specific content" of Grievant's job "did not pre-exist his assignment." That is, the Arbitrator found that Grievant's duties--comprising the position he held--had not previously been classified. Indeed, consistent with the Arbitrator's factual finding that Grievant I's duties were not being performed at the time he was hired, those duties could not have been previously classified. As such, the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">Corpus Christi</span> [<span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees Local 2142 and U.S. Department of the Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot, Corpus Christi Texas</span>, 51 FLRA 1140 (1996)] and <span class="Italic">Quarantine</span> [<span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services Plant Protection and Quarantine and National Association of Agriculture Employees</span>, 51 FLRA 1210 (1996)] is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Corpus Christi</span>, the Authority distinguished between grievances seeking temporary and permanent promotions. However, the Authority did not hold that <span class="Italic">all</span> grievances seeking temporary promotions are arbitrable, and did not address a situation, such as exists in this case, where the duties forming the basis for a requested temporary promotion have not previously been classified. In <span class="Italic">Quarantine</span>, the Authority held that, because the agency did not deny that a previously-classified, higher-graded position existed in the agency, there was no basis on which to conclude that the dispute involved a classification issue even though the higher-graded position did not exist at the grievant's work location. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1215-16. (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service and National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 450</span>, 35 FLRA 542, 549-50 (1990)). In this case, by contrast, the Arbitrator determined, and the Union does not dispute, that the duties performed by Grievant I were new and had not previously been classified anywhere.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs, Memphis and IFPTE Local 259,</span> 63 FLRA 565, 566 (2009), set aside an award that essentially constructed a position description and pay grade that would fit the higher-graded work that the grievant performed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute, grievances covering "the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction in grade or pay of an employee" are precluded by law from coverage by a negotiated grievance procedure. The Authority has construed the term "classification" as "the analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a class under the position-classification plan established by OPM [Office of Personnel Management] under chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 987, </span>37 FLRA 386, 389 (1990) (quoting 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.101(c)). As applied in this case, Authority precedent holds that if resolution of a grievance requires classification of previously-unclassified duties, then the grievance concerns classification within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">Cf. AFGE, Local 1617, </span>55 FLRA 345, 347 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, it is clear that the position comprising the duties that, according to the Arbitrator, entitle the grievant to compensation <span class="Italic">is not currently classified.</span> Indeed, although the Arbitrator ordered a grade 7 or 9 for the position, he also ordered negotiations over the "true grade level" of the position. As the disputed duties have not been classified, the grievance involves classification within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) and the award is deficient. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Muskogee, Okla.,</span> 47 FLRA 1112, 1117 (1993) (award deficient when to determine grade level of duties performed by grievant).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find the award, including the award of back pay, to be deficient because it involves classification under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NRC and NTEU</span>, 54 FLRA 1416, 1421-22 (1998), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 55 FLRA 666 (1999) (<span class="Italic">on further consideration</span>, 55 FLRA 1157 (1999)), reiterated that a classification issue is not generated if a temporary promotion claim is resolved based on comparison of functions performed in unclassified duties with the duties of another, classified position. Lack of a position description for higher-graded duties barred an arbitrator from considering a grievance irrespective of an equal pay contract provision, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 12</span>, 70 FLRA 497, 497-98 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) provides that negotiated grievance-and-arbitration procedures "shall not apply with respect to any grievance concerning...the classification of any position [that] does not result in the reduction in grade or pay of an employee." A grievance is not arbitrable under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) if it seeks a promotion based on the grade level of the duties assigned to, and performed by, the grievant as part of her or his permanent position.[9] By contrast, &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) does not bar a grievance about whether a grievant is entitled to a temporary promotion for performing the duties of an established, higher-graded position.[10] However, where the duties upon which a grievant relied to support a promotion claim "had not previously been classified" as part of a position with a higher grade level than the grievant's permanent position,[11] the Authority held that a grievance seeking a promotion based on the grade level of the grievant's duties "involved a classification matter" under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5).[12]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the grievant sought "compensation for...temporary periods [during which] he performed higher-level work." However, there can be no temporary promotion where there is no higher-graded position to which the grievant could be promoted.[14] Here, the Union admitted that no higher-graded position description "accurately captured" the duties upon which the grievant relied to support his promotion claim. Thus, the matter concerns classification, not a temporary promotion.[16]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Union's argument that the Arbitrator considered whether the grievant performed the duties of a higher-graded position by comparing the grievant's duties to "those performed by" the former employee. In fact, the Arbitrator did not refer to the duties or position description of the former employee. Further, we note that this claim is inconsistent with the Union's argument, at arbitration,[18] that no higher-graded position description "accurately captured" the grievant's duties.

But the Authority has held that a matter barred by &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) is not rendered grievable[22] just because a union makes an equal-pay claim based on a collective-bargaining agreement, applicable regulations, or employment-discrimination provisions, such as those found in the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[23] Thus, the grievance's discrimination allegations do not shield it from &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5)'s bar.</p>

<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Kessler AFB and AFGE Local 2760</span>, 60 FLRA 425, 427-28 (2004), a classification issue was not created when the duties performed by the grievant are compared against the duties of another, higher-graded position for the purpose of analyzing entitlement to compensation for a temporary promotion:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute, a grievance concerning "the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction of grade or pay of an employee" is removed from the scope of the negotiated grievance procedures. The Authority has held that when the substance of a grievance concerns whether the grievant is entitled to be compensated at a higher rate of pay by reason of having temporarily performed the established duties of a higher graded position, the grievance does not concern the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 73</span>, 57 FLRA 412, 414 (2001) <span class="Italic">(NTEU</span>). In comparing the duties performed by a grievant with the properly classified duties of the higher-graded position claimed as the basis for the temporary promotion, an arbitrator is not involved in making a classification determination. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., id.</span>, 57 FLRA at 414. However, when the duties of a position have not been previously classified, a grievance seeking a temporary promotion to that position concerns a classification matter within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See United States Nuclear Regulatory Comm'n</span>, 54 FLRA 1416, 1421-22 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator found that the grievance concerned whether the grievant performed the higher-graded duties of a GS-7 Human Resources Assistant which would have entitled her to a "temporary promotion to that rating." The Arbitrator found that the evidence "[w]as substantial and persuasive" that the grievant performed duties peculiar to the GS-7 position as provided in the position description for the GS-7 position on a regular and recurring basis. This is not, on its face, a classification determination. The Arbitrator did not evaluate the grade level of the duties permanently assigned to and performed by the grievant to determine the appropriate classification. Rather, he focused simply on whether the grievant performed the established duties of a higher graded position, comparing the grievant's duties to those performed by a GS-7 Human Resources Assistant. The Arbitrator thus did not make a classification determination. Accordingly, the award is not contrary to &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU</span>, 57 FLRA at 414.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA Port St. Lucie Dist. and AFGE Local 2014</span>, 64 FLRA 552, 554 (2010) ("In rendering his award, the Arbitrator confined his analysis and conclusions to resolving this contractual issue. Specifically, he assessed whether the grievants were performing the previously established duties of GS-9 Claims Representatives, and he found that the grievants fully performed six, and partially performed three, of those duties.<span class="Italic"> </span>He also found that GS-9 employees, rather than GS-8 employees, replaced the grievants when they were absent.").</p>
<p class="noindent">The distinction between a temporary assignment to a classified higher-graded job and performance of higher-graded duties that do not constitute an established position was explained, <span class="Italic">USDA, FSIS and Nat'l Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals, AFGE</span>, 60 FLRA 192, 194-95 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has construed the term "classification" in &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) in the context of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.101(c), which defines the term as "the analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a class under the position-classification plan established by [the Office of Personnel Management] under chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 987</span>, 37 FLRA 386, 389 (1990). Where the substance of a grievance concerns the grade level of the duties assigned to, and performed by the grievant, the grievance concerns the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. Similarly, where the substance of a grievance concerns the accretion of higher-graded duties to an existing position, the grievance concerns a classification matter. <span class="Italic">See AFGE Local 1858</span>, 59 FLRA 713, 715 (2004)<span class="Italic">. </span>Where, however, the substance of a grievance concerns whether a grievant is entitled to a temporary promotion under a collective bargaining agreement by reason of having temporarily performed the duties of a higher-graded position, the grievance does not concern the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point, N.C</span>., 42 FLRA 795, 801 (1991). However, when the duties of a position have not been previously classified, a grievance seeking a temporary promotion to that position concerns a classification matter within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See United States Nuclear Regulatory Comm'n</span>, 54 FLRA 1416, 1421-22 (1998). In such a grievance, a necessary predicate to determining whether the employee performed higher-graded duties would be to determine the classification of those duties. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson Air Fore Base, Ohio</span>, 59 FLRA 64, 67 (2003) (<span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson AFB</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator examined duties performed by the grievant, compared those duties to the matrix used as a tool by Agency classification staff, and determined that the grievant should have received a temporary promotion. However, it is clear that the grievant was seeking an upgrade, in his permanent position, based on the performance of additional duties. As noted, grievances concerning the grade level assigned to an employee concern classification matters. Thus, to reach his conclusion that the grievant was due a temporary promotion, the Arbitrator classified and graded a set of duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union admits as much when it stated that the Arbitrator "compared the duties of the grievant with the [A]gency's classification guide, and made the appropriate decision[.]" Because the Arbitrator resolved an issue that involved the classification of the grievant's grade level, the award is inconsistent with &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Soc.
