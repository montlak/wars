<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-210"><span class="space">1.</span> Constitutional Framework Applied in Federal Sector</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Pickering v. Board of Educ.</span>, 391 U.S. 563 (1968), factors to be considered in cases taken against public employees because of their speech include whether (1) the statements were directed toward any person with whom appellant would normally be in contact in the course of his daily work; (2) a question of maintaining discipline or harmony among coworkers is involved; (3) the working relationships between the employee and those who are criticized are such that personal loyalty and confidence are necessary to their proper functioning; (4) the speech interfered with the regular operation of the office generally; and (5) the speech impeded the employee's proper performance of his daily duties. Although the balancing test relies heavily on the facts, resolution of the <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> test is a legal determination. <span class="Italic">Stanek v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 805 F.2d 1572 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Under <span class="Italic">Stanek</span>, the determinant for adverse action is the outcome of the balancing test as stated by the Supreme Court; the agency is not required to "clearly demonstrate" how the speech interfered with agency operations, but to demonstrate that the communication interfered with agency operations in a material way. <span class="Italic">Connick v. Myers</span>, 461 U.S. 138 (1983), limits employees' free speech protections to public statements about matters of public interest, leaving internal communications within agencies effectively without constitutional protection, although internal criticism may be protected by prohibited personnel practice safeguards. If one of the bases for a removal case is determined to be speech that is constitutionally protected and therefore not properly supporting a removal action, the AJ must determine under <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle</span>, 429 U.S. 274 (1977), whether the action would have been taken, if at all, based on the remaining specifications. <span class="Italic">Bradley v. DCA</span>, 3 MSPR 498, 500-01 (1980).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ledeaux v. VA</span>, 29 MSPR 440, 445 (1985), noted the Board's approach toward free speech issues after <span class="Italic">Myers</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following <span class="Italic">Myers,</span> the Board has made the element of public concern a preliminary requirement for finding that employee speech is protected by the First Amendment. <span class="Italic">See Barnes v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Army,</span> 22 MSPR 243, 246 (1984); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Federal</span> <span class="Italic">Aviation Administration,</span> 15 MSPR 224, 229-31 (1983). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also Brown v. Department of Transportation,</span> 735 F.2d 543, 546 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (<span class="Italic">Pickering</span> test is applied by determining 1) whether the speech addressed a matter of public concern and, <span class="Italic">if so</span>, 2) whether the interest of the agency in promoting the efficiency of public service outweighs the employee's interest as a citizen). Even if the public concern element is only one factor to consider in determining whether an employee's speech is protected, it is clearly the most important. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Curry v. Department of the Navy,</span> 11 MSPB 573, 576, 13 MSPR 327, 331 (1982) (employee speech that lacks a public dimension and is seen as subversive to good order, efficiency, or discipline in the work place, is more likely to be held unprotected than speech that is more public in character). Here, appellant's allegation that Mr. Debenedictis pushed him into the door is clearly a matter of personal concern only.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit offered its version of free speech constitutional formulations in <span class="Italic">Mings v. DOJ</span>, 813 F.2d 384, 387-89 (Fed. Cir. 1987). The case involved removal of a border patrol agent against whom the principal charge was that he wrote a letter to a manager sharply critical of the use of a particular form for processing hearings for deportable aliens. The letter suggested that use of the form contributed to delays in deportation. The letter also made racial as well as religious comments about the aliens and some border patrol personnel. The court sustained removal; the letter was unprotected by the First Amendment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On several occasions the Supreme Court has considered the scope of the First Amendment protection applicable to speech by public employees....&#8197;Although the Court has recognized that a public employee has a constitutionally protected interest in freedom of expression, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Connick</span>,...the Court has ruled that in determining the measure of that right, the employee's interest must be balanced against the need of government officials for "wide latitude in managing their offices, without intrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the First Amendment."...&#8197;Accordingly, the determination of the free speech rights of government employees involves:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a balance between the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees. <span class="Italic">Pickering</span>....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The First Amendment "does not require a public office to be run as a roundtable for employee complaints over internal office affairs." <span class="Italic">Connick</span>. Accordingly, where speech involves only internal agency grievances rather than matters of "political, social, or other concern to the community," the speech does not involve matters of public concern....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that under this standard the petitioner's letter touched only tangentially, if at all, on matters of public concern. The letter did not discuss the general problems of the rights of illegal aliens, but merely criticized the form the agency used to notify aliens of their hearing rights....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that the petitioner's letter was directed to an agency official rather than to the public at large would not preclude a finding that the letter addressed a matter of public concern....&#8197;The petitioner's use of internal agency channels to vent his dissatisfaction with a specific agency form, however, buttresses the conclusion that the letter did not address a matter of general public interest....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, in determining whether the letter addressed a matter of public concern, the entire document must be considered....&#8197;Viewed as a whole, the letter was not merely a sharp criticism of Form I-293, but also expressed the petitioner's racial and religious prejudice....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an "employee speaks not as a citizen upon matters of public concern, but instead as an employee upon matters only of personal interest," a <span id="Page_2728"></span>federal court may not, "absent the most unusual circumstances...review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency allegedly in reaction to the employee's behavior." <span class="Italic">Connick</span>....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the petitioner's letter did address a matter of public concern, the agency would be precluded from relying upon the letter as a basis for removal only if the petitioner's free speech interest outweighed the interest of the agency in promoting the efficiency of the public service it performs....&#8197;Although in certain First Amendment cases "particularized balancing [of competing interests] is difficult,"...in the present case the potentially <span id="Page_2729"></span>disruptive effect that the letter could have on agency operations substantially outweighed whatever public interest the letter addressed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The letter reflected virulent anti-Hispanic and anti-Catholic bias and accused the petitioner's superiors and fellow employees of incompetence....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A law enforcement officer who has this attitude toward the persons he is charged with apprehending is likely to show little respect for their rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner contends, however, that the agency's mere apprehension that his continued employment would create disruption of and impede its operation is insufficient to justify his removal on the basis of the letter. According to the petitioner, the agency must show that its efficiency was actually diminished. The Supreme Court has rejected this contention. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Connick</span> (sustaining dismissal of employee even where there was no demonstration that the employee's ability to perform her job was actually diminished). An employer has no obligation "to allow events to unfold to the extent that the disruption of the office and the destruction of working relationships is manifest before taking action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 152, <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Fiorillo</span>, 795 F.2d at 1551 (potential of harm from employee's speech need only be "reasonably apprehensible"). <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Monsanto v. Quinn</span>, 674 F.2d 990, 999 (3d Cir. 1982) (stronger showing of harm required where employee's speech touched on matters of substantial importance).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The discharge of a postal employee for writing an article in a union newspaper highly critical of what he considered to be a congressman's anti-union efforts was reviewed in <span class="Italic">APWU v. USPS</span>, 830 F.2d 294, 300 (D.C. Cir. 1987). The article stated that the information about the congressman was revealed from some mail that fell out of an envelope that the employee was processing. The Postal Service fired the employee for improper disclosure of material in the mails. As will be seen, the employee's version of how he received the congressman's mailing was fictitious. The employee was ordered reinstated with back pay:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is now well-settled that the first amendment protects the speech of public employees as well as private citizens. <span class="Italic">Rankin v. McPherson</span>, __U.S. __, 107 S. Ct. 2891 (1987). Public employees, however, enjoy less first amendment protection than private citizens because the government, federal or state, has a significant interest "as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees" in order to perform its public services effectively. <span class="Italic">Pickering</span>, 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968). In <span class="Italic">Pickering</span>, the Supreme Court stated that "[t]he problem in any [government employee] case is to arrive at a balance between the interests of the...[employee] as a citizen in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since <span class="Italic">Pickering</span>, the Supreme Court has refined the balancing test somewhat. In <span class="Italic">Connick v. Myers</span>, the Court turned the "public concern" element of the <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> formulation into a threshold requirement: "if [a public employee's speech]...cannot be fairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter of public concern, it is unnecessary for [a court]...to scrutinize the reasons for [the employee's]...discharge."...According to <span class="Italic">Connick</span>, only if a court finds that the public employee's speech meets this threshold requirement should the court go on to balance the employee's interests in free expression against the government's interest in curtailing the expression....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Rankin</span> represents the most recent Supreme Court statement concerning the protection of public employee speech under the first amendment. In that case the Constable of Harris County, Texas dismissed a deputy...who, upon hearing of an attempt to assassinate the President of the United States, said, "if they go for him again, I hope they get him."...Following <span class="Italic">Connick</span>, the Court first considered whether McPherson's statement addressed a matter of public concern. The Court held that it did because of the "context" in which it was made: "The statement was made in the course of a conversation addressing the policies of the President's administration."...The Court then went on to conduct the <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> balance between the conflicting interests and concluded that the government "fail[ed] to demonstrate a state interest that outweighs McPherson's First Amendment rights."...The Court considered two possible justifications for punishing a public employee's speech: because "it interfered with the efficient functioning of the [government] office" or because "it had discredited the office by [being heard]...in public."...&#8197;There was no evidence, however, that McPherson's statement had actually caused harm to either one of those government interests. Consequently, the Supreme Court held that McPherson's speech was protected by the first amendment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Rankin</span> decision controls our conclusion that Gordon's speech was constitutionally protected. First of all, after <span class="Italic">Rankin</span>, there can be no doubt that Gordon's speech addressed a matter of public concern. Gordon's column, entitled "Workers of the World Unite," was exclusively concerned with efforts to reinvigorate the trade union movement and, more specifically, to combat the threat to organized labor from "right to work" laws. The urge to unionize certainly falls within the category of expression that is "fairly considered as relating to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community...." <span class="Italic">Connick</span>, 461 U.S. at 146.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following <span class="Italic">Rankin</span>, therefore, we avoid asking at the threshold level whether Gordon's assertion that he disclosed a third class mailing's contents, excerpted from its original context, "may not warrant the same level of First Amendment protection."...That decision turns on the <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> balancing test, which expressly takes government harm into account. The threshold inquiry into public concern merely determines whether a government discharge decision is "subject to judicial review" at all under the first amendment and obviously is distinct from the ultimate question of whether Gordon's remark is constitutionally protected speech....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Rankin</span> also is dispositive as to the balancing test promulgated in <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> to properly weigh individuals' first amendment interests against governments' interests in restricting the expressions of its employees. The government asserts that its interest in this case is the "public's confidence in the confidentiality of the mailstream."...Obviously the concern is legitimate, but the government has offered no evidence that Gordon's speech harmed this interest....&#8197;Indeed, the government concedes that it <span class="Italic">cannot</span> show any concrete harm in this case....&#8197;Given the absence of any demonstrated harm caused by Gordon's speech, Gordon must prevail in the balancing of competing interests. <span class="Italic">Rankin</span> explicitly states that the government "bears a burden of justifying the discharge on legitimate grounds."...&#8197;The present case mirrors <span class="Italic">Rankin</span> in that the government has totally failed to meet this burden: It has offered no evidence whatsoever, apart from a postal official's opinion, that Gordon's speech interfered with a legitimate government interest.[13]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13]&#x2003;Our own court's precedents also indicate that, in the absence of a showing of actual harm, a presumption of harm is not sufficient to outweigh an employee's interest in speaking on a matter of public concern....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if it were possible in some situations, after <span class="Italic">Rankin</span>, for the government to pass a <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> balancing test without offering any evidence of actual harm to its asserted interest, this is not such a case, given the limited nature of Gordon's audience and the substance of what he actually wrote. Gordon's article was circulated only to currently employed and retired postal workers. There is no evidence that any member of the more general public read his article. Though several of the 2,100 copies may possibly have come to the attention of nonemployees, this accidental public readership could only be small, and certainly is not to be presumed in the absence of any proof.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]hough <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> left undecided whether a knowingly or recklessly false statement by a public employee will still be protected by the first amendment in the absence of a clear showing of harm resulting from the speech,...no court has ever summarily denied a public employee's first amendment claim on that ground....&#8197;To be sure, intentional falsehoods are among the forms of expression least deserving first amendment protection, and a public employee's interest in uttering deliberate, harmful lies obviously cannot outweigh the Postal Service's interest in promoting the more deserving first amendment activities of the general public in using the mails to communicate their thoughts. But we are not dealing here with knowingly false and harmful statements of fact and the government grossly mischaracterizes Gordon's speech by denouncing it as such.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Gordon did not intend to convey to his readers "false statements of fact." Rather, he wrote a fictional account of how he encountered the Crane "right to work" petition in an attempt "to show the irony of the labor force...handling mail such as this." It is absolutely crucial that, for the purposes of evaluating first amendment claims, courts distinguish analytically between intentionally false statements of fact on the one hand and narrative fiction on the other. The analytic distinction, of course, is that a statement of fact purports to be true, even when it is false, while narrative fiction does not purport to describe events that have actually happened. Narrative fiction, unlike an intentionally false statement of facts, deserves considerable first amendment protection. Indeed, some forms of political expression, like satire, often cannot be fully realized except in the form of narrative fiction....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Indeed, just as an intentionally false statement of fact lies close to, <span id="Page_2730"></span>if not at, the lowest end of a spectrum of first amendment values, the interest that an individual, like Gordon, has in trying to express his political sentiments lies close to, if not at, the top of that spectrum....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[D]espite his maladroit attempt at fiction, the expression of his political beliefs remains protected speech, especially when the government has conceded that it lacked any evidence of actual harm, the article was sent to no member of the general public, and there is no evidence to suggest that any reasonable reader who might have happened on the piece would have lost confidence in the integrity of the mails. Thus, the special facts of this case reveal, just as in <span class="Italic">Rankin</span>, that the public employee's speech, although "ill-considered," remains nonetheless "protected by the First Amendment."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">APWU</span> also defined the hazy relation between defamation, as a source of discipline, and the First Amendment, as a protection, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 308-09:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Defamation cases involve civil liability for damage to a person's reputation. <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> cases involve discipline, usually discharge, of public employees in response to speech that allegedly causes harm to the government.[23]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[23]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Pickering</span>, the Supreme Court explicitly stated that public employee discharge cases and defamation actions are not entirely congruent for the purposes of first amendment law. "We...note our disinclination to make an across-the-board equation of dismissal from public employment for remarks critical of superiors with awarding damages in a libel suit by a public official for similar criticism." 391 U.S. at 574.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first amendment rule governing defamation claims applies regardless of who makes the defamatory statement. If a private citizen may be held liable in tort for a particular defamatory statement, then a public employee is equally liable in tort for the same statement....&#8197;We know then that if a public employee libels a supervisor or a fellow worker, the first amendment will provide no shield from liability in a libel suit brought by the supervisor or coworker.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the first amendment will not prevent the government worker from being discharged for the same defamatory statement. Under the <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> analysis, the first amendment does not protect speech by public employees that "impairs discipline by superiors or harmony among coworkers, has a detrimental impact on close working relationships for which personal loyalty and confidence are necessary, or impedes the performance of the speaker's duties or interferes with the regular operations of the enterprise." <span class="Italic">Rankin</span>. Libels about officemates--precisely because libel actions require proof of damages--involve harm to working relationships necessary for the proper functioning of a government office. Consequently, these defamatory statements would not survive the <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> analysis. Even if the libels about coworkers involved matters of public concern and therefore passed the threshold inquiry, they would not survive the second part of the analysis: the government's interest in maintaining the effective functioning of its operations.[25]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[25]&#x2003;We note that for purposes of this analysis it does not matter whether the defamatory statement, standing alone, constitutes speech on a matter of public concern or whether the defamatory statement, in context, touches on a matter of public concern. Even a defamatory statement that <span class="Italic">itself</span> undeniably addresses a matter of public concern can fail the second part of the <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> analysis. For example, if an EPA employee published an article stating that a named investigator was receiving payments from chemical companies in return for falsified reports, that assertion itself would undoubtedly involve a matter of public concern, but if the assertion was false and made with full knowledge of its falsity, we have no doubt that the EPA could fire the employee for that statement without violating the first amendment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, our opinion is consistent with both <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> case law and defamation case law in protecting the government against libels of its employees. This opinion leaves unaffected the government's prerogative to discharge a public employee who libels a supervisor or fellow worker. And, like <span class="Italic">Rankin</span>, this opinion cannot be read to hold that defamatory statements are "immunized" from punishment...when placed in the context of speech on a matter of public concern. As stated above, that logic confuses <span class="Italic">Connick's</span> threshold inquiry with the subsequent <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> balancing. Instead, we directly follow <span class="Italic">Rankin</span> in holding that a statement by a public employee passes the threshold test established in <span class="Italic">Connick</span> if its context discloses that it touches on a matter of public concern. This preliminary conclusion does not determine first amendment protection. The threshold inquiry merely determines whether a <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> balancing will occur. In this balancing, speech on a matter of public concern will lose constitutional protection if the <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> analysis demonstrates sufficient harm to the government.[27] In the present case, no such harm was adduced. Nor did Gordon's speech harm the reputation of any other person. Defamation law too, therefore, would be unavailing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[27]&#x2003;Wildly irresponsible or damaging statements, even in the context of speech on a matter of public concern, therefore, would incur punishment. The harm to the government from such statements would clearly outweigh an employee's interest in freedom of expression....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[B]ecause the interest that the government seeks to protect by discharging Gordon is not the reputation of private individuals but its own public image, Gordon's speech falls into a category for which an individual cannot normally be punished by the government at all, except when the writer is a public employee. It is precisely for this reason that the distinctive threshold and balancing analysis developed in the <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> line of cases controls the first amendment inquiry in public employee cases, and why the distinctive set of constitutional rules developed for private defamation actions do not govern this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The D.C. Circuit considered and rejected constitutional protection for an employee who was disciplined for comments he made concerning a furlough system to be implemented in his office. The dispute concerned private rather than public interests and was therefore beyond the protection of the First Amendment, <span class="Italic">Murray v. Gardner</span>, 741 F.2d 434, 438 (D.C. Cir. 1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he role of the whistle-blower merits protection; the expressions of personal dissatisfaction by a discontented employee do not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We imagine that at times this line would be difficult to draw, as the part of a "good government" partisan is no doubt very attractive as the last refuge of the incompetent or discontented. But no such difficulty is present here. We discern nothing in Murray's remarks that would enrich the public's store of appropriate knowledge on the operation of the FBI or which would in any way relate to matters of general public concern. Rather, his remarks appear to be an example of the quintessential employee beef: management has acted incompetently. Perhaps it did--the furlough plan seems less than Solomonic. But the furlough plan was purely a labor relations matter, an arrangement of employees under which some would win and some would lose. Its connection to the matters of public concern <span class="Italic">Connick</span> envisioned does not even qualify as remote. If <span class="Italic">Connick's</span> rule could be bypassed by the arguments that Murray raises--that public monies and government efficiency are involved--<span class="Italic">Connick</span> would stand for nothing. We refuse to eviscerate so recent a holding.</p>

Ct. 913 (2015)), declined to honor a First Amendment defense to an adverse action imposed based on disclosure of security-sensitive information in violation of regulations implementing a statute:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the agency violated his First Amendment right to freedom of speech by removing him for his 2003 disclosure of SSI to the MSNBC reporter. The administrative judge found the appellant's First Amendment claim unproven, finding that under the balancing test outlined in <span class="Italic">Pickering v. Board of Education of Township High School District 205, Will Count, Illinois,</span> 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968), the appellant's interest in commenting on a matter of public concern, i.e., the 2003 directive regarding overnight missions, was outweighed by the interest of the agency, as employer, in promoting aviation security. The appellant challenges this finding. We note, in this regard, courts have recognized that law enforcement duties entail special obligations with regard to public trust that may be considered in the <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> balancing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States v. Aguilar,</span> 515 U.S. 593, 606 (1995); <span class="Italic">O'Donnell v. Barry,</span> 148 F.3d 1126, 1135 (D.C. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Cochran v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the record reflects that the appellant revealed information about FAM deployments that the agency legitimately expected to remain confidential, and which created a vulnerability in the aviation system. We find that disciplining the appellant for releasing details of aviation security measures to a reporter did not violate his First Amendment right of free speech. <span class="Italic">Cf. Chambers v. Department of the Interior,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 375, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 36-42 (2006) (disciplining a Chief of Police for disclosing information about officer patrols and her agency's budget to a reporter did not violate her First Amendment right of free speech), a<span class="Italic">ff'd in part, vacated in part on other grounds, and remanded,</span> 515 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also believe the fact that the agency acted in this instance pursuant to, and consistent with, the aforementioned statutory and regulatory nondisclosure scheme mandated by Congress regarding aviation security, undercuts the appellant's constitutional claim. To the extent that the appellant's claim implicitly involves a challenge to the constitutionality of the statute authorizing the agency to issue the nondisclosure regulations, the Board lacks jurisdiction to hear such a claim. <span class="Italic">See May v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 38 M.S.P.R. 534, 538 (1988) (the Board has authority to adjudicate a constitutional challenge to an agency's application of a statute, but it is without authority to determine the constitutionality of federal statutes).</p>
