<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-162"><span class="space">d.</span> Due Process Considerations; Notice</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If the parties enter an LCA that informs the appellant of the decision to take an adverse action and places the action into abeyance pending completion of the terms of the agreement, to satisfy due process requirements the agency need do no more than inform the appellant of the agreement's violation before instituting the adverse action and the waiver of appeal rights. In <span class="Italic">Hanley v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 90 MSPR 43, 47-50 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-13 (2001), the agency proposed the appellant's removal for alcohol misuse. The appellant entered into an agreement that he would abstain for the duration of his employment. The agency sent the appellant a letter stating that the specification in the proposal was upheld, but the decision was placed into abeyance because of the appellant's execution of the agreement. Subsequently, the appellant tested positive for alcohol use and the agency sent the appellant a letter referencing the agreement, informing him of the violation of the agreement, and informing him of his immediate removal and appeal rights. On appeal, the Board remanded the appeal for a decision on the merits and declined to find either that the appellant was denied proper notice and an opportunity to respond or that the agency engaged in improper <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications concerning the reasons for the removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1999), the court examined what constitutionally-guaranteed procedures were due a non-probationary public employee who can only be removed for cause prior to his removal from his position. Citing <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 542-46, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 84 L. Ed.2d 494 (1985), the court held that an employee is entitled to notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to respond to the charges. <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1375-76. From this basic precept, the court held that the introduction of new and material information by <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications to the deciding official undermines those due process guarantees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1376. The court stated that, where there is evidence of such an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication, the Board must determine whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication was so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee could fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1377. When the Board finds that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication meets that threshold, the court concluded, the employee is entitled to a new constitutionally correct removal procedure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues in its petition for review that, because the appellant was removed from his position for the original misconduct that had been set out in the September 2, 1999 letter of proposed removal, and not for failing the April 23, 2000 breath alcohol test, even if the evidence of the latter constituted an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication, it was not new and material information regarding the charge under appeal. The agency characterizes the April 23, 2000 positive breath alcohol test as a "contingency" upon which it could rely in taking the removal action without further notice to the appellant, and it cites several Board cases and a Federal Circuit case in support of its argument. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Girani v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 924 F.2d 237 (Fed. Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Vincent v. Department of Transportatio</span>n, 47 M.S.P.R. 550 (1991); and <span class="Italic">Walton v. Department of the Navy,</span> 24 M.S.P.R. 565 (1984)). The AJ found that the appellant's violation of the Rehabilitation/Treatment agreement was "part and parcel" of the final decision to remove him. In another section of the initial decision, however, he appears to contradict that finding by stating that the agency had removed the appellant "based on the abeyant decision." The question of whether the appellant received the minimum due process required by the Constitution is, of course, dependent on the specific cause of action the agency took. Thus, the first issue we must resolve is whether the appellant was removed for the misuse of alcohol charge set out in the September 2, 1999 proposal letter, for which a final decision had been held in abeyance, or whether the removal was a new action, taken based on the appellant's alleged failure of the April 23, 2000 breath alcohol test in violation of the Rehabilitation/Treatment Agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its October 13, 1999 letter, the agency found that the evidence supported the reason and specification cited in the September 2, 1999 proposed removal, but held its decision in abeyance because of the appellant's agreement to participate in a Rehabilitation/Treatment Program, outlined in an attached agreement. The agency further stated that any violation of the agreement would result in the appellant's separation from the service, and that a final decision in the matter was "contingent upon" the appellant's fulfillment of the agreement's conditions. In its April, 26, 2000 decision letter, the agency set out the fact that the appellant's removal had been proposed on September 2, 1999 for misuse of alcohol, that the appellant had responded to that proposal, and that, in the October 13, 1999 letter, the agency had informed the appellant that the reason cited in the proposal letter was supported by the evidence, but that the decision would be held in abeyance because of the appellant's agreement to fulfill the terms of a treatment agreement. The letter continued by pointing out that the final decision on the proposed removal had been made contingent upon the appellant's successful completion of the agreement, and that one condition of the agreement was the appellant's promise to abstain at all times, on and off duty, from the use of alcohol for the duration of his employment with the agency. The letter then described the April 23, 2000 administration of the on-duty breath alcohol test and the results and confirmed that the appellant violated the terms of his treatment agreement. The letter concluded that "in order to promote the efficiency of the federal service, I have decided to remove you from your position," and it gave the appellant an explanation of his appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's comparison between the facts in this appeal and those in <span class="Italic">Girani</span> is apt. In <span class="Italic">Girani</span>, the agency proposed the employee's removal on a charge involving substance abuse and the agency sustained the charges and found the reasons for the removal supported, but held the action in abeyance pending the employee's completion of a rehabilitation agreement. 924 F.2d at 239. When the agency determined that Mr. Girani had violated the terms of the agreement by drinking alcohol, it issued a decision letter removing him from his position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 239-40. The court found unpersuasive Mr. Girani's argument that he had been removed on a new charge without proper procedural protections, stating that the requirement that he refrain from all alcohol use was a "contingency," rather than a new charge, that he was aware that he could be removed if he failed to comply, and that his failure to do so entitled the agency to remove him without once again complying with procedural protections, i.e., without issuing a new notice and opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 241-42 (citing <span class="Italic">Walton</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. at 569).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the April 26, 2000 letter did not explicitly state that, as a result of the violation of the Agreement, the appellant was being removed on the basis of the earlier misconduct, as the agency did in <span class="Italic">Girani</span>, 924 F.2d at 239-40. Both letters cited above, however, made it clear to the appellant that the agency's decision on the earlier proposed removal was "contingent" on his successful completion of rehabilitation and adherence to the Rehabilitation/Treatment Agreement, that the appellant had not done so, and that he was therefore being removed. Once the agency believed that the appellant had violated the agreement, it was free to issue a decision on the earlier proposed removal, which was still pending. Thus, we interpret the agency's April 26, 2000 decision letter as a final decision removing the appellant from his position on the basis of the September 2, 1999 charge of Misuse of Alcohol. Moreover, because it is undisputed that the appellant had been given an opportunity to <span id="Page_1135"></span>respond to that charge, as in <span class="Italic">Girani</span>, his procedural rights as explained in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> were not violated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reversing the action, the AJ relied on the minimum due process requirements in <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, which the court extrapolated from those in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>. As stated above, in <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, the court held that the introduction of new and material information by <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications to the deciding official undermined the public employee's constitutional due process guarantee of notice (both of the charges and the agency's evidence) and the opportunity to respond. 179 F.3d at 1376. The court further explained that "[w]hen deciding officials receive such <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, employees are <span class="Italic">no longer on notice</span> of the reasons for their dismissal and/or the evidence relied upon by the agency" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis supplied). Thus, we interpret <span class="Italic">Stone</span> as protecting employees from the deciding official's consideration of new and material evidence that was not provided to the appellant, and therefore from discipline for reasons not described in the letter proposing the personnel action. Here, however, because we have found that the action under appeal is the agency's decision on its proposed removal for misuse of alcohol, and because the agency had already sustained that charge, we agree with the agency that any new evidence concerning the appellant's breach of the Rehabilitation/Treatment Agreement was not material to that charge, and thus that the AJ erred in finding that the agency violated the due process considerations set out in <span class="Italic">Stone</span>.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Stone,</span> the court also pointed out that the employee's right to a meaningful response to his proposed termination is essential not only to the charge(s), but also to the penalty levied. 179 F.3d at 1376. It follows, of course, that factors the agency considers in determining the penalty must be set out in the proposal letter. To the extent that there is a question here whether the agency's mention of the appellant's violation of the Rehabilitation/Treatment Agreement in the decision letter, but not in the proposal letter, is a violation of the prohibition specified in <span class="Italic">Stone,</span> we agree with the AJ that, because the agency had already considered removal to be appropriate, any consideration of the subsequent conduct was not material to the penalty determination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Whittaker v. VA</span>, DA-0752-15-0157-I-1 (NP 1/3/2017) ("[T]he administrative judge properly noted that there are no due process concerns of notice and an opportunity to respond at stake in circumstances involving an agency's invocation of an LCA's provision reinstating a removal action....[T]he appellant received notice and an opportunity to respond to the charges that were the basis of the original removal action."); <span class="Italic">Browand v. USDA</span>, SF-0752-12-0400-I-1 (NP 5/30/2013) ("The appellant cannot claim that his due process rights were violated simply because he chose to sign the LCA rather than avail himself of the clearly presented opportunity to provide both oral and written replies. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Darnell v. Department of Transportation</span>, 807 F.2d 943, 945 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ('All that is required to meet the essential requirements of due process are notice and an opportunity to reply.')").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of notice of an LCA violation, if the decision letter does not state the underlying infraction, the appellant may be placed on notice by related documentation, <span class="Italic">Sowell v. VA,</span> AT-0752-10-1009-I-1 (NP 5/23/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly determined that the appellant failed to make nonfrivolous allegations of his compliance with the last chance agreement (LCA). The appellant contends on review, as he did below, that the agency's removal letter contains only general statements and provides him with insufficient notice of any specific policies or procedures that he allegedly violated. We agree that the removal letter, standing alone, fails to provide the appellant with sufficient notice. <span class="Italic">See Lizzio v. Department of the Army,</span> 534 F.3d 1376, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2008). This does not end the inquiry, however. The agency submitted below numerous "individual training plans" for the appellant with weekly evaluation scores of "1," defined as "Unacceptable--Failed to demonstrate effective leadership traits and / or correctly apply VCS [Veteran's Canteen Service] standards, programs, policies and procedures." We find that these submissions were sufficient to inform the appellant in what way he allegedly breached the LCA and to exercise his right to overcome his waiver of appeal rights by proving that he complied with the LCA. Neither the appellant's submissions below or on review, however, raise nonfrivolous allegations that, if proven, would refute the agency's evidence that he had breached the LCA. Thus, for example, the appellant's response to the administrative judge's order states that the agency's documents contained "many inaccuracies" and were "incomplete." As the administrative judge correctly determined, because the LCA provides that a single incident is sufficient to establish the appellant's breach of the LCA, and the appellant did not contest all of the breaches identified by the agency, he failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation that he complied with the LCA.</p>
