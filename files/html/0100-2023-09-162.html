<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-160"><span class="space">b.</span> Public Policy; Appeal Preclusion; Consideration; Conflict With Regulation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board found no constitutional (due process) impediment to an LCA, <span class="Italic">Vincent v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 47 MSPR 550, 559 (1991). Under <span class="Italic">Drummond v. USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 289, 292 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Absent a showing of bad faith, or arbitrary and capricious conduct by the agency, the Board will uphold "last chance" settlement agreements....&#8197;The...Federal Circuit has also held that last chance settlement agreements and waivers of appeal rights to the Board are not void as a matter of public policy, because good faith action must be read into them. <span class="Italic">See McCall v. USPS</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 667-8 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The courts approve last chance agreements, <span class="Italic">McCall v. USPS</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 667-68 (Fed. Cir. 1988), noting:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">McCall...asserts that waiver agreements are inherently coercive because, due to unequal bargaining power as between employer and employee, the employee will often agree to whatever the agency proposes in order to retain his civil service career. It is true that some waiver agreements may not arise out of an entirely voluntary decision. However...the mere possibility of intimidation cannot justify invalidating <span class="Italic">all</span> such agreements. Parties are often forced to make difficult choices which effectively waive statutory or even constitutional rights....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The waiver agreement in this case...reflects a rational judgment on the part of McCall. That McCall obtained a substantial benefit from the agreement is plain: he retained his employment and was given an opportunity to demonstrate satisfactory attendance and performance. What he gave up was the right to pursue the appeal of his original removal to the MSPB, a course in which he had a substantial risk of forfeiting any right to employment. Because his choice was knowing and voluntary, the public interest against involuntary waivers of rights does not weigh against the enforcement of this agreement and it is not void as a matter of public policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also think that McCall is wrong to assume that agencies would be tempted to fabricate misconduct charges to extract "last chance" settlement agreements from employees. Government officials are presumed to carry out their duties in good faith....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The dismissal of an employee for failure to abide by the terms of a last chance settlement agreement concerning his work schedule was affirmed in <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3072). The court approved a settlement agreement establishing a probationary period and defeating the appellant's appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Feiss v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 88-3078).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Can an agreement to waive jurisdiction be contrary to the public policy favoring resolution of civil rights claims? <span class="Italic">O'Neal v. USPS</span>, 39 MSPR 645, 648 (1989), questioned whether an agreement that purported to waive the right to file a complaint with EEOC was void. The Board commented on the general validity of LCAs, but it did not directly rule on the validity of an EEO waiver:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has previously upheld last chance agreements of the type at issue. <span class="Italic">See Green v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> 38 MSPR 577, 582-583 (1988); <span class="Italic">Ferby v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States Postal Service,</span> 26 MSPR 451, 455-56 (1985). Additionally, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently found that such agreements are not void as a matter of public policy. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McCall v. United States Postal Service,</span> 839 F.2d 664, 668 (Fed. Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, in <span class="Italic">McCall,</span> the court found that the agreement itself serves as a check on arbitrary action by the agency. <span class="Italic">McCall,</span> 839 F.2d at 667. The court stated, "[i]f an agency acts in bad faith or takes other arbitrary and capricious action, as a breaching party it would not be able to enforce the agreement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In the present case, however, we find that the agency has not acted in bad faith.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant claims that the agency breached the Agreement by categorizing his absences as AWOL after approving them and/or paying him for those periods. The appellant, however, has not shown that the agency either approved of or paid the appellant for all eleven periods of AWOL at issue. The appellant has proffered evidence regarding some but not all of the periods of AWOL. Furthermore, this evidence does not indicate that the appellant complied with the Agreement's provision regarding absence from work. We note that the Agreement stipulated that all questionable documentation regarding absences would be sent to the agency's Human Resources office for a final ruling on the acceptability of the documentation. As in <span class="Italic">McCall,</span> the Agreement itself serves as a check on arbitrary agency action. <span class="Italic">See McCall,</span> 839 F.2d at 667. Thus, the appellant has not established bad faith on the part of the agency by enforcing the Agreement. <span class="Italic">See McCall,</span> 839 F.2d at 667.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The appellant also contends, for the first time, that the Agreement constitutes handicap discrimination because it results in his removal for absences that were due to his alleged physical incapacitation, and that the Agreement violates public policy because it required him to waive the right to raise the defense of handicap discrimination before the Board. The Board will not consider an argument raised for the first time in a petition for review absent a showing that it is based on new and material evidence not previously available despite the party's due diligence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Banks v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 4 MSPB 342, 4 MSPR 268, 271 (1980). <span class="Italic">See also McCall,</span> 839 F.2d at 666 note. We find that the appellant has not made such a showing in this case. Accordingly, we need not consider these contentions further. Furthermore, while we note the appellant's additional contention raised for the first time in the petition for review that the Agreement also violates public policy because it purports to waive his right to file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the validity of the waiver is not before us. <span class="Italic">See Banks,</span> 4 MSPR at 271. Moreover, even if that attempted waiver is void, that would not affect the validity of the other portions of the Agreement. <span class="Italic">See McCall,</span> 839 F.2d at 666 note.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lizzio v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/LIZZIO_PETER_J_PH_0752_06_0546_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_246073.pdf">105 MSPR 322</a>, 326-28 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7, 10, 2007 MSPB 89 (2007) (remanded on other grounds, <span class="Italic">Lizzio v. Dept. of Army</span>, 534 F.3d 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2008), on remand, <span class="Italic">Lizzio v. Dept. of Army</span>, 110 MSPR 442, 2009 MSPB 10 (2009), <span class="Italic">aff'd on further appeal</span>, <span class="Italic">Lizzio v. Dept. of Army</span>, 374 Fed. Appx. 973 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP)), determined it would be contrary to public policy to enforce a provision in an LCA that precluded the Board from determining whether the appellant actually violated the agreement when, based on an alleged violation, the prior removal action was implemented under the agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge determined that the appellant had made a nonfrivolous allegation of compliance with the LCA, and that he was therefore entitled to a hearing on the issue of jurisdiction. She further found that the waiver provision at &#x00B6; 2(b)(2) was unenforceable as a matter of public policy, on the grounds that "operation of such a waiver would supplant the Board's authority to determine its own jurisdiction over the challenged employment action." Following the hearing, the administrative judge found that the appellant had complied with the LCA, and that the agency was therefore not entitled to invoke the appellant's waiver of appeal rights. Having further determined that the agency did not afford the appellant due process in removing him for his alleged breach of the LCA, the administrative judge reversed the action and ordered the agency to provide interim relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has argued that the appellant's denial that he engaged in misconduct is ipso facto a breach of the LCA, specifically &#x00B6; 2(b)(2), which provides that the appellant "waives the right to appeal or contest a supervisor's determination of future misconduct and agency action based upon misconduct for one year." However, the appellant's position is that the agency had already breached the agreement by removing him, thereby voiding the waiver provision in question. Moreover, contrary to the agency's argument, the appellant need not show that the agency acted in bad faith in order to establish a breach; he may also prove Board jurisdiction by showing that the agency materially breached the agreement, regardless of motive. <span class="Italic">Link v. Department of Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1577, 1582-83 (Fed. Cir. 1995). If, at the time of his removal, the appellant had thus far complied with the LCA, then the agency's removal action was a material breach of the agreement and grounds for disregarding its waiver provisions. Thus, the threshold issue in determining the Board's jurisdiction over this appeal is whether the appellant violated the LCA by engaging in misconduct, as the agency alleges. Insofar as &#x00B6; 2(b)(2) might be construed as precluding the Board from addressing that issue, we agree with the AJ's decision not to enforce it on public policy grounds. <span class="Italic">See Cruz v. Department of the Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240, 1244 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (observing that the Board "has jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction, as do its AJ's").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a nonprecedential decision, the Federal Circuit implied that a waiver may be so broad that Board jurisdiction will be completely divested, no matter what the circumstances, <span class="Italic">Ilardo v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1993 NP No. 92-3415):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 7, 1991, the agency proposed Mr. Ilardo's removal from his <span id="Page_1129"></span>position as a distribution clerk with the United States Postal Service because of sexual harassment. On April 2, 1991, the parties entered into a last chance agreement which provided that Mr. Ilardo would serve a two-year probationary period during which he would provide the agency with monthly medical documentation that "he is able to perform his duties with no restrictions and will not be a threat to the safety of his coworkers or himself." Mr. Ilardo also agreed "to conduct himself in a professional manner and refrain from any behavior that may be construed as sexual harassment or abusive in nature." Additionally, the last-chance agreement stated that Mr. Ilardo "waives further appeals of this action or any further action caused by a violation of any of the above terms."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective September 6, 1991, the agency removed Mr. Ilardo for breach of the last chance agreement by assaulting a coworker and failing to timely provide the agency with medical documentation required by the agreement. He appealed his removal to the Board, and the agency moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The AJ found that Mr. Ilardo had expressly waived his appeal rights to the Board as to both the original removal charge and the allegation of breach, and he did so knowingly and voluntarily. Because Mr. Ilardo had not alleged a nonfrivolous allegation of bad faith by the agency, the AJ dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Ilardo argues that his alleged assault of a coworker and his failure to file medical documentation with the agency were not breaches of the settlement agreement with the agency. However, pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Ilardo waived his right to appeal any breach of that agreement. A settlement agreement is a contract which is interpreted as a matter of law. <span class="Italic">Greco v. Dept. of Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). The language of the agreement that Mr. Ilardo "waives further appeals of this action or any further action caused by a violation of any of the above terms" is unambiguous and waives Mr. Ilardo's right to appeal his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">McCall v. USPS</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 666-67 (Fed. Cir. 1988), we concluded that, where an employee knowingly and voluntarily waives his appeal rights, an agency may enforce the waiver provided the agency acts in good faith. In <span class="Italic">Stewart v.</span> <span class="Italic">USPS</span>, 926 F.2d 1146, 1148-49 (Fed. Cir. 1991), we held that if the language of a last chance agreement provides for a waiver of an employee's right to challenge the validity of his original removal, but fails to expressly waive appeal rights as to breach of the agreement, an employee will, upon raising a nonfrivolous allegation of noncompliance with the agreement, be entitled to petition the Board for review of that issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Clark v. USPS</span>, 989 F.2d 1164 (Fed. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">Stewart</span>, Mr. Ilardo signed a total waiver of appeal rights, including the right to challenge a breach. Additionally, he has failed to make a nonfrivolous claim that the agency acted arbitrarily or in bad faith in removing him for violating the agreement. Mr. Ilardo's coworker filed a claim that Mr. Ilardo had punched him; the agency determined that to be an abusive act in violation of his settlement agreement. Thus, the Board did not have jurisdiction to review Mr. Ilardo's removal....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There must be contractual consideration for an agreement waiving appeal rights. The appellant must get something out of the bargain or the agreement is void, <span class="Italic">Tetrault v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 376, 380-81 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e further find that the last-chance settlement agreement, Settlement 1, does not preclude Board jurisdiction in this appeal. The Board has held that such agreements are enforceable as long as they are fair, freely made, the subject of mutual consideration, and in no way the result of duress or bad faith on the part of the agency, even if they were predicated on something less than a fully effected removal. <span class="Italic">See Romano v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 319, 322 n.3 (1991). Consideration for an appellant's waiver of appeal rights can include, but is not necessarily limited to, an agency's agreement to reduce a removal to a suspension, or its holding of a removal in abeyance for a period of time. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 322; <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 38 MSPR 162, 164 (1988); <span class="Italic">Ferby v. USPS</span>, 26 MSPR 451, 454, 456 (1985). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">McCall v. USPS</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 667 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (discussing the "substantial benefit" the appellant derived from the settlement and what he "gave up" in return for it).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the last-chance agreement in the present case does not satisfy the mutual consideration requirement. As discussed above, that agreement places various requirements upon the appellant regarding attendance and participation in the agency's EAP, and provides for the appellant's waiver of appeal rights. It also includes various clauses explaining that the agreement represents one last chance for the appellant to be retained as a productive employee. It does not, however, include any consideration flowing from the agency to the appellant in exchange for the appellant's waiver of appeal rights. The parties entered into the agreement on the same date that the agency determined to suspend the appellant for 14 days, and Settlement 1 is silent on the relationship between it and the suspension. We, therefore, conclude that the agreement, on its face, lacks the mutual consideration necessary for Board enforcement of a waiver of appeal rights....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">LCAs can be very broad, meaning that agency discretion in deciding whether to terminate an employee for breach of the agreement can be very broad, almost unbridled. The Board may apply the penalty stated in an agreement with an employee who settles a past problem by agreeing to exemplary conduct and satisfactory performance for a future period of time on the pain of dismissal. <span class="Italic">Wakkure v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 85-2769). <span class="Italic">Zordel v. DOD</span>, 99 MSPR 554, 558-59 &#x00B6; 14 (2005), enforced an agreement providing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the terms of the LCSA, the appellant agreed, among other things, to the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">6.c.&#x2003;[T]hat all her communications (both orally and in writing) will be professional, clear, and concise. All communications will maintain the standards of her peers and will not be unduly repetitive, lengthy, or unnecessarily disseminated.</p>

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 245, 247-48 (1991) (finding enforceable a settlement provision requiring the appellant to conduct himself in accord with Postal Service rules and regulations or be subject to dismissal with no right to grieve and no right to seek administrative or judicial relief), <span class="italic">aff'd,</span> 954 F.2d 733 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Black v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 116 MSPR 87, 94-96 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-22, 2011 MSPB 13 (2011), considered whether an LCA that arguably violated an agency regulation could serve as a basis for dismissing an adverse action appeal. The decision spoke of the possibility of a failure of consideration for the LCA, but the decision was really based on a potential conflict between the provisions of the LCA and agency regulations. FAA informed the appellant of a decision to remove him based on a positive alcohol test establishing a limit on alcohol concentration at the time of a test. With the discharge decision, FAA offered what it styled to be an agreement that the removal decision be placed in abeyance based on the appellant's acceptance of terms concerning steps necessary to ensure avoidance of a repetition of improper substance use. When the appellant failed to meet the conditions, FAA terminated the abeyance status of the removal and removed the appellant. In the ensuing adverse action appeal, the appellant argued that FAA should not have imposed the LCA in accordance with its policy, but instead that the policy of DOT should have been followed. The DOT policy was essentially similar to a "firm choice" requirement: an employee shall not be subject to disciplinary action for a first determination of an off-duty drug or alcohol misuse if he successfully completes a rehabilitation program. The difference in approach was clear: a failure to abide by the FAA LCA would result in removal; the failure to complete rehabilitation under DOT policy might result in a proposed action, but the result was not mandated. Recognizing the possibility of a conflict between FAA and DOT policies, the Board sent the case back to the AJ for analysis of the validity of the LCA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An LCA is a settlement agreement, which is a contract. <span class="Italic">Bahrke v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 513, &#x00B6; 11 (2005). A party challenging the validity of a settlement agreement bears a heavy burden of showing a basis for invalidation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. A party may challenge the validity of a settlement agreement if the party believes that the agreement is unlawful, involuntary, or the result of fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. To establish that a settlement agreement was fraudulent as a result of coercion or duress, a party must prove that he involuntarily accepted the other party's terms, that circumstances permitted no alternative, and that such circumstances were the result of the other party's coercive acts. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To have an enforceable contract, there must be consideration, i.e., a performance or a return promise that must be bargained for and does not involve performance of a pre-existing duty. <span class="Italic">See Aviation Contractor Employees, Inc. v. United States</span>, 945 F.2d 1568, 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 545, &#x00B6; 9 (2005); Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 71 (1981). "In the typical bargain, the consideration and the promise bear a reciprocal relation of motive or inducement: the consideration induces the making of the promise and the promise induces the furnishing of the consideration." Restatement (Second) of Contracts, &#x00A7; 71.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has upheld LCAs executed by the parties where they are freely made, fair, the subject of mutual consideration, and are the result of the appellant's knowing and intentional waiver of his right to appeal the agency's action to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Gonzales v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 162, 165 (1988). However, the Board has found waivers of appeal rights in similar situations unenforceable when there was no consideration for the employee's waiver. <span class="Italic">See Thompson</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 545, &#x00B6; 9 (there was no consideration for Thompson's waiver where she <span id="Page_1130"></span>already occupied a position with the agency when she signed the "Notice of Probationary Period Document," and there was no evidence that she knew prior to starting her position that she was waiving her appeal rights); <span class="Italic">see also Hughes v. Social Security Administration</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 67, &#x00B6; 7 (2005) (the appellant did not waive her Board appeal rights by signing a probationary agreement two months after starting a position with a new agency because she received no consideration from the agency in exchange for the waiver of those rights).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the FAA agreed to offer the appellant an opportunity for rehabilitation and to hold the removal action in abeyance in exchange for the appellant's execution of the LCA, which contained a complete waiver of the appellant's appeal rights. However, under DOT Order 3910.1C, the FAA had a "pre-existing duty" to offer the appellant a rehabilitation plan and to hold the removal action in abeyance if he accepted the TRP. <span class="Italic">See Baker v. Department of Transportation</span>, 418 F.3d 1369, 1371-72 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (the FAA was required to offer Baker, an Air Traffic Control Specialist, the opportunity for rehabilitation/treatment under DOT Order 3910.1C and to hold in abeyance the removal action since this was his first instance of off-duty drug use). If DOT Order 3910.1C controls, based upon this "pre-existing duty" and without some other promise from the FAA, there was no consideration for the appellant's execution of the LCA and waiver of appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the decision notice expressly provided that, if the appellant declined the LCA or failed to return the LCA acceptance/declination form, "[the appellant's] removal [would have] become effective <span class="Italic">February 28, 2009</span>," the appellant could not have enforced his right to continue rehabilitation under the TRP without signing the LCA. Consequently, the appellant had no alternative but to sign the LCA and waive all of his appeal rights in order to continue treatment under the TRP. Thus, if the FAA did not have the authority to promulgate the conflicting HROI provisions, the LCA would be unenforceable and would have to be set aside. <span class="Italic">See Aviation Contractor Employees, Inc.</span>, 945 F.2d at 1574; <span class="Italic">Bahrke</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 513, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12. Under such circumstances, the appellant's waiver of his Board appeal rights would be unenforceable and would not deprive the Board of jurisdiction over the reinstated removal action, which the FAA effected based upon the appellant's alleged positive alcohol test in violation of FAA/DOT policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">ORDER</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we VACATE the initial decision and REMAND the appeal to the Atlanta Regional Office for further adjudication.[5] On remand, the administrative judge shall afford the parties a reasonable opportunity to submit evidence and argument concerning the FAA's alleged authority to promulgate a policy that conflicts with DOT Order 3910.1C. If the FAA establishes that it has the authority to implement a policy that conflicts with DOT Order 3910.1C, the administrative judge shall find that the LCA is valid, and that the appellant's waiver of his Board appeal rights deprives the Board of jurisdiction over this appeal.[6] The administrative judge shall issue a new initial decision that addresses these findings and incorporates by reference his findings in the January 6, 2010 initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;We note that the FAA is not precluded from bringing a separate action against the appellant under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 based upon the appellant's alleged positive drug test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;If the administrative judge finds that the FAA had the authority to promulgate the conflicting HROI provisions, a finding would also be necessary as to whether the conflicting HROI provisions were proper under the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If, however, the FAA fails to prove that it possesses this authority, the administrative judge shall find that the HROI impermissibly conflicts with DOT Order 3910.1C, that DOT Order 3910.1C controls over the conflicting HROI, and that the LCA is invalid for the reasons set forth in this Opinion and Order. The administrative judge shall issue a new initial decision that makes these findings. Upon finding that the Board has jurisdiction over the reinstated removal action, the administrative judge shall apprise the parties of their burdens of proof and afford them a reasonable opportunity to submit evidence and argument on whether the original removal action, which was effected based upon the appellant's allegedly positive alcohol test, is supported by preponderant evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After holding a hearing, the administrative judge shall issue a new initial decision determining whether the FAA proved that the removal action is supported by preponderant evidence.</p>
