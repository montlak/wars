<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-6"><span class="space">2.</span> Jurisdictional Hearing; Documentary Evidence</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 7701(a)(1) guarantees the appellant a hearing in an appeal within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Staples v. MSPB</span>, 684 Fed. Appx. 951, 954 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP) ("Mr. Staples complains that he was denied a hearing, but the Board's rules permit a hearing on the merits only if the Board has jurisdiction over an appeal. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.24(d). Because the Board lacked jurisdiction here, Mr. Staples was not entitled to a hearing."). Historically, the Board's position is that cases not involving customary removals, reductions in pay or grade, suspensions of more than 14 days, appeals from OPM retirement decisions, and RIF appeals, warrant hearings if the appellant makes nonfrivolous allegations of jurisdiction. Typical cases that require a preliminary showing of jurisdiction include constructive suspensions resulting from enforced leave and coerced resignations, downgradings, or retirements. Whistleblower reprisal appeals involving personnel actions not normally within the appellate Board's jurisdiction require nonfrivolous jurisdictional allegations for the appellant to obtain a Board hearing. [Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-012.html#sec6-13">Constructive Adverse Action</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-13-013.html#sec6-14">Jurisdictional Showing</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In recent years there has been persistent criticism by the Federal Circuit of the Board's characterization of "jurisdictional" hearings. The Federal Circuit's view, simplified (and not without ambiguity and some internal contradiction in decisions), is that jurisdiction is established by nonfrivolous allegations and supporting evidence from the appellant. When jurisdiction is established, the appeal moves forward to a merits hearing. The distinction is of significance. If a case is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, assuming no impediment based on the timeliness of the appeal, an appellant may be able to bring the case again, with better evidence of jurisdiction, and avoid a bar through <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> or collateral estoppel. If the appeal is heard on the merits, the final decision should have preclusive effect. The byplay between the Board and the Federal Circuit is reflected in the discussion that follows. The final word on the subject has not been written. What vitality remains in the concept of a jurisdictional hearing remains to be seen. The Board continues to refer to hearings on jurisdiction, as in <span class="Italic">Funari v. VA</span>, DA-315H-12-0319-I-1 (NP 11/27/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the outset, we note that the administrative judge inappropriately dismissed the appellant's appeal based upon his failure to prove jurisdiction by preponderant evidence without a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 325, 329 (1994). Rather, an appellant is entitled to a hearing on jurisdiction if he makes a nonfrivolous allegation[3] that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal. <span class="Italic">See Ferdon</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 329....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Nonfrivolous allegations" are allegations of fact that, if proven, could establish that the Board has jurisdiction over the matter at issue. <span class="Italic">Walker v. Department of the Army</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 391, &#x00B6; 6 n.2 (2013).</p>

Here, the appellant withdrew his hearing request shortly after the administrative judge began a hearing on remand. Furthermore, the appellant was properly apprised of the elements and his burden to establish Board jurisdiction over his alleged involuntary reduction in grade and/or pay claim, and the appellant responded to the administrative judge's orders to submit evidence and argument on the jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">See Burgess v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish entitlement to a jurisdictional hearing, an appellant need not allege facts which, if proven, definitely would establish that the resignation was involuntary; she need only allege facts which, if proven, could establish such a claim<span class="Italic">. See Braun</span>, 50 F.3d at 1008; <span class="Italic">Dumas</span>, 789 F.2d at 894. As the court stated in <span class="Italic">Braun</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We further hold that Mr. Braun has made a non-frivolous allegation that, if proven, could establish that his resignation was coerced. This non-frivolous allegation is all that is required to trigger the Board's jurisdiction at this threshold stage. It would be illogical to require a petitioner to prove in advance by preponderant evidence that a resignation or retirement was involuntary to secure a hearing on that very issue. When there is a question as to the voluntariness of the petitioner's resignation or retirement, and the petitioner makes a non-frivolous allegation of the involuntariness of the resignation or retirement, an evidentiary hearing is required to determine whether the resignation or retirement was in fact involuntary.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">At the outset, there is no statutory authority requiring the Board to hold a hearing on the threshold issue of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Rose v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 721 F.2d 355, 357 (Fed. Cir. 1983). Section 7701(a) of Title 5 provides a right to a hearing on the merits, <span class="Italic">see Crispin v.

<p class="Body-Text">If jurisdiction is disputed, it is important that the appeal specifically describe events establishing a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> claim to Board jurisdiction and to a Board hearing. If there are disputed facts that go to the Board's jurisdiction, the AJ should convene a hearing. In <span class="Italic">Murray v. DMA</span>, 1 MSPR 350, 350-51, 1 MSPB 338 (1980), the appellant alleged he involuntarily retired, an action considered tantamount to a removal. The AJ reviewed unsworn statements in the record and concluded that the retirement was voluntary. The Board reversed and remanded for a hearing: "Since an involuntary retirement is tantamount to a removal, a hearing is required here to resolve this disputed factual issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bell v.

Because an involuntary retirement is tantamount to a removal, a hearing is required to determine voluntariness if the facts are disputed. A hearing may be convened to take evidence on a jurisdictional issue and the AJ may then resolve the issue against the appellant without continuing the hearing into other areas. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Carmichael v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...An appellant is not required to prove Board jurisdiction to entitle him to a hearing; rather, he need only make a non-frivolous allegation that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has made such an allegation. The appellant submitted an objection to the agency's motion to dismiss his appeal in which he contested the agency's definition of manager. He set forth specific examples of what he considered to be management functions that he performed. Thus, the appellant's argument concerning jurisdiction was nonfrivolous because it was based on more than mere conclusory allegations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alford</span>, 47 MSPR at 274. Furthermore, in her initial decision, the administrative judge proceeded to consider this argument and the evidence and argument submitted by the agency to make factual findings concerning the weight of the evidence. Indeed, as previously stated, she did not conclude based on these submissions that the Appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction; rather, she concluded that he did not meet his burden of proving that he was a management employee. This determination should not have been made until after a hearing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Alford</span>, 47 MSPR at 274.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">In constructive adverse actions (discussed in <a href="0100-2023-13-001.html#sec6-1">Chapter 6</a>) there will ordinarily be a hearing concerning the facts supporting the allegation that an adverse action was constructively taken against the appellant, assuming the existence of nonfrivolous allegations of fact supporting jurisdiction. But if the issue is more technical, e.g., the rights secured under a particular form of appointment, no hearing is obtained unless material issues cannot be resolved on documentary materials alone. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Soehngen v. DOJ</span>, 47 MSPR 169, 172 (1991). The same result occurs in stay cases brought under the Whistleblower Protection Act. If it appears that the Board lacks jurisdiction, and if the jurisdictional issue can be resolved on documentation alone, a hearing is not granted. <span class="Italic">Wagner v. EPA</span>, 53 MSPR 300 (1992). The analysis was restated by <span class="Italic">Wagner v. EPA</span>, 54 MSPR 447, 451 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Alford</span>, 47 MSPR at 274, the Board held that an appellant is not required to prove Board jurisdiction to establish entitlement to a hearing, but rather, need only make a nonfrivolous allegation that the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal. Even after an appellant makes a nonfrivolous allegation of the Board's jurisdiction, however, he is entitled to a hearing only if the nonfrivolous allegation cannot be decided based on the documentary evidence of record. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Manning v. MSPB</span>, 742 F.2d 1424, 1428 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Jarman v. SBA</span>, 44 MSPR 514, 516 (1990); <span class="Italic">O'Neal v. USPS</span>, 39 MSPR 645, 649, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 887 F.2d 1095 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wagner</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 54 MSPR at 452, concluded that the appellant's allegations did not "establish that a preliminary hearing was warranted on the issue of the Board's jurisdiction over his alleged exclusion from training." The reference to a "preliminary hearing" was interesting but otherwise not expounded on by the Board. Are there to be two hearings in doubtful cases: one on jurisdiction, if documentation will not suffice, and then one on the merits? [Refer to Chapter 13, "<a href="0100-2023-20-083.html#sec13-80">Jurisdictional Issue</a>" for Individual Right of Action appeals.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Laity v. VA</span>, 54 MSPR 51, 54 (1992), referenced the concept of a jurisdictional hearing without explaining how it might differ from a merits hearing. The appellant filed an IRA appeal, following resort to OSC, complaining of a reprimand that he received allegedly as a result of his complaints of "obstruction of government efficiency," "goldbricking," and violations of agency policy requiring the cleaning of clinical areas prior to the cleaning of administrative areas. The AJ dismissed the case because the appellant did not cite any law or regulation that was being violated. The Board first determined that the AJ's acknowledgment order should have but did not tell the appellant that he was required to "show that he made disclosures concerning a violation of law, rule, or regulation, or...gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds." The Board then noted that the employee cited specific laws and regulations concerning his allegations, and described in detail the conduct that violated those regulations, before both the AJ and on PFR:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has made nonfrivolous allegations of fact relating to the Board's jurisdiction over his claim of reprisal for his asserted disclosures of violations of law, rule, or regulation that cannot be resolved based on the documentary evidence of record. Thus, we conclude that the appellant is entitled to a hearing on the jurisdictional issue....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It cannot be fathomed from <span class="Italic">Laity</span> what the jurisdictional hearing is supposed to accomplish. If the appellant states facts within the Board's jurisdiction, he is entitled to a hearing on the merits, not a hearing on jurisdiction. In constructive adverse action cases the hearing on jurisdiction and the merits merges. According to the Board's view of constructive adverse actions, jurisdiction depends on proof of the constructive adverse action; having demonstrated a noticeless constructive action, the appellant then proves both jurisdiction and entitlement to a remedy by deprivation of the constitutional due process required in an adverse action. Winner takes all. [Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-013.html#sec6-14">Jurisdictional Showing</a>," for the interaction of jurisdiction and merits dispositions in constructive adverse action appeals.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Matters become analytically more complex when the Board attempts to discern whether jurisdictional allegations are sufficient to obtain a hearing. The Board may require, in addition to allegations, detailed information through sworn declarations, possibly statements in pleadings (e.g., the appeal), or documents to convert what the Board sometimes calls a "bald allegation" (the Board's way of characterizing the jurisdictional allegation as insubstantial or frivolous) to an allegation sufficiently complete to warrant a hearing. There are cases, however, that permit an AJ to direct the submission of evidence to allow the AJ to make a more informed jurisdictional determination. <span class="Italic">Ellis v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 76 MSPR 102, 106-07 (1997), provided a concise statement of the AJ's authority to require evidence to support allegations, but <span class="Italic">Ellis</span>, involving a constructive demotion, supplied no more than an abstruse explanation of how that discretion should be exercised:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...It is true that an allegation, standing alone, may not be sufficient to warrant a jurisdictional hearing, and the Board may request sufficient evidence to determine if, in the first instance, there is any support for what otherwise might be bald allegations. <span class="Italic">Briscoe,</span> 55 F.3d at 1573; <span class="Italic">see also Clede v. Dept. of</span> <span class="Italic">the Air Force,</span> 72 MSPR 279, 284-86 (1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 113 F.3d 1257 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table). The AJ here did not explicitly require the appellant to submit specific documentary evidence, however. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Manzan v. USPS</span>, 68 MSPR 616, 620 (1995) (in remanding the appeal for further jurisdictional development, the Board stated that the AJ may require the appellant to submit documentary evidence in support of his jurisdictional claim before determining whether his allegations are sufficient to entitle him to a jurisdictional hearing). Moreover, unlike in <span class="Italic">Briscoe</span> and <span class="Italic">Clede</span>, where the pertinent jurisdictional evidence regarding the appellants' alleged mental incapacity was likely to be within their possession and control, the pertinent evidence here regarding the circumstances surrounding the reclassification of the appellant's former position is likely to be within the possession and control of the agency. Indeed, the appellant contended below that she had "limited access to the paper trail generated by the agency in upgrading her previous position," and requested that, if the AJ determined that her submission was insufficient to afford her a jurisdictional hearing, she be allowed to complete discovery before her appeal was dismissed. <span class="Italic">Cf. Briscoe,</span> 55 F.3d at 1574 (the court dismissed Briscoe's argument that she was unable to support her jurisdictional allegations because the Board would not allow adequate discovery, finding that her discovery motions were not likely to reveal relevant information and that she did not show why she could not submit statements or affidavits from her doctors or others to support her bald allegations of mental incapacity). Furthermore, the appellant did submit a sworn affidavit, attesting to the alleged jurisdictional facts in a somewhat specific and detailed manner, which could constitute evidence. <span class="Italic">Cf. Truitt v. Dept. of</span> <span class="Italic">the Navy,</span> 45 MSPR 344, 347 (1990) (sworn statements that are not rebutted are competent evidence of the matters asserted therein). We therefore find, under these circumstances, that the appellant raised nonfrivolous jurisdictional allegations regarding the upgrading of her former position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Requiring the production of evidence in addition to nonfrivolous allegations, or requiring evidence as a component of a nonfrivolous allegation, amounts to the use of summary judgment on jurisdictional issues. The Board does not use the label of summary judgment--to the contrary, the Board asserts that it is precluded from using summary judgment. However it is labeled, the relation between evidence and allegations in the disposition of jurisdictional issues is a matter of some significance. To establish a jurisdictional basis for a hearing in an appeal not indisputably within the Board's jurisdiction, e.g., an adverse action, the appellant's best route is to provide allegations, evidence supporting the allegations, and legal analysis on the jurisdictional issue--like a response to a summary judgment motion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit criticized the Board, without much effect, for failing to distinguish a dispositive jurisdictional issue and proof of a claim within Board jurisdiction. The concept of nonfrivolous allegations of jurisdiction sufficient to warrant an evidentiary hearing, as opposed to a "jurisdictional hearing," was developed in <span class="Italic">Dick v. VA</span>, 290 F.3d 1356, 1361-62 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (partially overruled on other grounds, <span class="Italic">Garcia v. DHS</span>, <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1143912.html">437 F.3d 1322</a> (Fed. Cir. 2006)), involving a claimed constructive adverse action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Confusion arises in cases where the issues before the Board are "at one and the same time jurisdictional issues--requiring a non-frivolous allegation for Board jurisdiction--and merits issues--requiring a determination in favor of the employee if relief is to be awarded." <span class="Italic">Walley</span>, 279 F.3d at 1019. When confronted with such issues, we have held that the Board need not hold a separate hearing to determine jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. Yunus</span>, 242 F.3d at 1371. Indeed, in <span class="Italic">Rose v. Department of Health and Human</span> <span class="Italic">Services</span>, 721 F.2d 355, 357 (Fed. Cir. 1983), we held that there is "[n]o statutory right to a hearing to contest jurisdiction" because "5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1) applies only after jurisdiction has been properly invoked," and that the denial of a hearing on jurisdictional issues is not a violation of due process. In <span class="Italic">Staats v. United States Postal Service</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1124-25 (Fed. Cir. 1996), we again noted that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a) 'does not provide for a hearing on the question whether the Board has jurisdiction in a particular case, and the Due Process Clause does not mandate a hearing where the statute does not require that one be afforded." There simply is no right to a hearing on the threshold issue of jurisdiction. After making a non-frivolous allegation of the involuntariness of a retirement or resignation, an employee has a right to a hearing on voluntariness, <span class="Italic">Burgess v. Merit Sys. Prot</span>. Bd., 758 F.2d <span id="Page_1307"></span>641, 643 (Fed. Cir. 1985), but such a hearing is a hearing on the merits, not a jurisdictional hearing.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;To the extent that <span class="Italic">White v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 213 F.3d 1381, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2000) suggested that the Board is sometimes required to hold a jurisdictional hearing, it is dicta, and inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Rose</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Throughout the <span class="Italic">Guide</span>, but especially in Chapters <a href="0100-2023-08-001.html#sec1-1">1</a>, <a href="0100-2023-13-001.html#sec6-1">6</a>, and <a href="0100-2023-20-001.html#sec13-1">13</a>, many decisions discuss Board jurisdiction. To ensure that adjudication is conducted with a record that allows informed disposition of jurisdictional issues, it will be seen in those chapters that the Board expects its AJs to inform parties of the nature of jurisdictional issues presented in an appeal and the nature of the evidence or allegations that the appellant must present to ensure that the case advances to a hearing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Lee v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 76 MSPR 142, 145-46 (1997) (AJ should have ensured that the appellant had a meaningful opportunity to present evidence or argument on the issues of whether she was subjected to a constructive suspension and whether she was a preference eligible employee).
