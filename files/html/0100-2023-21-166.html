<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-164"><span class="space">3.</span> Redeposit</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Refund of an employee's FERS retirement contributions generally extinguishes annuity rights. <span class="Italic">Pagum v. OPM</span>, 55 MSPR 648, 651 (1992) (citing 5 USC 8424; "Furthermore, although the decision OPM has cited in its petition for review concerns retirement under the CSRS, while the appellant applied for retirement under the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS), the statutory provision OPM has cited provides that refund of an employee's FERS retirement contributions generally voids all FERS annuity rights, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8424 (a).Thus, if OPM did refund the appellant's ' retirement contributions, he would be ineligible for payment of a retirement annuity."). If an individual receives a lump sum payment of his retirement deductions that were withheld during a period of employment, upon federal reemployment the individual must redeposit the amount received, with interest, to receive credit for his prior service. 5 USC 8334(d); <span class="Italic">Broad v. OPM</span>, 53 MSPR 575, 577 (1992) (CSRS). "The statutory and regulatory provisions for waivers and deposits of this nature evidently concern the amount of the annuity to which an eligible employee is entitled, rather than the employee's basic entitlement to an annuity." <span class="Italic">Bell v. OPM</span>, 22 MSPR 43, 45 (1984). [Refer to OPM webcast presentation "Civilian Redeposits" <a href="https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/benefits-officers-center/webcast-presentations/civilian-redeposits.pdf">https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/benefits-officers-center/webcast-presentations/civilian-redeposits.pdf</a>.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee who withdraws his retirement contributions may later seek to redeposit those funds, but the conditions allowing redeposits are limited, as first described in <span class="Italic">Abubot v. OPM</span>, 6 MSPR 40, 41 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As noted by the Appeals Review Board, appellant's participation in the Civil Service retirement fund was terminated by his withdrawal of his contributions. He could have regained the forfeited right to an annuity if he had redeposited those funds, plus accrued interest, during a subsequent period of employment in a covered position, and if he ultimately completed five years of service in a covered position. However, the record shows that he was not employed in a covered position at the time he made application to make a redeposit. Therefore, he was properly found to be ineligible to make a redeposit into the Civil Service retirement fund. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8384(d).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A deferred annuity was precluded through withdrawal of retirement contributions despite appellant's lack of adequate knowledge or information concerning the effect of the withdrawal and inability to make a redeposit, <span class="Italic">Freeman v. OPM</span>, AT-0831-17-0566-I-1 (NP 4/3/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual seeking retirement benefits bears the burden of proving entitlement to those benefits by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 623, &#x00B6; 7 (2005). It is well settled that the Government cannot pay benefits to an employee that are not otherwise permitted by law. <span class="Italic">See Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. 414, 416, 434 (1990) (holding that the Government cannot be estopped from denying benefits not otherwise permitted by law even if the claimant was denied monetary benefits because of his reliance on the mistaken advice of a Government official); <span class="Italic">Danganan v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 265, 269 (1992) (holding that, although there was no evidence that the appellant was aware that he would forfeit any retirement benefits if he withdrew his retirement contributions, OPM could not be required to pay the annuity because he did not meet the statutory requirements), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 19 F.3d 40 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge reversed OPM's reconsideration decision based on his finding that the appellant satisfied the following standard for determining whether an election of retirement options is voidable due to incorrect information: whether a reasonable person would have been confused under the particular circumstances. For the reasons discussed below, assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that this standard was met here, we nonetheless find that the administrative judge erred in reversing OPM's reconsideration decision and ordering OPM to allow the appellant to revoke her election to withdraw her retirement contributions and to redeposit her withdrawn funds with interest.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In ordering this remedy, the administrative judge relied on cases in which the Board found that the appellant was entitled to void his election of a retirement option because he made the election in reliance on erroneous information provided by Government employees. ID at 5 (citing <span class="Italic">Froom v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 607 (2008) and <span class="Italic">Cortinas v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 513 (1987)). Significantly, however, in those cases, the relevant statutory provisions did not prevent the remedial action ordered by the Board. In <span class="Italic">Froom</span>, the Board reversed an initial decision and determined that the appellant was entitled to void his election to make a military service retirement credit deposit, and to a refund of that deposit, when he reasonably relied on erroneous information provided to him by OPM and the Social Security Administration (SSA) in making a deposit to ensure that he would retain CSRS service credit for his post-1956 active duty military service. The Board noted that, contrary to what OPM and the SSA advised the appellant, he was entitled to CSRS credit for his military service without having to make a deposit as a matter of law, as long as he did not qualify for old-age Social Security benefits when he became 62 years of age, which under the facts presented, he did not. The Board agreed with the appellant that a reasonable person would have been confused by the erroneous material information OPM and the SSA furnished him, and so the Board ordered OPM to refund the appellant's deposit that he made to retain CSRS service for his military service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Cortinas</span>, the appellant was receiving military retirement pay when he retired on disability. <span class="Italic">Cortinas</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. at 514. The appellant elected to receive a monthly annuity rather than a lump-sum distribution because his employing agency informed him that his monthly annuity would be based on his military and civilian service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 515-16. In fact, however, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(g), with certain exceptions, excludes credit for military service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 514. Consequently, OPM computed the appellant's annuity based on his length of civil service and average salary, excluding credit for military service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. As a result, the amount of his monthly annuity was more than $300 less than the estimate provided by his employing agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 516.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal in <span class="Italic">Cortinas</span>, the appellant acknowledged that OPM's annuity calculations were correct, but contended that its decision should be reversed and that he should be provided with an opportunity to make an informed decision regarding available retirement options because his election of retirement options was based on the incorrect information provided by his employing agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 515. The administrative judge <span id="Page_4388"></span>rejected the appellant's argument and affirmed OPM's decision, finding that, even if the appellant was misled or given erroneous information, an agency cannot be estopped from enforcing the requirements of a statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 514-15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board reversed the initial decision and ordered OPM to inform the appellant of his retirement options and allow him to apply for a change in his annuity. <span class="Italic">Cortinas</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. at 516-17. The Board found the estoppel issue relied on by the administrative judge was inapplicable because providing the appellant equitable relief would not require a waiver or nullification of statutory provisions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 516.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, however, the relief ordered by the administrative judge would require a waiver or nullification of statutory provisions. With exceptions not applicable in this appeal,[6] the receipt of a refund of CSRS retirement contributions voids all annuity rights based on the service for which the refund is made until the recipient is reemployed by the Federal Government in a covered position and redeposits the funds previously withdrawn. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8334(d), 8342(a); <span class="Italic">Youngblood v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 278, &#x00B6; 12 (2008). Thus, an annuitant must be in a current covered Federal position to make a redeposit of refunded CSRS credit. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;There are two statutory exceptions to the general rule that receipt of retirement contributions voids an interest in the CSRS until reemployment in the Federal service. The first, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8343a, provides for alternative forms of annuities to employees with life-threatening afflictions or other critical medical conditions at the time of retirement. The second, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(d)(2), addresses annuity-eligible employees who do not make the deposit required to receive service credit. The circumstances alleged by the appellant do not fall within the purview of either of these statutory provisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An individual also may avoid the rule that receipt of a refund of retirement contributions voids annuity rights if she was mentally incompetent when she applied for the refund. <span class="Italic">See Yarbrough v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 770 F.2d 1056, 1060 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Here, the appellant has not alleged that she was mentally incompetent when she signed the refund application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, because the appellant requested and received a refund of her CSRS retirement contributions, and she is not a current Federal employee making retirement contributions, she is not entitled to redeposit her withdrawn contributions or to receive an annuity. <span class="Italic">See Mahan v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 639, 641-42 (1991) (holding that, because the appellant requested and received a refund of her contributions to the civil service retirement fund, and she has not been reemployed in a covered position in the Federal service, any right she had to an annuity was extinguished). In other words, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(d) precludes the remedy ordered by the administrative judge. Accordingly, we reverse the initial decision and sustain OPM's reconsideration decision denying the appellant's request for a deferred retirement annuity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hunt v. OPM</span>, CH-0831-12-0753-I-1 (NP 9/23/2013), summarized the law governing redeposits following refunds of retirement contributions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Section 8334(d) of Title 5 of the U.S. Code provides that an employee who has received a refund of retirement deductions may receive credit for the service covered under the refund if she redeposits the amount received, with interest. An employee is defined under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(d) as either: (1) a person currently employed in a position subject to the civil service retirement law; or (2) a former employee whose annuity has not been finally adjudicated and who retains civil service retirement annuity rights based on separation from a position in which retirement deductions were properly withheld and remain (or have been redeposited in whole or in part) in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.112(a)(1)-(2). An annuity is considered finally adjudicated 30 days after the date of the first regular monthly annuity payment. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2202.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to a redeposit made to augment the annuity of an individual who rejoins the federal workforce after earlier withdrawing retirement contributions, <span class="Italic">Lloyd v. OPM</span>, 19 MSPR 624, 625 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Once eligibility is established based on creditable service and age, the basis for computing the actual amount of an annuity in cases where employees have received a refund of retirement deductions is outlined at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(d). It requires a redeposit of refunds of retirement deductions before the service covered by the refund can be included in the computation of annuity benefits, and does not define creditable service for purposes of determining eligibility for an annuity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Wallen v. OPM</span>, DC-0841-15-0167-I-1 (NP 9/2/2016) (CSRS):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A former Federal employee may elect to receive a lump-sum refund of his previously paid retirement deductions. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(a). Upon receipt of that payment, the employee "voids all annuity rights...based on the service on which the lump-sum credit is based, until the employee...is reemployed in the service." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(d)(1), the loss of annuity rights may be cured by an employee's redeposit of the lump-sum payment with interest. <span class="Italic">Carreon</span>, 321 F.3d at 1130-31; <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 343, 346-47 (1991). In addition, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(d)(2)(B), as implemented by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.303(c)(1), allows certain employees, who are otherwise eligible to receive a nondisability annuity under CSRS, to receive credit for a period of refunded service without making the redeposit. In such a case, the employee will receive an annuity at a reduced rate. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(d)(2)(B); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.303(c)(2). This exception to the redeposit requirement is available only to: (1) employees "whose retirement is based on a separation occurring before October 28, 2009, and who [have] not completed payment of a redeposit for refunded deductions based on a period of service that ended before October 1, 1990...provided the nondisability annuity commences after December 1, 1990"; and (2) employees "whose retirement is based on a separation on or after October 28, 2009, and who [have] not completed payment of a redeposit for refunded deductions based on a period of service that ended before March 1, 1991." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.303(c)(1)(i)-(ii); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(d)(2)(A)(i); <span class="Italic">see also</span> National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (NDAA), Pub. L. No. 111-84, &#x00A7; 1902, 123 Stat. 2190, 2615&#8209;2616 (2009) (amending 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(d)(2)(A)(i) by replacing "October 1, 1990" with "March 1, 1991" effective October 28, 2009).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wallen</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, addressed waivers of restrictions limiting the ability to make a redeposit:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, an employee who receives a lump-sum refund of his previously paid retirement deductions voids his annuity rights. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(a). An employee who received a refund pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342 may, however, be allowed credit for his prior service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(d)(1) if, "[w]hile subsequently reemployed in a covered position," he redeposits the amount received, with interest. <span class="Italic">Carreon</span>, 321 F.3d at 1130-31; <span class="Italic">Sanchez</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. at 346-47. Here, the appellant could have, but did not, redeposit his withdrawn retirement contributions, with interest, while reemployed in a covered position, prior to his resignation on May 17, 2011. Because the appellant is no longer employed in a covered position, OPM cannot accept his request to redeposit the withdrawn funds or grant him a deferred annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(d)(1) (stating that an "employee," as defined by section 8331(1), who has received a refund of retirement deductions may deposit the amount received, with interest, in order to receive credit for the period of service covered by the refund). The appellant argues, however, that the deadline for making a redeposit, i.e., his last day of employment on May 17, 2011, should be waived.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge correctly explained below, the Board recognizes three bases for waiving a filing deadline prescribed by statute or regulation: (1) the statute or regulation expressly provides for a waiver under specified circumstances; (2) an agency's affirmative misconduct precludes enforcement of the deadline under the doctrine of equitable estoppel; and (3) an agency's failure to provide a notice of rights of the applicable filing deadline, where such notice is required by statute or regulation, warrants a waiver of the deadline. <span class="Italic">Perez Peraza v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 457, &#x00B6; 7 (2010). In the initial decision, the administrative judge found that the appellant had failed to establish any basis for waiver of the redeposit deadline. Specifically, he determined that the relevant statutes and regulations did not provide for a waiver under specified circumstances and that the appellant failed to allege that the agency had a statutory or regulatory obligation to provide him with notice pertaining to the redeposit deadline. Further, he determined that the appellant's allegations that PTO misinformed him regarding the redeposit requirement and, in 2010, improperly appointed him as a "career conditional, with no annuity rights" did not establish that the redeposit deadline should be waived under the doctrine of equitable estoppel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant has not challenged the administrative judge's finding that the first potential basis for waiver does not apply, and we discern no reason to disturb this finding. However, the appellant argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that bases (2) and (3) did not warrant waiver of the filing deadline for making a redeposit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To prevail on an equitable estoppel claim, the appellant must demonstrate by preponderant evidence that: (1) he reasonably relied on the information provided by the Government officials; and (2) the actions of the relevant government officials constituted "affirmative misconduct." <span class="Italic">Perez Peraza</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 457, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 14. The unintentional, negligent provision of misinformation, however, does not constitute affirmative misconduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Nunes v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 19 (2009). Here, the appellant argues on review, as he did below, that the deadline for making a redeposit of his refunded retirement deductions should be waived because he reasonably and detrimentally relied on misinformation provided by PTO. Specifically, the appellant argues that PTO provided him an employee handbook, which "undeniably states that a rehired employee who left service prior to March 1, 1991, would be paid an annuity regardless of whether [he] completed a redeposit." He further argues that "PTO must be assigned full knowledge of the contents of the handbook," and, therefore, "[i]t <span id="Page_4389"></span>speaks for itself that the PTO knew, or certainly should have known, the handbook was at a minimum incomplete and...inaccurate when applied to the Appellant's situation."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although PTO may have been negligent in providing the appellant a document containing incomplete or inaccurate information, we are not persuaded by the appellant's bare assertions that PTO officials knew or should have known that the information in the handbook was incorrect. Absent any, much less preponderant, evidence that PTO officials knowingly and intentionally misinformed the appellant, we discern no basis to disturb the administrative judge's finding that the appellant failed to establish that PTO officials engaged in affirmative misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Nunes</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 19 (stating that the unintentional provision of misinformation does not constitute affirmative misconduct).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further argues that he is entitled to a waiver on the basis of equitable estoppel because PTO "reinstated him in 2011 as a career conditional employee" rather than reinstating him as a former career employee with tenure status, in violation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.201(c)(4). He argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that this allegation was irrelevant to the estoppel issue because "[v]iolation of the law is always affirmative misconduct." Moreover, he argues, PTO's violation of section 315.201(c)(4) "affirmatively precluded him from receiving any benefit counseling."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.401, "an agency <span class="Italic">may</span> appoint by reinstatement to a competitive service position a person who previously was employed under career or career-conditional appointment (or equivalent)." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.401(a) (emphasis added). Such appointments are exempt from the 1-year probationary period if the individual previously satisfied that requirement. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.201(c)(4). Although it appears that the appellant may have been eligible for a reinstatement appointment under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.401, appointment under the section is permissive, rather than mandatory, and it does not appear from the evidence in the record that he was actually appointed under that legal authority. To the contrary, the letter confirming the appellant's appointment stated that he was required to complete a 1-year probationary period. Thus, we find no merit to the appellant's argument that PTO violated a regulation, and we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant has failed to establish any affirmative misconduct on the part of PTO as to warrant the application of equitable estoppel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the third potential basis for waiving a statutory or regulatory deadline, the appellant argues that PTO had an obligation to provide him with benefit counseling and notice of the redeposit deadline pursuant to the "OPM regulation" in the "CSRS Handbook," which sets forth an agency's responsibilities when an employee, who is not entitled to an immediate annuity, separates from service. Contrary to the appellant's contention, however, the guidelines set forth in OPM's CSRS and Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) Handbook are not regulations. <span class="Italic">See Roman v. Central Intelligence Agency</span>, 297 F.3d 1363, 1368-69 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (referring to OPM's CSRS and FERS Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices as "an internal handbook," which, unlike a regulation, was not "promulgated pursuant to statutory authority and following formal notice and comment proceedings"). Thus, PTO's failure to provide the appellant with notice of his rights and the applicable filing deadline pursuant to guidelines in the CSRS/FERS Handbook provides no basis for waiver of a statutory filing deadline.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to a claim for waiver of a redeposit, <span class="Italic">Harper v. OPM</span>, 116 MSPR 309, 312 &#x00B6; 7, 2011 MSPB 42 (2011) (CSRS), declared:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...It is well settled that an employee who received a refund pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342 may be allowed credit for prior service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(d) only if "[w]hile subsequently reemployed in a covered position" he redeposits the amount received, with interest. <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. 343, 346-47 (1991). There is no statutory or regulatory provision for waiver of the redeposit amount. The government cannot be estopped from denying monetary benefits, including those that would result from using unfunded service in its calculation of an annuity, not otherwise permitted by law. <span class="Italic">See Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond,</span> 496 U.S. 414, 425-34 (1990). The appellant thus has failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that she may be granted waiver of the redeposit amount and the administrative judge's failure to address the issue, if error, did not harm the appellant's substantive rights. <span class="Italic">Panter v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984) (an adjudicatory error that is not prejudicial to a party's substantive rights provides no basis for reversal of an initial decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to a claim for waiver of interest on a redeposit, under <span class="Italic">Rivers v. OPM</span>, AT-0845-14-0673-I-1 (NP 2/6/2015) (FERS):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge explained, the payment of interest on a redeposit is a statutory requirement, and there is no law, rule, or regulation that would allow OPM the discretion to waive the payment of interest. ID at 3 (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(d)(1)). The administrative judge also correctly rejected the appellant's argument that interest should be waived based on equitable considerations, noting that "the doctrine of equitable estoppel cannot be used to pay a retirement benefit from the Federal Treasury that is contrary to a statutory appropriation because the payment would violate the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution." ID at 3 (citing <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. 414, 416-17 (1990)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even with incorrect information from the employing agency, the agency is not responsible for paying the amount of a required redeposit. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Terwilliger v.

<p class="Body-Text">If an employee is subsequently reemployed under an indefinite appointment that OPM has excluded from CSRS coverage, the employee is ineligible to redeposit a prior refund. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sanchez v.

In an appeal involving a court order that determined that an appellant's service with an organization was entitled to retirement service credit and the appellant had earlier withdrawn her retirement contributions because her federal service credit did not then qualify for an annuity, appellant was permitted to make a redeposit, although no longer a federal employee, to qualify for an annuity. <span class="Italic">Dorry v.
