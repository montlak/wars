<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-4"><span class="space">1.</span> Use of Counsel; Licensure</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">"Always remember that when you go into an attorney's office door, you will have to pay for it, first or last." (Trollope, <span class="Italic">The Last Chronicle of Barset</span>). The solution? "The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers." (<span class="Italic">Henry VI</span>, IV, ii). The Bard's solution to the complexities of personnel problems has not yet been adopted by the Board. Rather, the Board operates through a staff (heavily populated by attorneys) and generally favors attorney representation, with the cost shifting that representation may entail. This does not mean that one must be an attorney to practice before the Board. Far from it--less than half the cases involve appellants' representation by lawyers. The majority of appellants appear before the Board bereft of counsel. Some of those are represented by family members, some by union officials. Lawyers do aid the process. Although bar membership is not synonymous with competent representation, one is told that it is "foolish" for "any lay person...in these United States...to engage in any transaction, important and novel to him or her, without having a skilled (and expensive) lawyer at his elbow." <span class="Italic">Gonce v. VA</span>, 872 F.2d 995, 1000 (Fed. Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of the complexities of personnel litigation, and the utility of representation by skilled counsel, <span class="Italic">Trowell v. USPS</span>, 2 MSPR 600, 602-03, 3 MSPB 117, 118-19 (1980), cautioned:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Representation of a party in an adverse action appeal before the Board requires familiarity with a complex body of statutes, regulations, and case law, in addition to knowledge of the Board's procedures and skill in the presentation of evidence and examination of witnesses....&#8197;Congress has...provided a much more judicial character for the Board's proceedings than was required for pre-Reform Act proceedings before the former Civil Service Commission. The appellant now has in all cases a statutory right to an evidentiary hearing, a transcript, and representation by counsel. 5 USC Section 7701(a). Extensive discovery rights akin to those of litigants in federal court are now available, and the Board is also now authorized to issue subpoenas for witnesses and documents. 5 USC Section 1205(b). Moreover, Congress has expressly placed upon agencies the burden of proving their cases before the Board. 5 USC Section 7701(c). In these circumstances, "the proper functioning of our adjudicative system, whether in court or in administrative proceedings, depends upon the sharp focus of factual and legal issues which takes place through the full participation of the parties in the adversarial process." <span class="Italic">In the Matter of Tariela</span>, 1 MSPB 116, 1 MSPR 119 (1979) (concurring opinion at 124). Competent representation of the parties in such adjudication is not only to their advantage, it also "serves the interests of justice by providing the adjudicative body with a more fully enlightened perspective from which to render its decision," thereby serving "the public interest in decreasing the likelihood that an adjudication may go askew through failure to consider important aspects of the case." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 123, 125, 1 MSPR at 127, 129.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This may not require agencies to be represented by counsel in proceedings before the Board, but surely it does not permit the assignment of totally unskilled, inexperienced, and unprepared agency representatives who are utterly lacking in familiarity with the essentials of presenting the agency's case before the Board. The consequence of such unqualified representation is all too foreseeable--an incompetent presentation of the case which makes reversal of the agency's decision virtually inevitable on the record established before the Board, and which thus has the effect of rendering the entire proceeding an unnecessary burden, if not a <span class="Italic">de facto</span> form of harassment, for the appellant. If an agency is not prepared to take a removal action seriously enough to present its case with at least a minimal degree of competence, then in the interest of justice to all concerned it should not initiate the action to begin with. The interest of justice does not warrant the imposition on appellants of the legal costs of such an unnecessary and unjustified burden.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tanner v. DOD</span>, DC-0752-12-0209-A-1 (NP 8/1/2014) ("[M]odern Board law, with its complex body of precedent and many areas of jurisdiction, presents enormously difficult legal and factual issues in a niche area that few attorneys are well-equipped to handle. Private attorneys who practice before the Board have every right to receive compensation at a reasonable market rate.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The statutory attorney fees provisions of the CSRA facilitate an appellant's access to counsel by alleviating his burden of bearing legal expenses as a result of an erroneous decision of an agency. <span class="Italic">Stephens v. OPM</span>, 33 MSPR <span id="Page_4529"></span>292, 295 (1987). Statutory fee shifting enhances the availability of counsel to employees. Because most recoveries of back pay are small in comparison to potential recoveries from commercial and major tort litigation, attorneys would not be generally available to handle them on any contingent fee basis reasonable to the employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Civil Serv. Comm'n</span>, 407 F. Supp. 380, 387 (D.D.C. 1975) (rev'd on other grounds, 554 F.2d 1186 (D.C. Cir. 1977)) ("But it is not only large, complicated cases such as this one which may call for an award of attorneys' fees and costs in order to effectuate the congressional policies. Even in the ordinary cases under &#x00A7; 7701, where an attorney may sometimes be needed, those policies would be emasculated by the narrow reading urged by the defendants. Since most recoveries of back pay are relatively small, attorneys would not be generally available to handle them on any contingent fee basis reasonable from the veterans' point of view. Likewise, those relatively small recoveries would make it impossible for the persons involved to undertake to pay those fees outright....").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Counsel admitted to practice law in a state may recover fees for time spent before Board offices in states other than where they are licensed. <span class="Italic">Augustine v. VA</span>, <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1045084.html">429 F.3d 1334</a> (Fed. Cir. 2005), recognized the national nature of Board practice:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Supreme Court and the courts of appeals have frequently invalidated state licensing requirements for federal employees and federal contractors. <span class="Italic">See Leslie Miller Inc.,</span> 352 U.S. at 190 (holding that the United States Air Force alone has the authority to determine the type of license that is required of its independent contractors); <span class="Italic">Johnson,</span> 254 U.S. at 57 (holding that a state could not require the driver of a United States Postal truck to obtain a state driver's license before performing his duties); <span class="Italic">United States v. Virginia,</span> 139 F.3d 984, 987-88 (4th Cir. 1998) (holding that the Virginia Criminal Justice Services Board could not require private investigators under contract with the FBI to obtain state private investigator licenses); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. United States,</span> 821 F.2d 1428, 1431-32 (9th Cir. 1987) (noting that California could not require an army hospital or its health care providers to be licensed under state law).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">So too state licensing requirements which purport to regulate private individuals who appear before a federal agency are invalid. In <span class="Italic">Sperry v. Florida,</span> 373 U.S. 379 (1963), the Florida Bar attempted to enjoin a non-attorney from performing services in the state relating to a patent prosecution occurring before the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO"). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 381. The Florida Bar argued that the non-attorney was engaged in the "unauthorized practice of law" because the Florida Bar had not licensed him. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 382. The Supreme Court held that a "State may not enforce licensing requirements which...give 'the State's licensing board a virtual power of review over the federal determination' that a person or agency is qualified and entitled to perform certain functions," and found that the state's licensing requirements could not govern practice before the PTO. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 385, 388 (quoting <span class="Italic">Leslie Miller, Inc.,</span> 352 U.S. at 190).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Just as the states cannot regulate practice before the PTO, they cannot regulate practice before the Merit Systems Protection Board. Allowing state control would plainly impede the conduct of federal proceedings even though the Board does not have procedures for admitting counsel to practice before it. The Board "is an independent Government agency that operates like a court." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1200.1 (2004). California has no authority to require that attorneys practicing before the Board obtain a state license or to regulate the award of fees for work before federal agencies. To the extent that the Board held otherwise, that decision cannot stand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We turn now to the second question--whether federal law incorporates state law. This in turn requires consideration of two subsidiary questions: whether federal law incorporates state law as to the right to practice before the Board; and whether federal law incorporates state law as to who is entitled to fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although a state cannot regulate the licensing requirements of attorneys before the Board, federal law may adopt or incorporate state law standards as its own. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NLRB v. Natural Gas Util. Dist. of Hawkins County</span>, 402 U.S. 600, 603 (1971) ("There are, of course, instances in which the application of certain federal statutes may depend on state law.") (quoting <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Randolph Elec. Membership Corp.,</span> 343 F.2d 60, 62 (4th Cir. 1965)). But incorporation "is controlled by the will of Congress. In the absence of a plain indication to the contrary...it is to be assumed when Congress enacts a statute that it does not intend to make its application dependent on state law." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The relevant statute regarding appeals to the Board states that: "An appellant [before the Board] shall have the right...to be represented by an attorney or other representative." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(2) (2000). The regulation states that "[a] party may choose any representative as long as that person is willing and available to serve." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.31(b) (2004). Here, neither the statute nor the regulation imposes a requirement that an attorney appearing before the Board be licensed in the state in which the services are rendered. Thus, we must assume that neither Congress nor the Board had intended to incorporate state law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Quite apart from the statutory and regulatory silence, it seems to us clear that federal law here does not incorporate state-law rules governing the unauthorized practice of law. Congress has addressed the role of state law most directly in connection with the application of state-law rules to government attorneys. In 1998, Congress, concerned that government attorneys should abide by state ethics standards, enacted 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 530B, which provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An attorney for the Government shall be subject to State laws and rules, and local Federal court rules, governing attorneys in each State where such attorney engages in that attorney's duties, to the same extent and in the same manner as other attorneys in that State.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 530B(a) (2000). But nothing in section 530B suggests that government attorneys must abide by state licensing requirements. To the contrary, 28 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 77.2 (which is referred to by section 530B(c) for the definition of "attorney for the Government") explicitly rejects the proposition that government attorneys must comply with state licensing requirements. The regulation states that the "phrase state laws and rules and local federal court rules governing attorneys...does not include...[a] statute, rule, or regulation requiring licensure or membership in a particular state bar." 28 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 77.2(h) (2004). Thus, while government attorneys must abide by the ethical codes of conduct of each state in which they perform their services, they do not have to be licensed by those states to practice law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Collins v. Department of Justice,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 62 (2003), the Board held that private attorneys appearing before it will also be expected to conform to applicable state rules governing attorney conduct but did not suggest that they must abide by state licensing requirements. The issue in <span class="Italic">Collins</span> was whether a particular attorney should be disqualified to serve as a representative under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.31(b). Although the regulation allows a party to choose "any representative as long as that person is willing representative had previously established an attorney-client relationship with a witness opposing Collins and therefore had a potential conflict of interest. <span class="Italic">Collins,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. at 63-64. The Board reasoned that private attorneys should follow the same state ethics rules as government attorneys, referring to section 530B. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 68-69....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It would indeed adversely affect proceedings before federal administrative agencies if state licensing rules were applied, since the pool of available attorney representatives would be severely impaired. In addition to finding an attorney who is accessible and familiar with Board practice, the private party would also have to find an attorney who is licensed in the state in which services are to be rendered. In a similar situation, the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Sperry,</span> while not directly addressing the incorporation issue, concluded that applying state licensing requirements to practitioners appearing before the PTO would have a "disruptive effect," given that one-quarter of the attorney practitioners before the PTO would have been disqualified because they were not licensed in the state in which they were practicing. 373 U.S. at 401. Moreover, the various state bar rules governing unauthorized practice are not uniform. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> ABA Section of Legal Educ. and Admissions to the Bar &#x0026; Nat'l Conference of Bar Examiners, Comprehensive Guide to Bar Admissions Requirements (2005). To require the federal agency and those practicing before it to determine in every case whether a representative was authorized to perform particular services within the state as an attorney would burden both the bar and the agencies themselves. We thus conclude that the federal statute here does not incorporate state law and that an attorney licensed in any state or federal jurisdiction is authorized to practice as an attorney before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government nonetheless argues that even if petitioner's counsel could properly practice before the Board as an attorney, his entitlement to fees is determined by state law, and that no federal interest is undermined in determining fees in accordance with state law. As with the first issue regarding the right to practice before the Board, there is nothing in the text of the fee-shifting statute to suggest incorporation of state law. Here, the fee-shifting provision of the VEOA states: "A preference eligible who prevails in an action under section 3330a or 3330b shall be awarded reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(b) (2000). The Board's regulation governing attorney's fees merely states that the fee application must show why the applicant is "entitled to an award under the applicable statutory standard," and must show "an established attorney-client relationship." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.203 (2004). Given the statutory and regulatory silence, the presumption here again is that federal law does not incorporate state standards. There is also no legislative history suggesting an intent to incorporate state law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a similar fee-shifting statute, we have given the term "attorney" its ordinary meaning. In <span class="Italic">Cook v. Brown,</span> 68 F.3d 447 (Fed. Cir. 1995), we determined that where the Equal Access to Justice Act did not define "attorney" for fee purposes, the ordinary meaning of the term prevailed. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 451 (citing Black's Law Dictionary, which defines "attorney at law" as <span id="Page_4530"></span>a "[p]erson admitted to practice law in his respective state and authorized to perform both civil and criminal legal functions for clients"). We then noted that "[t]he EAJA gives no indication that it intends 'attorney' to be defined other than as 'attorney at law,' i.e., someone formally trained and licensed in the general practice of law."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are also not aware of any suggestion in the myriad of Supreme Court cases concerning attorney's fees statutes that state law limits fee awards under federal law. In fact, it is quite clear that denying fees to attorneys authorized to practice before federal agencies would severely undermine the congressional purpose.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The federal fee-shifting statutes recognize that awarding compensation to the prevailing party plays an important role in allowing clients to secure counsel in the first place.[5] The Supreme Court has, on numerous occasions, explained that the "fundamental aim of [fee-shifting] statutes is to make it possible for those who cannot pay a lawyer for his time and effort to obtain competent counsel, this by providing lawyers with reasonable fees to be paid by the losing defendants." <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">It seems to us axiomatic that the denial of fees to attorneys practicing before federal agencies would discourage such representation by attorneys. To allow attorneys to practice before federal agencies, while barring them from collecting fees under the attorney's fees statute, would, as a practical matter, bar such private representation entirely in many cases and limit representation to the few attorneys willing to serve without compensation. Under the government's theory it might even be impermissible for the attorney to receive compensation out of the client's own monetary recovery. A restrictive reading of the term "attorney" in the fee-shifting statute would thus naturally limit the opportunities that veterans would have in obtaining counsel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, the purposes of the fee-shifting statute can be served only by allowing fees for representatives who are licensed as attorneys in any state or federal jurisdiction, without regard to the state licensing requirements of the state in which services were rendered.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that attorney fees cannot be awarded against the federal government unless specifically authorized by a statutory waiver of sovereign immunity. <span class="Italic">Saldana v.

Such statutory authorization must be express and specific; it cannot be extended beyond the statute's literal terms and it cannot be implied. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant relies on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) as the statutory authority for an award of attorney fees. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), the Board may require payment by the agency of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee if the employee is the prevailing party and the Board determines that payment is warranted in the interest of justice. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Driscoll v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 7 (2011). Attorney fees are incurred where an attorney-client relationship exists and counsel has rendered legal services on behalf of the appellant in an appeal before the Board. <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Department of the Army</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 26, 27 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.203(a). The appellant bears the burden of establishing his entitlement to an award of attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See Parker v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 688, 691 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7701(a)(2) of Title 5 provides, in relevant part, that an appellant shall have the right to be represented by an attorney or other representative. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.31(b). The dispositive issue before the Board on review is whether Zvenia appeared before the Board as the appellant's attorney, or whether he did so as the appellant's non-attorney representative. The Board has long held that an attorney-client relationship does not exist between an appellant and his non-attorney representative. <span class="Italic">Vitanza v.

Therefore, only if the appellant's representative was appearing as an attorney would the appellant have incurred attorney fees under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither Title 5 nor the Board's regulations expressly define the term "attorney." The ordinary meaning of the term "attorney" in fee-shifting statutes is someone licensed by the government to practice law generally. <span class="Italic">Cook v. Brown</span>, 68 F.3d 447, 451 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (interpreting the Equal Access to Justice Act). As the administrative judge recognized, whether an individual is licensed to practice as an attorney at law before the Board is governed by federal law. <span class="Italic">[S]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">ee Augustine v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 429 F.3d 1334, 1340-41 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Thus, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 500(b), an "individual who is a member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of a State" may provide legal representation before any federal agency, including the Board. "State," as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 500(a)(2), means "a State, a territory or possession of the United States including a Commonwealth, or the District of Columbia." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 500(a)(2). It is undisputed that Zvenia is not a member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia. Therefore, Zvenia could practice as an attorney at law before the Board and incur attorney fees within the meaning of section 7701(g)(1) only if one or more of the tribes in whose court Zvenia is authorized to practice qualifies as "a territory or possession of the United States."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Courts that have considered the status of tribal courts for purposes of attorney admissions and practice have found that tribes are not territories or possessions of the United States. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that an attorney's license to practice before the High Court of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands did not entitle him to admission to practice before the Ninth Circuit because the Trust Territory is not a "Territory or Insular Possession of the United States." <span class="Italic">In re Rothstein</span>, 884 F.2d 490, 491 (9th Cir. 1989). In addition, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, interpreting language almost identical to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 500, has held that a tribe does not qualify as a "territory of the United States" for purposes of admission to the bar of that court. <span class="Italic">In re Application for Admission of Gere Unger</span>, 16 Vet.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, and absent any indication in the legislative history or elsewhere to the contrary, we agree with the administrative judge that Zvenia's tribal court admissions do not constitute admission to the highest court of a territory or possession of the United States. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 500; <span class="Italic">see generally</span> H.R. Rep. No. 89-1141 (1965), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4170, 4171. The authority on which the appellant primarily relies--a Department of Labor regulation governing practice before the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board (ECAB)--is inapposite. <span class="Italic">See</span> AFF, Tab 1 at 3-5, 8, Tab 6 at 4-5, 9. That regulation allows a claimant to be represented before the ECAB by "any individual or an attorney who has been admitted to practice and who is in good standing with any court of competent jurisdiction." 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 501.1(h). The issue in this case, however, is not whether Zvenia may appear as a "representative" before the Board, it is whether he appeared as an attorney-representative and the appellant incurred attorney fees under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). There is no clear indication, however, that in enacting section 7701(g)(1), Congress intended to cover fee awards for members of tribal courts practicing before the Board. In the absence of an express and specific statutory authorization, the Board cannot extend the statutory waiver of sovereign immunity in section 7701(g)(1) beyond its literal terms, and such a waiver cannot be implied. <span class="Italic">Saldana</span>, 766 F.2d at 516.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant's representative is not licensed to practice law in the "highest court of a State, territory or possession of the United States, including a Commonwealth, or the District of Columbia," we agree with the administrative judge that he is ineligible to practice before the Board <span id="Page_4531"></span>as an attorney-representative. Therefore, the appellant is ineligible to receive attorney fees for his representative's services. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Metsopulos v.

<p class="Body-Text">Along with the statutory right to a hearing before an AJ who is an attorney and the right to discovery, the counsel fee provision is among the most significant and salutary of the advances in civil service law following passage of the Reform Act. The Board initially resisted fee awards, yet direction from the Federal Circuit guided the Board to better implement the compensatory purposes of the Reform Act fee provisions so that fee awards are fairly common, but not assured, for the relatively few appellants who prevail in Board litigation. As in other aspects of Board adjudication, the Board's decisions on fees receive considerable deference from the Federal Circuit, its reviewing court. The award of attorney fees is a fact-specific, equitable determination committed to the sound discretion of the Board, whose decision will not be disturbed unless a clear abuse of discretion is shown--for example, if its decision is premised on factual findings unsupported by substantial evidence or on a material misstatement of the applicable law. <span class="Italic">Ubogy v.
