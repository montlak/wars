<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-119"><span class="space">2.</span> Privacy Act</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Privacy Act, 5 USC 552a, is concerned with the collection, use, maintenance, and dissemination of information maintained on individuals by government agencies. The Act has broad application to federal employees and to other individuals as to whom the federal establishment maintains records. The civil remedy provisions of the Privacy Act do not apply against private individuals, private entities, state agencies, or state and local officials. <span class="Italic">Dittman v. California</span>, 191 F.3d 1020, 1026 (9th Cir. 1999). OPM regulations at 5 CFR 293.101-103 (2022) call for accurate personnel records, but the regulations are not directly enforced by MSPB. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Normoyle v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 65 MSPR 80, 83 (1994) ("The proper forum for making allegations of Privacy Act and FOIA violations is the federal district court after the exhaustion of administrative remedies."); <span class="Italic">Salazar v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 60 MSPR 633, 639-40 (1994) ("Although this regulation suggests that it is the general policy of the Federal government that agencies should maintain accurate personnel records, it does not itself set forth any standards of accuracy, nor has appellant Salazaar shown that the regulation provides for any penalty or remedy against the agency for its alleged failure to meet the demands of this policy. Thus, assuming for purposes of argument that the agency in this appeal previously failed to maintain accurate personnel records...he has not shown that such a failure is actionable before the Board in these RIF appeals."). The Privacy Act may create a remedy for individuals who are harmed in their occupations by inaccurate reports on their work with the government. If the remedy under the Privacy Act is available, the existence of that remedy may preclude a <span class="Italic">Bivens-</span>style lawsuit against government officials. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Downie v. City of Middleburg Heights</span>, 301 F.3d 688, 697 (6th Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the D.C. Circuit, the Privacy Act may be available to obtain relief for personnel actions not otherwise within the scope of the Reform Act if improper government records or improper means of acquiring information for the basis for the personnel actions complained of. <span class="Italic">Doe v. Goss</span>, 2007 WL 106523, 2007 U.S. DIST. LEXIS 2708 (D.D.C. No. 04-2122 Jan. 12, 2007), held as to a termination claim (concerning a CIA employee who had no protection under the Reform Act) and as to a claim concerning lack of promotion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In Count II, Plaintiff alleges Defendants violated the Privacy Act, which "regulates the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of information concerning individuals." <span class="Italic">Cardamone v. Cohen,</span> 241 F.3d 520, 524 (6th Cir. 2001). Plaintiff argues that during the CIA's investigation of his alleged sexual affair and diversion of funds, the agency willfully and intentionally created and relied upon inaccurate records in violation of the Privacy Act and that these violations resulted in irreparable damage to his career. He claims that these records caused him injury, including his termination and "adverse determinations about the rights, benefits and privileges of Plaintiff under Federal Programs." 2AC &#x00B6; 46.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, Plaintiff alleges violation of two provisions of the Privacy Act. First, he alleges that Defendant CIA "willfully and intentionally failed to maintain accurate, timely and complete records" about him in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(e)(5) ("Accuracy claim"). 2AC &#x00B6; 44. As a result of this violation, Plaintiff alleges that he suffered the following adverse determinations: he was placed on administrative leave, barred from entering CIA facilities or engaging in any further operations on behalf of the CIA, denied his "previously approved promotion to GS-15" and the CIA Medal of Intelligence, terminated from his employment, and denied the process to which he would have been entitled as a GS staff employee to contest his termination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, he alleges that Defendant CIA violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(e)(2) by "willfully and intentionally fail[ing] to the greatest extent practicable to collect directly from Plaintiff information that would have refuted the allegations against him" ("Information-Gathering claim"). 2AC &#x00B6; 46. Plaintiff alleges that this violation "resulted in adverse determinations about [his] rights, benefits and privileges...under Federal Programs...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> For each of these violations, he seeks actual damages and all relief to which he is entitled under the Privacy Act. 2AC &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 48-49.[14]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[14]&#x2003;In his Opposition, Plaintiff contends for the first time that he has "an equitable right to challenge the offending records" and seek expungement. To the extent Plaintiff is asserting this "equitable right" as a constitutional claim rather than as a statutory claim, the case law is clear that "when a constitutional claim is intertwined with a statutory one, and Congress has provided machinery for the resolution of the latter, a plaintiff must first pursue the administrative machinery." <span class="Italic">Steadman v. Governor, United States Soldiers' &#x0026; Airmen's Home,</span> 287 U.S. App. D.C. 23, 918 F.2d 963, 967 (D.C. Cir. 1990). He has not done so here. As Defendants correctly point out, Plaintiff has failed to plead that he sought expungement pursuant to the amendment provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(d)(2) &#x0026; (3) administratively before seeking judicial review. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(d); <span class="Italic">Dickson v. Office of Personnel Mgt.,</span> 264 U.S. App. D.C. 182, 828 F.2d 32, 40-41 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Accordingly, he has failed to plead exhaustion of his administrative remedies as to this claim. Plaintiff cannot circumvent the exhaustion requirement by styling his "equitable right" as a constitutional claim where, as here, Congress has provided administrative machinery for the resolution of the statutory claim. Because he has not alleged exhaustion of available administrative remedies, this Court has no authority to consider Plaintiff's alleged equitable right to challenge the records.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5340"></span>In assessing whether the CSRA precludes these claims, the determinative question is whether they fall within its purview. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., National Treasury Employees Union v. Devine,</span> 577 F. Supp. 738, 745 (D.D.C. 1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 236 U.S. App. D.C. 22, 733 F.2d 114 (D.C. Cir. 1984). As discussed above, this statutory framework covers "personnel actions," including promotions, benefits and awards, as well as adverse actions, including terminations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(ii) &#x0026; (ix), 7512(1). Where a plaintiff's Privacy Act claim in substance seeks judicial review of such a federal personnel action, as Defendants argue here, the CSRA precludes that claim regardless of how Plaintiff seeks to characterize it. <span class="Italic">See Kleiman v. Dep't. of Energy,</span> 294 U.S. App. D.C. 49, 956 F.2d 335, 338 (D.C. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiff argues that his Privacy Act claims are outside the CSRA scheme and therefore not precluded by it. He contends that these claims do not arise out of one of the prohibited personnel actions specifically enumerated by the CSRA, but rather arise out of the recording of inaccurate information during the course of the two "sham investigations" that discredited him. Moreover, Plaintiff argues that because his injuries were actually caused by this inaccurate information, his claims are not precluded by the CSRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A Privacy Act claim survives CSRA preclusion in this jurisdiction if a plaintiff shows the harm alleged was <span class="Italic">actually caused</span> by the alleged violation. In <span class="Italic">Hubbard v. EPA,</span> 257 U.S. App. D.C. 305, 809 F.2d 1, 5 (D.C. Cir. 1986) <span class="Italic">aff'd in part on other grounds sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">Spagnola v. Mathis,</span> 859 F.2d 223 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), our Court of Appeals explained that while the CSRA preempts judicial review of prohibited personnel actions, the District Courts retain jurisdiction to award damages "for an adverse personnel action actually caused by an inaccurate or incomplete record." <span class="Italic">See also, Kleiman,</span> 956 F.2d at 339 n.5 (reaffirming <span class="Italic">Hubbard</span>'s statement that "the Privacy Act permits a federal job applicant to recover damages for an adverse personnel action actually caused by an inaccurate or incomplete record"). The question before this Court, then, is whether Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that the adverse actions were caused by the inaccurate records.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In their argument on the merits, Defendants contend that Plaintiff has not properly alleged causation in either his Accuracy or Information-Gathering claims. Rather, they argue he has specifically alleged that his termination was in retaliation for his failure to falsify his intelligence reporting. Accordingly, Defendants argue, the two investigations that are the subject of Plaintiff's Privacy Act claims cannot also be the cause of his termination for purposes of the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to his Accuracy claim, Plaintiff counters that the announced basis for his termination was the false information contained in the identified files. He contends that the CIA initiated two investigations, and that the inaccurate information recorded during those investigations proximately caused the CIA to order his termination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that Plaintiff also claims that the investigations themselves were pretextual does not preclude his causation argument. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(e)(2), a plaintiff may plead inconsistent facts in support of alternative theories of recovery. At this stage in the proceedings, Plaintiff may argue that the investigations were a pretext used to terminate him for refusing to falsify his reports and at the same time argue that the investigations actually caused his termination. Discovery may show that Plaintiff was, in fact, terminated due to the allegedly false information in his records collected as part of the CI and OIG investigations.[15]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[15]&#x2003;There is no dispute that the OIG investigation was concluded with no finding of wrongdoing on Plaintiff's behalf, that the CIA sought information from Plaintiff in July 2004, or that the investigation did not conclude until April 2005, after Plaintiff's termination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2AC &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 30, 36; Defs.' Reply at 5. This timing does not necessitate a finding against causation, however. The extent to which various pieces of information collected during the course of the investigation itself affected the adverse actions in this case is an issue of fact that cannot be resolved at this stage.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, in <span class="Italic">Krieger v. Fadely,</span> 341 U.S. App. D.C. 163, 211 F.3d 134, 136 (D.C. Cir. 2000), the Court of Appeals recognized that at the initial pleading stage, very little is required to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. That principle is particularly relevant here where Plaintiff does not even know the precise contents of his records because they are classified and he has no access to them. Thus, his allegation is plausible that these records contain derogatory information that formed the pretext for his termination. For example, he knows that the CIA initiated two investigations and he knows he was subsequently fired. It is not unreasonable to conclude, as Plaintiff has alleged, that information recorded in his files as a result of the investigations was the cause of his termination. Reading the Complaint in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, he has alleged actual causation in his Accuracy claim. Accordingly, that claim is not precluded by the CSRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to his Information-Gathering claim, Plaintiff has alleged that Defendants' failure to seek information from him in the course of the CI investigation, and the failure to seek information at an earlier point in the OIG investigation, proximately caused adverse determinations about his rights and benefits under federal programs. It is true that Plaintiff does not provide much detail regarding the determinations about his rights and benefits or about the role of the CI and OIG investigation reports in those determinations. However, "complaints 'need not plead law or match facts to every element of a legal theory.'" <span class="Italic">Krieger,</span> 211 F.3d at 136 (internal citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the Court at this early stage must give Plaintiff "the benefit of all inferences that plausibly can be drawn from well-pleaded allegations of the complaint," <span class="Italic">Haynesworth,</span> 820 F.2d at 1254. It is certainly plausible to infer from Plaintiff's allegations that, had Defendants consulted with him regarding the CI investigation, the allegedly false information would not have been recorded in Plaintiff's files. Similarly, the Court may plausibly infer that, had Defendants consulted with Plaintiff at an earlier point in the OIG investigation, certain false or inaccurate information would not have been recorded in Plaintiff's files.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Plaintiff has alleged that Defendants Privacy Act violation actually caused his injury, the Information-Gathering claim is not precluded by the CSRA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Doe v. FDIC</span>, 545 Fed. Appx. 6 (2d Cir. 2013) (suggesting that remedial provisions of the Reform Act involving whistleblower claims preempted jurisdiction under the Privacy Act to remedy a negative performance evaluation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Privacy Act is a complex piece of legislation. The standard for measuring some violations of the Act, intentional or willful disclosures violating the Act, is subject to debate and interpretation. <span class="Italic">See Beaven v. DOJ</span>, 622 F.3d 540 (6th Cir. 2010). The cases mentioned in this discussion are but a few among hundreds of federal court decisions. Research must be undertaken in any Privacy Act analysis.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On a related theme, the Court of Federal Claims lacks jurisdiction over a FOIA claim; FOIA does not mandate money damages. <span class="Italic">Clark v. United States</span>, 116 Fed. Appx. 278 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Frazier v. United States</span> (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP No. 2017-1326) ("The COFC does not have jurisdiction over claimed violations of the Privacy Act or FOIA because those statutes do not contain money-mandating provisions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Snowton v. United States</span>, 216 Fed. Appx. 981, 983 (2007)."). The MSPB is not the proper forum for resolution of FOIA claims. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Castro v. DHS,</span> AT-3330-11-0493-I-1 (NP 2/28/2012) ("Although the appellant uses the word 'discover' in his petition, there is no evidence that he attempted to use the Board's discovery procedures, of which he was informed, to obtain the evidence that he seeks. Rather, it appears that he sought the evidence through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request submitted to the agency. His request on petition for review appears to be that the Board order the agency to respond to his FOIA request. The Board, however, is not authorized to consider such requests. <span class="Italic">See Normoyle v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. 80, 83 (1994).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although remedies under the Privacy Act are not precluded by the CSRA, if the challenge is to a negative notation on an SF-50 recording an employee's resignation pending a personnel investigation, 5 USC 3322 provides a (seldom-used) MSPB appeal right, and that right precludes use of the Privacy Act or Tort Claims Act to challenge the SF-50's contents. <span class="Italic">Manivannan v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 42 F.4th 163, 172 n.3 (3rd Cir. 2022), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Though not pressed in his briefing, Manivannan also brought claims of alleged inaccuracies in the Form 50 documenting his separation from the DOE. He aired this challenge in his whistleblower retaliation action before the Protection Board, which noted that the changes to his Form 50 were outside the scope of those proceedings but could be addressed under a different CSRA provision, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3322. <span class="Italic">See Manivannan</span>, 2020 WL 1130149, at n.3. We agree. Section 3322 concerns an employee's voluntary resignation from government employment prior to the resolution of a personnel investigation and entitles the employee to appeal to the Board the accuracy of any adverse findings noted in his or her official personnel record file. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3322(a), (c). Having had access to that procedure, Manivannan cannot now use the Privacy and Tort Claims Acts to attack the contents of his Form 50 in federal court.</p>
