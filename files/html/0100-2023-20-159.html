<p class="Body-Text">Analysis of jurisdictional issues involving constructive adverse actions, never simple, is downright complex when intersected with IRA jurisdiction. "With respect to an otherwise appealable matter, such as an alleged involuntary resignation, an appellant may either file a Board appeal directly or file a Board appeal after exhausting the OSC process." <span class="Italic">Chakravorty v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 90 MSPR 304, 311 &#x00B6; 17 (2001) ("If the employee seeks corrective action from OSC, the time limit for appealing the otherwise appealable action is governed by the time limit for filing a timely IRA appeal."); <span class="Italic">Schaeffer v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 86 MSPR 606, 618 &#x00B6; 18 (2000) ("An involuntary retirement, which is tantamount to a removal, is an 'otherwise appealable action,' and as such, need not satisfy the jurisdictional requirements for an IRA appeal.") (<span class="Italic">Schaeffer</span> overruled as to the determination that an IRA appeal would cover an alleged involuntary retirement, since the involuntary retirement is an appealable constructive action, <span class="Italic">Covarrubias v. SSA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/COVARRUBIAS_JOANNA_SF_1221_09_0133_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_500317.pdf">113 MSPR 583</a>, 587 n.2, 2010 MSPB 90 (2010), <span class="Italic">Covarrubias in turn overruled by Colbert v. VA</span>, 121 MSPR 677, 684 n.5, 2014 MSPB 80 (2014)); <span class="Italic">Roach v. Dept. of Army</span>, 82 MSPR 464, 469-70 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (1999) (AJ erred by dismissing the claim of an involuntary resignation based on a whistleblowing reprisal for a lack of prior exhaustion with OSC; a constructive adverse action was an otherwise appealable action); <span class="Italic">Holloway v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 82 MSPR 435, 442-43 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-21 (1999) (appellant did not raise the alleged involuntary retirement with OSC; the appeal was otherwise untimely); <span class="Italic">Marshall v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 81 MSPR 305, 312-13 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15 (1999) (allegedly forced retirement was an otherwise appealable action; OSC exhaustion was not necessary). A forced resignation may be one of several personnel actions alleged to be retaliatory in an IRA case. If the Board concludes that there was whistleblower reprisal, but not a forced resignation, remedies may then be restricted to provable damages and counsel fees. <span class="Italic">E.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Ingram-Jones v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/nonprecedential/INGRAM_JONES_TRINITY_LYNN_AT_1221_14_0633_W_2_FINAL_ORDER_2005204.pdf">AT-1221-14-0633-W-2</a> (NP 2/23/2023). [Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-012.html#sec6-13">Constructive Adverse Action</a>" concerning allegations that whistleblowing reprisal led to forced resignations, retirements, or downgradings.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As in otherwise appealable actions, a resignation is actionable in an IRA appeal only if the appellant shows that it was involuntary. <span class="Italic">Lawley v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 84 MSPR 253, 257 &#x00B6; 8 (1999); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Kelly v. MSPB</span>, 566 Fed. Appx. 997, 1000 (Fed.

Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 290 F.3d 1356, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 97 F.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Allegations of reprisal for whistleblowing, when made in an IRA appeal in support of an assertion that an agency coerced an appellant's resignation or retirement, should be considered for the limited purpose of determining whether they support a finding of coercion. <span class="Italic">Heining v. General Services Administration</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 539, 551 (1994); <span class="Italic">Burke v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 434, 439 (1992). If the administrative judge determines on remand that the agency failed to meet its burden by clear and convincing evidence regarding the proposed removal, and that the proposed removal was therefore retaliatory, he then should reconsider the voluntariness of the appellant's retirement in light of that finding. <span class="Italic">See Diefenderfer v. Department of Transportation</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 651, &#x00B6; 37 (2008) (remanding an IRA appeal for further consideration of an alleged involuntary resignation when that claim was intertwined with other claims that were being remanded).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant complains of but does not prove that a resignation resulted from whistleblowing reprisal in the course of an IRA appeal, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appeal because "a voluntary resignation is not a personnel action." <span class="Italic">Shelly v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 75 MSPR 411, 413-14 (1997). What the Board appeared to resolve in <span class="Italic">Shelly</span> was that because Board jurisdiction in constructive adverse actions is tied to proof that the action is truly adverse, the Board does have jurisdiction under the WPA with proof that the constructive action was caused by whistleblowing reprisal. The Board's earlier decisions bear out that jurisdictional result. <span class="Italic">Zygmunt v. DHHS</span>, 61 MSPR 379, 381-84 (1994), determined that the WPA may encompass both threats leading to resignations as well as a remedy for the resignation caused by the threat:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged the following in her petition for appeal. In March of 1991, the appellant complained to agency officials that her curriculum vitae (CV) had been sent to private firms without her permission. The agency initiated an investigation. On or about May 30, 1991, the appellant's first-line supervisor, Donna Freeman, M.D., admitted that she had released the CV, and apologized to the appellant. Agency officials concluded that Dr. Freeman had violated the Privacy Act, and reprimanded her. On June 14, 1991, the appellant's second-line supervisor, Diane Murphy, M.D., told her that she had "failed in performance and had to resign or be fired." The appellant submitted her resignation on or about June 18, 1991, shortly before the end of her probationary period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With exceptions not relevant here, it is a prohibited personnel practice to "threaten to take" a "personnel action" because of an employee's disclosure of information that he or she reasonably believes evidences a violation of law. 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A)(i). Termination of a probationary employee is a "personnel action" for purposes of 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(a). <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Department of the Army</span>, 58 MSPR 325, 331 n.4 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's claim that she was "terminat[ed] as retaliation [for] whistle-blowing," interpreted in light of her factual allegations, is a claim that the agency threatened to terminate her during her probationary period because of her disclosure of Dr. Freeman's violation of law. The appellant's allegations, if proven, would permit a finding that the agency committed whistleblower reprisal, a prohibited personnel practice actionable under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(a). The administrative judge erred, therefore, in dismissing the appeal without a hearing. Accordingly, the appeal must be remanded for a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge stated that the appellant failed to show, or even allege, that the agency did not have reasonable grounds for terminating her. While a non-frivolous allegation that an agency lacked reasonable grounds to threaten removal entitles an appellant to a hearing in an alleged involuntary resignation appeal brought under 5 USC Chapter 75, <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Schultz v. U.S. Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987), this is not such an appeal. In short, whether the appellant's resignation could be considered involuntary under Chapter 75 involuntary resignation case law has no bearing on whether the agency committed whistleblower reprisal actionable under the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board is empowered to "order such corrective action as [it] considers appropriate" in an IRA appeal. 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1). As noted above, the appellant alleges that she resigned approximately four days after the agency threatened to terminate her. As corrective action, she seeks reinstatement and back pay. Such a remedy goes well beyond mere abatement of the threat; if she made a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing that the threat to terminate her was a prohibited personnel practice, and nothing more, we could not conclude that reinstatement and back pay is appropriate corrective action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under well-established doctrine interpreting Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other laws proscribing discrimination in employment, an individual who resigned from his or her job in the face of allegedly unlawful discrimination, and who seeks reinstatement and back pay, must show that he or she was "constructively discharged." In order to establish that he or she has suffered a constructive discharge, an employee must show that the working conditions were "so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in the employee's shoes would have felt compelled to resign." <span class="Italic">Aviles-Martinez v.

Cases 1887, 1892 (Nov. 28, 1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We adopt a similar approach here. The appellant is not entitled to reinstatement and back pay as corrective action, even if she makes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing that the threat to terminate her was a prohibited personnel practice, unless she can also show that a reasonable person in her shoes would have resigned in the face of the threat.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the appellant must show that she resigned because of the threat, and not for some other reason. Reinstatement and back pay would not be appropriate corrective action if, for example, before the agency threatened to terminate the appellant, she had made plans to submit her resignation prior to the expiration of her probationary period. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> EEOC Dec. No. 84-1, 33 F.E.P. Cases 1887, 1892 (Nov. 28, 1983) (to demonstrate that there has been a constructive discharge, the former employee must show, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that his or her resignation "resulted from" the discriminatory working conditions).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In other words, the appellant's resignation will be evaluated under both an objective and a subjective standard. It must have been reasonable under the circumstances, and it must actually have been the result of the threatened termination. <span class="Italic">Cf. Harris v. Forklift</span> <span class="Italic">Systems</span>, __ U.S. __, 114 S. Ct. 367, 370-71, 126 L. Ed.2d 295 (1993) (in a hostile environment sexual harassment claim under Title VII, an employee must show that a reasonable person would find the working environment hostile or abusive, and that the employee himself or herself actually perceived the environment to be hostile).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Some courts also require a former employee to show, in a constructive discharge action, that the employer intended to force the employee to quit. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Clay Printing</span>, 955 F.2d 936, 944 (4th Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Hervey v. City of</span> <span class="Italic">Little Rock</span>, 787 F.2d 1223, 1231 (8th Cir. 1986). Other courts expressly reject such an approach, and hold that the employer's intentions are irrelevant. <span class="Italic">Boze v. Branstetter</span>, 912 F.2d 801, 804 (5th Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Watson v. Nationwide Insurance</span>, 823 F.2d 360, 361 (9th Cir. 1987). We find the latter authorities more persuasive. An employer "must be held to have intended those consequences [of its actions] it could reasonably have foreseen." <span class="Italic">Clark v. Marsh</span>, 665 F.2d 1168, 1175 n.8 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (citation omitted). The appellant in the present appeal, therefore, need not show that the agency, when it threatened to terminate her, intended to exact her resignation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we rely on constructive discharge doctrine only by analogy, and only as support for our formulation of standards for determining what appropriate corrective action would be where, as here, the remedy sought in an IRA appeal goes beyond mere cure, abatement, or cancellation of an action that constituted a prohibited personnel practice. The central inquiry in this appeal is whether the agency's threat to terminate the appellant constituted reprisal for whistleblowing, not whether the agency constructively discharged her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, if the appellant shows that her whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the agency's threat to terminate her, and if she shows that reinstatement and back pay is appropriate corrective action under the standards outlined above, then she is entitled to such corrective action if the agency has not shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have threatened to terminate her, even in the absence of her protected activity. 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(e).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sirgo v. DOJ</span>, 66 MSPR 261, 267-68 (1995), provided the Board's approach to a probationer's allegation that he was forced to resign because of his whistleblowing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 24, 1991, the agency proposed terminating the appellant during his probationary period. Termination of a probationer is a "personnel action" under the WPA, and the Board has interpreted the term "threat" under the WPA broadly to include at the least a proposal to take an action against an appellant. <span class="Italic">See Zygmunt v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 61 MSPR 379, 381 (1994); <span class="Italic">Gergick v. General Services Administration</span>, 43 MSPR 651, 656-57 (1990). The appellant thus has shown that the agency threatened to take a covered personnel action against him after the effective date of the WPA. <span class="Italic">See White</span>, 63 MSPR at 94-95; <span class="Italic">Geyer</span>, 63 MSPR at 16.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge stated that the appellant had failed to show that his resignation had been coerced and thus that he was not entitled to a jurisdictional hearing. While a nonfrivolous allegation that a resignation was coerced entitles an appellant to a jurisdictional hearing in an alleged involuntary resignation appeal under 5 USC Chapter 75, this is not such an appeal. Whether the appellant's resignation could be considered involuntary under Chapter 75 involuntary resignation case law has no bearing on whether the appellant here has been subjected to a personnel action within the jurisdiction of the WPA. <span class="Italic">See Zygmunt</span>, 61 MSPR at 380, 382.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has established that he was subject to a "personnel action" and that he exhausted OSC proceedings. However, the issue of whether he made a protected disclosure involves factual questions that are potentially disputed and that cannot be resolved based on the existing record. <span class="Italic">See Frederick v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 63 MSPR 563, 572 (1994). On remand, the administrative judge shall develop the factual record at a jurisdictional hearing and determine whether the matter discussed by the appellant with his co-workers was one which a reasonable person in his position would believe evidenced an abuse of authority. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 568.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the administrative judge finds that the Board has jurisdiction, he must then consider the merits of the appeal. The appellant has the burden on the merits to show by preponderant evidence that any protected disclosures were a contributing factor in the threatened personnel action. If he meets this burden, corrective action must be ordered unless the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have threatened to terminate him absent those disclosures. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 569; <span class="Italic">Geyer</span>, 63 MSPR at 17. The appellant here, however, requests reinstatement and back pay as corrective action and not merely abatement of the threat. To obtain that kind of corrective action, even if he makes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing that the threat to terminate him was a prohibited personnel practice, the appellant must show that a reasonable person in his situation would have resigned in the face of that threat, under the standards that the Board has outlined. <span class="Italic">See Zygmunt</span>, 61 MSPR at 382-84.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Harper v. VA</span>, 68 MSPR 594, 602 (1995), added as to a retirement allegedly resulting from a retaliatory reassignment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A reassignment is a covered "personnel action," and a proposal to take an action affecting an appellant has been interpreted as a "threat." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(iv); <span class="Italic">Sirgo v. Department of Justice</span>, 66 MSPR 261, 267 (1995). The proposed reassignment and reassignment described by the appellant thus appear to satisfy the second element set forth above. In addition, the appellant appears to have satisfied the third element as well, because he seems to have raised the whistleblower issue before OSC, and it has closed its investigation of these matters. The issue of whether he made a protected disclosure, however, involves factual questions that are potentially disputed and that cannot be resolved based on the existing record. <span class="Italic">See Sirgo</span>, 66 MSPR at 268. If the appellant wishes to pursue this potential avenue of appeal, the administrative judge shall develop the factual record at a hearing in order to determine whether the disclosures are protected and thus whether the Board has jurisdiction over these matters as part of an IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the administrative judge finds that the Board has jurisdiction, he shall then proceed to the merits, where the appellant will have to demonstrate by preponderant evidence that protected disclosures were a contributing factor in the proposed reassignment and actual reassignment. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Corrective action must then be ordered unless the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have acted in the same way absent those disclosures. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> The appellant, however, requests reinstatement and back pay as corrective action rather than mere abatement of the threatened reassignment or cancellation on paper of the reassignment that was actually effected. In analyzing whether an appellant in a similar situation who has resigned can receive such relief, the Board has held that the appellant must show that a reasonable person in his situation would have resigned in the face of the threatened personnel action, under standards that it has outlined. <span class="Italic">See Sirgo</span>, 66 MSPR at 268; <span class="Italic">Zygmunt v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 61 MSPR 379, 382-84 (1994). We find that the appellant here would have the same burden of proof on the issue of corrective action with respect to his retirement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Heining v. GSA</span>, 61 MSPR 539, 551-54 (1994), <span class="Italic">reaff'd on reconsideration</span>, <span class="Italic">Heining v. GSA</span>, 68 MSPR 513 (1995) (discussed under "<a href="0100-2023-08-119.html#sec1-118">Involuntary Resignation</a>" in Chapter 6), concluded that an appellant was constructively discharged as a result of her treatment as a whistleblower:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant was constructively discharged. The Board has held that allegations of reprisal for whistleblowing, when made in support of an assertion that an agency coerced an appellant's resignation, should be considered for the purpose of determining whether they support a finding of coercion<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Burke v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 53 MSPR 434, 439 (1992). To establish that her resignation was coerced, the appellant had to show that her working conditions were made so intolerable by the alleged reprisal that she was "forced" into an involuntary resignation<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. at 438, 439. If the appellant made this showing, there was a constructive discharge because she was left with no alternative but to leave her place of employment through resignation. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 438. Another formulation of this standard is that to demonstrate constructive discharge, the appellant must show that her working conditions were made so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in her circumstances would have felt compelled to resign. <span class="Italic">See Landgraf v.</span> <span class="Italic">USI Film Products</span>, 968 F.2d 427, 429 (5th Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Collins v. Argonne National Laboratory</span>, 757 F. Supp. 934, 937 (N.D. Ill. 1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3919"></span>The administrative judge concluded that the appellant had been constructively discharged based on the following findings: (1) The agency had retaliated against the appellant for her whistleblowing activity by denying her a promotion and by giving her an unacceptable performance rating; (2) she "got no satisfaction" from her filing of grievances and an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) complaint; (3) she was improperly denied a compressed work schedule; (4) although the appellant had complained about the way Mr. Russell treated her, Mr. Creel assigned him to supervise her; and (5) the appellant experienced a great deal of frustration and stress as a result of her unsuccessful attempts to obtain assistance from the agency concerning her disclosures of illegality and abuse of authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, we have sustained the administrative judge's findings of whistleblower reprisal regarding the denial of the appellant's promotion and her unacceptable performance rating. In addition, the hearing record contains extensive testimony from agency employees that Mr. Russell made the working conditions within JA-4 extremely difficult and unpleasant by making rude, insulting, abusive comments to them; continuously observing their activities and keeping files on those activities; and threatening to ruin the careers of those with whom he disagreed. Even after the appellant had complained about these practices in her August 1989 memorandum, however, the agency nonetheless assigned her to work on an audit team that Mr. Russell supervised. And, for no apparent reason, the agency rejected her request for a compressed work schedule.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence of record further shows that the appellant's second-line supervisor (Mr. Creel) did not forward the complaints contained in the appellant's August 1989 memorandum to the agency's Inspector General, although agency guidelines required reporting of suspected irregularities within the agency to that official. Moreover, the evidence of record and hearing testimony indicate that the agency's investigation of the appellant's grievances relied heavily on the accounts of agency managers and did not solicit to any great extent the views of the appellant and agency employees who could support her version of events. Finally, the record shows that the appellant's usage of sick leave rose significantly in the period shortly before her resignation, apparently as a result of illnesses brought on or exacerbated by the pressures of her working environment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency correctly notes that the appellant did not take full advantage of her appeal rights regarding her grievances and that she did not file a formal EEO complaint or a complaint with OSC until after her resignation. The agency cites <span class="Italic">Boze v. Branstetter</span>, 912 F.2d 801, 805 (5th Cir. 1990), to support its argument that the appellant was not constructively discharged because she did not pursue all available avenues of redress. The employee in that case, however, resigned only three weeks after he filed a grievance and before his employer rendered even an initial decision on the grievance; the appellant here started the grievance process in October 1989 and received a decision on her grievances in May 1990. <span class="Italic">See Boze</span>, 912 F.2d at 803-04. The court in <span class="Italic">Boze</span> also supported its holding in that case with the finding that not "even a modicum of evidence" suggested that the employee had been discriminated against, and the facts of that case do not show that the employee offered even meager proof of a difficult or unpleasant working environment. <span class="Italic">See Boze</span>, 912 F.2d at 803-04.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By contrast, the discussion above shows that the agency engaged in reprisal against the appellant because of her whistleblowing and that the working environment within JA-4 was generally difficult and severely unpleasant. It also shows that the appellant attempted to obtain some remedy for her problems at work but that the agency thwarted those efforts through investigations that either failed to meet its own guidelines or that were unbalanced and incomplete. The record further demonstrates that the appellant had significant health problems at the time of her resignation due in part to the stress caused by her working conditions. Given this background, we can discern no clear error in the administrative judge's finding that the appellant was constructively discharged. The sustained findings of whistleblower reprisal, coupled with the aggravating factors of the appellant's pervasively difficult, unpleasant working environment and her poor health, establish that a reasonable person in her circumstances would have felt compelled to resign. <span class="Italic">See Landgraf</span>, 968 F.2d at 429-30. Although the appellant did not pursue all potential forms of redress before resigning, we agree with the administrative judge that, given her prior experiences with the handling of her August 1989 memorandum and her grievances, it would still not have been unreasonable for her to conclude that resignation was the only realistic alternative to her intolerable working conditions. <span class="Italic">See Burke</span>, 53 MSPR at 439.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following <span class="Italic">Heining</span>, <span class="Italic">Bravo v. VA</span>, 83 MSPR 653, 658-59 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-14 (1999), resolved that the appellant was entitled to a hearing based on his IRA constructive discharge claim:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Just as in "otherwise appealable actions," <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1209.2(b)(2), a resignation is actionable in an IRA appeal only if the appellant shows that it was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Mintzmyer v. Department of the Interior,</span> 84 F.3d 419, 423 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Shelly v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 75 MSPR 411, 413-14 (1997). Allegations of coerced resignations or retirements tend to fall into one of two scenarios: when the agency has proposed or threatened an adverse action and the employee resigns or retires in the face of the impending action; or when the agency takes actions that make working conditions so intolerable that the employee is driven to an involuntary resignation or retirement<span class="Italic">. Heining v.</span> <span class="Italic">General Services Administration,</span> 68 MSPR 513, 519 (1995). In both scenarios, voluntariness rests on whether the totality of the circumstances supports the conclusion that the employee was effectively deprived of free choice in the matter, and application of this test must be gauged by an objective standard rather than by the employee's purely subjective evaluation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 519-20. Applied to the case of a constructive discharge alleged to be due to intolerable working conditions, the ultimate question is "whether under all the circumstances working conditions were made so difficult by the agency that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 520. To be entitled to a jurisdictional hearing on his constructive discharge claim, the appellant must therefore have alleged facts which, if proven, could establish that a reasonable person in his position would have felt compelled to resign.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his letter of resignation, the appellant stated that he was leaving "due to continued and increased acts of hostile and malicious reprisal on the part of the administration...." He stated that these acts of reprisal included orders to have him destroy government property and agency documents, with the administration later denying any knowledge of these orders and attempting to place the blame on him. The appellant stated that the position he had occupied for six months prior to his resignation--Reproduction Clerk--was unnecessary to the agency, and was created for the sole purpose of forcing him to quit his job. During those six months, the appellant said he sat and played cards with a co-worker, because he had virtually no duties to perform. He said he did this with the full knowledge of his supervisors, with no criticism or reproof from anyone. Then in July, he was given a written admonishment for playing cards while on duty. Following that, he alleged that he was given "stacks of work" to do, work that he characterized as not only <span class="Italic">"'totally'</span> useless and sometimes destructive to Veterans Affairs documents but injurious to [his] disability..." He added that his supervisor refused to hear any of his concerns about the pain and discomfort he was experiencing, and was ordered to do the work in spite of medical documentation he provided that indicated that the work was injurious to his disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction entitling him to a hearing, the Board may not weigh conflicting evidence or make credibility determinations. <span class="Italic">See Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 60 MSPR 325, 329 (1994). We must therefore accept the appellant's allegations as true for purposes of determining whether he has alleged facts sufficient to entitle him to a jurisdictional hearing. If the agency placed him in a position with virtually no duties for a period of six months, during which time it tacitly approved his playing cards while on duty, then issued a letter of admonishment for that activity, and then ordered the appellant to perform nonproductive duties that were injurious to his health, a reasonable person in his situation might well have felt compelled to resign. We note that the appellant brought these concerns to the agency's attention prior to his resignation, thereby giving the agency an opportunity to ameliorate the conditions which he claims forced his resignation. <span class="Italic">See Heining v.

<p class="Body-Text">It was the Board's view that IRA analysis was not necessary for personnel appeals involving statutorily-defined personnel actions that are considered to be otherwise appealable to the Board under statute or regulation. When an otherwise appealable action was before the Board, jurisdiction of the Board was established by that action and the case need not be examined for the independent existence of IRA jurisdiction. The otherwise appealable action was within the Board's jurisdiction and the determination of the claim of whistleblowing reprisal was decided as a component of the merits of the otherwise appealable action (assuming that the IRA did not also challenge a personnel action independent of the otherwise appealable action). A constructive adverse action in the form of a forced retirement was an adverse action appealable to the Board (assuming a nonfrivolous jurisdictional basis) as an "otherwise appealable action," <span class="Italic">Covarrubias v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge need not have considered whether the appellant's allegation of retaliation for protected whistleblowing activity satisfies the jurisdictional requirements of an individual right of action (IRA) appeal. The Board recently held that, because an involuntary retirement, if proven, is equivalent to a removal over which the Board has jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, it constitutes an otherwise appealable action under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(b). <span class="Italic">Covarrubias v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Covarrubias</span> was overruled by <span class="Italic">Colbert v. VA</span>, 121 MSPR 677, 684 n.5, 2014 MSPB 80 (2014):</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Colbert</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the constructive adverse action may proceed through the IRA process and will be analyzed under IRA law, with possible IRA remedies. The question remains as to the impact of the Board's 2012 regulatory modifications involving elections of remedies. Although the IRA case can be used to take a constructive adverse action to the Board, 5 CFR 1209.2 (2022) limits what may be considered by the Board once the case is placed there after initial resort to OSC:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Jurisdiction</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Generally</span>. Under 5 U.S.C. 1221(a), an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment may appeal to the Board from agency personnel actions alleged to have been threatened, proposed, taken, or not taken because of the appellant's whistleblowing or other protected activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Appeals authorized</span>. The Board exercises jurisdiction over:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Individual right of action (IRA) appeals</span>. These are authorized by 5 U.S.C. 1221(a) with respect to personnel actions listed in 1209.4(a) of this part that are allegedly threatened, proposed, taken, or not taken because of the appellant's whistleblowing or other protected activity. If the action is not otherwise directly appealable to the Board, the appellant must seek corrective action from the Special Counsel before appealing to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Otherwise appealable action appeals</span>. These are appeals to the Board under laws, rules, or regulations other than 5 U.S.C. 1221(a) that include an allegation that the action was based on the appellant's whistleblowing or other protected activity. Otherwise appealable actions are listed in 5 CFR 1201.3(a). An individual who has been subjected to an otherwise appealable action must make an election of remedies as described in 5 U.S.C. 7121(g) and paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example 5</span>: Same as Example 4 above. While the OSC complaint with respect to the proposed removal is pending, the agency effects the removal action. OSC subsequently issues a letter notifying Employee Y that it has terminated its investigation of the alleged retaliation with respect to the proposed removal. With respect to the effected removal, Employee Y can elect to appeal that action directly to the Board or to proceed with a complaint to OSC. If she chooses the latter option, she may file an IRA appeal when OSC has terminated its investigation, but the only issue that will be adjudicated in that appeal is whether she proves that her protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the removal action and, if so, whether the agency can prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have removed Employee Y in the absence of the protected disclosure. If she instead files a direct appeal, the agency must prove its misconduct charges, nexus, and the reasonableness of the penalty, and Employee Y can raise any affirmative defenses she might have.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Issues before the Board in IRA appeals</span>. In an individual right of action appeal, the only merits issues before the Board are those listed in 5 U.S.C. 1221(e), i.e., whether the appellant has demonstrated that whistleblowing or other protected activity was a contributing factor in one or more covered personnel actions and, if so, whether the agency has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action(s) in the absence of the whistleblowing or other protected activity. The appellant may not raise affirmative defenses, such as claims of discrimination or harmful procedural error. In an IRA appeal that concerns an adverse action under 5 U.S.C. 7512, the agency need not prove its charges, nexus, or the reasonableness of the penalty, as a requirement under 5 U.S.C. 7513(a), i.e., that its action is taken "only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." However, the Board may consider the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its adverse action in determining whether the agency has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the whistleblowing or other protected activity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SAVAGE_TOMMIE_G_AT_0752_11_0634_I_2_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1217635.pdf">122 MSPR 612</a>, 625 &#x00B6; 18, 2015 MSPB 51 (2015), commented on the election of remedy for a constructive suspension appeal. To be a valid election, depending on whether the constructive suspension is first taken to OSC or to the Board, the election must be informed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we also have held that an election under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g) is binding only if made knowingly and voluntarily. <span class="Italic">Agoranos</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 498, &#x00B6; 16. Here, neither the agency, nor the administrative judge, advised the appellant that contesting her alleged constructive suspension in an OSC complaint would preclude a subsequent chapter 75 appeal before the Board. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6; 18. Moreover, while the express language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g) negates <span class="Italic">Massimino</span> and <span class="Italic">Covarrubias</span>, the Board had not yet recognized this when the OSC complaint was filed, and the appellant and her attorney could have reasonably relied on those cases. <span class="Italic">See Agoranos</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 498, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18.[3] We therefore find that the appellant's decision to contest her alleged constructive suspension before OSC was not a binding election and did not preclude her from filing an adverse action appeal before the Board. Because the appellant has expressly indicated that she wishes for her constructive suspension claim to be adjudicated outside the scope of her IRA appeal, we will consider her claim as an adverse action appeal under chapter 75.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3] The administrative judge also appears not to have recognized the effect of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g), as evidenced by his decision to dismiss the removal appeal without prejudice to permit the appellant to file an OSC complaint. Ordinarily, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g), the appellant's removal would not have been properly before OSC, as she had already appealed it to the Board. To the extent the administrative judge may have erred in granting the appellant's request for dismissal without prejudice, or to the extent OSC may have erred in including the removal in the scope of its investigation, these errors have no effect on the outcome of this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a decision that would likely be of debatable validity after the 2012 regulatory modifications, the Board did not impose a rigorous IRA exhaustion <span id="Page_3921"></span>requirement on an involuntary retirement claim that would not have been necessary had the case gone to the Board without prior resort to OSC, <span class="Italic">Coufal v. DOJ</span>, 98 MSPR 31, 39-40 &#x00B6; 21 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an agency takes an action against an employee that is otherwise appealable to the Board, an employee who believes the action was in reprisal for whistleblowing may choose either to seek corrective action from OSC before filing an IRA appeal with the Board or to appeal directly to the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(b); <span class="Italic">Chakravorty v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 304 &#x00B6; 17 (2001). Here, the appellant chose to file a complaint with OSC alleging that her retirement was involuntary and caused by the hostile work environment created by the agency in reprisal for her whistleblowing. An involuntary retirement, which is tantamount to a removal, is an "otherwise appealable action" and, as such, need not satisfy the jurisdictional requirements for an IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">Schaeffer v. Department of the Navy</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 606 &#x00B6; 19 (2000). Accordingly, if the appellant establishes that her retirement was involuntary, the Board would have jurisdiction over her removal, regardless of whether she established that she made whistleblowing disclosures or whether she "exhausted" her OSC remedy. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Thus, notwithstanding our above finding that the administrative judge properly dismissed the appellant's IRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction, we must consider the appellant's claim that intolerable working conditions created by the agency resulted in her involuntary retirement. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
