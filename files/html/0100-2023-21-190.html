<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Finch v. OPM</span>, AT-0845-16-0722-I-1 (NP 7/14/2022), outlined the analysis of unconscionability of recovery as a basis for waiver of an overpayment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The standard for unconscionability is a high one and is granted only under exceptional circumstances. <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 214, &#x00B6; 18 (2000). In assessing unconscionability, the Board considers all relevant factors under a totality-of-the-circumstances approach. <span class="Italic">Vojas</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 502, &#x00B6; 22. Such circumstances may include, but are not limited to, cases in which: (1) OPM delayed an exceptionally long time to adjust an annuity; (2) OPM failed to respond within a reasonable length of time to an annuitant's inquiries regarding an overpayment; (3) OPM failed to act expeditiously to adjust an annuity in the face of the specific notice; or (4) OPM was otherwise grossly negligent in handling the case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board also will consider an annuitant's personal limitations, such as lack of education, physical or mental disability, or other factors that would make the collection of an overpayment manifestly unfair. <span class="Italic">Aguon v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 540, 550 (1989). In addition, in determining whether recovery of a debt would be unconscionable under the circumstances, the Board may consider whether collection of the overpayment would have a negative impact on an annuitant because of her medical conditions or whether those medical conditions require expenditure of a portion of the installment amount. <span class="Italic">Boone v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 53, &#x00B6; 9 (2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant applied for disability retirement under FERS in January 2015, and OPM notified her that it had approved her application on August 5, 2015. On October 14, 2015, OPM advised the appellant that she had been placed in an interim payment status while it finished processing her application. On March 16, 2016, OPM notified the appellant that she had received an overpayment in the amount of $4,318.47 and provided her a repayment schedule. The appellant requested reconsideration on April 2, 2016, and OPM issued a reconsideration decision on June 30, 2016. Thus, the entire process took approximately 18 months. The Board has held that substantially longer delays, without more, do not render recovery unconscionable. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Spinella v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 185, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-10 (2008) (finding that OPM's delay of 79 months to adjust the appellant's annuity did not render recovery of the overpayment unconscionable); <span class="Italic">Newcomb v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 552, 558?59 (1989) (determining that OPM's delay of 3 years and 10 months to render a decision on an annuitant's request for waiver did not render recovery of the overpayment unconscionable).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant is approximately 61 years old and has a left shoulder impingement. She has not shown, however, that repayment of the monthly installment of $50 would have any negative impact on her because of her age or medical condition and has not shown that her medical condition requires expenditure of any of the installment amount. <span class="Italic">See Boone</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 53, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Dixon v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 607, 610-11 (1994) (finding that recovery of an $8,994 overpayment was not unconscionable because, among other things, the annuitant failed to show that repayment in monthly installments of $149.90 would have any negative impact on him because of his advanced age of 85 years, numerous medical conditions, or low education level).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the foregoing, we find that there has been no excessive delay or other egregious conduct on OPM's part and that the appellant's age and left shoulder impingement do not warrant waiver of the overpayment based on unconscionability. Therefore, we do not disturb the administrative judge's determination that the appellant is not entitled to waiver of the overpayment based on unconscionability.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lucas v. OPM</span>, SF-0845-13-0413-B-1 (NP 2/8/2023) (partial waiver of overpayment by reason of OPM delay in recovery (and in part by reason of appellant's poor health): "OPM approved the appellant's disability annuity and SSA approved her application for disability benefits in the same month, March 2007. OPM received specific notice that the appellant was receiving SSA benefits in October 2008. However, OPM did not act to adjust the appellant's annuity payments to stop overpaying her until July 2010. At that point, the appellant requested a waiver, but it took OPM years to issue its final denial.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A nonprecedential decision from the Federal Circuit emphasized OPM delays in overpayment efforts. The decision from the Board,<span class="Italic"> Gordon v. OPM</span>, CH-0845-16-0204-I-1 (NP 9/9/2016), focused on whether the appellant "relinquished a valuable right because of the incorrect payment." The Federal Circuit saw things differently, <span class="Italic">Gordon v. OPM</span>, 689 Fed. Appx. 977, 982-89 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Gordon next argues that he is entitled to waiver of the overpayment. OPM's collection of FERS overpayments is subject to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b), which provides in pertinent part, "[r]ecovery of payments under this subchapter [including FERS annuity benefits] may not be made from an individual when, in the judgment of the Office of Personnel Management, the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8470(b); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.301. Recovery is against equity and good conscience if any of the following three conditions are met:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;It would cause financial hardship to the person from whom it is sought;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_4415"></span>(b)&#x2003;The recipient of the overpayment can show (regardless of his or her financial circumstances) that due to the notice that such payment would be made or because of the incorrect payment he or she either has relinquished a valuable right or has changed positions for the worse; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c)&#x2003;Recovery would be unconscionable under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.303.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found, and the Board did not dispute, that Gordon was "without fault" in this case, but the AJ denied Gordon's request for a waiver based on her equity and good conscience analysis. Gordon argues that recovery in this case would be against equity and good conscience because he meets each of the three conditions. After reviewing each of the conditions, we conclude the AJ erred in finding that Gordon had not shown recovery would be against equity and good conscience because recovery of the overpayment under these circumstances would be unconscionable due to OPM's lengthy delays and the impact it had on Gordon's benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;Fault</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the AJ and the Board both found that Gordon was without fault, we briefly address the fault inquiry because of its impact on the reasoning used to support the finding by the AJ and the Board that Gordon failed to prove recovery would be against equity and good conscience. As we explained in <span class="Italic">Boyd v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 851 F.3d 1309 (Fed. Cir. 2017), the relevant regulations state that a recipient of an overpayment is "without fault if he/she performed no act of commission or omission which resulted in the overpayment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1402. One of the pertinent considerations when considering a finding of fault is whether the recipient of an overpayment "accepted a payment which he/she knew or should have known to be erroneous." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 831.1402(a)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's published policy guidelines interpreting its regulations further reiterate and explain the fault inquiry. OPM's guidelines state that "an individual is <span class="Italic">not</span> without fault if," <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "he/she accepted a payment which he/she knew to be erroneous[,] or...he/she accepted a payment which he/she should have known to be erroneous." Ret. &#x0026; Ins. Grp., U.S. Office of Pers. Mgmt., <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines on the Disposition of Overpayments under the Civil Service Retirement System and Federal Employees' [sic]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic"> Retirement System</span> ("<span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span>"), &#x00A7; I.B.3(c)-(d) (1995). But the guidelines contain an exception under which anyone, even an individual who knows that he is receiving an erroneous overpayment, can automatically be found without fault:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Prompt Notification Exception</span>. Individuals who accept a payment in excess of the amount to which they are entitled will automatically be found without fault, regardless of whether they knew or should have known that the payment was erroneous, if they promptly contact OPM and question the correctness of the payment. In general, an individual must contact OPM within 60 days of the receipt of the overpayment--i.e., a onetime prompt notification requirement. (Note: This rule provides an exception to the general rules cited above (I.B.3) by allowing certain persons who knowingly accept overpayments to be found without fault if they demonstrate good faith by promptly bringing the overpayments to OPM's attention. However, the fact that they suspected or knew that they had received an overpayment--as evidenced by their contacting of OPM--will have a bearing on equity and good conscience determinations. See the Set-Aside Rule, guideline I.C.4.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.B.6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Set-Aside Rule, which is referenced by the Prompt Notification Exception, applies to the equity and good conscience inquiry. <span class="Italic">Boyd</span>, 851 F.3d at 1313-15. Although the Set-Aside Rule does not affect the fault analysis, the outcome of the fault analysis determines the applicability of the Set-Aside Rule. <span class="Italic">See Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; I.B.6, I.C.4, I.E.7. The Set-Aside Rule states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Individuals who are aware that they are receiving overpayments are obligated by the principles of equity and good conscience to set aside the amount overpaid pending recoupment by OPM. Thus, <span class="Italic">an individual who accepted a payment which he/she suspected or knew to be erroneous</span> but<span class="Italic"> who is found without fault under the Prompt Notification Exception (I.B.6) is obliged to set the overpaid money aside pending recovery by OPM</span>....&#8197;Unless there are exceptional circumstances, recovery by OPM in these cases is not against equity and good conscience. (Note: Exceptional circumstances would involve extremely egregious errors or delays by OPM--e.g., a failure to issue a written decision within 4 years of a debtor's request for waiver. [See I.F.1 and I.F.3.] Financial hardship is not an exceptional circumstance.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.C.4 (italicized emphasis added). As explained by the guideline, the Set-Aside Rule applies to any individual who accepted a payment that he "suspected or knew to be erroneous" but was nevertheless found without fault due to the Prompt Notification Exception. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, there is no indication that the Prompt Notification Exception applies to Gordon. OPM's reconsideration decision, issued on December 28, 2015, merely states, "[a]fter a careful review of the evidence of record, we find that [Gordon is] not at fault in causing or contributing to the overpayment." OPM's decision makes no reference to the Prompt Notification Exception. The decisions of the AJ and the Board also give no indication that the Prompt Notification Exception applies in this case, and we see no indication in the record that Gordon notified OPM within sixty days of the receipt of an overpayment, as required by <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.B.6. We therefore conclude that the Prompt Notification Exception does not apply to Gordon.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Prompt Notification Exception does not apply, the decisions of OPM, the AJ, and the Board finding Gordon "without fault" must be based on the underlying conclusions that Gordon (1) did not know his payment was erroneous, and (2) could not have reasonably been expected to know his payment was erroneous.[1] If either of these conclusions were not true, then Gordon would not be without fault under the <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> because the Prompt Notification Exception, which "provides an exception to the general rules cited above (I.B.3) by allowing certain persons who knowingly accept overpayments to be found without fault...," <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.B.6, does not apply in this case. <span class="Italic">See Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.B.3(c)-(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;A parenthetical note at the end of <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.B.3 states, "[t]he phrase 'should have known' can be interpreted as 'could have reasonably been expected to know.'"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;Financial Hardship</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Gordon argues that he has burdensome financial obligations caused by his disability and now by the overpayment. Gordon asserts that his financial obligations became so great that he was forced to return to work against the advice of his doctor. To demonstrate his financial obligations, Gordon filed a Financial Resources Questionnaire in February 2012. OPM requested that Gordon submit an updated questionnaire in 2014, but he declined to file one. OPM again requested an updated questionnaire while the case was before the AJ. The AJ even encouraged Gordon to submit an updated questionnaire before his hearing and specifically informed him that the AJ would find it difficult to find in his favor on financial hardship grounds without an updated questionnaire. Gordon declined once again.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To show financial hardship, an individual must show that he needs substantially all of his "current income and liquid assets to meet current ordinary and necessary living expenses and liabilities." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.304. A pertinent consideration in this determination is the "individual's financial ability to pay <span class="Italic">at the time collection is scheduled to be made</span>." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 845.304(a)(1) (emphasis added). The AJ found that Gordon failed to meet his burden to show financial hardship because he declined to submit an updated questionnaire, which left the AJ without sufficient evidence to compare Gordon's then current monthly household income with his claimed expenses. Because Gordon's ability to pay at the time of collection is a pertinent consideration in analyzing financial hardship and there is substantial evidence to support the AJ's conclusion that Gordon failed to show his financial ability to pay at the time of the appeal, we find no error in the AJ's consideration of this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;Relinquishment of a Valuable Right or Changed Position for the Worse</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Gordon argues that he lost valuable healthcare benefits from the Veterans Administration, Medicare, and Medicaid because of the overpayment. He also argues that he lost nearly all of a $35,000 forgivable home loan from the State of Illinois because the overpayment falsely inflated his reportable income to the IRS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Waiver of an overpayment is justified under &#x00A7; I.E.3 of OPM's guidelines when the relinquishment of a valuable right or change in position is:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a)&#x2003;directly caused by the overpayment or notice that such payment would be made (i.e., loss or change would not have otherwise occurred);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b)&#x2003;detrimental to the overpayment recipient;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c)&#x2003;material (i.e., significant enough to warrant the waiver); and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d)&#x2003;irrevocable (i.e., the forfeited right cannot be recovered, the change in position cannot be reversed).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.E.3; <span class="Italic">see also King v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 730 F.3d 1342, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2013). But the <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> explain that relinquishment of a valuable right or change in position does not warrant a waiver of an overpayment if the debtor knew or strongly suspected that the payment was erroneous:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A debtor's claim that an overpayment caused him/her to lose a valuable right or to change positions for the worse should be rejected if there is substantial proof that the debtor knew or strongly <span id="Page_4416"></span>suspected that the payment in question was erroneous: e.g., debtor inquired as to correctness of the payment. <span class="Italic">See</span> I.C.4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.E.7. This limitation on the relinquishment of a valuable right or change in position analysis coincides with &#x00A7; I.C.4--the Set-Aside Rule--because a debtor who is "aware," or who "knew or strongly suspected" (in the language of &#x00A7; I.E.7), that he is receiving overpayments cannot receive a waiver of the overpayment for equity and good conscience "[u]nless there are exceptional circumstances," which do not include financial hardship. <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.C.4. In other words, if a debtor was "aware" or "knew or strongly suspected" that he received an overpayment, then the Set-Aside Rule applies and the equity and good conscience analysis hinges on whether exceptional circumstances exist, not the separate factors relating to the inquiries of financial hardship or relinquishment of a valuable right or change of position for the worse.[3] <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; I.C.4, I.E.7; <span class="Italic">James v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 72 M.S.P.R. 211, 220 (1996) (analyzing a debtor's argument related to a change in position for the worse due to a commitment to buy a new house based on the exceptional circumstances standard, not the factors relating to a change in position for the worse, when the Set-Aside Rule applied).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;To be clear, we are not saying that a situation involving loss of a valuable right or a change in position for the worse cannot rise to the level of exceptional circumstances. Although the Set-Aside Rule specifies that "[f]inancial hardship is not an exceptional circumstance," <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.C.4, it does not state that a loss of a valuable right or a change in position for the worse cannot create an exceptional circumstance. We do not offer any further analysis on this issue because, as explained below, the Set-Aside Rule does not apply in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her analysis, the AJ appears to have combined the first prong of &#x00A7; I.E.3--direct causation--with the note in &#x00A7; I.E.7 to conclude that Gordon did not qualify for waiver under this condition. The AJ found that Gordon could not show detrimental reliance "when [he] was made aware just one month prior to receiving social security that he should set aside those payments until OPM finalized his case." The AJ concluded that Gordon's negotiation of his Social Security benefits despite notice from OPM not to negotiate the benefits "served as an intervening circumstance precluding good-faith reliance to his detriment." The AJ also found that there is "substantial proof in the record that the appellant knew that his FERS annuity payments were subject to reduction upon receipt of" a Social Security benefits award.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ's analysis on this issue is not supported by substantial evidence and is erroneous. First, to the extent the AJ's analysis relies specifically on the direct causation element of &#x00A7; I.E.3, the AJ's "intervening circumstance" conclusion is not supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise not in accordance with law. The <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> explain that the direct causation element considers whether the "loss or change would not have otherwise occurred." <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.E.3(a). The receipt of an overpayment that disqualifies a person from the receipt of benefits he otherwise would have received falls directly within the criteria that the "loss or change would not have otherwise occurred." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The AJ's attempt to skirt this conclusion because Gordon negotiated his Social Security benefits conflates this element with the fault determination, which had already been made in Gordon's favor. As noted, OPM concluded that Gordon was "without fault," so Gordon's fault should not have come into play at that point. <span class="Italic">AJ Decision</span>, 2016 MSPB LEXIS 2622, at *14. The AJ's reintroduction of fault during an analysis of &#x00A7; I.E.3(a) is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent the AJ relied on &#x00A7; I.E.7 because Gordon allegedly knew that he was receiving an overpayment, the AJ's conclusion must be erroneous because it contradicts the AJ's previous conclusion that Gordon was without fault. As discussed above, the record provides no evidence that the Prompt Notification Exception applies to Gordon. OPM, the AJ, and the Board also made no indication that the Prompt Notification Exception applies in this case. Because the Prompt Notification Exception does not apply, Gordon must not have known or had a reasonable expectation to know that his payments were erroneous; otherwise, OPM, the AJ, and the Board could not have found him without fault under <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.B.3(c)-(d). The AJ's contradictory conclusions that Gordon was without fault in this case, which required a conclusion that he did not know or have a reasonable expectation to know that the payments were erroneous, but that he could not satisfy the detrimental reliance criteria because he knew that the payments were erroneous cannot stand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's characterization of the AJ's decision on this issue as an application of the Set-Aside Rule, <span class="Italic">Board Order</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. at 574, fails for similar reasons.[4] The Set-Aside Rule explains that it applies to "[i]ndividuals who are aware that they are receiving overpayments...." <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.C.4. It then specifies that it applies to "an individual who accepted a payment which he/she suspected or knew to be erroneous but who is found without fault under the Prompt Notification Exception...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. As addressed above, the Prompt Notification Exception does not apply, and the conclusion by OPM, the AJ, and the Board that Gordon was without fault must be premised on findings that he did not know and could not have reasonably been expected to know that his payments were erroneous. <span class="Italic">See Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.B.3(c)-(d). The Board's conclusion that the AJ "correctly found [that] the appellant [wa]s without fault," <span class="Italic">Board Order</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. at 574, directly contradicts the Board's subsequent conclusion that Gordon was subject to the Set-Aside Rule because he was aware that he was receiving overpayments. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. These contradictory conclusions cannot both stand; given the conclusions of OPM, the AJ, and the Board that Gordon was without fault based on the facts of this case, the Set-Aside Rule could not apply.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The AJ did not cite the Set-Aside Rule in her decision. The AJ also did not analyze Gordon's arguments under the Set-Aside Rule, as shown by the AJ not analyzing Gordon's argument under the "exceptional circumstances" standard, which specifically disqualifies financial hardship as an exceptional circumstance, <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.C.4. Instead, the AJ analyzed Gordon's arguments, including financial hardship, on the merits. The Board denied Gordon's petition for review and adopted the AJ's initial decision as the Board's final decision; the Board did not state that the initial decision was adopted subject to modifications by the Board, as it does in some instances. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Howard v. Dep't of Transp</span>., 117 M.S.P.R. 610, 610 (2012) (adopting the AJ's decision as the Board's final decision "[e]xcept as modified by th[e] Final Order"). Because the Board's application of the Set-Aside Rule suffers from the same internal inconsistency as the AJ's analysis of Gordon's arguments, we do not address the effect of the Board affirming the AJ's decision as the final decision without modification but then offering reasoning that clearly departs from that given by the AJ.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;On this issue, the Board also stated, "[t]here is no evidence that [Gordon] made an effort to inform the VA or the Illinois state authorities, who oversaw the benefits that he sought, that the income that was reported by OPM to the Internal Revenue Service was erroneous, i.e., falsely inflated by OPM's failure to reduce [Gordon's] FERS benefit as of the date of his receiving Social Security benefits." According to the Board, Gordon would not be entitled to waiver "[a]bsent proof of such effort and a showing that it failed to persuade the VA and the state authorities to allow him the benefits to which he would have been entitled at a lower income level...." The government also references this logic in its brief. But neither the Board nor the government cites any authority for placing this additional burden on Gordon. We find no support in the statute or regulations for the Board's requirement that an individual must show that he tried to convince a state or local agency his income was falsely inflated by overpayments before he can receive waiver of an overpayment based on the loss of other benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the decisions of the AJ and the Board on this issue contradict the premise underlying the previous conclusions of the AJ and the Board that Gordon was without fault, we conclude that the decisions are arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law. We would normally remand the matter to the Board for reconsideration in light of the inconsistent factual findings made and the inconsistent legal theories employed. We need do that, however, because we conclude that the recoupment of the overpayment in these circumstances is otherwise unconscionable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">D.&#x2003;Unconscionability</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the AJ recognized, the Board will waive recovery based on unconscionability only under exceptional circumstances. The Board considers "all relevant factors using a 'totality-of-the-circumstances' approach in order to determine whether recovery of an annuity overpayment is unconscionable in a given case." <span class="Italic">Aguon v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 42 M.S.P.R. 540, 550 (1989). Possible circumstances include, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, an "exceptionally lengthy delay by OPM in adjusting an annuity," <span class="Italic">id</span>., or a failure by OPM to respond to a without-fault debtor's request for reconsideration within four years of the debtor's request, <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.F.3. A delay of less than four years "does not mean that a finding of inequitable recovery is absolutely precluded"; instead, "it simply means that a delay of less than [four] years will not automatically be presumed to render recovery inequitable." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. But granting a waiver based on egregious errors or delays "requires a determination that OPM's handling of a case was so offensive--so monstrously harsh and shocking to the conscience--that one's sense of equity forbids recovery." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; I.F.1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ concluded that OPM's three-year delay to finalize its calculations for Gordon's benefits, although inexplicable, was not "so 'monstrously harsh' that recovery of the overpayment would be unconscionable...." The AJ also found that Gordon had failed to demonstrate unique personal circumstances and credited OPM for acting equitably during the delay by extending Gordon's last day of pay by a few days to qualify him for benefits despite its belief that he had not met the 18-month requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4417"></span>But the AJ did not address the delay between Gordon's request for reconsideration and OPM's reconsideration decision. Gordon requested reconsideration of OPM's initial decision on February 10, 2012, but OPM did not issue a decision until December 28, 2015. OPM provided no reason for its delay; instead, it merely stated, "[w]e apologize for the delay in responding to your request." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Although this delay does not automatically qualify as an exceptional circumstance under <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.F.3, it only barely misses that mark and remains an important consideration. <span class="Italic">See Aguon</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. at 550.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In considering the totality of the circumstances, we also acknowledge Gordon's failure to qualify for aid and benefits from state agencies, local agencies, and the Veterans Administration because of OPM's delay in finalizing its calculations. The AJ recognized that Gordon likely would have qualified for these benefits without the overpayments. And the Board did not disagree with that conclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because of OPM's lengthy delays on two separate occasions, the effect the first delay had on Gordon's inability to qualify for benefits he likely would have received, and the fact that the second delay fell only forty days short of the presumptively impermissible four-year time frame, we conclude that recovery of the overpayment is unconscionable. OPM would have required Gordon to forego nearly $1,200.00 per month (comparing his $1,118.00 FERS interim benefits with the $1,984.00 Social Security benefits and $326.00 earned FERS annuity he was entitled to receive)--a hefty percentage of his income--for almost three years because OPM did not finalize its calculations more quickly.[6] But OPM did not learn from its initial delay. Instead, OPM waited another three years and almost eleven months to respond to Gordon's request for reconsideration. Although the delayed response to the request for reconsideration does not qualify as automatically inequitable under <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.F.3, it follows a delay of almost three years to calculate Gordon's annuity. To be clear, we do not endorse a rule that merely adds up multiple delays to conclude that the greater than four year presumptively unconscionable time period has passed. We simply find that where, as here, there is a wholly unexplained delay of three years and almost eleven months, which followed an earlier three-year delay, and the AJ found both that Gordon was without fault and that Gordon was deprived of the opportunity to pursue and receive other benefits he likely would have received during those delays, the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b) have been met, despite the other countervailing considerations addressed by the AJ. Considering the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that OPM's recovery of the $33,127.42 overpayment would be unconscionable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The AJ's belief that Gordon's circumstances are far from unique because they "fit squarely with a great deal of former federal employees who are overpaid on account of interim pay and corresponding social security benefits," creates cause for concern regarding the statutory scheme and OPM's efficiency, especially in addressing disability benefits for veterans such as Gordon. But we are tasked with applying the law, not rewriting it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">III.&#x2003;CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the Board's Final Order adopting the AJ's initial decision as the Board's final decision. The Board is directed to instruct OPM to waive recovery of the $33,127.42 claimed as an overpayment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Aguon v. OPM</span>, 42 MSPR 540, 549-51 (1989), addressed egregious errors or delays by OPM as elements of unconscionability:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argued that it would be unconscionable under the circumstances to require recovery of the overpayment because he was 70 years old, totally disabled, and had a severe heart condition. OPM has interpreted 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1403 to require that unconscionability be treated as a separate factor warranting waiver of recovery of an annuity overpayment. OPM's <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.F.1. at 11, provide that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When a without-fault overpayment recipient does not meet the financial hardship or detrimental reliance requirements, waiver may still be granted if the circumstances of the case clearly make recovery unconscionable on other equity grounds. For example, <span class="Italic">egregious errors and/or delays</span> by OPM may render recovery unconscionable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(Emphasis in original.) Thus, under OPM's own interpretation of its regulations as expressed in its <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines,</span> unconscionability is viewed neither as an adjunct to nor as part of the categories of "financial hardship" or "detrimental reliance/relinquishment of a valuable right." Rather, it is a distinct provision intended to cover those cases where the circumstances surrounding an annuity overpayment, although not meeting the tests for waiver based on either financial hardship or detrimental reliance, nevertheless merit special consideration and treatment.[10] Because OPM's <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> are consistent with the regulatory language on which they are based, we defer to OPM's interpretation. <span class="Italic">See Kimsey,</span> 24 M.S.P.R. at 532<span class="Italic">.</span> We emphasize that the unconscionability criterion is a high standard, and that waiver based on that criterion will be granted only under exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;To the extent that <span class="Italic">Gray v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 559 (1986), and any subsequent Board decisions suggest that the only two ways to establish that collection of an overpayment is against equity and good conscience are to show financial hardship or one of the two forms of detrimental reliance (relinquishment of a valuable right or change of position for the worse), they are hereby overruled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of any guidance in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b) of its legislative history regarding the meaning of "unconscionability," the Board will define the term according to its "ordinary, contemporary, common meaning."<span class="Italic">See Perrier v. United States,</span> 444 U.S. 37, 42 (1979). The term "unconscionable" is defined as "[g]oing beyond the bounds of what is customary or reasonable; ridiculously or unjustly excessive; inordinate. In law, contrary to good conscience inequitable." 90 C.J.S. <span class="Italic">Unconscionable</span> (1955).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the concept of unconscionability is generally defined in terms of broad, equitable considerations, the Board will consider all relevant factors using a "totality-of-the-circumstances" approach in order to determine whether recovery of an annuity overpayment is unconscionable in a given case.[11] We find that such circumstances may include, but are not limited to, cases where: (1) There has been an exceptionally lengthy delay by OPM in adjusting an annuity; (2) OPM failed to respond within a reasonable length of time to an annuitant's inquiries regarding an overpayment; (3) OPM failed to act expeditiously to adjust an annuity in the face of specific notice; and/or (4) where OPM is otherwise grossly negligent in handling the case. <span class="Italic">See Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.F.1. at 11. In addition, we note that general principles of equity and fairness demand that just consideration also be given to situations where recovery of an annuity overpayment may be unconscionable because of misinformation given to the annuitant or where the personal limitations of the annuitant, such as lack of education, physical or mental disability, or other factors, would make the collection of an overpayment manifestly unfair.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;We believe that the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Day v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 873 F.2d 291 (Fed. Cir. 1989)], does not preclude us either from defining "unconscionability" in terms of its commonly accepted meaning or from adopting a totality-of-the-circumstances approach. The court relied upon OPM's reconsideration decision in that case, which stated in part that waivers for unconscionability would be granted "only if the action or lack of action by OPM in causing or increasing the payment to be recovered was flagrantly inconsistent with normal case processing activities (i.e., there were excessive delays or egregious errors)."<span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 293. The court concluded that Day had not shown OPM's definition to be erroneous or that OPM violated its own definition. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> OPM's <span class="Italic">Guidelines,</span> on which the Board is relying here, do not appear to have been before the court in <span class="Italic">Day.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unconscionability also may be presumed under certain circumstances. Although OPM's fault in delaying adjustment of an annuity generally does not in and of itself entitle an annuitant to a waiver, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1402 and <span class="Italic">Knowles v. Office of Personnel Management</span> 24 M.S.P.R. 500, 502 (1984), OPM has stated, as a matter of policy, that it would be deemed unconscionable to collect an overpayment when its Reconsideration and Debt Collection Division failed to respond (with a decision) to a debtor's request for waiver and/or reconsideration within four years of the date of the debtor's request. <span class="Italic">See Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.F.3. at 12. OPM also deems unconscionable recovery of that portion of an overpayment that accrued more than three years prior to the date of the initial overpayment notice, and that portion of an overpayment that cannot be recovered within six years (from the date of the first collection) without imposing a financial hardship on the debtor (based on the criteria set forth in the <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> for determining financial hardship). <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; I.F.4. and 5. at 12. The Board agrees with these rules as expressed by OPM in its <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> and will apply them where appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's rules afford satisfactory means of providing a without-fault annuitant with a complete or partial waiver of an annuity overpayment in certain situations where OPM's actions caused delays. However, lengthy delays by OPM, when accompanied by other circumstances not specifically covered by the <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines,</span> may also support a finding that the annuitant is entitled to a waiver of the entire overpayment amount. As noted above, an egregious delay by OPM could, in itself, justify a finding that a recovery would be unconscionable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this regard, we note that OPM has ready access to the personnel information of annuitants, including information that a particular annuitant may have retired on disability. OPM therefore should inquire into the nature of such an annuitant's disability, including the current health of the annuitant. OPM's failure to expedite the processing of request for waiver filed by such an annuitant, if it results in unnecessary delays, could lead to a finding that collection of the overpayment is unconscionable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4418"></span>The record in this appeal is not clear as to the state of the appellant's health. The appellant therefore should be given the opportunity on remand to submit evidence and argument showing that his medical condition is sufficient, either alone or in combination with other factors, to justify a finding that recovery would be unconscionable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Relying on <span class="Italic">Aguon, supra,</span> <span class="Italic">Nelson v. OPM</span>, DE-0845-14-0626-I-1 (NP 9/6/2022), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When a recipient of an overpayment does not meet the financial hardship and detrimental reliance requirements for a waiver, a waiver may nevertheless be granted where the circumstances establish that recovery would be unconscionable on other equity grounds. <span class="Italic">Aguon v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 540, 549 (1989). Because the concept of unconscionability is generally defined in terms of broad, equitable considerations, the Board will consider all relevant factors using a "totality-of-the-circumstances" approach to determine if recovery of an annuity overpayment is unconscionable in a given case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Such circumstances may include, but are not limited to, cases in which OPM: (1) delayed adjusting an annuity for an exceptionally long period of time; (2) failed to respond in a reasonable length of time to an annuitant's inquiries regarding an overpayment; (3) failed to expeditiously adjust an annuity after receiving specific notice; or (4) was grossly negligent in handling a case. <span class="Italic">Aguon</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. at 550. The unconscionability criterion is a high standard justifying waiver only under exceptional circumstances. <span class="Italic">Boone v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 53, &#x00B6; 9 (2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant did not prove unconscionability, in part because OPM was not grossly negligent and did not unreasonably delay the final adjustment of the appellant's annuity or fail to respond to his request for a waiver within a reasonable length of time. On review, the appellant argues that recovery would be unconscionable because OPM double-reported the overpayment to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which caused him to incur an unfair tax liability in 2012. The appellant also asks the Board to order OPM to provide the IRS with corrected documentation to remove the 2012 overpayment that OPM allegedly double-reported to the IRS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge specifically considered and repeatedly rejected the appellant's argument that recovery would be unconscionable because he incurred an unfair tax liability. The administrative judge properly found that OPM is legally required to withhold Federal income taxes from annuity benefits and remit them to the IRS and that the appellant must seek a remedy from the IRS to the extent that any benefits adjustments or resulting overpayments affected his past tax liability. <span class="Italic">See Cebzanov v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 562, &#x00B6; 11 (2004). We find that the administrative judge's findings are supported by the applicable law as cited in the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lucas v. OPM</span>, 614 Fed. Appx. 491, 495 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Konschak v. OPM</span>, 84 MSPR 555, 558-60 &#x00B6; 9-14 (1999), presents an exceptional case involving a waiver based on unconscionability of recovery:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Recovery of an annuity overpayment may not be made "when, in the judgment of the Office of Personnel Management, the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b); <span class="Italic">Tatum</span>, slip op. at &#x00B6; 8. Recovery is deemed against equity and good conscience when it would cause financial hardship, where, regardless of financial circumstances, the recipient has relinquished a valuable right or changed positions for the worse because of the incorrect payment, or where recovery could be unconscionable under the circumstances. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1403; <span class="Italic">Gromo v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 944 F.2d 882, 884-85 (Fed. Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has further stated that the unconscionability standard is high, and a waiver based on this standard will be granted only under exceptional circumstances. In determining whether recovery of an overpayment is unconscionable, the Board examines the totality of the circumstances. Such circumstances may include, but are not limited to cases where there has been an exceptionally lengthy delay by OPM in adjusting an annuity, or where OPM is otherwise grossly negligent in handling the case. Further, an egregious delay by OPM can, in itself, justify a finding that a recovery would be unconscionable. <span class="Italic">See Cassity v. Office of</span> <span class="Italic">Personnel Management</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 25, 28-29 (1992), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds, Steele v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 458 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 50 F.3d 21 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table); <span class="Italic">Aguon v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 540, 549-51 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, OPM alleged that the debt arose because Mr. Konschak's retirement application indicated that he was allowed credit for all of his active duty military service in computing his civil service annuity benefits, but that information received in 1997 from the Military Retired Pay Center showed that he was not entitled to such dual credit. OPM found that he was "not totally without fault" in causing this overpayment because at the time he retired, he did not reveal on his application that he was receiving military retired pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge, however, that Mr. Konschak was not at fault in creating the overpayment. Question 9A of his July 21, 1975 retirement application asked whether he was a military reservist, and Mr. Konschak checked the "no" box to that inquiry. Question 9B asked whether he was in receipt of, or had ever applied for military retired pay, and provided a "yes," box and a "no" box for answering this question. Mr. Konschak did not check either box, and left this question blank. Question 9C, however, was a follow-up question to 9B, and it asked "if 'yes' were you retired from a reserve component under Chapter 67, Title 10, USC?" Mr. Konschak checked the "no" box to this question. The administrative judge found that the record established that Mr. Konschak was confused about the nature of military retired pay and military disability pay, that this confusion caused him to answer these questions as he did, and that these circumstances warrant the conclusion that Mr. Konschak was without fault in creating the overpayment. We find no reason for disturbing this finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that OPM's decision to allow Mr. Konschak retirement credit for his military service in computing his annuity from 1976 until 1997 based upon the incomplete application, renders recovery of the resulting overpayment unconscionable. Mr. Konschak's retirement application lacked a crucial answer for purposes of determining the amount of his annuity--whether he was receiving military retired pay. Further, Mr. Konschak's answer to question 9C implied that he was receiving such pay. OPM, however, took no action to resolve this obvious omission in the appellant's application when it was received, apparently in mid-1975. Had it taken some action at that time, it could have prevented the overpayment in its entirety. Indeed, OPM admitted that it should not have computed Mr. Konschak's annuity with his military service until it verified the status of his military retired pay, and that it should have taken this step before he retired. We find that this failure to act constituted administrative error. <span class="Italic">See Drury v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 493, &#x00B6; 19 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Not only did OPM fail to clarify this obvious omission at the time, but it continued to do nothing for 22 years, until it notified an 82-year old annuitant that it would seek to recover over $100,000. We conclude that OPM's administrative error in processing Mr. Konschak's incomplete retirement application, coupled with its 22 year delay in discovering the overpayment, warrants the conclusion that recovering this overpayment is unconscionable. In light of this conclusion, we need not address the other arguments raised in the appellant's cross petition for review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Delay in OPM's recovery efforts did not constitute unconscionability in <span class="Italic">Hughes v. OPM</span>, DA-831M-14-0483-I-1 (NP 3/17/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further asserts that recovery would be unconscionable because he has been "dealing with OPM on this matter since August 12, 2012, almost two and one half years." Although the unconscionability of collection is a basis to waive recovery of an overpayment, it is a high standard that will only be granted under exceptional circumstances. <span class="Italic">Taylor</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 214, &#x00B6; 18. Those circumstances may include, but are not limited to, cases where: (1) there has been an exceptionally lengthy delay by OPM in adjusting an annuity; (2) OPM failed to respond within a reasonable length of time to an annuitant's inquiries regarding an overpayment; (3) OPM failed to act expeditiously to adjust an annuity in the face of specific notice; and/or (4) where OPM is otherwise grossly negligent in handling the case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board has previously held that a nearly 2-year delay between the date an appellant first became eligible to receive social security benefits and the date that OPM adjusted his civil service annuity to reflect that eligibility did not establish unconscionable circumstances warranting a waiver under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1403(a)(3). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Harris v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 387, 390, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 907 F.2d 158 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (Table). In this case, the appellant similarly faced a 1 year and 7 month delay between his August 12, 2012 request for <span id="Page_4419"></span>post-retirement election forms and March 1, 2014, the date OPM started reducing his annuity to provide for the survivor benefit. Accordingly, we find that the appellant did not face an exceptionally lengthy delay demonstrating unconscionable circumstances warranting a waiver.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Delay in overpayment by OPM can be considerable without affecting the legitimacy of OPM's recovery efforts, <span class="Italic">Petersdorf v. OPM</span>, SF-831M-15-0452-I-1 (NP 12/8/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will consider all relevant factors under a "totality-of-the-circumstances" approach to determine whether recovery of an annuity overpayment is unconscionable. <span class="Italic">Spinella v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 185, &#x00B6; 7 (2008). The unconscionability standard is a high one, and a waiver based on this standard will be granted only under exceptional circumstances. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, cases where there has been an exceptionally lengthy delay by OPM in adjusting an annuity, or where OPM is otherwise grossly negligent in handling the case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Further, egregious delay by OPM may justify a finding that recovery would be unconscionable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, a lengthy delay in adjusting an annuity is not by itself a finding of unconscionability. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that OPM's 62-month delay in processing the appellant's request for an increased survivor annuity was lengthy and OPM did not justify the delay. However, we find that the length of the delay is insufficient on its own to establish that recovery of the overpayment would be unconscionable. The Board has previously found that a 55-month delay between the appellant's election and the processing of the election was, based on the totality of the circumstances, egregious and that recovery was thus unconscionable. <span class="Italic">Cassity v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 25, 28-29 (1992), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Steele v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 458, 461-63 (1993). Conversely, the Board has found that a 79-month delay in correcting an appellant's high-3 average salary and adjusting his annuity did not constitute gross negligence and that, absent other exceptional circumstances, recovery of the resulting overpayment was not unconscionable. <span class="Italic">Spinella</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 185, &#x00B6; 10. Thus, although we do not absolve OPM of its unexplained failure to adjust the appellant's annuity, we must consider other factors in determining whether recovery of the overpayment would be unconscionable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alexander v. OPM</span>, 58 MSPR 358, 364-66 (1993) (also including extensive discussion of "unconscionability"); <span class="Italic">Wilcox v.

We found that such circumstances may include cases where there has been an exceptionally lengthy delay by OPM in adjusting an annuity; OPM failed to respond within a reasonable length of time to an annuitant's inquiries regarding an overpayment; OPM failed to act expeditiously to adjust an annuity in the face of specific notice; or OPM was otherwise grossly negligent in handling the case. In addition, we noted that general principles of equity and fairness demand that consideration also be given to situations where recovery may be unconscionable because of misinformation given to the annuitant or where the personal limitations of the annuitant, including a lack of education, physical or mental disability, or some other factor, would make collection manifestly unfair. Finally, we stated that unconscionability may be presumed under certain circumstances.").</p>
