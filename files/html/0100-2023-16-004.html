<h3 class="h3" id="sec8-5"><span class="space">B.</span> BARGAINING FAILURE</h3>
<p class="noindent">The Statute contemplates that the union will require the employer to bargain over conditions of employment. Under 5 USC 7102:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Each employee shall have the right to form, join, or assist any labor organization, or to refrain from any such activity, freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal, and each employee shall be protected in the exercise of such right. Except as otherwise provided under this chapter, such right includes the right--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;to act for a labor organization in the capacity of a representative and the right, in that capacity, to present the views of the labor organization to heads of agencies and other officials of the executive branch of the Government, the Congress, or other appropriate authorities, and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment through representatives chosen by employees under this chapter.</p>
<p class="noindent">The bargaining obligation is affirmative and responsive. The right to bargain is affirmative: if management does nothing, the union may require negotiations over working conditions. The right to bargain is affirmative: a typical three-year contract is bargaining from scratch to the signing and ratification of the agreement. The right to bargain is responsive: when management changes working conditions, the changes may lead to negotiations if the union requests them. The right to bargain is limited by management rights. and bargaining waivers, earlier discussed, and later discussed as to the “covered by” doctrine and “zipper” clauses.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to management rights, under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, management officials have the right "to hire, assign, direct" and take certain other specified personnel actions. Section 7106(a)(2)(B) provides that management has the right "to determine the personnel by which agency operations shall be conducted." However, under the provisions of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) and (3), when management exercises its rights, bargaining is mandatory on procedures designed for exercising those rights and on arrangements for employees adversely affected, i.e., on the impact and implementation of management decisions. The rule is subject to the proviso that negotiations on procedures and impact may not operate to prevent or excessively interfere with the right of management to exercise its management rights. To meet its bargaining obligation, management has the duty to give the exclusive bargaining representative adequate advance notice of the proposed implementation of management decisions having more than a de <span class="Italic">minimis</span> impact on working conditions and to provide the union with an opportunity to participate in impact and implementation bargaining. The union then must act to request negotiations, if it is to act at all, and if the union acts, management must, upon the union's request, maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>during negotiations, subject to some exceptions. The structure of bargaining and negotiability is the subject of Chapters 3-7 of this <span class="Italic">Guide</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Management has a general obligation to bargain over terms and conditions of employment. 5 USC 7102(2), 5 USC 7117, 7116(a)(5), 7103(a)(12). "An agency's bargaining obligation may arise in one of the following contexts: (1) during term negotiations for a collective bargaining agreement; (2) in response to union-initiated mid-term proposals; and (3) when management proposes to change existing conditions of employment." <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Wright-Patterson AFB and AFGE Council 214</span>, 51 FLRA 1532, 1535 (1996). The obligation to bargain arises on request from the union holding exclusive recognition. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 114 F.3d 1214, 1217-19 (D.C. Cir. 1997). The request may be oral. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Wright-Patterson AFB and IAF Local F-88</span>, 56 FLRA 706, 706 (2000) (in context of agency's refusal to bargain over discontinuance of smoking policy, FLRA noted "it would have been futile for the Charging Party to make a written bargaining request because the Respondent clearly stated that it was unwilling to bargain."). The bargaining obligation is fulfilled through negotiations leading to a basic agreement, midterm bargaining, and bargaining over impact and implementation of decisions made within the ambit of management rights. The obligation is established only by statute. Nothing in the Statute or FLRA decisions establishes a bargaining duty on the basis of equity, hardship, or burdens on the parties. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. and NTEU Chap. 133</span>, 38 FLRA 770, 783 (1990). [Concerning mid-term bargaining and <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1309 v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 119 S. Ct. 1003 (1999), refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-16-017.html#sec8-18">Evolution of the Doctrine; Confirmation of the Midterm Bargaining Obligation</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiations encompass exchanges between the parties.

If the agency fails to respond to a bargaining request, it is not necessary for the FLRA to resolve the negotiability of the union's proposal to find that unilateral implementation of a change in working conditions violates the Statute. <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 56 FLRA 351, 356 (2000); <span class="Italic">see DOJ, INS, post</span>.

<p class="noindent-1">It is long established that an agency "must meet its obligation to negotiate prior to making changes in established conditions of employment[.]" <span class="Italic">Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, 5 </span>FLRA 9, 11 (1981)<span class="Italic"> (Scott Air Force Base). </span>The Authority has held that this obligation includes "affording the exclusive representative notice of proposed changes and an opportunity to [bargain.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 10-11. The Authority has also held that the obligation includes, "at a minimum, the requirement that a party respond to a bargaining request." <span class="Italic">Army and</span> <span class="Italic">Air Force Exchange Service,</span> <span class="Italic">McClellan Air Force Base Exchange, McClellan Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force Base, California and American Federation of</span> <span class="Italic">Government Employees, Local 185 7, </span>3 5 FLRA 764, 769 (I 990) <span class="Italic">(Army and Air Force Exchange).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this connection, the Authority has found that when a union requests bargaining and an agency does not respond to that request, the agency violates the duty to bargain, even where the union has not submitted specific proposals on the matter over which the union seeks to bargain.[8] <span class="Italic">See id; U.S. Department of Health and</span> <span class="Italic">Human Services, Security Administration, Baltimore,</span> <span class="Italic">Maryland and Social Security Administration, Fitchburg, Massachusetts District Office, Fitchburg, Massachusetts, </span>36 FLRA 655, 669 (1990) <span class="Italic">(SSA, Fitchburg). </span>Similarly, the Authority has refused to find that an agency has no bargaining obligation simply because the proposals submitted by a union were nonnegotiable. For example, in <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson AFB, </span>25 FLRA at 545, 555, the Authority affirmed the Judge's finding that, under the circumstances of the case, the agency could not relieve itself of liability by asserting for the first time in the ULP proceeding that the union's proposals were nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;Acknowledging that the bargaining process involves more than the exchange of proposals is also consistent with the Statute, which requires parties to "approach negotiations with a sincere resolve to reach a collective bargaining agreement," and to "meet at reasonable times and convenient places as frequently as may be necessary, and to avoid unnecessary delays...." 5 USC 7114(b)(1),(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Without addressing this precedent, the Respondent argues that to establish that it has improperly failed to bargain, the General Counsel must prove that the Charging Party submitted negotiable proposals in response to the announced implementation of the policy. The Respondent relies on <span class="Italic">INS-II, </span>995 F.2d [46, 47-49,] in support of its claim, and excepts to the Judge's finding that <span class="Italic">INS-II</span> is inapplicable to this case. We find that <span class="Italic">INS-II </span>is distinguishable from this case. As noted by the Judge, the agency in <span class="Italic">INS-II, </span>unlike the Respondent here, engaged in bargaining with the union (reaching agreement on some proposals), and asserted the nonnegotiability of other proposals as the reason for implementing the change. <span class="Italic">See INS-II, </span>995 F.2d at 48. In this case, the Respondent never responded to the Charging Party's proposals before implementing the policy. In addition, the Respondent did not assert the nonnegotiability of the Charging Party's proposals as the basis for implementing the change. Nothing in the court's decision establishes, or even addresses, a requirement to determine the negotiability of proposals in the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent also relies on <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland and American Federation</span> <span class="Italic">Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, </span>39 FLRA 258, 262-63 (1991) <span class="Italic">(HHS, Baltimore), </span>where the Authority acknowledged that an agency may unilaterally implement a change in working conditions without violating the Statute where a union's proposals submitted in response to that change are nonnegotiable. However, this principle is not so broad as the Respondent claims. The principle applies in cases where "a union submits bargaining proposals and an agency refuses to bargain over them on the contention that they are nonnegotiable[.]" <span class="Italic">Id. See also, Department of Health and Human</span> <span class="Italic">Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore,</span> <span class="Italic">Maryland, </span>31 FLRA 651, 656 (1988) <span class="Italic">(Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Health and Human Services). </span>In that circumstance "the agency acts at its peril if it then implements the proposed change in conditions of employment[&#8197;]" and the proposal is later determined to be negotiable. <span class="Italic">HHS, Baltimore, </span>39 FLRA at 263.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Respondent's assertions, however, the principle--that an agency may unilaterally implement a change without violating the Statute where a union's proposals are nonnegotiable--does not <span id="Page_1205"></span>establish that it is a necessary element of the General Counsel's burden proof in establishing a violation of the Statute that a union have submitted negotiable proposals. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., SSA, Fitchburg, </span>36 FLRA at 669 (finding it "not necessary" to determine the negotiability of the union's proposal because the agency did not respond to the union's request to bargain); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Air Force, Headquarters, Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio and</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Council 214, </span>36 FLRA 524, 531 (1990) (finding that without regard to the negotiability of the union's specific proposals, the totality of the circumstances established that the agency violated the Statute). Rather, it establishes circumstances in which an agency may assert as a <span class="Italic">defense </span>to an alleged violation of the statutory duty to bargain, that the agency did not have an obligation to bargain because the specific proposals the union sought to bargain over were not negotiable. <span class="Italic">See HHS, Baltimore, </span>39 FLRA at 262-63. In particular, this principle does not, as asserted by the Respondent, provide a defense to a charge that the agency failed to <span class="Italic">respond at</span> <span class="Italic">all </span>to a request to bargain. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., The Adjunct General's Office, Puerto Rico Air National Guard and</span> <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1665,</span> 3 FLRA 343, 345 (1980) (holding that the agency violated the Statute by failing to respond to a general request to bargain even though the specific proposals submitted by the union "clearly were not negotiable").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we reject the Respondent's claims, and conclude that finding that a union has submitted negotiable proposals is not a necessary element for finding that unilateral implementation violates the Statute<span class="Italic">. See Wright-Patterson AFB, </span>25 FLRA at 545,555.[10] In addition, we conclude that the Respondent has an obligation under the Statute to respond to the Charging Party's request to bargain. <span class="Italic">See Army and</span> <span class="Italic">Air Force Exchange, </span>35 FLRA at 769.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;We note that in <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration, Malden</span> <span class="Italic">District Office, Malden, Massachusetts and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1164, AFL-CIO, 54</span> FLRA 531, 538 (1998) <span class="Italic">(SSA, Malden), </span>the Authority dismissed the complaint alleging a failure to bargain because the parties had, in fact, bargained extensively and, at the time of implementation, the union had no pending proposals. In doing so, the Authority stated that "[t]he General Counsel had the burden of alleging and proving that a negotiable Union proposal was pending when the Respondent implemented the change [at issue]<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. In the unique circumstances of that case, this was true. However, to the extent that <span class="Italic">SSA, Malden</span> suggests that the General Counsel must always establish that the union made a negotiable proposal, we take this opportunity to clarify that this is not required. In this regard, a review of the precedent relied on by the Authority in <span class="Italic">SSA, Malden--</span>particularly <span class="Italic">SSA, Fitchburg, </span>36 FLRA 655--confirms that the description of the General Counsel's burden did not establish such a rule. As discussed above, in <span class="Italic">SSA, Fitchburg, </span>36 FLRA at 669, the Authority found that the agency violated the Statute, without regard to whether the union's proposal was negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, it is undisputed that in response to the Respondent's notification that it intended to implement a new non-deadly force policy, the Charging Party sent the Respondent a letter "demanding to bargain concerning the proposed policy on the use of non-deadly force to the fullest extent permissible under law and Executive Order." The letter contained the Charging Party's initial position concerning the policy, and specified that the "forgoing comments, concerns, questions, and proposal <span class="Italic">are not all-inclusive and</span> <span class="Italic">are subject to revision and/or augmentation at any time</span> <span class="Italic">prior to the completion of bargaining." Id. </span>(emphasis added). It is also undisputed that the Respondent failed to respond at all to the request, making no assertions with regard to the negotiability of those proposals included in the request, and that 5 months later, the Respondent implemented the policy. In this regard, the Respondent asserted for the first time during the ULP proceeding that the Charging Party's proposals are nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Charging Party never even submitted proposals over the impact and implementation of the non-deadly force policy--the matter over which the Respondent is obligated to bargain--because the Respondent never provided the Charging Party with an opportunity to submit further proposals or bargain. In addition, we note that up until the hearing, the Respondent never declared that any of the Charging Party's proposals were nonnegotiable. In fact, even during the hearing, the Respondent asserted only that particular sections--not all--of the Charging Party's proposals were nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under these circumstances, the principle that an agency may unilaterally implement a change in working conditions where a union's proposals submitted in response to that change are nonnegotiable does not apply. Thus, the Respondent cannot rely on the purported nonnegotiability of the Charging Party's proposals as a defense to its failure to bargain with the Charging Party over any aspect of the proposed change.</p>

<p class="noindent">Negotiations are to be more than an exchange of paper through the mail (or email). An agency may not insist that the union negotiate in a particular manner. The agency may not require that the union respond to the agency's written proposals with written proposals from the union. The obligation to negotiate contemplates meetings, not just the exchange of written materials. <span class="Italic">EPA and AFGE</span>, 16 FLRA 602, 613 (1984) (ALJ Decision) (impact bargaining). If management changes a working condition and the union requests bargaining, there is an obligation to meet. Without some affirmative demonstration from the union, the agency may not conclude that the bargaining request is limited to bargaining over a decision, as opposed to bargaining over impact. The union's failure to submit specific proposals does not absolve the agency from bargaining over impact. Waiver can only be construed if the parties met, the agency requested specific proposals from the union, and there were none. The obligation to bargain over impact is not met by a memo from the agency to the union asking for comments about the changes management desires to make. <span class="Italic">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and Philadelphia Metal Trades Council</span>, 18 FLRA 902, 915-16 (1985) (ALJ Decision).

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2441 v. FLRA</span>, 864 F.2d 178, 180 (D.C. Cir. 1988), stated the theory underlying refusal to bargain charges:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Once employees in a unit of the federal government have chosen by majority vote to be represented by a particular labor organization, that labor organization becomes the exclusive bargaining representative of the unit employees....&#8197;The agency is required by the FSLMRS to negotiate in good faith with that labor organization over "conditions of employment," except for those particular matters that are excluded from the duty to bargain by federal law or government-wide rules or regulations....&#8197;The term "conditions of employment" is defined broadly to include "personnel policies, practices, and matters...affecting working conditions." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14). If an agency refuses to negotiate in good faith with an exclusive bargaining representative as to matters covered by the duty to bargain, the agency is guilty of an unfair labor practice. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), (a)(5).</p>
<p class="noindent">Most ULPs involving bargaining failures result from lack of notice to unions of changes in working conditions, or implementation of those changes without bargaining and before exhaustion of impasse procedures, or refusal to bargain on a particular topic as a result of a dispute over negotiability. There are relatively few cases that involve bargaining tactics so unconscionable that FLRA finds bad faith in the bargaining process, in the sense of reprehensible negotiating tactics. One example, however, is portrayed in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Hq., Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB and AFGE Council 214</span>, 36 FLRA 524, 531-34 (1990), leading to a bargaining order as to substantive proposals:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the totality of the circumstances in this case supports the conclusion that the Respondent did not bargain in good faith.&#x2003;First, we find that the record establishes that the Respondent did not approach negotiations with a sincere resolve to reach agreement on the proposals submitted by the Union. Rather, in our view, the record establishes that the Respondent was attempting to avoid bargaining on the Union's proposals. For example, we note that the Respondent did not respond at all to the Union's October 15 request to bargain. In addition, although the Respondent responded to the Union's second request to bargain, that response consisted of the Respondent's returning the Union's proposals with the statement that mid-term bargaining procedures would have to be agreed upon before the Union's proposals would be considered. The response, which included the Respondent's 16 proposals, did not set, or propose, a date for bargaining, however.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thereafter, when the Union's representative, Palacio, sought to set a date for the parties to bargain, the Respondent's representative, Biddle, stated that he was too busy to meet until the end of the year. Although Palacio complained to Biddle's supervisor about his inability to schedule a meeting with Biddle and his supervisor replied that a meeting would be scheduled, no date, time, or place for bargaining was suggested. When Palacio made his third request to bargain on the Union's proposals and sought again to set a date for bargaining, Biddle responded by offering to meet with Palacio for 30 minutes on November 19. The parties met that date. However, Biddle walked out of the meeting before they had <span id="Page_1206"></span>finished discussing all of the Respondent's proposals and when Palacio attempted to set a date for another meeting, Biddle refused.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Palacio again complained to Biddle's supervisor about his difficulty in arranging a meeting with Biddle. Although Biddle set up a meeting for "a couple of days later," he cancelled the meeting....&#8197;The supervisor again intervened and the meeting was rescheduled. Although the parties met on several occasions in December, no agreement was reached on the ground rules at that time and the Union's proposals were not discussed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a result of the Respondent's conduct between October 15, 1987, when the Union first requested bargaining, and November 23, 1987, when the Union filed its unfair labor practice charge, the parties met for only 1 hour and none of the Union's proposals were discussed....&#8197;In our view, Respondent's conduct establishes that it was not bargaining, or attempting to bargain, in good faith....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that...Biddle testified that he was unable to set dates for bargaining because he had a vacation planned for the end of the year and he was scheduled for training. We also note, however, that section 7114(b)(2) of the Statute requires that the Respondent provide "duly authorized representatives...to discuss and negotiate on any condition of employment[.]" If Biddle was unable to meet with the Union, therefore, a duly authorized substitute representative should have been made available.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...As the obligation to bargain over ground rules is inseparable from the parties' mutual obligation to bargain in good faith, it is clear that a party may not insist on bargaining over ground rules which do not enable the parties to fulfill their mutual obligation. Stated simply, we conclude that ground rules proposals must, at a minimum, be designed to further, not impede, the bargaining for which the ground rules are proposed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we are unable to conclude that the Respondent's proposals were designed to enable the parties to fulfill their mutual obligation to bargain in good faith. The Respondent's first proposal provided that "[t]he employer [would] not be obligated to negotiate over union initiated mid-term bargaining proposals and failure to do so [would] not constitute an unfair labor practice."...&#8197;The Respondent's second and third proposals would have required the Union to negotiate a "zipper" clause when the MLA was renegotiated and would have limited the Union to one mid-term bargaining initiative per year until the "zipper" clause was negotiated into the MLA. The Respondent's thirteenth proposal would have waived the Union's statutory right to seek assistance from the...Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) and the Federal Service Impasses Panel (the Panel).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It strains credulity...to assert that the nature of these proposals, which would relieve the Respondent of its obligation to bargain over either or both of the Union's substantive proposals and preclude the Union from requesting third-party assistance in resolving impasses over those proposals, was such that the Respondent was privileged, consistent with its statutory obligation to bargain in good faith, to insist on bargaining over them before addressing the Union's proposals. Rather, when viewed in the context of the Respondent's actions noted above, we find that the record as a whole, including the proposals themselves, supports the conclusion that the Respondent was not bargaining, or attempting to bargain, in good faith.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We emphasize...that we are not ruling on the negotiability, or the merits, of the Respondent's proposals....&#8197;Instead, we conclude that the Respondent's ground rules were designed to set forth arrangements so that negotiations over the two Union proposals would <span class="Italic">not</span> be conducted.</p>
<p class="noindent">For further developments in the <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> litigation, refer to <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Hq., Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB and AFGE Council 214</span>, 36 FLRA 912 (1990), <span class="Italic">Ogden Air Logistics Ctr., Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 39 FLRA 1381 (1991) (ALJ Decision) (ULP when local management would not bargain over union-initiated midterm change because of a higher-level ground rules dispute), and <span class="Italic">Ogden Air Logistics Ctr., Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 39 FLRA 1409 (1991) (ALJ Decision) (no ULP when local management refused to engage in midterm bargaining over procedures for selecting mobility selection team members; local union representative was not delegated authority by consolidated bargaining unit to request negotiations).</p>
<p class="noindent">Good faith bargaining is not established if the agency sets the dates for negotiations unilaterally rather than through mutual agreement, imposes deadlines on the submission of proposals, seeks to limit the union's caucus time during negotiations, or refuses to return to the bargaining table on the matter after negotiations are disbanded. <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE</span>, 18 FLRA 511, 523-25 (1985) (ALJ Decision). An agency's obstruction of the bargaining process violates the duty to bargain in good faith, as in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v64/64-067.html">64 FLRA 426</a>, 435 (2010), reviewing an arbitration award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In assessing whether the Agency's conduct obstructed bargaining, the Arbitrator found that the Agency never requested negotiations between August 2005 and March 2006, when it presented its "last Best Offer[.]" He further found that the Agency stated on April 6, 2006, that it would be available to meet whenever the Union was available, but, subsequently, restricted any meeting to a teleconference on April 21. He also found that, when the Union refused to bargain in a teleconference and proposed meeting during the week of May 8, the Agency responded that it would not participate in further bargaining sessions over ground rules. On this basis, the Arbitrator found that the Agency "avoided meetings more often than not and failed to use FMCS mediation" and that "[t]hese delays, refusals and restrictions fly in the face of the Agency's asserted desire to bargain in good faith[.]" Accordingly, the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency's conduct with respect to bargaining sessions "was not sufficient to meet [its] bargaining obligation" and that its handling of bargaining sessions obstructed meaningful bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's factual findings support by a preponderance of the evidence that the Agency's conduct with respect to bargaining sessions was obstructive and failed to meet its bargaining obligation. <span class="Italic">See NTEU Chapter 90</span>, 58 FLRA at 393 (deferring to the arbitrator's factual findings, the Authority denied the exception to the arbitrator's conclusion of whether the agency violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)).</p>
<p class="noindent">Good faith bargaining during negotiations requires that neither party mislead the other as to its intentions. It is essential that the union and management agents not engage in misrepresentations. A ULP is committed by a management representative who falsely states that management agrees to several proposals that it has not initialed in order to obtain the union's agreement to other proposals. <span class="Italic">VA, VAMC and AFGE Local 85</span>, 32 FLRA 855, 872-73 (1988) (ALJ Decision). The agency fails to bargain in good faith over implementation of a regulation if it commits itself to providing additional information concerning the proposed changes, fails to do so, and then implements the new procedure despite a bargaining request and a request for information. The agency does not have a valid defense in the late date of the union's formal bargaining request if the delay was caused by management's unfulfilled promise to complete a briefing and supply additional information to the union. <span class="Italic">DOD, Dept. of Air Force, Hq., Air Force Training Ctr., Lackland AFB and AFGE Local 1367</span>, 24 FLRA 334, 336-37 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">Most of the decisions in this chapter involving failures to bargain arise from ULP charges.
