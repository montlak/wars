<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-145"><span class="space">2.</span> Contingency Arrangement, Enhancement; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">City of Burlington</span></span></h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Two types of contingency fee arrangements are found in Board practice. The first involves contractual compensation: an agreement that the client assign to the lawyer, as a portion of or all of the legal fees, a percentage of the winnings in his case; there may or may not be an hourly fee. The second arrangement involves statutory compensation: the lawyer agrees to take the case without hourly compensation; the lawyer's recovery is based on the hope that the case will be won and that if it is won, a statutory fee can be obtained on the basis of an hourly rate. There are hybrid arrangements as well. An agreement would be contingent that requires counsel to undertake representation on the basis of a fixed retainer and then makes further recovery of an hourly rate dependent upon success in the appeal or reinstatement of the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. DOD</span>, 42 MSPR 35, 44 (1989) ("The fee agreement between the appellant and his attorney provided that, except for being paid a $500.00 retainer, counsel would be paid an hourly rate for his services only if the appellant was reinstated. Thus, it is a contingency agreement. The agreement provided further that, if the appellant were reinstated without back pay, counsel would be paid $50.00 per hour and, if the appellant were reinstated with back pay, counsel would be paid 50 percent of the appellant's back pay.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agreement providing a percentage of the winnings to the lawyer is a traditional fee arrangement used in personal injury and commercial class action cases. It is not often used in employment cases because of the relatively small recoveries that are obtained: a GS-13 who is fired and out of work for six months might recover $60,000 in back pay, too small an amount to compensate an attorney at a one-third contingency for the time spent in litigation of the appeal. When a true contingency agreement has been used, it does not appear to have generated much case law. The fee recovery is contractual, between counsel and client, and there would not be many situations calling for Board involvement. The second type of fee agreement, involving the lawyer's agreement to work for only whatever recovery he can obtain through a Board order directing payment fees, is not a problem. If the lawyer chooses to accept a case on this basis, if his client wins, and if a fee award is justified under the "interest of justice" standard, the lawyer will be paid by the agency-employer.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Whatever the contingency arrangement, the statutory provision for reasonableness of a fee award does not permit windfalls beyond the lodestar amount plus any necessary adjustments. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hutchison v. DHHS</span>, 42 MSPR 302, 309-10 (1989) (citing <span class="Italic">Brown v. DHHS</span>, 42 MSPR 291, 296 (1989)). Although counsel may set an hourly rate in a contingency agreement, with the understanding that the fee will be collected, if at all, against the government, that rate must be established as a reasonable market rate for the lawyer's services, <span class="Italic">Martinez v. USPS</span>, 89 MSPR 152, 160-61 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e disagree with the administrative judge's apparent finding that a contingency fee agreement entitled the appellant to a lower rate of attorney fees. The decisions he cites for this proposition are inapposite. In <span class="Italic">Downes v. Department of Transportation</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 207, 212 n.2, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 865 F.2d 269 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table), the Board specifically found that the appellant's counsel did not accept the case on a contingency fee basis. In <span class="Italic">Helt v. Veterans Administration</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 165, 169 (1987), the Board declined to award the appellant his counsel's requested rate of $150 an hour because he provided no specific evidence of contingency fee cases handled in which the appellant's counsel was actually paid at that rate during the time he represented the appellant or that that was the prevailing hourly rate in the community in which he practiced. Here, however, as previously noted, Wallace stated in her declaration that her current rate is $375, and that rate has been paid by other federal agencies. <span class="Italic">[S]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">ee Francois v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 191, 196 n.2 (1994) (because the appellant's request for attorney fees was based on the number of hours expended multiplied by the hourly rate set forth in the contingency retainer agreement, the Board found that the case did not involve any entitlement to a contingency fee enhancement, which is not awardable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)). Thus, we find that the appellant submitted adequate evidence of his fee agreements with Emery and Wallace, that this rate was $400 an hour for Emery and $375 an hour for Wallace, and that this rate should not be reduced solely because Wallace represented the appellant on a contingent fee basis. <span class="Italic">Cf.

<p class="Block-Quote1">For the first time on review, the appellant argues that the Board should consider that a different agency agreed to pay the appellant's attorney $650 per hour in an "identical differential pay case[ ]." The fact that a different agency in another case agreed to pay a lump sum to resolve a dispute concerning attorney fees is not particularly illuminating regarding whether the attorney's claimed hourly rate underlying that lump sum was reasonable. An agency's decision to settle such a matter may be based on myriad considerations which are unrelated to the reasonableness of the attorney's hourly rate. Although the initial decision dismissing the attorney fees matter as settled was issued 1 week after the initial decision in this case, and therefore it is new evidence, it is not of sufficient weight to warrant a different outcome here. <span class="Italic">See Russo v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The main issues with the fee petition are that (1) the attorney did not include his hourly rates in his retainer agreement with the clients, (2) he failed to present evidence of similar cases before the Board in which other attorneys with similar experience received his claimed rate, and (3) he failed to demonstrate that he received similar rates in Board litigation.

<p class="Body-Text">There is one situation relating to contingency fee arrangements that has produced considerable confusion and case law. Lawyers have accepted cases on the basis of contingency agreements and then sought to increase or "enhance" their standard hourly rates because of the risk of nonpayment, or delayed payment, resulting from the contingency agreement. Some decisions considered whether and how to adjust statutory fee awards for contingency factors. After much debate and considerable confusion in the law, the Supreme Court decided that statutory fee awards were not to be adjusted for contingencies.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">City of Burlington v. Dague</span>, 112 S. Ct. 2638, 2639-43 (1992), the Supreme Court rejected contingency fee enhancements for awards under fee-shifting statutes:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case presents the question whether a court, in determining an award of reasonable attorney's fees under 7002(e) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA), 90 Stat. 2826, as amended, 42 USC 6972(e), or 505(d) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act (CWA)), 86 Stat. 889, as amended, 33 USC 1365(d), may enhance the fee award above the "lodestar" amount in order to reflect the fact that the party's attorneys were retained on a contingent-fee basis and thus assumed the risk of receiving no payment at all for their services. Although different fee-shifting statutes are involved, the question is essentially identical to the one we addressed, but did not resolve, in <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air</span>, 483 U.S. 711, 107 S. Ct. 3078, 97 L. Ed.2d 585 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Delaware Valley II</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Respondent Dague (whom we will refer to in place of all the respondents) owns land in Vermont adjacent to a landfill that was owned and operated by petitioner City of Burlington. Represented by attorneys retained on a contingent-fee basis, he sued Burlington over its operation of the landfill. The District Court ruled, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that Burlington had violated provisions of the SWDA and the CWA, and ordered Burlington to close the landfill by January 1, 1990. It also determined that Dague was a "substantially prevailing party" entitled to an award of attorney's fees under the Acts, <span class="Italic">see</span> 42 USC 6972(e); 33 USC 1365(d). 732 F. Supp. 458 (Vt. 1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In calculating the attorney's fees award, the District Court first found reasonable the figures advanced by Dague for his attorneys' hourly rates and for the number of hours expended by them, producing a resulting "lodestar" attorney's fee of $198,027.50. (What our cases have termed the "lodestar" is "the product of reasonable hours times a reasonable rate"....) Addressing Dague's request for a contingency enhancement, the court looked to Circuit precedent, which provided that "'the rationale that should guide the court's discretion is whether "[w]ithout the possibility of a fee enhancement...competent counsel might refuse to represent [environmental] clients thereby denying them effective access to the courts."...&#8197;Following this guidance, the court declared that Dague's "risk of not prevailing was substantial" and that "absent an opportunity for enhancement, [Dague] would have faced substantial difficulty in obtaining counsel of reasonable skill and competence in this complicated field of law." It concluded that "a 25% enhancement is appropriate, but anything more would be a windfall to the attorneys." It therefore enhanced the lodestar amount by 25%--$49,506.87.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court of Appeals affirmed in all respects. Reviewing the various opinions in <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley II</span>, the court concluded that the issue whether and when a contingency enhancement is warranted remained open, and expressly disagreed with the position taken by some Courts of Appeals that the concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley II</span> was controlling. The court stated that the District Court had correctly relied on Circuit precedent, and, holding that the District Court's findings were not clearly erroneous, it upheld the 25% contingency enhancement. 935 F.2d 1343, 1359, 1360 (CA2 1991). We granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> only with respect to the propriety of the contingency enhancement....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first provide some background to the issue before us. Fees for legal services in litigation may be either "certain" or "contingent" (or some hybrid of the two). A fee is certain if it is payable without regard to the outcome of the suit, it is contingent if the obligation to pay depends on a particular result being obtained. Under the most common contingent-fee contract for litigation, the attorney receives no payment for his services if his client loses. Under this arrangement, the attorney bears a contingent risk of nonpayment that is the inverse of the case's prospects of success: if his client has an 80% chance of winning, the attorney's contingent risk is 20%.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley II</span>, we reversed a judgment that had affirmed enhancement of a fee award to reflect the contingent risk of nonpayment. <span id="Page_4684"></span>In the process, we addressed whether the typical federal fee-shifting statute (there, 304(d) of the Clean Air Act, 42 USC 7604(d)) permits an attorney's fees award to be enhanced on account of contingency. In the principal opinion, Justice WHITE, joined on this point by three other Justices, determined that such enhancement is not permitted. 483 U.S., at 723-727, 107 S. Ct., at 3085, 3088. Justice O'CONNOR, in an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, concluded that no enhancement or contingency is appropriate "unless the applicant can establish that without an adjustment for risk the prevailing party would have faced substantial difficulties in finding counsel in the local or other relevant market,"...and that any enhancement "must be based on the difference in market treatment of contingent fees as a class, other than on an assessment of the 'riskiness' of any particular case."...Justice BLACKMUN's dissenting opinion, joined by three other Justices, concluded that enhancement for contingency is always statutorily required....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We turn again to this same issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7002(e) of the SWDA and Section 505(d) of the CWA authorize a court to "award costs of litigation (including<span class="Italic"> reasonable attorney...fees</span>)" to a "prevailing or substantially prevailing party." 42 USC 6972(e); 33 USC 1365(d). This language is similar to that of many other fee-shifting statutes, <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, 42 USC 1988, 2000e-5(k), 7604(d); our case law construing what is a "reasonable" fee applies uniformly to all of them....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "lodestar" figure has, as its name suggests, become the guiding light of our fee-shifting jurisprudence. We have established a "strong presumption" that the lodestar represents the "reasonable" fee, <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley I</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 478 U.S., at 565, 106 S. Ct., at 3098, and have placed upon a fee applicant who seeks more than that a burden of showing that "such an adjustment is <span class="Italic">necessary</span> to the determination of a reasonable fee." <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stenson</span>, 5 U.S. 886, 898, 104 S. Ct. 1541, 1548, 79 L. Ed.2d 891 (1984) (emphasis added). The Court of Appeals held, and Dague argues here, that a "reasonable" fee for attorneys who have been retained on a contingency fee basis must go beyond the lodestar, to compensate for risk of loss and of consequent nonpayment. Fee-shifting statutes should be construed, he contends, to replicate the economic incentives that operate in the private legal market, where attorneys working on a contingency-fee basis can be expected to charge some premium over their ordinary hourly rates. Petitioner Burlington argues, by contrast, that the lodestar fee may not be enhanced for contingency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note at the outset that an enhancement for contingency would likely duplicate in substantial part factors already subsumed in the lodestar. The risk of loss in a particular case (and, therefore, the attorney's contingent risk) is the product of two factors: (1) the legal and factual merits of the claim, and (2) the difficulty of establishing those merits. The second factor, however, is ordinarily reflected in the lodestar--either in the higher number of hours expended to overcome the difficulty, or in the higher hourly rate of the attorney skilled and experienced enough to do so. <span class="Italic">Blum</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 898-899, 104 S. Ct., at 1548-1549. Taking account of it again through lodestar enhancement amounts to double-counting. <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley II</span>, 483 U.S., at 726-727, 107 S. Ct., at 3087-3088 (plurality opinion).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first factor (relative merits of the claim) is not reflected in the lodestar, but there are good reasons why it should play no part in the calculation of the award. It is, of course, a factor that always exists (no claim has a 100% chance of success), so that computation of the lodestar would never end the court's inquiry in contingent-fee cases....&#8197;Moreover, the consequence of awarding contingency enhancement to take account of this "merits" factor would be to provide attorneys with the same incentive to bring relatively meritless claims as relatively meritorious ones. Assume, for example, two claims, one with underlying merit of 20%, the other of 80%. Absent any contingency enhancement, a contingent-fee attorney would prefer to take the latter, since he is four times more likely to be paid. But with a contingency enhancement, this preference will disappear: the enhancement for the 20% claim would be a multiplier of 5 (100/20), which is quadruple the 1.25 multiplier (100/80) that would attach to the 80% claim. Thus, enhancement for the contingency risk posed by each case would encourage meritorious claims to be brought, but only at the social cost of indiscriminately encouraging nonmeritorious claims to be brought as well. We think that an unlikely objective of the "reasonable fees" provisions. "These statutes were not designed as a form of economic relief to improve the financial lot of lawyers." <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley I</span>, 478 U.S., at 565, 106 S. Ct., at 3098.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Instead of enhancement based upon the contingency risk posed by each case, Dague urges that we adopt the approach set forth in the <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley II</span> concurrence. We decline to do so, first and foremost because we do not see how it can intelligibly be applied. On the one hand, it would require the party seeking contingency enhancement to "establish that without the adjustment for risk [he] 'would have faced substantial difficulties in finding counsel in the local or other relevant market.'"...&#8197;On the other hand, it would forbid enhancement based "on an assessment of the 'riskiness' of any particular case."...&#8197;But since the predominant reason that a contingent-fee claimant has difficulty finding counsel in any legal market where the winner's attorney's fees will be paid by the loser is that attorneys view his case as too risky (i.e., too unlikely to succeed), these two propositions, as a practical matter, collide. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">King v. Palmer</span>, 292 U.S. App. D.C. 362, 371, 950 F.2d 771, 780 (1991) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), <span class="Italic">cert. pending sub nom</span>, <span class="Italic">King v. Ridley</span>, No. 91-1370.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A second difficulty with the approach taken by the concurrence in <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley II</span> is that it would base the contingency enhancement on "the difference in market treatment of contingent fee cases as a class."...&#8197;To begin with, for a very large proportion of contingency-fee cases--those seeking not monetary damages but injunctive or other equitable relief--there is no "market treatment." Such cases scarcely exist, except to the extent Congress has created an artificial "market" for them by fee-shifting--and looking to that "market" for the meaning of fee-shifting is obviously circular. Our decrees would follow the "market," which in turn is based on our decrees....&#8197;But even apart from that difficulty, any approach that applies uniform treatment to the entire class of contingent fee cases, or to any conceivable subject matter-based subclass, cannot possibly achieve the supposed goal of mirroring market incentives. As discussed above, the contingent risk of a case (and hence the difficulty of getting contingent-fee lawyers to take it) depends principally upon its particular merits. Contingency enhancement calculated on any class-wide basis, therefore, guarantees at best (leaving aside the double-counting problem described earlier) that those cases within the class that have the class-average chance of success will be compensated according to what the "market" requires to produce the services that all cases having above-class-average chance of success will be overcompensated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Looking beyond the <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley II</span> concurrence's approach, we perceive no other basis, fairly derivable from the fee-shifting statutes, by which contingency enhancement, if adopted, could be restricted to fewer than all contingent-fee cases. And we see a number of reasons for concluding that no contingency enhancement whatever is compatible with the fee-shifting statutes at issue. First, just as the statutory language limiting fees to prevailing (or substantially prevailing) parties bars a prevailing plaintiff from recovering fees relating to claims on which he lost, <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 76 L. Ed.2d 40 (1983), so should it bar a prevailing plaintiff from recovering for the risk of loss....&#8197;An attorney operating on a contingency-fee basis pools the risks represented by his various cases: cases that turn out to be successful pay for the time gambled on those that did not. To award a contingency enhancement under a fee-shifting statute would in effect pay for the attorney's time (or anticipated time) in cases where his client does not prevail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, both before and since <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley II</span>, "we have generally turned away from the contingent-fee model"--which would make the fee award a percentage of the value of the relief awarded in the primary action--"to the lodestar model." <span class="Italic">Venegas v. Mitchell</span>, 495 U.S. 82, 87, 110 S. Ct. 1679, 1682, 109 L. Ed.2d 74 (1990)....&#8197;To engraft this feature onto the lodestar model would be to concoct a hybrid scheme that resorts to the contingent-fee model to increase a fee award but not to reduce it. Contingency enhancement is therefore not consistent with our general rejection of the contingent-fee model for fee awards, nor is it necessary to the determination of a reasonable fee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">And finally, the interest in ready administrability that has underlain our adoption of the lodestar approach...and the related interest in avoiding burdensome satellite litigation...counsel strongly against adoption of contingency enhancement. Contingency enhancement would make the setting of fees more complex and arbitrary, hence more unpredictable, and hence more litigable. It is neither necessary nor even possible for application of the fee-shifting statutes to mimic the intricacies of the fee-paying market in every respect....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court stated in the beginning of its opinion in <span class="Italic">Dague</span> that its case law construing statutes that provide for the award of "reasonable attorney fees" to prevailing parties applies uniformly to all such statutes. <span class="Italic">See Dague,</span> __U.S. at __, 112 S. Ct. at 2640. We find that the Court's holding in Dague, disallowing contingency enhancements under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended, 42 USC 6972(e), and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, 33 USC 1365(d), applies similarly to fee awards by the Board under 5 USC 7701(g).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, as amended, 5 USC 7701(g), authorizes the Board to award reasonable attorney fees in Federal employee appeals. The Board may award fees to a prevailing party under section 7701(g)(1) where a fee award is "warranted in the interest of justice." The Board may award fees to a prevailing party under section 7701(g)(2) where the Board's decision is based on a finding of discrimination prohibited by 5 USC 2302(b)(1). Under section 7701(g)(2), the payment of attorney fees "shall be in accordance with the standards prescribed under section 706(k) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC 2000e-5(k))." <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court in Dague specifically mentions 42 USC 2000e-5(k) as a fee-shifting statute to which its case law construing "reasonable attorney fees" applies. It follows, therefore, that the Board may not award contingency enhancements under the authority of 5 USC 7701(g)(2). It follows further that the prohibition against contingency enhancements extends to the Board's authority to award "reasonable attorney fees" under the authority of 5 USC 7701(g)(1), as well. We can discern no reason to find that Dague's prohibition against contingency enhancements should be limited to section 7701(g)(2) and not extend to section 7701(g)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that section 7701(g)(1) differs from section 7701(g)(2) in that, to receive a fee award under the former, the employee must show that fees are warranted in the interest of justice. We find that this additional requirement does not materially modify the requirement that the fee award be reasonable, however. The Board has recognized that reasonableness is the overarching standard by which a fee award is to be measured. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. Department of the Navy</span>, 51 MSPR 542, 548 (1991). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Blanchard v. Bergeron</span>, 489 U.S. 87, 92-94, 109 S. Ct. 939, 944, 103 L. Ed.2d 67 (1989). We find, therefore, that the prohibition against contingency fee enhancements includes fee awards under both subsection (g)(1) and subsection (g)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we deny the appellant's request for a contingency enhancement. In doing so, we hereby overrule our earlier decisions finding that contingency enhancements could be awarded under 5 USC 7701(g).</p>

DOD</span>, 97 MSPR 430, 436 &#x00B6; 12 (2004) (Board may not award enhancements for contingency fee agreements; an agreed-upon hourly rate is presumed to be the maximum reasonable fee, subject to rebuttal by convincing evidence that the rate was not based on marketplace considerations and the attorney's rate for similar work was customarily higher, or by a showing that the attorney agreed to that rate only because of the employee's reduced ability to pay a significantly, customarily higher fee for similar work); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Perdue v.

<p class="Body-Text">For an analysis of taxation aspects of contingency fees, and the deductibility, under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, 118 Stat. 1418, &#x00A7; 703, from adjusted gross income of costs and fees paid by a taxpayer to counsel in any action involving a claim of discrimination or other laws, including whistleblowing statutes, regulating any aspect of the employment relationship, refer to <span class="Italic">Commissioner of Internal Revenue v.
