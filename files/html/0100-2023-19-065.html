<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-61"><span class="space">a.</span> Disparate Treatment</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Failure to accommodate an employee's disability is the most frequent basis for Board decisions favoring employees. But a disparate treatment defense is also available to the disabled employee. Elements of a disparate treatment case based on disability were outlined in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 112 MSPR 173, 181-82 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-21, 2009 MSPB 165 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...It appears that the appellant in this matter is asserting a disparate treatment, rather than a failure to accommodate claim. An appellant may establish a disability discrimination claim based on disparate treatment by showing that: (1) she is a member of a protected group; (2) she was situated similarly to an individual who was not a member of the protected group; and (3) she was treated more harshly than the individual who was not a member of her protected group. <span class="Italic">Hardy v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 387, &#x00B6; 33, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 250 Fed. Appx. 332 (Fed. Cir. 2007). For other employees to be deemed similarly situated, the Board has held that all relevant aspects of the appellant's employment situation must be "nearly identical" to those of the comparative employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A disabled person is one who has a "physical or mental impairment" that "substantially limits" one or more "major life activities," who has a record of such an impairment, or who is regarded as having such an impairment. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 654, &#x00B6; 8 (2007); 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(g). The term "major life activities" means functions such as caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working. <span class="Italic">Davis,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 654, &#x00B6; 8; 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(i). A person who is "substantially limited" in the major life activity of working is "significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities. <span class="Italic">Davis,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 654, &#x00B6; 8; 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3). A medical diagnosis of an impairment, by itself, is insufficient to prove disability; an appellant must offer evidence "that the extent of the limitation caused by the impairment is substantial, in terms of the employee's own experience." <span class="Italic">Davis,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 654, &#x00B6; 8 (citing <span class="Italic">Burgess v. Department of the Interior,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 134, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23-25 (2003)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual may also qualify as disabled under the "perceived as" or "regarded as" definition when she:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Has a physical or mental impairment that does not substantially limit major life activities but is treated by a covered entity as constituting such limitation; (2) Has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activities only as a result of the attitudes of others toward such impairment; or (3) Has none of the impairments defined in paragraph (h) (1) or (2) of this section but is treated by a covered entity as having a substantially limiting impairment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(1); <span class="Italic">see Carter v. Department of Justice,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 641, &#x00B6; 24 (2001). In each of these scenarios, "it is necessary that [the employer] entertain misperceptions about the individual...." <span class="Italic">Carter,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 641, &#x00B6; 24.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant alleges that the agency discriminated against her based on her disability in taking the following actions: (1) requiring her to telephone Mr. Jenter upon her arrival and departure from the office on a daily basis; (2) taking prior disciplinary action for lack of candor; and (3) removing her for unauthorized absences on April 3 and 14, 2008, although the absences were covered by the FMLA. However, she failed to establish that her Hepatitis C and mononucleosis-like illnesses substantially limited one or more of her major life activities or impaired her ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs, or that the agency perceived her as disabled. Thus, we agree with the AJ that the appellant failed to prove that she was a disabled individual entitled to the protection of disability discrimination laws. Consequently, the AJ properly found that there was no evidence of disability discrimination. [<span class="Italic">S</span>] <span class="Italic">ee Davis,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 654, &#x00B6; 10 (where the appellant failed to prove that she was a disabled individual, the Board found that the agency did not discriminate against her on the basis of disability when it removed her for the charged misconduct).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">No disparate treatment was found based on workplace comments and a supervisor's conduct that was evenly applied in the workplace, <span class="Italic">Pace v. Dept. of Army,</span> CH-0432-14-0335-I-1 (NP 6/11/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Discrimination may be established by direct or circumstantial evidence. Direct evidence may be any statement made by an employer that (1) reflects directly the alleged discriminatory attitude, and (2) bears directly on the contested employment decision. <span class="Italic">Arredondo v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 113, &#x00B6; 13 (2000). In addition to direct evidence of discrimination, the Board also may consider circumstantial evidence in determining whether an appellant has met his burden. <span class="Italic">Crump v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 224, &#x00B6; 12 (2010). Such evidence may include:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;evidence of suspicious timing, ambiguous oral or written statements, behavior toward or comments directed at other employees in the protected group, and other bits and pieces from which an inference of retaliatory intent might be drawn; (2) evidence that employees similarly situated to the appellant have been better treated; and (3) evidence that the employer's stated reason for its actions is pretextual.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Troupe v. May Department Stores Company,</span> 20 F.3d 734 (7th Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant stated that the proposing official and another agency employee made harassing comments towards him. The appellant cited a statement of a coworker that an agency employee (Ms. S.) would degrade the appellant to a greater degree than she did other employees and would make derogatory comments. He did not, however, elaborate as to what comments were made. Because the appellant has not established that the comments allegedly made by Ms. S bear directly on his removal, those comments do not constitute direct evidence of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Arredondo</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 113, &#x00B6; 13. As to the proposing official, the appellant indicated that he was responsive when he heard rumors that another co-worker bullied the appellant; the proposing official listened to the appellant's complaint concerning the situation and stated that he would talk to the employee. We therefore find that the appellant's bare allegations that the proposing official and coworkers were discriminating against him do not constitute direct evidence of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Pinegar v. Federal Election Commission</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 32 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also have considered circumstantial evidence in deciding whether the appellant's disability was a motivating factor in his removal. The appellant generally objected to the lack of feedback he received from the proposing official, stated that the proposing official failed to accommodate his disability, and disagreed with the proposing official's criticism of his work. However, the appellant admitted in his testimony that the proposing official treated everyone in the office the same way. We find that the appellant has not shown that others were treated more favorably than him. We also have considered the evidence concerning Ms. S.'s alleged comments. Nonetheless, we find, upon considering all of the evidence, that the appellant has not shown that his disability was a motivating factor in his removal. Accordingly, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to establish his affirmative defense of disparate treatment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">SSA v. Abrams</span>, CB-7521-13-0008-T-1 (NP 11/17/2022), found no disparate treatment by reason of the disability of an ALJ whose removal was sought by SSA because of the ALJ's inability to meet production requirements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also have considered the respondent's contention that SSA treated ALJ H.C. and other ALJs differently than her. In pertinent part, she asserts on review that, in fiscal year 2012, she issued more decisions and held more hearings than ALJ H.C., but ALJ H.C. was never reprimanded, disciplined, charged with unacceptable docket management, or had her removal proposed. We interpret this argument as a challenge to the ALJ's conclusion that she did not prove her disparate treatment disability discrimination claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As with a claim of disability discrimination based on an agency's failure to reasonably accommodate that disability, a claim based on an individual's status as disabled requires that the individual be a qualified individual with a disability. <span class="Italic">Haas v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 2022 MSPB 36, &#x00B6; 28. Further, to establish a claim of disparate treatment disability discrimination, the respondent has the burden of proving that her disability was a motivating factor in the agency's proposed suspension and removal actions. <span class="Italic">See Pridgen v. Office of Management and Budget</span>, 2022 MSPB 31, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 35, 37, 40, 42. If the respondent meets her burden, the Board will then inquire whether the agency has shown by preponderant evidence that the action was not based on the prohibited personnel practice, i.e., that it still would have taken the contested action in the absence of the discriminatory motive. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 33-34. If the Board finds that the agency has made that showing, its prohibited personnel practice will not require reversal of the action.[14] <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[14]&#x2003;Because we affirm the ALJ's finding that the respondent failed to show that any prohibited consideration was a motivating factor in the petitioner's actions, we need not resolve the issue of whether the respondent proved that discrimination was a but-for cause of the petitioner's actions. <span class="Italic">See Pridgen</span>, 2022 MSPB 31, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-22, 29-33.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we found above, we agree with the ALJ that the respondent was not a qualified individual with a disability. Furthermore, we agree with the ALJ that the respondent has not identified any comparators that had such deficiencies in docket management, low production, a backlog of cases, or inability to perform the essential functions of her position. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Department of the Interior</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 205, &#x00B6; 27 (2014) (explaining that for employees to be similarly situated for purposes of a disparate treatment <span id="Page_3442"></span>discrimination claim, all relevant aspects of the employee's employment situation must be "nearly identical" to those of the comparator employees). For instance, the record reflects that ALJ H.C., a nearly 20-year employee who was diagnosed with Stage 4 metastatic breast cancer, had her request to hold fewer hearings as an accommodation denied starting in 2012, she was issued a written directive to schedule more hearings in May 2013, but, in the following fiscal year, she issued more decisions and held more hearings than she had in previous years. Therefore, we agree with the ALJ that the respondent has not proven her disparate treatment disability discrimination claim.[15]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[15]&#x2003;The respondent reiterates her claim, made below, that SSA harassed her based on her disability and reasonable accommodation requests by, among other things, issuing many directives to her. The ALJ did not explicitly address this claim in the initial decision, and we modify the initial decision herein to do so. The respondent identifies on review the following legal standard for such a claim: (1) a qualified individual with a disability; (2) subject to unwelcome conduct or harassment; (3) based on the individual's disability; (4) that unreasonably interfered with work performance or created a hostile work environment; and (5) there is a basis for imputing liability on the employer. PFR File, Tab 3 at 17-18 (citing <span class="Italic">Wagner v. Department of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120103125, 2010 WL 4972778 (Dec. 1, 2010)). Because we have found that the respondent is not a qualified individual with a disability, she also could not prevail on this claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without providing detailed analysis, <span class="Italic">McNab v. Dept. of Army</span>, 121 MSPR 661, 667 n.6, 2014 MSPB 79 (2014) (Vice Chairman Wagner concurring and dissenting in part), suggested a distinction between a defense of disparate treatment and a disparate penalty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also refers to his argument as one alleging "disparate treatment." However, based on the argument itself, he is seeking review of the penalty determination, as distinct from seeking review of the finding that he did not prove his affirmative defense of disparate treatment under the ADAAA. <span class="Italic">See Chavez v. Small Business Administration</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 168, &#x00B6; 19 (2014) (explaining that disparate penalty and disparate treatment are different theories that have different elements of proof).</p>
