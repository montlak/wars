DOD and OPM</span>, 110 MSPR 508, 2009 MSPB 16 (2009), <span class="Italic">post</span>, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Pedeleose v. DOD</span>, 343 Fed. Appx. 605 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP) (affirming Board decision sustaining suspension), <span class="Italic">post</span>), presents a finding of whistleblowing reprisal when the manager who was the subject of the disclosure launched an investigation that led to suspension of Pedeleose, who declined to cooperate in the investigation based on his concerns that his cooperation could jeopardize an IG investigation into his whistleblowing allegations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, an employee does not have the unfettered right to disregard an order merely because there is substantial reason to believe that the order is not proper; he must first comply with the order and then register his complaint or grievance, except in certain limited circumstances. The Board has defined one example of those limited circumstances, situations where obedience would place the employee in a clearly dangerous situation, or when complying with the order would cause him irreparable harm. <span class="Italic">See Cooke v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. 401, 407-08, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 73 F.3d 380 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). The Board has not had occasion to define additional circumstances that provide exceptions to the general rule, although the Board's reviewing court has found that the agency and the Board must consider surrounding circumstances, including the appellant's reservations regarding the legality of the instruction, in disciplining an employee for failure to obey an order, particularly where, as here, the employee has no prior misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Department of Justice,</span> 31 M.S.P.R. 211 (!986), <span class="Italic">citing Brown v. Department of Justice,</span> 790 F.2d 89 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two considerations underlie the "obey now, grieve later" rule: (1) the agency and its mission may be harmed by the employee's failure to act; and where (2) the employee may be mistaken in his belief. Therefore, cases employees are disciplined for breaking the rule usually involve investigations of potential crimes and serious misconduct. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Weston v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development,</span> 724 F. 2d 943 (Fed. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Negron v. Department of Justice,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 561 (2004); <span class="Italic">Larry v. Department of Justice,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. 348 (1997); <span class="Italic">Pope v. Department of the Navy,</span> 63 M.S.P.R. 51 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">None of these considerations are present in this case. The agency concedes that the Scantlebury investigation did not involve any potential crimes or even misconduct meriting discipline. It was an inquiry into rumor spreading, nothing more. The agency provides no evidence of harm due to the appellant's lack of full cooperation. Further, the e-mails from the IG show that it is uncertain whether the appellant was mistaken in his belief that the investigation, if not illegal, might conflict with the IG's investigation into similar matters.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Considering the circumstances surrounding the Scantlebury investigation as well as the facts that it did not involve a potential crime or serious misconduct and the absence of evidence that the appellant's failure to fully co-operate caused harm to the agency or its mission, we find that an exception to the "obey now, grieve later" rule is warranted in this case. In so finding, we stress that the appellant raised legitimate concerns about the investigation in which he was initially asked and ultimately ordered to participate. He sought the advice of the IG and did not get a definitive answer about whether the investigation was lawful. Further, the appellant supplied to the IG the information that Plourde sought through the investigation conducted by Scantlebury. He informed Plourde and Scantlebury on more than one occasion during the investigation that he had given the information that they sought to the IG.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, agency officials also took steps to determine whether the agency investigation might conflict with any investigation of the same or similar issues by the IG. The agency submitted to the IG a list of questions that it planned to ask the appellant. The IG indicated that "on their face" none of the written questions would interfere with his investigation into the appellant's allegations. However, there is no evidence that Plourde or Scantlebury informed the appellant of the steps that the agency had taken to coordinate the two investigations.[6] This failure contrasts with the fact that Scantlebury, with Plourde's knowledge, informed the appellant of the actions that the agency had taken to consult with the U.S. Attorney. Further, this failure appears disingenuous against the backdrop of the appellant's repeated statements of concern to Plourde and Scantlebury about the potential conflict with the IG's investigation. By not conveying the IG's views to the appellant, Plourde and Scantlebury essentially cut off the means by which the appellant could have complied with their investigation and orders without fearing interference with the IG's investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;One of the emails sent by the IG to Ms. Owens asserted that the IG had urged the appellant to cooperate with the investigation and to refer any questions he felt would compromise the IG investigation to the IG. This was apparently an oral communication and the appellant made no reference to it in his deposition. The only reference that the appellant makes to an oral communication with the IG is that the IG told him to cooperate with a lawful investigation but could not say whether the Scantlebury investigation was lawful. Regardless of what the IG orally communicated to the appellant on one occasion, there is no evidence that Ms. Owens, Scantlebury, or Plourde informed the appellant that the list of questions Scantlebury wished to ask had been approved by the IG or that the IG and the agency had agreed upon a means to proceed with both investigations, despite the appellant's repeated protests about the potential conflict between the investigations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances of this case, we find that the agency failed to prove its charges. Because the appellant supplied the relevant information to the IG, repeatedly informed Plourde and Scantlebury that he had done so, and consulted with the IG to learn that it was unclear whether giving the relevant information to Scantlebury would interfere with the IG's investigation, and because no one involved with the agency's investigation gave the appellant the information that would have allowed him to cooperate in the investigation in the manner that Plourde ordered, we find that the agency did not establish its charges by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of his whistleblowing claim, the appellant alleged that he made numerous protected disclosures. Considering the disclosures asserted by the appellant who is <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and the evidence he submitted into the record, we find that one of the appellant's allegations of protected disclosures lies at the heart of this appeal: that threatening to fire VanDerbeck, who had also made protected disclosures regarding the safety of the C-130J program, was a violation of the WPA and an abuse of authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A protected disclosure is one the appellant reasonably believes evidences a violation of law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8); <span class="Italic">Ganski v. Department of the Interior,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 32, &#x00B6; 5 (2000). The proper test for determining whether an employee had a reasonable belief that his disclosures revealed misconduct prohibited under the WPA is whether a disinterested observer, with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee, could reasonably conclude that the actions of the government evidence wrongdoing as defined by the WPA. <span class="Italic">Lachance v. White,</span> 174 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 528 U.S. 1153 (2000); <span class="Italic">White v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 27-28 (2003). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit emphasized in <span class="Italic">Lachance</span> that this standard is an objective one: "A purely subjective perspective of an employee is not sufficient even if shared by other employees." 174 F.3d at 1381; <span class="Italic">see White,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 28.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant may demonstrate that a disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action through circumstantial evidence, including evidence that the official taking the personnel action knew of a disclosure and that the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1); <span class="Italic">Easterbrook v. Department of Justice,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 60, &#x00B6; 7 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged that Plourde violated the WPA and abused her authority by targeting certain DCMA LMM employees, notably VanDerbeck, for termination. As noted, the appellant alleged that Plourde's alleged intention to fire and ultimate firing of VanDerbeck, who had made disclosures of safety issues regarding the C-130J, was a violation of law and was an abuse of authority because it threatened VanDerbeck's career. He also alleged that the investigation Plourde <span id="Page_3982"></span>initiated into the rumors concerning the termination of employees was an abuse of authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An abuse of authority occurs when there is an arbitrary or capricious exercise of power by a federal official or employee that adversely affects the rights of any person or results in personal gain or advantage to himself or preferred other persons. <span class="Italic">Wheeler v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 236, &#x00B6; 13 (2001). There is no <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard for abuse of authority as a basis of a protected disclosure under the Whistleblower Protection Act. <span class="Italic">Murphy v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 131, &#x00B6; 6 (2000). Harassment or intimidation of other employees may constitute an abuse of authority. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> A supervisor's use of his or her influence to denigrate other staff members in an abusive manner and to threaten the careers of staff members with whom he or she disagrees constitutes abuse of authority.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we must determine whether the appellant had a reasonable belief that his disclosures revealed either a violation of law or abuse of authority in the form of harassment or intimidation of other employees, or a supervisor's use of influence to denigrate other staff members and to threaten the careers of staff members. As noted the test is whether a disinterested observer, with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the appellant, could reasonably conclude that the actions the appellant's supervisors constituted an abuse of authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, in early June 2005, the appellant helped VanDerbeck file a complaint with the DOD IG alleging 14 safety violations in the C-130J program. The appellant's e-mail to the IG of VanDerbeck's complaint was copied to Plourde. VanDerbeck's disclosures followed closely on the Air Force's decision, notwithstanding the IG report, quoted above, to keep the C-130J program. Also in June 2005, the appellant received information that Plourde said, in response to a discussion about the system safety issues that VanDerbeck was raising, that since VanDerbeck was a probationary employee all they had to do was fire her. Additionally, the appellant had worked closely enough with VanDerbeck to be able to judge the quality of her work and he believed that she was a good engineer. In his deposition, the appellant stated, "I mean, I've heard her [VanDerbeck] describe things on the C-130J that are absolutely brilliant, as far as electrical systems, distribution and all this." Thus, the appellant had a reasonable belief that Plourde knew of VanDerbeck's safety disclosures and that VanDerbeck was a competent employee with knowledge of the C-130J. Under all of these circumstances, we find that the appellant had a reasonable belief that Plourde had been correctly quoted regarding firing VanDerbeck and that Plourde's statement exhibited a violation of the WPA and an abuse of authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also established by preponderant evidence that his protected disclosure was a contributing factor in his suspension. Because the agency's investigation of the rumor that employees would be terminated began on June 22, 2005, soon after the appellant sent the June 2005 e-mail to the DoD IG, which was copied to Plourde, we find that the appellant has satisfied the timing prong of the knowledge/timing test. <span class="Italic">See Russell v. Department of Justice,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. 317, 323 (1997). Further, the appellant established that the deciding official in this case, DCMA East Deputy Director Steven T. Bogusz, had knowledge of his allegation that Plourde violated the law and abused her authority by targeting VanDerbeck. In his response to the notice of proposed suspension, the appellant detailed his accusation that Plourde had targeted employees to be fired. Among the items that the appellant submitted in his response to the notice of proposed suspension was an e-mail from Plourde to the appellant in which she states "[Y]ou state that Scantlebury's investigation was initiated as a result of the termination of Ms. Susan VanDerbeck. Your statement is inaccurate.... The investigation was neither responsive to, nor directed at, any action involving VanDerbeck."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we stated above, once an appellant has established that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the contested personnel action, the Board will order corrective action unless the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of such disclosure. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1), (2); <span class="Italic">see Horton v. Department of the Navy,</span> 66 F. 3d 279, 284 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Clear and convincing evidence is that measure or degree of proof that produces in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief as to the allegations sought to be established; it is a higher standard than preponderant evidence. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.4(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an agency has met its burden by clear and convincing evidence, the Board will consider the following factors: The strength of the agency's evidence in support of its action; the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">Carr v. Social Security Administration,</span> 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Because the action taken by the agency officials must be weighed in light of what they knew at the time they acted, in determining whether an agency has met its burden of rebutting the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by clear and convincing evidence, the Board must assess the evidence as it stood at the time the officials acted. <span class="Italic">See Yunus v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 242 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, for the reasons that we found that the agency did not prove its charges, the strength of the agency's action is weak. The record also shows that Plourde, who as the proposing official was involved in the agency action, had a motive to retaliate against the appellant. The motive to retaliate can be inferred from the fact that the alleged wrongdoer knew of the allegations of wrongdoing directly. <span class="Italic">See Russell,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. at 326-328. Plourde was aware of the appellant's allegations. She was aware that the appellant assisted VanDerbeck in her whistleblowing activity, and that, after the agency terminated VanDerbeck, he represented her in her EEO complaint. Plourde knew that the appellant believed that she had violated the law and abused her authority in threatening to fire VanDerbeck. As noted, in his response to the notice of proposed suspension was a copy of an e-mail from Plourde to the appellant in which she states "[Y]ou state that Scantlebury's investigation was initiated as a result of the termination of Ms. Susan VanDerbeck. Your statement is inaccurate.... The investigation was neither responsive to, nor directed at, any action involving VanDerbeck."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plourde was also well aware of the appellant's contribution to Congressional investigations into the C-130J program, investigations which resulted in a report calling for the termination of the C-130J, the program that she was charged with administering. The appellant's participation in those investigations was widely known at DCMA. The IG had cautioned Owens in an e-mail that Senators Grassley and McCain were interested in the issues the appellant was perceived as advancing. Further, the appellant had given Scantlebury two letters from Senator Grassley citing the assistance the appellant had provided the Senate Finance Committee in its investigation of the C-130J program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plourde's motive to retaliate is also inferred from the shifting reasons that she gave to conduct the investigation. On one hand she said that there was no basis for the rumors and the investigation was because the rumors were having a negative effect on employee morale. Yet, as we quoted above, in her affidavit, Plourde stated "I was concerned that one of my supervisors was inappropriately discussing confidential management information with subordinates and that this conduct was feeding rumors that certain employees were targeted to be fired." Plourde's statement and actions imply that she had a real concern that information that she wanted kept confidential was leaking to employees and that she wanted to get to the ultimate source of that leak. The force of her actions after she traced the rumors to the appellant implies that she had a motive to retaliate against the appellant, who published the allegation of her violation of law and abuse of authority and would not provide her the information that she wanted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plourde's motive to retaliate is further evidenced in the fact that she did not inform the appellant that the IG approved the questions for the Scantlebury investigation and what recourse he had if he believed that additional questions would interfere with the IG investigation. The appellant repeatedly told Plourde and Scantlebury that he had given the information they sought to the IG and that he was concerned that their investigation would interfere with that of the IG. Nevertheless, neither Plourde nor Scantlebury told the appellant that they had consulted the IG and worked out a means of coordinating the two investigations. Plourde's failure to inform the appellant of the means to resolve his expressed concerns about the investigation compels the inference that her purpose in questioning the appellant was not simply to gather information, but instead to force the appellant into a failure to cooperate with the investigation, thereby providing the means to punish him for making protected disclosures about her threat to terminate VanDerbeck.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, there is no evidence regarding whether the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated; therefore, we find that the agency has failed to meet its significant statutory burden of proof to show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have disciplined the appellant absent his whistleblowing. Thus, corrective action is mandated. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On an OPM reconsideration petition, the Board vacated its decision in <span class="Italic">Pedeleose v. DOD and OPM</span>, 110 MSPR 508, 518-20 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-24, 2009 MSPB 16 (2009), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> <span class="Italic">Pedeleose v. DOD</span>, 343 Fed. Appx. 605 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>, and the Board reversed its earlier determination that the appellant was excused from cooperating in an agency investigation into matters that the appellant believed were connected with his whistleblowing disclosures:<span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision held that the appellant established that his suspension was a reprisal for his disclosure that Plourde threatened to fire VanDerbeck because of her disclosure to the IG of safety violations on the C-130J and that Plourde thereby abused her authority and violated the WPA. The appellant's disclosure was made in communications sent to the IG on June 15, 2005, that repeated what the appellant said he <span id="Page_3983"></span>was told by former employee Davis concerning a threat allegedly made at a meeting at which VanDerbeck's disclosure of safety violations was discussed. On further examination, we agree with OPM that the Board misapplied the test for determining whether the appellant's report was a protected disclosure. While a disinterested observer who was aware of the information asserted could reasonably conclude that Plourde's alleged threat was an abuse of authority, as the Board found, we cannot agree with the Board's finding that the appellant reasonably believed in the factual truth of his report of what happened at the meeting. 107 M.S.P.R. 191, &#x00B6; 39.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are several reasons to doubt the accuracy of the report. Davis, the appellant's informant, was not present at the meeting where the alleged threat was made, and neither was Shelton-Thomas, Davis's informant. Moreover, the appellant stated in his affidavit that Shelton-Thomas, when he spoke with her about the matter on June 15, 2005, refused to discuss it with him, dismissing it as a rumor. Furthermore, the summary of their conversation that Davis sent the appellant at his request a few days later made no mention of VanDerbeck's disclosures as the reason for Plourde's suggestion that she be fired. Finally, the appellant acknowledged in his June 20, 2005 email forwarding the summary to the IG that two days earlier Davis had informed him that, contrary to his recollection, she had not told him that VanDerbeck's safety violation allegations were discussed at the meeting. Under these circumstances, the appellant lacked a reasonable basis for his assertion that Plourde violated the WPA and abused her authority by threatening to fire VanDerbeck on account of VanDerbeck's disclosure of safety violations. Thus, we find that the appellant's report of this alleged threat to the IG was not a protected disclosure for purposes of the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its prior decision, the Board found that this disclosure was protected and that the appellant made a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that it contributed to the agency's decision to suspend him. The Board then considered the agency's argument that it would have suspended the appellant in the absence of the disclosure, and it concluded that the agency did not establish its defense because the evidence for its action was weak and Plourde had a strong motive to retaliate. Finding that the appellant therefore established his primary whistleblowing reprisal claim, the Board determined that it was unnecessary to address other protected disclosures alleged by the appellant--that agency management violated the law and abused its authority by targeting employees other than VanDerbeck for firing and by conducting an investigation into rumors that certain employees were being targeted for termination. 107 M.S.P.R. 191, &#x00B6; 40, n.8. These allegations are intertwined with the appellant's primary disclosure that we have found not to be protected. The appellant's sources for the targeting of other employees are the same as his sources for the targeting of VanDerbeck, and reliable evidence for his belief that termination of these employees was threatened because of their whistleblowing is equally lacking. We find that the appellant had no reasonable basis for making these allegations or for asserting that the agency's investigation of the targeting rumor was retaliatory in nature.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only other alleged protected disclosure raised by the appellant was the May 16, 2005 report titled "Cover-up in the Department of Defense." The report by the appellant and other employees covers the C-130J program over a number of years and criticizes agency management for wasteful expenditures, safety problems, and their alleged concealment. This report was not the focus of the appellant's appeal. Assuming, however, that the report makes protected disclosures, we find that the agency established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have suspended the appellant in the absence of such disclosures. In making this determination, the Board has considered the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its action and the strength of any motive to retaliate by those involved in the decision. We have found that the agency proved the charges on which the appellant's suspension was based, and we find that the agency had strong evidence to support its action. Indeed, the content of the charged conduct was not disputed, but rather was held justified by our prior decision recognizing an exception to the general duty to obey agency orders. We have now determined that such an exception is unwarranted. The lengthy report, which largely concerns actions and events that preceded Plourde's employment by the agency, makes few references to her and articulates no specific criticism of her that could constitute a protected disclosure. It thus presents no basis for inferring a strong motive on her part to retaliate against the appellant. Thus, we conclude that, in light of the strong case in support of the agency's action and the absence of a strong motive to retaliate by the officials responsible for the action, the agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the action in the absence of the other alleged protected disclosures raised by the appellant in the May 2005 report.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's decision upholding the suspension was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Pedeleose v. DOD</span>, 343 Fed. Appx. 605, 609-10 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP), resolving on the agency's defense to the whistleblowing allegation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the report that Mr. Pedeleose provided to the IG concerning alleged problems in a program run by DCMA, assuming without deciding that this was a protected disclosure, we affirm the Board's decision that there was clear and convincing evidence that the agency would have suspended Mr. Pedeleose regardless. The Board correctly considered the substantial record evidence and applied the relevant factors, such as: the strength of the evidence supporting suspension; the existence and strength of any motive by DCMA officials to retaliate; and DCMA's actions against non-whistleblowers who were otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">See Carr</span>, 185 F.3d at 1323. Importantly, the evidence submitted in support of the charge of insubordination and refusal to cooperate with a duly authorized agency investigation was substantial and largely undisputed. In addition, while Mr. Pedeleose argues that similarly situated non-whistleblowers were not suspended, he overlooks a critical distinction--those employees did in fact cooperate with the investigation and, therefore, were in no way "similarly situated." Thus, we cannot say the Board's decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or otherwise not in accordance with law.</p>
