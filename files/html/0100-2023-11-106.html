<h5 class="h5" id="sec4-107"><span class="space">g.</span> Decision of Another Tribunal; Effect of State Law</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Tanner v. USPS</span>, 94 MSPR 417, 422-24 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-16 (2003), applied a traditional analysis of the issues before the EEOC to determine that a Board appeal was not collaterally blocked by the outcome of an EEO case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the decisions raised by the agency below, and issued by entities other than the Board, do not collaterally estop the appellant from pursuing this appeal. The final agency decision issued on October 3, 1996, addressed the appellant's formal complaint of discrimination in connection with his former manager's recommendation that he not be rehired, and an alleged refusal to allow the appellant access to the agency's personnel office, but not whether his resignation was the product of misinformation. On August 5, 1997, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia dismissed the appellant's hostile work environment complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, ruling that because the appellant had pursued the hostile work environment claim before the Board and did not appeal that Board decision, he was "precluded from pressing that claim administratively with the EEOC and this Court is without jurisdiction to consider his claim here." The court did not address the instant claim of alleged misinformation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a December 31, 1998 bench decision, issued after the agency filed a motion to proceed without a hearing, an EEOC AJ identified the first issue in the case before him as whether the appellant was discriminated against based on race, sex, age, disability, or reprisal for having participated in prior EEO activity, when "[s]ix months following his voluntary resignation on January 13, 1995 (on July 2, 1995) he believed he was forced to resign." In his findings of fact, the EEOC AJ noted that "[s]ix months after the resignation, on July 2, 1995, Complainant was informed that for him to return to his position as a letter carrier, he would first have to pass a '470 battery exam.' Complainant alleged he was informed by Charmaine Murmur that if he returned to the Agency following his resignation, he would not be required to take this exam." After referencing the December 19, 1995 Board initial decision in MSPB Docket No. DC-0752-95-0770-I-1, the EEOC AJ ruled that the appellant was afforded a Board hearing "on the identical factual situations presented in issue[ ] number 1...of his EEO complaint." The EEOC AJ noted that, at the Board hearing, the appellant "had ample opportunity to address the merits of the issue," and dismissed issue number one under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming, without deciding, that all of the collateral estoppel requirements are met with respect to this bench decision, we decline to apply collateral estoppel to that decision<span class="Italic">. See Kroeger,</span> 865 F.2d at 239 (even when the requirements for applying collateral estoppel are met, it would not be error to decline to apply collateral estoppel). The considerations of public economy and private repose that underlie the doctrine of collateral estoppel must be balanced against the competing interest of fundamental fairness and due process. <span class="Italic">Williams</span> <span class="Italic">v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 35 M.S.P.R. 581, 585 (1987), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds</span> <span class="Italic">by Berkey v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. 24, 27-28 (1989). Thus, even if the prerequisites for collateral estoppel exist, the reviewing body may refrain from applying the doctrine if injustice would result or other public policy considerations would be compromised. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. For example, "redetermination of issues may be warranted due to the different nature of one forum as compared to the other, or where there is reason to doubt the quality, extensiveness, or procedural or substantive fairness of the prior adjudication." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, based on our finding that the appellant's 1995 Board appeal clearly did not include an adjudication of the issue of whether his resignation was involuntary based on misinformation provided by his employing agency, we have reason to doubt the quality, extensiveness, and procedural or substantive fairness of the adjudication by the EEOC AJ reaching the opposite conclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the EEOC's Office of Federal Operations addressed, in a decision dated March 4, 2002, the same issue addressed by the EEOC AJ and the agency, which implemented the EEOC AJ's decision, namely, whether the agency discriminated against the appellant when "six months following his resignation on January 13, 1995 (on July 2, 1995) he believed he was forced to resign." The EEOC noted that the appellant asserted on appeal that the agency deceived him in his exit interview by stating that he could be reinstated whenever he chose without being required to take any examinations. The EEOC held that to establish a constructive discharge a complainant must show that (1) A reasonable person in the complainant's position would have found the working conditions intolerable; (2) conduct which constituted prohibited discriminatory treatment created the intolerable working conditions; and (3) the complainant's involuntary resignation resulted from the intolerable working conditions. After finding that the record contained no evidence showing that a reasonable person would have found the agency's conduct so intolerable that a resignation was warranted, and that "none of the other issues raised by complainant amount to egregious conduct that made resignation his only option," the EEOC concluded that the EEOC AJ properly granted summary judgment in favor of the agency. As noted above, the issue actually resolved by the EEOC, whether the appellant's resignation was involuntary based on intolerable working conditions, is distinct from the issue before the Board at this time, namely, whether his resignation resulted from misinformation provided by the agency. Thus, there are differences in the "bundle of legal principles," as well as in the facts, subject matter, and case law, that preclude collateral estoppel from applying in this case. <span class="Italic">See Siegert,</span> 38 M.S.P.R. at 688.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another EEOC determination lacked collateral estoppel effect, <span class="Italic">Otterstedt v. USPS</span>, 96 MSPR 688, 692-94 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-15 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may apply the doctrine of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, if: (1) The issue previously adjudicated is identical to that now presented; (2) that issue was actually litigated in the prior case; (3) the previous determination of that issue was necessary to the resulting judgment; and (4) the party precluded by the doctrine was fully represented in the prior case. <span class="Italic">Dorsey v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 439, 444 (1998); <span class="Italic">Peartree v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 332, 341 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 30 and 31, 2001, the EEOC conducted a hearing on the two aforementioned EEO complaints filed by the appellant. The EEOC AJ characterized the issue to be decided as whether the appellant was "subjected to a hostile work environment from December 7, 1999[,] through July 29, 2001[,] based on her age, race, sex, disability, and/or reprisal[.] " The appellant's EEO complaints of discrimination and retaliation pertained to the terms and conditions of her employment and involved incidents alleged to have taken place during a time period well before the February 12, 2002 proposed adverse action in this case.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The agency initially proposed the appellant's removal on February 12, 2002, but later decided to effect her demotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, the appellant's first complaint, dated February 19, 2000, alleged "ongoing" discrimination based on her race, color (Caucasian), religion (Catholic), sex, age (47), reprisal, and disability (major depressive disorder), beginning on December 14, 1999. The allegations underlying her first complaint involved her then-supervisor, Postmaster John Kelly; Officer in Charge Eddy Masangcay; and employee Alan Poon, all of whom worked at the Linden Station with the appellant at the time of the alleged incidents. Her allegations were, in essence, that she had been verbally assaulted and physically threatened by Poon on December 14, 1999, and that agency managers, including Kelly and Masangcay, failed to take any corrective action to discipline Poon for his conduct. Instead, according to the appellant, they subjected her to a continuing hostile work environment from that time forward.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's second complaint, dated April 20, 2001, alleged discrimination based on her color, sex, age (48), retaliation, and disability (mental) on December 20, 2000, and January 3, 2001. Specifically, the appellant alleged that Station Manager Mike Pizzo subjected her to a hostile work environment by scheduling Poon to open the Linden Station with the appellant on December 6, 2000, thereby requiring her to be alone in the station with Poon. The appellant also alleged that Ezio Nurisio, who became the Officer in Charge and the appellant's supervisor after Kelly left the Linden Station, contributed to the hostile work environment and retaliated against her for her prior EEO activity by attempting to change her job duties, responsibilities, and location; denying her training; issuing her a letter of warning after her subordinate performed poorly on a secret shopper survey; and berating her in front of other supervisors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although an EEOC appeal does not have to involve the same cause of action at issue in a Board appeal for collateral estoppel to apply, <span class="Italic">Fuentes v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 4, 9 (1992), the EEOC did not adjudicate issues identical to the issues here. The EEOC AJ determined that the appellant's allegations did not support a finding of harassment based on a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII. Specifically, the EEOC AJ determined that "the incidents...complain[ed] [of], including the disciplinary actions, did not involve conduct or behavior on the part of the agency managers which could be characterized as abusive, severe or pervasive so as to constitute harassment, even when considered together." The EEOC decision did not address whether the appellant was a qualified disabled employee. Nor did it address whether the agency's alleged conduct could have been retaliation under the circumstances or whether there was a genuine nexus between the alleged conduct and the appellant's prior EEO activity. Accordingly, the agency has failed to <span id="Page_1540"></span>meet the first prong of the test for collateral estoppel, and, accordingly, we deny its request to vacate the ID's discrimination and retaliation determinations on that basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends further that, even if collateral estoppel does not apply, the Board should defer to the September 19, 2003 decision of the EEOC. However, we believe the EEOC's findings are not entitled to deferential effect since, as fully set forth above, its findings did not involve the same issues of disability discrimination and retaliation for prior EEO activities raised by the appellant, and adjudicated by the AJ, in this appeal. <span class="Italic">Cf. Dorsey</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 446-47 (collateral estoppel applied to a prior EEOC decision, but the Board determined that, even if collateral estoppel did not apply, the Board would give "deferential, if not preclusive, effect to the findings of the EEOC on the same religious discrimination issue raised by the appellant in [his Board] appeal"); <span class="Italic">Bannister v. General Services Administration</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 362, 367-68 (1989) (decisions of the Comptroller General, although not entitled to collateral estoppel effect, may be given deference by the Board where: (1) The issue to be resolved is identical to the one in the prior action; (2) the issue was litigated in the prior action; (3) the determination in the prior action was necessary to the resulting judgment; and (4) the party against whom the doctrine is applied was fully represented in the prior action).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A result in an Title VII case before EEOC and a district court barred litigation of the same matters in a Board forced retirement appeal, <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. VA</span>, SF-0752-10-0202-I-1 (NP 8/18/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In his response to the Order to Show Cause, the appellant asserted that "[T]he discrimination complaints that the District Court so wrongfully granted summary judgment on, are based on different operative facts than my involuntary disability retirement claim." Specifically, the appellant contended that his Board appeal was different because the "first issue (1) discussed during the April 06, 2010 Hearing was the timeliness of my appeal. The second issue (2) discussed was the refusal by the Agency to comply with my Reasonable Accommodation (RA) requests. The third issue (3) discussed was the denial of my Veteran's Employment Opportunity Act (VEOA) of October 30, 1998 rights."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well-established that under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> (also known as "claim preclusion"), a valid, final judgment on the merits of an action bars a second action involving the same parties or their privies based on the same cause of action. <span class="Italic">Peartree v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 332, 337 (1995); <span class="Italic">see Muyco v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 694, &#x00B6; 9 (2010). <span class="Italic">Res judicata</span> precludes parties from relitigating issues that were, or could have been, raised in the prior action, and is applicable if: (1) the prior judgment was rendered by a forum with competent jurisdiction; (2) the prior judgment was a final judgment on the merits; and (3) the same cause of action and the same parties or their privies were involved in both cases. <span class="Italic">Peartree</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 337.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For claim preclusion to bar a new claim, it must be based on the same set of transactional facts as the earlier one. <span class="Italic">International Air Response v. United States</span>, 302 F.3d 1363, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">Jet Inc. v. Sewage Aeration Systems</span>, 223 F.3d 1360, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (explaining that "courts have defined 'transaction' in terms of a 'core of operative facts,' the 'same operative facts,' or the 'same nucleus of operative facts,' and 'based on the same, or nearly the same, factual allegations.'").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In articulating his intolerable working conditions and hostile work environment claim, the appellant has reiterated the same allegations that he previously raised in his four formal complaints of discrimination against the agency. In addition, the District Court granted summary judgment on the merits of these complaints by finding that no reasonable person could find the appellant's work environment was abusive. The court stated, "[T]he conduct that plaintiff complains of was generally infrequent, not severe, and did not unreasonably interfere with plaintiff's job performance." <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Principi</span>, 2006 WL 1582358 (E.D. Cal. June 5, 2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The criteria for the application of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> thus are met here, because in his District Court case: (1) The court had jurisdiction to decide his claims of EEO discrimination; (2) its decision was a final judgment on the merits; and (3) the same parties and cause of action were involved, as in the instant appeal. The appellant's response to the Order to Show Cause has failed to identify any basis for finding that this claim is not precluded. The three issues identified by the appellant in his response are claims or issues in his appeal that are unrelated to the merits of his intolerable working conditions and hostile work environment claim, and these issues, therefore, do not serve to change the operative facts of this claim. Accordingly, the appellant's claim of involuntary disability retirement based upon intolerable working conditions or hostile work environment is precluded by the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, even if <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> did not bar the appellant's hostile work environment claim, he cannot relitigate the underlying issue of intolerable working conditions because of the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Collateral estoppel, or "issue preclusion," is appropriate when: (1) An issue is identical to that involved in the prior action; (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior action; (3) the determination on the issue in the prior action was necessary to the resulting judgment; and (4) the party against whom issue preclusion is sought had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior action, either as a party or as one whose interests were otherwise fully represented in that action. <span class="Italic">Kroeger v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 865 F.2d 235, 239 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Metallo v. Department of Defense</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 229, &#x00B6; 12 (2008); <span class="Italic">McNeil v. Department of Defense</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 146, &#x00B6; 15 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Collateral estoppel precludes the appellant from litigating this claim because: (1) The issue in this appeal is identical to the same issue involved in his District Court case; (2) the issue was actually litigated in that case; (3) the determination of the issue in the case was necessary to the resulting judgment; and (4) the party precluded (i.e., the appellant) was fully represented in his District Court case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mojarro v. USPS</span>, SF-0752-09-0694-M-1 (NP 4/12/2013) (appellant was estopped, based on an EEOC decision, from challenging a settlement before the Board: "We find that all of these conditions have been met here. Specifically, the issue of whether the appellant was coerced into signing the settlement agreement, thereby rendering the settlement agreement invalid and unenforceable, was addressed and resolved in the negative by the OFO in its November 15, 2011 decision. Further, this determination was necessary to the resulting judgment, and the appellant had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue before the OFO. Therefore, we find that the appellant is collaterally estopped from claiming that the settlement agreement is invalid in No. 0222 and that the Board, thus, lacks jurisdiction over No. 0222 because of the waiver provisions of the settlement agreement. Accordingly, we DISMISS No. 0222 for lack of jurisdiction.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Collateral estoppel was applied to a determination in arbitration that a settlement agreement was valid, precluding the appellant from challenging the settlement before the Board. <span class="Italic">Walter v.

U.S. Postal Service,</span> 57 M.S.P.R. 63, 67 (1993). Thus, the arbitration award cannot be afforded collateral estoppel effect. <span class="Italic">See White v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the administrative judge should have applied the common law of California to analyze whether he was collaterally estopped from challenging his criminal conviction and the misconduct underlying the charge.
